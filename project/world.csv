"UAW files objection to Mercedes vote, accuses of intimidating workers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uaw-files-objection-to-mercedes-vote-accuses-of-intimidating-workers/articleshow/110411782.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United Auto Workers (UAW) has accused Mercedes of interfering with a union election at two factories in Alabama by intimidating and coercing workers to vote against unionization.The labor group filed an objection with the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) seeking a new vote, alleging that the company engaged in an ""unlawful antiunion campaign"" that included discipline, captive audience meetings, and a general goal of coercing and intimidating employees.However, despite the alleged illegal anti-union campaign, over 2,000 Mercedes workers voted in favor of unionization.The UAW believes that in a fair election, where Mercedes is held accountable for following the law, workers will successfully unionize. The workers sought a fair opportunity to have a voice on the job and a say in their working conditions.Mercedes-Benz stated that more than 90% of team members participated in the election, with a majority indicating they are not interested in UAW representation for collective bargaining purposes. The company claims to have worked with the NLRB to adhere to guidelines throughout the election process and will continue to do so.The union's filing alleges that four pro-union employees were fired, and the company allowed anti-union employees to solicit support during work hours while prohibiting pro-union employees from doing the same. The company also required workers to attend anti-union meetings, displayed anti-union propaganda, and prohibited the distribution of union materials in non-work areas.Furthermore, the union claims that the company, or its representatives, polled workers about union support, suggested that voting for the union would be futile, targeted union supporters with drug tests, and ""engaged in conduct which deliberately sought to exacerbate racial feelings by irrelevant and inflammatory appeals to racial prejudice.""The NLRB will review the objections, and if it is determined that the employer's conduct affected the election, a new election could be ordered.","The United Auto Workers (UAW) has accused Mercedes of interfering with a union election at two factories in Alabama.

US defense secretary Austin expected to meet with Chinese counterpart in Singapore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-defense-secretary-austin-expected-to-meet-with-chinese-counterpart-in-singapore/articleshow/110411501.cms,"WASHINGTON: US defense secretary Lloyd Austin is expected to meet with his Chinese counterpart , Admiral Dong Jun, at a major defense conference in Singapore next week, the Pentagon announced Friday.It will be the first meeting between the two defense leaders following a phone call in April. It comes as the US and China have gradually worked to warm relations, which had been largely frozen since a controversial visit to Taiwan by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2022 resulted in China temporarily stopping most military-to-military communications.The announcement came shortly before the Pentagon said Austin would undergo a medical procedure at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday evening and transfer power temporarily to his deputy. Austin is dealing with bladder issues that arose in December following his treatment for prostate cancer.Later Friday, the Pentagon said the procedure was successful and Austin had resumed duty and returned home. ""No changes in his official schedule are anticipated at this time, to include his participation in scheduled Memorial Day events,"" Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said.Austin and Dong, China's minister of national defense, are expected to meet during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore next week, an annual meeting of defense ministers and government officials from more than 50 countries.The meeting also comes, however, as China has engaged in aggressive military drills around Taiwan, resulting in Taiwan scrambling jets and putting missile, naval and land units on alert Thursday.China launched the exercises after the island's new president, Lai Ching-te, was inaugurated and delivered a speech asking Beijing to cease its intimidation against the island but face the reality of its existence. Beijing rejected his remarks as advocating for separatism and launched the military drills.China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and vows to seize it by force if necessary to achieve unification. The US is obligated under federal law to ensure the island can defend itself.In the wake of those exercises, the US has cautioned China not to use Taiwan's political transition as a ""pretext or excuse"" for provocative or coercive measures, a defense official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not been made public.The two governments began to engage each other more after President Biden hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in November in California and stressed the need to keep communications open.Dong is a former naval commander who was appointed in late December after his predecessor, Li Shangfu, was removed from office. Dong spoke with Austin by phone in April over issues including the war in Ukraine, freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, Taiwan and North Korea.Austin last met a Chinese defense minister in November 2022, when he and Wei Fenghe, then China's defense minister, were in Cambodia for a regional defense minister meeting.No US defense secretary has visited China since Jim Mattis visited in 2018.","Lloyd Austin and Admiral Dong Jun to meet at major defense conference in Singapore.

Prosecutors seek to bar Trump in classified files case from statements endangering law enforcement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prosecutors-seek-to-bar-trump-in-classified-files-case-from-statements-endangering-law-enforcement/articleshow/110411005.cms,"WASHINGTON: Federal prosecutors on Friday asked the judge overseeing the classified documents case against Donald Trump to bar the former president from public statements that ""pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents"" participating in the prosecution.The request to US district judge Aileen Cannon follows a false claim by Trump earlier this week that the FBI agents who searched his home in August 2022 were ""authorized to shoot me"" and were ""locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.""He was referring to the disclosure in a court document that was made public that the FBI, during the search, followed a standard use-of-force policy that prohibits the use of deadly force except when the officer conducting the search has a reasonable belief that the ""subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.""The policy is routine and meant to limit the use of force during searches. Prosecutors noted that the search was intentionally conducted when Trump and his family were away and was coordinated with the Secret Service. No force was used.""The Government's request is necessary because of several intentionally false and inflammatory statements recently made by Trump that distort the circumstances under which the Federal Bureau of Investigation planned and executed the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago,"" prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team wrote in asking that Cannon make a restriction on Trump's statements a condition of his release pending trial.""Those statements create a grossly misleading impression about the intentions and conduct of federal law enforcement agents - falsely suggesting that they were complicit in a plot to assassinate him - and expose those agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial, to the risk of threats, violence, and harassment,"" they added.An attorney for Trump didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment Friday night.Defense lawyers have objected to the government's motion, prosecutors wrote.Trump faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, classified documents that he took with him after he left the White House in 2021, and then obstructing the FBI's efforts to get them back. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.Trump faces four criminal cases as he seeks to reclaim the White House, but outside of the ongoing New York hush money prosecution, it's not clear that any of the other three will reach trial before the election.Asked Thursday at an unrelated event about the claim that the FBI intended to use force against Trump, Attorney General Merrick Garland said: ""That allegation is false, and it is extremely dangerous. The document that is being referred to in the allegation is the Justice Department's standard policy limiting the use of force. As the FBI advises, it is part of the standard operations plan for searches. And in fact, it was even used in consensual search of President Biden's home.""","Federal prosecutors ask judge to bar Donald Trump from making public statements.

Only one of the cows tested positive for bird flu.Even if bird flu were to end up in consumer beef, the USDA claims that heatingit to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.9 Celsius) will kill it, just as it does E. coli and other viruses.52 herds in US were infected with avian flu in nine of the 50 states as of Wednesday.

Texas power demand breaks May record again as prices soar in heat wave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-power-demand-breaks-may-record-again-as-prices-soar-in-heat-wave/articleshow/110410856.cms,"Record-tying heat

Power demand in Texas broke the record for the month of May for a second time this week on Friday as prices soared ahead of the US Memorial Day long weekend with homes and businesses cranking up their air conditioners to escape a heat wave .The Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT ), which operates most of the state's power grid for 27 million customers, said the system was operating normally with enough supply available to meet expected demand over the next week.ERCOT said power demand soared to a preliminary 72,695 megawatts (MW) on Friday, which would top the current record for the month of May of 72,261 MW set last Monday.ERCOT projected usage would break that new record on Monday, Memorial Day, when it forecasts a peak above 76,500 MW.The grid's all-time peak was 85,508 MW on August 10, 2023.Analysts expect ERCOT electric use will top that all-time high this summer with economic and population growth in Texas and demand for power from data centers, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency mining rising fast.One megawatt can usually power about 800 homes on a normal day but as few as 250 on a hot summer day in Texas.In the spot market, next-day power prices at the ERCOT North Hub , which includes Dallas, soared to a two-week high of $141 per megawatt hour (MWh) for Friday, up from $21 for Thursday, according to pricing data on the LSEG terminal.That compares with an average of $31 per MWh so far this year, $80 in 2023 and $66 over the prior five years (2018-2022).Day-ahead prices on the ERCOT website, meanwhile, soared to $654 per MWh for one hour on Friday evening.""May-to-date real-time pricing is 50% higher than in any year since 2010 (except for the 2022 natural gas price blowout). This results in more inefficient natural gas generators chewing through more gas ... to keep the lights on,"" analysts at consultancy EBW Analytics Group said in a note.High temperatures in Houston, the state's biggest city, will hold at 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) on Friday and Saturday before rising to 96 on Memorial Day Monday, according to meteorologists at AccuWeather.The normal high in Houston at this time of year is 88 F (31 C).AccuWeather said the forecast high of 95 F for Friday would tie the record for the day set in 1955.ERCOT projected supplies would exceed demand by 5,400 to 42,300 MW over the next week with the 5,400 MW low expected during one hour in the evening of May 26 after the sun goes down and solar panels stop working.That comfortable level of supply is higher than ERCOT forecast earlier on Friday and assumes nothing changes.But things always change - power plants and transmission lines shut and return to service, weather forecasts change and storms cause outages.","Power demand in Texas broke the record for the month of May for a second time this week on Friday.

Louisiana governor signs bill classifying abortion pills as controlled substances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-classifying-abortion-pills-as-controlled-substances/articleshow/110410765.cms,"Louisiana's governor on Friday signed a bill making his state the first in the U.S. to classify two abortion-inducing medications as controlled substances, a category that healthcare regulators typically reserve for drugs prone to abuse or addiction.The measure, thrusting Republican-led efforts to restrict abortion back to the political forefront in a presidential election year, was signed into law by Republican Governor Jeff Landry a day after the state legislature sent it to his desk.The bill cleared Louisiana's Republican-majority House of Representatives and Senate by wide margins, even as efforts by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to expand access to abortion pills is facing a legal challenge before the Supreme Court.The new law designates mifepristone and misoprostol, which the FDA approved more than two decades ago as safe and effective for terminating pregnancies, as Schedule IV drugs, meaning they merit greater oversight due to the potential for abuse or dependence.That puts the abortion pills in Louisiana in the same category as anti-anxiety medications Xanax and Valium, though neither mifepristone or misoprostol is considered by the medical establishment to pose a hazard of tolerance or addiction.Still, the reclassification makes it riskier for Louisiana residents, who are already subject to a near-total ban on surgical and medication-induced abortions, to obtain the pills from out of state or order them online without a prescription.Critics say the measure will also make it harder for patients to obtain the drugs when they are prescribed for other uses, such as inducing labor in childbirth, treating miscarriages and reducing the risk of serious bleeding from ulcers.Doctors will need a special license to prescribe the drugs, and those prescriptions are entered into a state database that law enforcement can access without a warrant. Critics say that situation could compromise patient privacy and expose physicians to unwarranted investigation.""It creates more onus, more chaos and confusion for people accessing this medication,"" Kirsten Moore, who heads the nonprofit Expanding Mediation Abortion Access (EMMA) Project, adding that the overall intent is to ""put mifepristone and misoprostol back under lock and key.""The bill makes unprescribed possession of the pills a crime punishable by one to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000.Although pregnant women are expressly exempt from punishment for violation of the measure, any other person who might help them obtain the drugs, such as friends, family members or healthcare providers, could be subject to prosecution.Women who are not pregnant but obtain the pills to have on hand as a precaution are likewise not exempt.The drug reclassification was added as an amendment to a bill specifically outlawing ""coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud,"" making it a crime for abortion-inducing medication to be administered to an unsuspecting pregnant woman without her consent.Supporters said placing mifepristone and misoprostol under greater regulatory control is intended to curtail their distribution for illicit purposes, such as coerced medication abortions that the larger bill aims to prevent.The measure's chief sponsor, Senator Thomas Pressly, named the bill for his sister whose then-husband slipped abortion drugs he obtained from Mexico into her drinks, causing her serious health effects and causing the premature birth of her daughter, who survived. The husband, whom she divorced, was later convicted in a domestic violence case and sentenced to 180 days in jail.Abortion rights groups decried the bill as part of a larger Republican-driven effort to criminalize abortion since the Supreme Court's conservative majority in 2022 overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that made access to abortion a constitutional right nationwide.That reversal left it up to individual states to regulate abortion largely as they saw fit.The Supreme Court in March heard oral arguments in a case challenging FDA regulations that expanded access to mifepristone, such as allowing the drug to be prescribed by telemedicine and dispensed by mail. In their line of questioning, the justices appeared skeptical about siding with anti-abortion groups on the issue.","Louisiana is the first state in the U.S. to classify two abortion-inducing medications as controlled substances.

China sends bombers with live missiles on mock strikes in Taiwan drill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-sends-bombers-with-live-missiles-on-mock-strikes-in-taiwan-drill-taiwan-reports-49-chinese-warplanes/articleshow/110384209.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Chinese military on Friday dispatched bombers armed with live missiles for mock strikes as part of its Taiwan drills. The bombers, belonging to the eastern theatre command of the People's Liberation Army, formed multiple attack formations in waters east of Taiwan and conducted simulated attacks in coordination with naval vessels, Chinese state television CCTV reported.Meanwhile, Taiwan tracked numerous Chinese warplanes and navy vessels near its coast, coinciding with the second day of a significant exercise conducted by China's People's Liberation Army in response to the inauguration of Taiwan's new leadership.China has extensively advertised these maneuvers, showcasing Taiwan's encirclement by forces affiliated with the ruling Communist Party's military arm, the People's Liberation Army. A recent video presentation depicted animated Chinese forces closing in from all directions, effectively enclosing Taiwan within a circular target zone.Despite the situation, there was little evident concern among Taiwan's 23 million citizens, who have lived under the threat of Chinese invasion since the bitter and bloody civil war in 1949 led to the division between the two sides.Taiwan's parliament faced a dispute between political parties over procedural matters on Friday, yet daily activities continued as usual in the bustling capital of Taipei.According to the defense ministry, 49 warplanes, 19 navy vessels, and Chinese coast guard vessels were tracked. Of these, 35 planes crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait, the de facto boundary between the two sides, within a 24-hour period from Thursday to Friday.Marine and coast guard vessels, along with air and ground-based missile units, have been placed on high alert, particularly around the Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu, situated just off the coast of China and distant from Taiwan's main island by approximately 160 kilometers (100 miles) across the Taiwan Strait.""Facing external challenges and threats, we will continue to maintain the values of freedom and democracy,"" Taiwan's new President Lai Ching-te told sailors and top security officials on Thursday as he visited a marine base in Taoyuan, just south of the capital, Taipei.Lai in his inauguration speech on Monday had called on Beijing to stop its military intimidation and said Taiwan was ""a sovereign independent nation in which sovereignty lies in the hands of the people"".China's military said that its two-day exercises around Taiwan were intended as punishment for separatist factions advocating independence. Almost daily, it dispatches navy ships and warplanes into the Taiwan Strait and other surrounding areas to erode Taiwan's defenses and attempt to intimidate its populace, who staunchly support the island's de facto independence.""As soon as the leader of Taiwan took office, he challenged the one-China principle and blatantly sold the two-state theory',"" China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Chen Binhua said in a statement on Thursday night.","China dispatches bombers armed with live missiles for mock strikes as part of its Taiwan drills.

NEW DELHI: Kabosu, the beloved Shiba Inu who became an internet sensation as the Doge meme, has passed away. Kabosu’s owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the sad news, stating that Kabosu ""fell into a deep sleep"" at 7:50 am on May 24. A farewell party is scheduled for Sunday at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City, from 1 pm to 4 pm.

Kabosu's fame began in 2010 when pictures of her went viral online, leading to the creation of the Doge meme. The meme's popularity skyrocketed and even inspired the creation of Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 using Kabosu’s image as its logo. Initially conceived as a joke, Dogecoin's success spurred the creation of several other dog-themed cryptocurrencies.

In April last year, Elon Musk briefly changed Twitter's logo to an image of Kabosu, causing a surge in Dogecoin's value. Musk has been an outspoken supporter of the meme-based cryptocurrency.

Kabosu had been diagnosed with cholangiohepatitis and chronic lymphoma leukemia in 2022. Her passing marks the end of an era for meme enthusiasts and the cryptocurrency community.

The Boeing 777-300ER, which departed from London’s Heathrow Airport, was diverted to Bangkok, where it made an emergency landing.The turbulence hit about 10 hours into the flight, as the plane flew over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar, a region known for severe weather conditions.The aircraft, carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members, was at an altitude of 37,000 feet when it suddenly encountered ""sudden extreme turbulence,"" causing it to drop 6,000 feet in about three minutes.Andrew Davies, a 54-year-old passenger from London, recounted his experience during the turbulence to the Wall Street Journal. He was deciding between taking a nap and watching a movie when the seatbelt sign flashed on. Just as he secured his seatbelt, the plane began to drop violently. ""Pillows, plates and cups were thrown in the air. His seat belt tugged at his waist, and he found himself covered in his neighbor’s coffee. Oxygen masks dropped down,"" Davies told the WSJ.The chaos in the cabin was immediate and severe. ""I saw a woman with a deep gash on her head, covered in blood. Flight crew members also appeared bloody and injured, hobbling around trying to help passengers,"" Davies added. An elderly passenger, identified as Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British national with a history of heart problems, likely suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by the crew to perform CPR for 20 minutes, they were unable to revive him.The plane's abrupt altitude change was documented by FlightRadar24, which reported a ""rapid change in vertical rate, consistent with a sudden turbulence event."" The turbulence was likely clear-air turbulence (CAT), which is difficult to detect and can occur without warning. ""Developing thunderstorms often have strong updrafts, a zone of upward moving air, that rises very rapidly, sometimes at more than 100 mph, and can leave pilots little time to react if it occurs directly in front of the plane,"" explained Dan DePodwin, Senior Director of Forecasting Operations at AccuWeather.Former pilot Marco Chan noted the turbulence likely occurred within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, notorious for thunderstorms. ""With turbulence of such magnitude, it is likely the [Singapore Airlines] flight was navigating through difficult thunderstorms,"" he said.Following the incident, Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong expressed condolences and assured that the airline was providing necessary support to affected passengers and their families. ""We are very sorry for the traumatic experience that everyone on board SQ321 went through,"" Goh said.Of the injured, 18 were hospitalized, with seven in critical condition. The Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok treated 71 passengers. The incident has renewed calls for strict adherence to safety protocols, emphasizing the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during a flight. ""It is a matter of life and death,"" said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.This event marked the first fatal incident involving Singapore Airlines in almost 25 years. The airline, recognized as one of the world's leading carriers, has a strong safety record, with its last major accident occurring in October 2000.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the US and Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau are investigating the incident. Preliminary findings suggest that climate change may be increasing the frequency and intensity of turbulence events. ""For clear-air turbulence, climate change is increasing the temperature difference across the jet stream between the cold poles and the warm tropics,"" explained Dr Paul Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading.As investigations continue, the aviation industry is urged to enhance real-time weather data sharing and improve safety protocols to better prepare for such unpredictable turbulence events.(With inputs from agencies)","Singapore Airlines Flight SQ321 was flying from London’s Heathrow airport to Singapore.

The actor will now face a trial on July 10.District court judge Mary Marlowe Sommer argued in a court filing that she found no prosecutorial bad faith in the grand jury, no error in jury instructions, and that prosecutors adequately informed jurors about a letter from Baldwin's legal team listing defense jurors they could call.The judge rejected defense claims that prosecutors violated grand jury procedure to distract attention away from exculpatory evidence and witnesses.“New Mexico law does not require a prosecutor to present exculpatory evidence to a grand jury, or require a grand jury to even consider exculpatory evidence after alerted to its existence,” the judge wrote.Hutchins was shot with a live round after Baldwin pointed a gun at her while she was setting up camera shots on movie set near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" star claims he did not pull the trigger, which has become essential to the case.According to Tre Lovell, a business and entertainment trial lawyer, the majority of the differences between prosecution and defense viewpoints are factual disagreements, which juries are expected to decide.“The real secret is educating a jury about a film set,” Lovell said.The FBI and an independent firearms specialist hired by the prosecution tested Baldwin's revolver and discovered that it would not shootuntil the trigger was pulled.The defense claims the revolver's hammer and trigger were modified to make it easier to fire, resulting in an unintentional discharge.(With inputs from agencies)",Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin's request to dismiss involuntary manslaughter charge against him in the alleged involuntary shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

Ex-CIA officer accused of spying for China pleads guilty in a Honolulu courtroom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ex-cia-officer-accused-of-spying-for-china-pleads-guilty-in-a-honolulu-courtroom/articleshow/110410639.cms,"HONOLULU: A former CIA officer and contract linguist for the FBI accused of spying for China for at least a decade pleaded guilty Friday in a federal courtroom in Honolulu.Alexander Yuk Ching Ma , 72, has been in custody since his arrest in August 2020. The U.S. Justice Department said in a court filing it amassed ""a war chest of damning evidence"" against him, including an hourlong video of Ma and an older relative - also a former CIA officer - providing classified information to intelligence officers with China's Ministry of State Security in 2001.The video shows Ma counting the $50,000 received from the Chinese agents for his service, prosecutors said.During a sting operation, he accepted thousands of dollars in cash in exchange for past espionage activities, and he told an undercover FBI agent posing as a Chinese intelligence officer that he wanted to see the ""motherland"" succeed, prosecutors said.The secrets he was accused of providing included information about CIA sources and assets, international operations, secure communication practices and operational tradecraft, charging documents said.As part of an agreement with prosecutors, Ma pleaded guilty Friday to a count of conspiracy to gather or deliver national defense information to a foreign government. The deal calls for a 10-year sentence, but a judge will have the final say at Ma's sentencing scheduled for Sept. 11. Without the deal, he faced life in prison.Ma was born in Hong Kong, moved to Honolulu in 1968 and became a U.S. citizen in 1975. He joined the CIA in 1982, was assigned overseas the following year, and resigned in 1989. He held a top secret security clearance, according to court documents.Ma lived and worked in Shanghai, China, before returning to Hawaii in 2001. He was hired as a contract linguist in the FBI's Honolulu field office in 2004, and prosecutors say that over the following six years, he regularly copied, photographed and stole classified documents. He often took them on trips to China, returning with thousands of dollars in cash and expensive gifts, such as a new set of golf clubs, prosecutors said.In court Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Sorenson revealed that Ma's hiring as a part-time contract linguist was a ""ruse"" to monitor his contact with Chinese intelligence officers.The FBI had been aware of Ma's ties with the intelligence officers and ""made the determination to notionally hire the defendant to work at an FBI off-site location in Honolulu,"" the plea agreement said.In 2006, while Ma was living in Hawaii, Chinese intelligence officers sent him photos of people they were interested in, Sorenson said, and Ma contacted the co-conspirator relative and convinced him to reveal at least two of the identities.Ma, in pleading guilty, said everything Sorenson described is true. Ma said he had signed non-disclosure agreements that he knew would be in effect even after leaving the CIA and that he knew the information he was providing to the Chinese intelligence officials could harm the United States or help a foreign nation.In 2021, Ma's former defense attorney told a judge Ma believed he was suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease and was having trouble remembering things.A defense motion noted that Ma's older brother developed Alzheimer's 10 years prior and was completely disabled by the disease. The brother is referred to as the co-conspirator in the indictment against Ma, but prosecutors didn't charge him because of his incompetency due to Alzheimer's, the motion said.The co-conspirator is now dead, Sorenson said in court Friday.Last year a judge found Ma competent and to not be suffering from a major mental disease, disorder or defect.Ma's plea agreement with prosecutors also says he will ""provide more detailed facts relating to this case during debriefings with Government representatives,"" and submit to polygraph examinations.""The defendant understands and agrees that his cooperation obligation represents a lifetime commitment by the defendant to the United States to cooperate as described in this agreement,"" the court document said.","Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 72, has been in custody since his arrest in August 2020.

Trump no longer a taboo for some Valley investors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-no-longer-a-taboo-for-some-valley-investors/articleshow/110407266.cms,"SAN FRANSISCO: In 2021, David Sacks, a prominent venture capital investor and podcast host, said former President Donald Trump 's behaviour around the Jan 6 riot at the US Capitol had disqualified him from being a future political candidate.At a tech conference last week, Sacks said his view had changed. ""I have bigger disagreements with Biden than with Trump,"" the investor said. Sacks said he and his podcast co-hosts were working on hosting a fundraiser for Trump, which could include an interview for their ""All In"" show. They also extended an invitation to President Joe Biden , he said, but the Trump camp was more open to it.Such public support for Trump used to be taboo in Silicon Valley , which has long been seen as a liberal bastion. But frustration with Biden, Democrats and the state of the world has increasingly driven some of tech's most prominent venture capitalists to the right.Some investors, like Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital, backed Democrats in the past. (He is set to co-host the fundraiser for Trump alongside Sacks.) Others, like Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz and Shaun Maguire of Sequoia Capital, have criticized Biden without expressing support for Trump. Much of Silicon Valley , including prominent donors like investors Reid Hoffman and Vinod Khosla, remains loyal to Democrats.Peter Thiel, the investor who backed Trump in the past, has said he is disillusioned with politics and plans to stay out of the 2024 race.Thiel's loud and enthusiastic support for Trump in 2016, which included a $1.25 million donation, came as a shock. Even more surprising to some in the industry was the way that, after Trump won the election that year, the world seemed to blame tech companies for his victory. The resulting ""techlash"" against Facebook and others caused some industry leaders to reassess their political views, a trend that continued through the social and political turmoil of the pandemic.During that time, Democrats moved further to the left and demonized successful people who made a lot of money, further alienating some tech leaders, said Bradley Tusk, a venture capital investor and political strategist who supports Biden.That feeling has hardened under Biden. Some investors said they were frustrated that his pick for chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, has aggressively moved to block acquisitions, one of the main ways venture capitalists make money. They said they were also unhappy that Biden's pick for head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, had been hostile to cryptocurrency companies.The startup industry has also been in a downturn since 2022, with higher interest rates sending capital fleeing from risky bets and a dismal market for initial public offerings crimping opportunities for investors to cash in on their valuable investments.","Venture capital investor David Sacks says former President Donald Trump disqualified him from being a future political candidate.

WASHINGTON: US defence secretary Lloyd Austin will undergo a medical procedure at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will transfer power temporarily to his deputy, Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder said in a statement. Austin is continuing to deal with bladder issues that arose in December following his treatment for prostate cancer , Ryder said.

The procedure he will undergo on Friday evening is elective and minimally invasive, ""is not related to his cancer diagnosis and has had no effect on his excellent cancer prognosis,"" the press secretary said.

Austin will transfer authority to Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks while he is indisposed, the Pentagon said.

Austin, 70, has had ongoing health issues since undergoing surgery to address a prostate cancer diagnosis. He spent two weeks in the hospital following complications from a prostatectomy. Austin faced criticism at the time for not immediately informing the president or Congress of either his diagnosis or hospitalization.

Austin was taken back to Walter Reed in February for a bladder issue, admitted to intensive care for a second time and underwent a non-surgical procedure under general anesthesia at the time.

With an estimated three million brown rats residing in New York City as of August 2023, the issue has reached a critical point.In a recent press release, Mayor Adams emphasized the importance of understanding the enemy to defeat it, sayingg, “The best way to defeat our enemy is to know our enemy.” The summit will gather experts from Boston, New Orleans, and Seattle to share insights and strategies on urban rat management.""New Yorkers may not know this about me – but I hate rats, and I’m confident most of our city’s residents do as well,"" Adams expressed. He highlighted that rat sightings have decreased by nearly 14% in the city's Rat Mitigation Zones over the past year, but stressed that efforts to combat the rodent issue are far from over.Kathleen Corradi , New York City's first director of rodent mitigations, also known as the ""rat czar,"" voiced the city's pride in hosting the event. She pointed out the surprising lack of research on urban rats and their management despite their prevalence in cities. “Despite being our closest urban counterparts, there is surprisingly limited research on urban rats and their management,” Corradi noted.In an effort to further tackle the rodent population, the New York City Council introduced a bill last month that would require the Health Department to use salty pellets to sterilize both male and female rats in two neighborhoods as part of a pilot program.However, not everyone is supportive of the city's approach. Animal rights activists from PETA have criticized Mayor Adams for “villainizing rats” and urged him to “show kindness and respect for all New Yorkers.” PETA plans to send the mayor an 'empathy kit' that includes a ‘rats have rights’ mug and a ""step-by-step guide to cultivating compassion.""","New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced the upcoming National Urban Rat Summit.

This variant has garnered significant attention due to its increased transmissibility and potential resistance to existing vaccines . Health officials are closely monitoring the situation and urging the public to stay vigilant.Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has emphasized the importance of booster shots and adherence to preventive measures. ""The KP.2 variant is more contagious and poses a greater risk of reinfection,"" he said. ""It is crucial for everyone, especially those at higher risk, to get their booster shots and continue practicing safety measures like wearing masks and social distancing.""The KP.2 variant, part of the family of ""FliRT"" variants, exhibits mutations that allow it to spread more easily among people. While initial data suggests that current vaccines still provide some protection against severe illness and hospitalization, there are concerns about the variant's ability to evade immune responses, a CNN report said.In response to the emergence of KP.2, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is ramping up efforts to distribute updated vaccines tailored to combat the new variant. Additionally, public health campaigns are being intensified to educate the public on the importance of vaccination and booster doses.The scientific community is also conducting extensive research to understand the full implications of the KP.2 variant. Studies are underway to determine its impact on vaccine efficacy and to develop strategies to counter its spread.Public health officials are emphasizing the importance of staying informed about the KP.2 variant. Clear and accurate communication is vital to ensure that people understand the risks and take appropriate actions to protect themselves and their communities.

Sanjay Wijesekera, Unicef regional director for South Asia, warned that rising temperatures could put millions of children’s health at risk if they are not protected and hydrated.Heatstroke is a serious illness that occurs when body temperature rises too quickly, potentially causing unconsciousness, disability, or death.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual monthly rainfall. Last month’s heavy rains caused fatalities and extensive damage to property and farmland.Daytime temperatures have soared as much as 8 degrees Celsius (46 degrees Fahrenheit) above the average May temperatures over the past 20 years, raising concerns about flooding in the northwest due to glacial melting.The 2022 floods caused significant damage in Sindh and Baluchistan provinces, resulting in 1,739 deaths nationwide.The heatwave is also affecting Pakistan's southwest and northwest regions. Schools in Punjab have been closed for a week.On Thursday, Save the Children announced that more than half of Pakistan’s school-age children, approximately 26 million, will miss a week of school due to the heatwave. The closure of schools in Punjab means 52% of the country’s students will be out of school.In Lahore, residents have been seen swimming in roadside canals to cool off. Despite contributing less than 1% to global carbon emissions, Pakistan is experiencing severe impacts of climate change.","Temperatures reached up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mohenjo Daro on Wednesday.

Additionally, the suspects were purportedly engaged in filming the abuse and circulating the videos within the vicinity, as reported by ARY News.The investigation into the matter was initiated following the disappearance of a child on May 11. Subsequent interrogations led to the unraveling of the gang's illicit activities.One of the suspects, identified as Nisar, reportedly enticed children from gaming zones and transported them to the gang's hideout. There, the minors were allegedly subjected to sexual abuse and also trafficked to others.It was disclosed by the police that the gang predominantly targeted children aged between 12 to 14 years.Law enforcement authorities further elaborated that the suspects employed a strategy of wearing a helmet associated with an online motorcycle service to evade detection while transporting the children from one location to another, ARY News reported.Data collected by Sahil, an NGO dedicated to addressing child sexual abuse, reveals a disturbing trend: the majority of abusers are individuals known to the victims, such as acquaintances, neighbours, or even family members.Shockingly, religious teachers and clerics emerge as the primary perpetrators within institutional settings, surpassing even police officers, school teachers, or nuclear family members in the number of complaints filed against them, according to Dawn.Primary data remains limited and organisations rely on media reports and police complaints but the trend over the past 20 years shows the gender divide of abused girls in madrassas is slightly higher than that of boys ('Cruel Numbers').","Police in Karachi have dismantled a gang allegedly engaged in the sexual abuse of children.

The child was brought before the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, where his legal representative asserted that the judge dismissed the case after receiving an affidavit.Officials from WAPDA and PESCO expressed uncertainty regarding the child's involvement in the alleged offense.This incident follows a significant revelation last month, where power theft within Power Distribution Companies (DISCOs) reportedly caused a loss of PKR 438 billion to the national treasury. Sources indicated that these losses were a considerable portion of the total annual billing of PKR 723 billion.The power division identified the poorest performing DISCOs, highlighting companies in Hyderabad, Sukkur, Peshawar, Quetta, and Tribal areas for their records. On April 7, the Punjab energy department raised concerns about power distribution companies overcharging government institutions, which it labeled a burden on the provincial exchequer.The department noted that Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO), Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) were overcharging government departments.The department reported that there are over 102,000 electric connections across provincial departments, with a significant discrepancy between actual consumption and billed amounts. For the financial year 2022-23, the provincial departments consumed electricity worth over PKR 1.91 billion but were billed PKR 76 billion.In response to this issue, the federal government approved the deployment of Federal Investigation Officers (FIA) to electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) to curb power theft and enhance revenue recovery. This measure was in line with demands from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as reported by ARY News.","A 3-year-old toddler was booked for electricity theft in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

He added that temperatures could reach up to 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit) above the monthly average. This week could rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country, Babar said.It's the latest climate-related disaster to hit the country in recent years.

NEW YORK: In perhaps the first acknowledgement of its kind on a global forum that the ""new India is a dangerous entity"", Pakistan 's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.Pakistan's permanent representative at the world body also quoted from a report in a leading US daily to say the ""new India comes into your home and kills you"".Addressing the General Assembly on May 2, Akram said, ""Pakistan's foreign minister informed the Security Council, as well as the secretary general and the president of the General Assembly of India's campaign of targeted assassinations in Pakistan. This extra-territorial state terrorism is not limited to Pakistan. It has been extended to targeted killings of political opponents in Canada and attempted in the United States and probably in other countries.""""The Washington Post reported that Prime Minister Modi last week told his cheering supporters, and I quote, ""Today, even India's enemies know this is Modi. This is the new India. This new India comes into your home and kills you"". This new India is a dangerous entity, it is a net provider of insecurity, not security,"" Pakistan's permanent representative to the UN alleged.Earlier, top British daily, The Guardian, claimed in a report that the Indian government carried out assassinations of wanted individuals deep inside Pakistan as part of a ""wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil"".It said, citing intelligence sources, that targeted assassinations increased significantly in 2023, claiming India's involvement in the suspected deaths of about 15 people, ""most of whom were shot at close range by unknown gunmen"".Earlier, some countries in the West raised concerns over what they claimed were targeted killings on their soil at the behest of the Indian government.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused 'agents' allegedly in the employ of the Indian government of killing Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan leader and a designated terrorist by the country's elite National Investigation Agency (NIA), in 2020.However, India has dismissed the claim as 'absurd' and 'motivated'.Nijjar was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A purported video clip of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March, this year, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men in what was alleged to be a 'contract killing'.In a recent development in the Nijjar case, the Canadian Police arrested four Indian nationals for their alleged involvement in the killing of the separatist Khalistleader outside a gurudwara in British Columbia last June.Reacting to the arrests, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar denied receiving any evidence implicating Indian nationals' involvement in the killing in Canada of the India-designated terrorist.Responding to media queries, Jaishankar said, ""I also read that another arrest has been made. If that person is an Indian national, then usually by consular practice, you inform the government or the embassy of the country of origin. But beyond that, we have long maintained that if anything, any event in Canada, any violence in Canada, has any evidence or information which is relevant to be investigated in India, we are open to investigating it.""He emphasised that while any Indian national's arrest would usually prompt notification to the government or embassy, no specific evidence justifying investigation by Indian agencies has been received to date.""But to date, we have never received anything, which is specific and worthy of being pursued by our investigative agencies. And I'm not aware anything has changed in the last few days in that regard,"" the External Affairs Minister said at a media interaction at a seminar on Indian Capital Markets 'Roadmap for Viksit Bharat' at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in Mumbai earlier.At a weekly media briefing, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), too, informed that Canada had not formally conveyed the arrests and India had not yet received any consular access request.On being asked about the fourth Indian arrested by Canada in connection with the Nijjar killing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have seen reports of the fourth person being arrested. We have not been formally conveyed of it. So far, we have not received any consular access request as well.""Earlier, campaigning for the ongoing general elections in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a telling remark vis-a-vis its western neighbour, saying India does not send dossiers on terrorism anymore but eliminates terrorists in their own backyard.""Today, India doesn't send dossiers.(Today India strikes back at terrorists on their own turf),"" PM Modi said at a poll rally in Maharashtra's Latur.Expanding on the difference in how his government tackles terrorism as compared to previous Congress regimes at the Centre, Prime Minister Modi said the earlier approach of handing dossiers to Pakistan has been replaced by taking out the wanted terror conspirators on their own turf.At a separate rally, PM Modi doubled down on remarks made by the INDIA bloc leader Farooq Abdullah that Pakistan was not wearing bangles and was a nuclear-amed nation, saying, """" (I was told Pakistanis don't even have bangles, we will make them wear some)"".Addressing a public meeting in Muzaffarpur, PM Modi said, ""These (Congress and INDIA alliance) people are so afraid that they see Pakistan's atom bombs even in their dreams. Can such a government and leader run the country? They (INDI alliance leaders) say, ''. (i am told Pakistanis don't even have bangles...we will make them wear some. They are desperately crying out for wheat, they don't have electricity and now they don't even have bangles to wear.) Some leaders in the Opposition are even giving clean chits to the 26/11 accused.""""Some people are doubting the surgical strikes and air strikes (after the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks). These leaders want to weaken the morale of our forces and cast aspersions on our nuclear power. It seems like 'INDI alliance ne India ke khilaf supari le li hai' (INDI partners have taken out a contract against the country),"" PM Modi added.In the US, federal prosecutors earlier alleged the involvement of two Indian nationals, including a government employee, in a plot to murder Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Canadian also holding American citizenship, on its soil.According to the indictment of the US Justice Department, an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, who is currently in custody, was charged with the murder-for-hire of Pannun. The US Justice Department claimed that an Indian government employee, who was not identified in the indictment filed, recruited Gupta to hire a hitman to allegedly assassinate Pannun, which was foiled by US authorities.India set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.","Pakistan's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.

The assessment team also inquired about the potential investment in different projects and especially asked for privatisation of the national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other state-owned enterprises (SOEs).Envisaging the CPI-based inflation on the higher average rate of 12.7 per cent for the next budget 2024-25, the Washington-based lender also inquired about the tax exemptions offered by the government for the upcoming Special Economic Zones (SEZs) under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The IMF wants maximisation of non-tax revenues as the proposal under consideration is to increase the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) for increasing collection up to Pakistani Rs 1.08 trillion in the next fiscal year or slap a carbon levy to compensate the zero rate of GST on petroleum products, The News International reported.The international lender has recommended imposing 18 per cent GST on petrol and diesel along with PDL.The IMF has refused to accept the macroeconomic framework of the Finance Ministry and so far pitched the macroeconomic framework for the next budget 2024-25 including a real GDP growth rate of 3.5 per cent while the CPI-based inflation was projected on the higher side at 12.7 per cent.The Ministry of Finance has prepared a macroeconomic framework whereby the GDP growth was envisaged at 3.7 to 4 per cent while inflation was kept on average in the range of 11 to 12 per cent, the report said.For the outgoing fiscal year 2023-24, the provision GDP growth figure may hover around 2 to 2.5 per cent of GDP against the official target of 3.5 per cent, it said.Pakistan has made a formal request for a fresh bailout package of USD 6 to USD 8 billion under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the possibility of being augmented through climate finance. If successful, it would be the 24th IMF bailout programme for the country.Last month, Pakistan completed a short-term USD 3 billion programme with the IMF, which bailed the country out of any default.It was unclear whether the IMF mission would end with a formal staff-level agreement for the next bailout package, according to The Express Tribune newspaper.The duration, instrument, and size of the next IMF programme were open to discussion, the report said, quoting sources.Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high of 38 per cent last May.The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall, and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around two per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","The IMF has asked Pakistan to share a draft of the under-preparation investment policy and ensure transparency in the working of the Special Investment Facilitation Council.
