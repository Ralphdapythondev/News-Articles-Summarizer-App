"Canada to cut immigration for first time in years amid rising political pressure, housing woes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-to-cut-immigration-for-first-time-in-years-amid-rising-political-pressure-housing-woes/articleshow/114528046.cms,"Canada is set to significantly reduce its immigration numbers for the first time in years, marking a major shift in policy as the Justin Trudeau government faces increasing political pressure.Starting in 2025, the country will accept 395,000 new permanent residents, decreasing to 380,000 in 2026, and further to 365,000 in 2027. This is a sharp drop from the 485,000 expected in 2024, according to a report by Reuters.The reports of these new immigration targets come at a time of heightened diplomatic tensions between Canada and India.Relations between the two countries have soured following the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Sikh separatist leader in British Columbia and designated terrorist by India, which led to the expulsion of diplomats from both sides.India is the largest source of foreign-born residents in Canada, according to the most recent census.Canada's immigration policy has been under increasing scrutiny as the country faces a housing affordability crisis. The rising cost of homes, exacerbated by higher interest rates and a growing population, has sparked concerns about the sustainability of the current immigration system.Many Canadians feel priced out of the housing market, with polls showing that a growing number believe the country is accepting too many immigrants. This issue has become a central topic in Canadian politics ahead of the next federal election, expected no later than October 2025.Migrant advocates have criticized the government's decision, arguing it will leave many immigrants in precarious situations.This shift comes after a period when Canada loosened immigration rules during the Covid-19 pandemic to fill labor shortages. The government had initially planned to welcome 500,000 new permanent residents annually in 2025 and 2026.However, with over 2.8 million temporary residents in the country as of mid-2024, the government has started to tighten its immigration policies. Immigration minister Marc Miller has said that Canadians want a system that is better regulated and not ""out of control.""The government has also pledged to reduce the share of temporary residents in the population and introduced caps on international students and foreign workers. These changes are intended to address concerns about wage suppression and the exploitation of temporary workers in Canada's labor market.","Starting in 2025, the country will accept 395,000 new permanent residents.

Israel accuses 6 Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-accuses-6-al-jazeera-journalists-in-gaza-of-being-palestinian-militants/articleshow/114527372.cms,"Al Jazeera broadcast engineer works at the Master Control Room unit (AP file photo)

RAMANALLAH: The Israeli army on Wednesday accused six Al Jazeera journalists covering the war in Gaza of also being current or former paid fighters for Palestinian militant groups. Al Jazeera rejected the claims. Israel cited documents it purportedly found in Gaza, and other intelligence it gathered, in making the accusations against the journalists, all of whom are Palestinian men.It said four are or have been affiliated with Hamas, and two with Palestinian Islamic Jihad .Al Jazeera said the accusations were ""fabricated"" and ""part of a wider pattern of hostility"" toward the pan-Arab network. It said the claims were ""a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region, thereby obscuring the harsh realities of the war from audiences worldwide.""The AP has been unable to independently verify the authenticity of the documents Israel posted online to support its claims.Al Jazeera is based in the energy-rich nation of Qatar , where many senior Hamas officials are based. The Gulf Arab country, which funds Al Jazeera, also has been a key player in Gaza cease-fire negotiations, along with the US and Egypt.Al Jazeera journalists Anas al-Sharif, Hossam Shabat, Ismael Abu Omar, and Talal Arrouki were accused by Israel of ties to Hamas. Ashraf Saraj and Alaa Salameh were accused of ties to Islamic Jihad.The men have held various roles, according to documents Israel cited -- sniper, infantry soldier, fighter, captain, training coordinator and ""propaganda.""The Committee to Protect Journalists released a statement on Wednesday that was critical of Israel, which it said ""has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence.""In July, after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City killed two Al Jazeera journalists, including Ismail Al Ghoul, the committee noted that Israel ""produced a similar document, which contained contradictory information, showing that Al Ghoul, born in 1997, received a Hamas military ranking in 2007 - when he would have been 10 years old.""Militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad led last year's attack on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. They have been fighting alongside each other against Israeli troops in Gaza for the past year.In January, Israel detailed allegations against 12 employees of a United Nations agency that it says were involved in the Hamas attack on Israel last year that ignited the war in Gaza. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, subsequently fired at least 21 staffers for their roles in the attack. UNRWA has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians in Gaza during the war.Four Al Jazeera journalists have been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza over the past 12 months, according to the network. Several of the dead later have been accused by Israel of being members of either Hamas or Islamic Jihad, accusations rejected by the Qatari outlet.In May, after an Israeli court ordered the closure of Al Jazeera's operations and broadcasts within Israel, police raided a hotel room in East Jerusalem from where the network had been broadcasting live images.It was the first time Israel had ever shuttered a foreign news outlet. Four months later, Israel raided Al Jazeera's office in the Palestinian-governed West Bank city of Ramallah, shutting down the bureau there.Several of those named by Israel on Wednesday, including al-Sharif, have become mainstay figures of the outlet's 24-hour live coverage of Gaza. They have acquired celebrity-like status among Palestinians and in other countries across the Middle East Al Jazeera is one of a handful of news organizations still broadcasting daily from the besieged enclave.The documents and intelligence Israel unveiled Wednesday purportedly show the rank, role, enlistment date, and battalion of each of the six Al-Jazeera journalists.At least 128 journalists have been killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, and Lebanon since last October, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an international media watchdog. They include 123 Palestinians, two Israelis and three Lebanese.Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza since the war began, according to the local health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants but says more than half of the dead are women and children.Even before the war, tensions between Al-Jazeera and Israel ran high. Israeli forces shot and killed Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist, in May 2022 as she reported on a story in the West Bank.Israel isn't the only critic of Al Jazeera. The US singled out the broadcaster during its occupation of Iraq after its 2003 invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, and for airing videos of the late al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden, who orchestrated the September 11, 2001 attack against the US.Al Jazeera has been closed or blocked by other governments in the Middle East. In 2013, Egyptian authorities seeking to crush mass protests against President Mohammed Morsi raided a luxury hotel used by Al Jazeera.","Al Jazeera said the accusations were ""fabricated"" and ""part of a wider pattern of hostility"" toward the pan-Arab network.

North Korean soldiers are traveling to Russia and if they join the fight against Ukraine , they will become legitimate military targets and it is also a sign of weakness on Kremlin's part, the White House said on Wednesday.In a press briefing, national security council spokesman John Kirby said, ""We will see what the Russians and North Koreans decide to do here.As I said earlier, if these North Korean soldiers decide to join the fight against Ukraine, they will become legitimate military targets.""These remarks came in the wake of the South Korea's claim that there are at least 3,000 North Korean soldiers are travelling to Russia and receiving training on drones and other equipment before being deployed to battlefields in Ukraine.Talking about the same reports, Kirby said that they are closely working on the situation and trying to understand.According to Kirby the soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia and then traveled onward to multiple Russian military training sites where they are currently undergoing training.""We do not yet know whether these soldiers will en- — enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is a certain — certainly a highly concerning probability,"" Kirby said.He further stated that the North Korean soldiers, after completing the training, might move to western Russia to fight against the Ukrainian military. The Ukrainian government has also been briefed about the situation.""For the time being, we will continue to monitor the situation closely. But let’s be clear, if North Korean soldiers do enter into combat, this development would demonstrate Russia’s growing desperation in its war against Ukraine,"" the NSC spokesperson said.""Russia is suffering extraordinary casualties on the battlefield every single day, but President Putin appears intent on continuing this war. If Russia is indeed forced to turn to North Korea for manpower, this would be a sign of weakness, not strength, on the part of the Kremlin,"" he added.Kirby also said that Russia’s cooperation with the North Korean military is in violation of multiple UN security council resolutions which prohibit the procurement of arms from North Korea and military arms training. This move is likewise a violation.","North Korean soldiers are traveling to Russia and if they join the fight against Ukraine, they will become legitimate military targets, the White House said on Wednesday.

North Korean balloon filled with trash drops on South Korean Presidential compound,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korean-balloon-filled-with-trash-drops-on-south-korean-presidential-compound/articleshow/114526521.cms,"Trash carried by a North Korean balloon landed on the presidential compound in central Seoul on Thursday, South Korean officials confirmed in a startling breach of security. This marks the second incident of its kind since North Korea resumed sending balloon-borne trash toward South Korea in late May, reviving Cold War-era psychological warfare tactics.South Korea's presidential security service assured that the debris contained no hazardous materials.However, it remains unclear whether President Yoon Suk Yeol was present at the compound when the balloon made contact.Experts suggest that North Korea lacks the advanced technology needed to target specific locations with precision.According to local media reports, including the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper, the latest balloons carried not only trash but also propaganda leaflets condemning President Yoon and First Lady Kim Keon Hee. These leaflets were reportedly scattered across Seoul’s Yongsan district, home to the presidential office. The newspaper also noted that North Korea may have started using GPS technology to more accurately deliver these balloons to their intended targets.The balloon campaign follows accusations by North Korea that South Korea has deployed drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month. North Korean officials have warned of military retaliation if such incidents persist. While South Korea has not confirmed the use of drones, it has issued a stern warning that any threat to the safety of its citizens would mean the end of the North Korean regime.A similar balloon incident occurred in July when trash carried by a North Korean balloon also landed on the presidential compound, sparking concerns over the security of vital South Korean facilities.

US Senator Graham says Israel-Saudi deal possible before year-end,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-senator-graham-says-israel-saudi-deal-possible-before-year-end/articleshow/114526004.cms,"US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham

MELVINDALE: US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and believed that an agreement to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia could be reached before the end of the year.Graham, who is in Michigan campaigning for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, told Reuters that Netanyahu supported work on a deal with Saudi Arabia, adding that the next U.S.administration was unlikely to be able to secure enough votes in Congress after President Joe Biden leaves office on Jan. 20.""I think the time to do this is on Biden's watch,"" said Graham, who had also met with Netanyahu earlier this month. He said Vice President Kamala Harris was ""far more beholden to the left"" and had not shown interest in working for such an agreement, but Biden was keen to see a deal get done and would be able to mobilize the needed Democratic votes.Normalizing Israeli-Saudi relations would mark an expansion of the “Abraham Accords” sealed when Trump was in office. The accords led to the normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.Morgan Finkelstein, National Security Spokeswoman for the Harris campaign said: “Vice President Harris has consistently supported efforts to ensure Israel is more deeply integrated in the Middle East region, including a potential historic normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia. She believes such integration is critical to counter the threats posed by Iran.”Democrats would be reluctant to support Trump if he won the election and the initiative slipped into next year, Graham said.The Biden administration had been working to broker a normalization accord between the two countries that would include U.S. security guarantees for Gulf state Saudi Arabia, among other bilateral deals between Washington and Riyadh, but those efforts stalled after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.A defense pact would require a two-thirds majority in the U.S. Senate, or 67 votes.Analysts have said that an Israel-Saudi normalization deal would be difficult to achieve without a clear path to establishing an independent Palestinian state, which most Israelis oppose.Graham expressed confidence that a solution could be found to ensure creation of a sovereign state in a Palestine that was de-militarized and could not threaten Israel.""We're moving in the right direction,"" he said, adding that he expected Saudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to be supportive since absence of a deal would undermine his economic goals.Graham said there was an ""opening a mile wide"" for a ceasefire in Lebanon given Israel's attacks on Hezbollah leaders, but ensuring a lasting peace in the region also required a plan to rebuild Gaza after the war and the West Bank, something he said should be led by Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.The Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants on Israel killed around 1,200 people, with another 253 taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent war has devastated Gaza, killing more than 42,500 Palestinians, with another 10,000 uncounted dead thought to lie under the rubble, Gaza health authorities say.",US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. He said he believed that an agreement to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia could be reached before the end of the year.Normalizing Israeli-Saudi relations would mark an expansion of the “Abraham Accords” sealed when Trump was in office.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114526121,imgsize-27016,width-400,resizemode-4/114526121.jpg"

TOI CORRESPONDENT from London: Donald Trump 's lawyer has written to the Federal Election Commission to request an immediate investigation into ""blatant foreign interference "" in the US president election by the UK Labour Party , alleging that ""illegal foreign contributions"" were made by Labour to Kamala Harris ' campaign.This comes after a LinkedIn post by Labour head of operations Sofia Patel surfaced last week in which she said 100 Labour staff were going to the US to campaign for Harris in battleground states.""We will sort your housing,"" she said.The letter from Trump's deputy general counsel, which has sparked fears the US-UK ties could be soured if Trump wins on Nov 5, pointed out that foreign nationals ""may not be compensated, may not make expenditures, and may not direct or control activities of US campaigns"". It alleged that language used in Patel's post ""supports a reasonable inference that Labour Party will finance at least travel and facilitate room and board."" Citing example, the letter said Australian Labour Party 's campaigning for Bernie Sanders in 2016 led to a $14,500 fine.Even if they are volunteers, Labour appears to be using party resources, including paid staff time, to coordinate their travel, the letter says. ""There is reason to believe that foreign nationals are exercising direction and control over elements of the Harris campaign,"" it continues, referring to ""the similarity in messaging"" between her campaign and Labour.UK PM Keir Starmer played down the row, saying Labour always sends volunteers to campaign for Democrats every election.

This perilous level of pollution poses serious health risks, leading to respiratory ailments, eye irritation, and skin infections among its residents.Delhi follows closely behind, recording an AQI of 204, also classified as ""very unhealthy."" The capital city's struggle with smog is exacerbated by factors such as heavy traffic, industrial emissions, and agricultural burning in surrounding areas.As these cities battle persistent air quality challenges, immediate and effective measures are essential to safeguard public health and mitigate the environmental impact.As air pollution continues to escalate, several major cities around the world are grappling with severe air quality issues. The following table lists some of the most affected cities, showcasing their alarming Air Quality Index (AQI) levels:Lahore tops the list with an AQI of 232, categorising it as ""very unhealthy."" The city faces significant pollution challenges, mainly due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust. Residents are often advised to limit outdoor activities, especially during peak pollution hours.Delhi ranks second with an AQI of 204, also falling into the ""very unhealthy"" category. The capital city struggles with high levels of smog, particularly during the winter months. Factors contributing to its poor air quality include traffic congestion, burning of crop residue in neighbouring states, and industrial pollution.Dakar has an AQI of 155, placing it in the ""unhealthy"" range. The coastal city experiences air quality issues primarily from dust storms, urbanisation, and emissions from vehicles. Residents are encouraged to take precautions, particularly those with pre-existing health conditions.Tied with Dakar, Kinshasa also reports an AQI of 155, indicating unhealthy air quality. Rapid urban growth and insufficient infrastructure contribute to pollution levels, which can impact respiratory health. Awareness and measures to improve air quality are increasingly important for the population.Dhaka's AQI of 142 categorises it as ""unhealthy."" The city is known for its heavy traffic and industrial emissions, contributing to air pollution. Public health advisories are common, especially during high pollution days, urging residents to wear masks and limit outdoor activities.With an AQI of 132, Ulaanbaatar falls into the ""unhealthy"" category. The city struggles with winter air pollution due to coal burning for heating, which significantly deteriorates air quality. Efforts are underway to transition to cleaner energy sources and improve overall air standards.Hanoi has an AQI of 128, also classified as ""unhealthy."" The capital experiences high pollution levels from traffic, construction, and industrial activities.

Efforts are being made to address these issues through cleaner public transport and stricter pollution controls.Bucharest rounds out the list with an AQI of 106, falling into the ""unhealthy for sensitive groups"" category. The city deals with pollution from traffic and industrial activities. Residents with respiratory issues are advised to be cautious and monitor air quality levels regularly.The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to measure and report air pollution levels, ranging from 0 to 500. It reflects the concentration of harmful pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone. AQI levels are categorised to indicate potential health risks. A value below 50 is considered ""good,"" while values above 100 become ""unhealthy,"" especially for sensitive groups like children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions.Prolonged exposure to high AQI levels can lead to serious health issues, including respiratory infections, heart disease, and reduced lung function. The AQI measures pollutant concentrations in the air. An AQI above 100 is considered unhealthy, and levels exceeding 150 are ""very unhealthy.""

E Coli Outbreak: Deadly E coli outbreak linked to McDonald's burger hits 10 US states: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deadly-e-coli-outbreak-linked-to-mcdonalds-burger-hits-10-us-states-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/114483137.cms,"Representtative image (Picture credit: Reuters)

Here's what you need to know:

Infections were reported in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

At least 49 individuals were affected, with 27 cases in Colorado and 9 in Nebraska.

One death was reported in Colorado; 10 hospitalizations, including a child with severe kidney complications.

All interviewed individuals reported consuming food from McDonald’s, primarily Quarter Pounders.

Investigators are examining slivered onions and beef patties as potential sources of contamination.

Preliminary findings suggest slivered onions from a single supplier may be linked to some illnesses.

McDonald’s has removed Quarter Pounder hamburgers and slivered onions from menus in affected states and parts of Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

The company has temporarily halted the distribution of slivered onions sourced from the implicated supplier and emphasized its commitment to food safety.

The implicated strain, E coli O157:H7, causes approximately 74,000 infections annually in the US, leading to severe symptoms including fever, stomach cramps, and bloody diarrhoea.

Young children are particularly vulnerable and can experience severe complications like acute kidney failure.

McDonald's has faced a decline in global same-store sales for the first time in nearly four years, prompting the introduction of a $5 meal deal that does not include the Quarter Pounder.

Following the CDC’s announcement, company shares dropped 9 per cent in after-hours trading.

An E coli outbreak associated with McDonald’s Quarter Pounder hamburgers has emerged as a significant public health concern, impacting at least 49 individuals across ten states. Federal health officials have confirmed that the outbreak has resulted in one death and ten hospitalizations, including a child facing severe kidney complications.The centers for disease control and prevention ( CDC ) is actively investigating the situation, which has sparked concerns regarding food safety and the fast-food giant’s menu offerings.The infections have been traced back to a period between September 27 and October 11, with the majority of cases reported in Colorado , which has logged the highest number of infections.As officials work to identify the source of the contamination, initial findings suggest that slivered onions and hamburger patties may be to blame. McDonald’s has responded to the outbreak by removing the implicated items from menus in affected states and halting distribution of certain ingredients.This outbreak comes at a challenging time for McDonald's , which has recently experienced declines in global same-store sales. As the fast-food chain grapples with the impact of inflation on consumer behavior, this health crisis may further strain its reputation and financial performance. The investigation is ongoing, with health officials urging the public to be vigilant about the symptoms of E coli infection.","At least 49 individuals were affected, with 27 cases in Colorado and 9 in Nebraska.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

This alert prompted Sri Lankan authorities to enhance security measures for tourists.In a statement highlighting an imminent threat, the embassy noted it had received ""credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations."" In response, police and intelligence agencies have collaborated to formulate a strategy aimed at safeguarding both tourists and local resorts.This warning follows social media calls to boycott Israeli-owned businesses in the area, coinciding with protests by local Muslim groups opposing Israel’s military actions in Gaza and Lebanon. These protests have garnered support from various segments of the predominantly Buddhist community in Sri Lanka.In light of the embassy’s warning, police have announced a new security initiative designed to protect tourists, although specifics remain undisclosed. Authorities have established a dedicated hotline for tourists to report any safety concerns, ensuring a prompt response to any threats.While Israeli tourists represent less than 1.5% of the 1.5 million visitors to Sri Lanka in the first nine months of this year, approximately 20,000 in total, Arugam Bay remains a particularly favoured destination for Israeli visitors.Since the devastating Easter Sunday attacks in 2019, which claimed the lives of 279 people, including 45 foreign nationals, Sri Lanka has not experienced similar violence. Those coordinated assaults targeted three luxury hotels and three churches, perpetrated by a local extremist group linked to the Islamic State.Tourism has gradually recovered in Sri Lanka following a significant decline due to these attacks and a severe economic crisis in 2022, which resulted in widespread civil unrest. Following an International Monetary Fund bailout last year, the tourism sector has seen an uptick in visitor numbers.",The US embassy in Sri Lanka issued a warning on Wednesday regarding a potential attack on Arugam Bay. This alert prompted Sri Lankan authorities to enhance security measures for tourists.

Israeli vlogger Nuseir Yassin aka Nas Daily came in support for the two-state solution amid the ongoing Middle East crisis due to the three-front war by Israel against the Hamas in Gaza, Lebanon’s Hezobollah and Houthi rebels in Yemen.Speaking at NDTV World Summit Yassin said, ""I think Israel should exist.""“My political opinion, which I make very clear, that we need two states for two people, but also we need to free Palestine from Hamas, from radicalism, from terrorism.I am not for that at all. I think Israel should exist,” he added.Further, Yassin claimed that he lost followers and brand deals due to his political stance but still managed to succeed.“So, I succeeded despite being cancelled more than 10 times. Because the videos are just so damn good, you’re willing to listen to somebody from Israel even though you hate Israel so much. And the lesson here I think for everybody is – there is this amazing picture of one guy standing and a 10,000 people and the guy says ‘You’re all wrong’. I want everybody to think about this picture, ‘You’re all wrong',” the 32-year-vlogger said.“What are you willing to stand in front of 10,000 people who disagree with you and tell them ‘You’re all wrong’? What is something you deeply believe in, that is deeply, deeply unpopular? For me, it is the Israel-Palestine conflict . But for you it is something else. It is a great exercise for every single person sitting here,” he added.Nuseir Yassin, an Israeli-Palestinian vlogger known as Nas Daily on social media, gained popularity through his one-minute videos sharing insights from his global travels. He later established the Nas Daily Corporation, a media company.Born on February 9, 1992, in Arraba, Israel, to a Palestinian Arab Muslim family, Yassin holds Israeli citizenship.According to reports, at 19, he applied to Harvard University in the United States to pursue aerospace engineering. In 2014, he graduated with a degree in economics and a minor in computer science.During his time at Harvard, Yassin founded a pay-it-forward registration service and a social media search engine. After graduating, he began working as a software developer for Venmo, a PayPal-owned mobile payment service, in New York in September 2014.","Nuseir Yassin aka Nas Daily came in support for the two-state solution amid the ongoing Middle East crisis due to the three-front war by Israel against the Hamas in Gaza, Lebanon’s Hezobollah and Houthi rebels in Yemen.

US Vice President Kamala Harris during a CNN town hall said that she believes that Donald Trump is a ""fascist."" When host Anderson Cooper posed the question, “Do you think Donald Trump is a fascist ?” Harris responded, “Yes, I do,” adding that those who know him best should be trusted on this subject.""How he talks about the military servicemen and women, referring to them as suckers and losers, how he demeans people who have taken an oath to sacrifice their life for our country,"" Kamala explained.The town hall, held in Delaware County, Pennsylvania , featured undecided voters just two weeks before the presidential election. This event followed a prior discussion where Harris accused Trump of wanting unchecked power, referencing comments made by former White House chief of staff John Kelly.Kelly revealed that Trump had expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler's generals, which Harris cited as evidence of Trump’s authoritarian tendencies. She said, ""Donald Trump wants unchecked power... one that will obey his orders, even when he tells them to break the law or abandon their oath to the constitution.""The town hall was strategically timed, with both candidates focusing on key battleground states like Pennsylvania and Georgia. Harris holds a narrow lead over Trump, with recent polling showing her at 46% compared to Trump's 43%. The candidates are vying for the support of undecided voters, who could ultimately determine the outcome of the election.Harris's comments about Trump’s leadership style echo sentiments from other former Trump officials. Retired Army Gen. Mark A. Milley described Trump as “fascist to the core” and “the most dangerous person to this country” in a recent book. Similarly, Gen. Jim Mattis reportedly concurred with Milley's assessment.Whit elections just around the corner, Trump is focusing on rallies, including one scheduled in Duluth, Georgia, while Harris continues to engage voters directly through town halls and campaign events.","US Vice President Kamala Harris during a CNN town hall said that she believes that Donald Trump is a ""fascist"" The town hall, held in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, featured undecided voters just two weeks before the presidential election.

'I was completely frozen': Former model alleges Trump groped her after meeting through Jeffrey Epstein,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-accused-of-groping-model-he-met-through-jeffrey-epstein/articleshow/114525892.cms,"File photo

Donald Trump faces new allegations of sexual misconduct after former model Stacey Williams , accused him of groping her in the early 1990s. According to The Guardian, Williams claims the incident took place during an encounter arranged by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein . Williams, now 56, shared these details on a call organised by ' Survivors for Kamala ', a group backing Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign.Williams alleges she first met Trump at a party in 1992 through Epstein, with whom she had a romantic relationship at the time. During the call, Williams told The Guardian, “It was clear Epstein and Donald were close, spending a lot of time together.” She then recounted a disturbing incident that allegedly occurred at Trump Tower in early 1993.According to Williams, Epstein brought her to Trump Tower, where Trump greeted her by groping her. She described how Trump immediately placed his hands on her breasts, waist, and buttocks. ""They both smiled during the whole thing, and I was completely frozen,"" she said. After the encounter, Williams claims Epstein berated her, asking, “Why did you do that?” She felt as though she had been caught in a manipulative game between the two men.Trump’s campaign quickly dismissed the accusations. With the election less than two weeks away, Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump's campaign, called the allegations ""completely false"" and suggested they were politically driven. Leavitt told the Guardian, “These claims are part of a smear campaign led by Harris’s team, using someone who once worked as an Obama activist.”This is not the first time Trump has faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Over 20 women have previously accused him of inappropriate behaviour, all of which he has strongly denied. His connection to Epstein is also well-documented, with the two frequently seen together at social events in the 1990s. While Trump once called Epstein a ""terrific guy,"" he later claimed to have distanced himself from him.Epstein died by suicide in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on further charges of sex trafficking minors.Williams’ claims follow other high-profile cases against Trump. Earlier this year, Trump was ordered by a New York court to pay $83.3 million to writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1990s. Trump denied the allegations, but a jury ruled in Carroll's favour, awarding damages for both assault and defamation.Critics argue that these repeated allegations raise serious questions about Trump's treatment of women. While his core supporters remain largely unaffected, the ongoing accusations continue to spark debate.","Former model Stacey Williams has accused Donald Trump of groping her in the early 1990s.

Justice Department: Justice Department warns Elon Musk’s America PAC over $1 million daily giveaway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/justice-department-warns-elon-musks-america-pac-over-1-million-daily-giveaway/articleshow/114525452.cms,"Justice Department warns Elon Musk’s America PAC over $1 million daily giveaway.(Picture credit: Reuters)

The Justice Department has issued a warning to Elon Musk ’s super PAC, America PAC , over its $1 million daily giveaway in key battleground states , citing concerns that it may violate federal election laws , reported CNN.The letter, which was reportedly sent by the department’s Public Integrity Section, has raised doubts about whether Musk’s initiative violates laws against compensating individuals for voter registration .This section of the Justice Department oversees election-related investigations, and the move follows increasing pressure from legal experts and former government officials to investigate the PAC’s operations.The America PAC giveaway needs participants to be registered voters in one of seven key battleground states—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The initiative aims to register over a million voters in these swing states ahead of the 2024 election .Participants must also sign a petition in support of the First and Second Amendments to qualify.Announcing the sweepstakes at a Trump campaign event in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Musk stated, “We want to try to get over a million, maybe 2 million voters in the battleground states to sign the petition in support of the First and Second Amendment,” on Saturday.“We are going to be awarding $1 million randomly to people who have signed the petition, every day, from now until the election”, he added.However, legal experts are divided over whether this scheme breaks the law. Some believe the contest may fall into a legal ""grey area"" but is not definitively illegal. Matthew Sanderson, an election law expert who has worked with Republicans, commented, ""I can see why people argue this violates the law, but I don’t think it does"", reported NBC News.Winners of the giveaway, who are randomly selected, receive $1 million, with the PAC already naming four winners. Many of them have appeared in promotional videos endorsing Trump and expressing support for constitutional rights, especially free speech and gun rights.Musk has defended the legality of the giveaway, stating that the lottery is not tied to party affiliation, and winners can come from ""any or no political party and one doesn’t even have to vote.""However, federal law clearly prohibits financial incentives related to voter registration. Critics argue that despite Musk’s reassurances, the terms of the contest may still conflict with these regulations.After receiving the Justice Department’s letter, America PAC modified its messaging, stating that winners would now be rewarded as ""spokespersons"" for the PAC’s petition.However, experts noted that the core structure of the contest remains unchanged, as only registered voters in specific states are eligible to participate.","The Justice Department has issued a warning to Elon Musk’s super PAC, America PAC, over its $1 million daily giveaway in key battleground states.

The Biden administration is open to the possibility of new ways to stop the fighting in Gaza and free hostages there, US officials say.Just before departing Tel Aviv Wednesday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken told reporters that he discussed new options in a Tuesday meeting with the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Blinken first referred to talks over a comprehensive ceasefire plan that the US has promoted for months, but which Hamas rejected.Then, in a departure from his usual talking points on the subject, Blinken said the US was also ""looking at new frameworks of formulations and possibility"".Though Blinken did not provide details, a senior US official said he was referring to the possibility that Israel might be willing to pause its Gaza offensive briefly in return for a small number of hostages. According to Israeli officials, Israel has recently discussed with Egypt the possibility of a shorter ceasefire - lasting roughly a week and a half - in exchange for the release of some of the 101 hostages in Gaza, many of whom are presumed dead. That would be a departure from the plan that's been on the table for months, which laid out a path to free all the hostages in exchange for the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners and an Israeli commitment to end the war.US officials are hoping to test whether Hamas is more open to negotiations following the death of its chief, Yahya Sinwar , whom Blinken called ""the primary obstacle"".",US secretary of state Antony Blinken says he discussed new options in a Tuesday meeting with the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

The lawsuit also points out that USCIS charges a fee for each verification submitted to the SAVE system, which is expected to more than double over the next three years.The filing highlights the paradox in federal law, which prohibits non-citizens from voting while simultaneously preventing states from requiring proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. Paxton's lawsuit also mentions the Senate's failure to pass the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (""SAVE Act""), which would allow states to ensure that votes are being cast legally by eligible voters.In response to the lawsuit, a DHS spokesperson reiterated the use of the SAVE program for verifying citizenship or immigration status but declined to comment on the pending litigation. The spokesperson stated that USCIS has engaged with Texas and will continue to correspond through official channels.Election-related lawsuits are common in every cycle, with Florida filing a similar lawsuit citing the SAVE program's DHS identifier requirement as an obstacle in verifying the citizenship of individuals on the voter roll. While the outcome of this lawsuit remains to be seen, it is unlikely to significantly impact the presidential contest in Texas, which is expected to remain a Republican stronghold.","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against the Biden-Harris administration, specifically the Department of Homeland Security.

Democratic operative and analyst James Carville said he's certain that Kamala Harris will be the next president and Donald Trump will again lose. His election prediction is not coming from any bias as he argued that the Republican Party has been on a losing streak since Trump took over. ""While I am not one to take part in the political prediction industry — recently ballooned by mysterious crypto investments gambling on a Donald Trump victory — today I am pulling my stool up to the political poker table to throw my chips all in: America, it will all be OK.Ms. Harris will be elected the next president of the United States.

Pollster Silver Nate said going by his gut feeling that Donald Trump would win but Kamala Harris could also spring a surprise.James Carville said he is certain that Kamala Harris will win the election. Explaining his argument, Carville wrote that in 2020 Trump was decisively bucked from the White House. Democrats, on the other hand, have been performing well in special elections since Trump appointees on the Supreme Court helped take away a basic right of American women, he wrote. ""Guess what? Abortion is on the ballot again — for president.""Carville's second argument is money in which Kamala Harris surpassed Donald Trump's campaign. ""Since joining the race, the vice president has raised an eye-boggling $1 billion, and last quarter one of her fund-raising committees reeled in $633 million — dwarfing what Mr. Trump raised with two committees combined. All this cash not only effectively offsets the flow of money funneling in for Mr. Trump from some tech billionaires, but it has also given Ms. Harris the resources she needs to persuade swing voters with ads and to organize on the ground,"" he wrote.Carville's third reason is his gut feeling which he described as 100 per cent emotion reason. ""We are constantly told that America is too divided, too hopelessly stricken by tribalism, to grasp the stakes. That is plain wrong. If the Cheneys and A.O.C. get that the Constitution and our democracy are on the ballot, every true conservative and every true progressive should get it too. A vast majority of Americans are rational, reasonable people of good will.

Democratic circles are growing increasingly concerned that Vice President Harris may be losing ground in the US presidential race against former President Trump .According to a report in Hill, while Democrats still believe Harris has a chance to win, the margins in the seven key battleground states are extremely tight, and any shift or polling error could be decisive.However, recent polling suggests that the race may be moving in Trump's direction, particularly in the last two weeks.The ""blue wall"" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which typically move together in presidential elections, are showing signs of vulnerability for Democrats. Senate races in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now considered toss-ups, according to the Cook Political Report. Harris has been losing ground to Trump in polls, especially in Wisconsin, while doubts among Arab American voters in Michigan are causing concern for Democrats.""Everyone keeps saying, 'It's close.' Yes, it's close, but are things trending our way? No. And no one wants to openly admit that,"" one Democratic strategist told The Hill.""Could we still win? Maybe. Should anyone be even slightly optimistic right now? No,"" he added.Another potential path to victory for Harris involves winning Pennsylvania, losing another blue wall state, but securing North Carolina and Nevada. However, these states, along with Arizona and Georgia, are not firmly in her camp.Despite the discouraging news, some Democrats remain optimistic about Harris's chances, pointing to her robust campaign schedule in the final days of the race. Harris is expected to spend most of her time in battleground states, and her upcoming appearance in Houston to discuss abortion rights is seen as a powerful moment that could resonate with women voters across the country.Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons praised Harris for running ""a spectacular campaign,"" taking risks, and effectively turning Republicans like Cheney into allies. Brad Bannon noted that while the race is a dead heat, ""Harris is more popular than Trump, which means her vote has more growth potential than he does.""However, both campaigns face challenges in the closing days, and the outcome could go either way. A former Obama White House aide summed up the situation: ""It's sort of the opposite of 2016, which was, 'How could this happen?' This feels more like, 'Of course this happened.' … We just don't know which yet.""","Democratic circles are growing increasingly concerned that Vice President Harris may be losing ground in the US presidential race against former President Trump. While Democrats still believe Harris has a chance to win, the margins in the seven key battleground states are extremely tight, and any shift or polling error could be decisive.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114519281,imgsize-996097,width-400,resizemode-4/114519281.jpg"

What is E coli and what are its symptoms?

Amid the deadly E. coli outbreak that killed one person and sickened at least 49 across 10 states, McDonald's said the customers should feel confident ordering from its outlets. The outbreak was linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburgers and a preliminary investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration said fresh onions that were served raw on those were a likely source of contamination.McDonald's said it's been working closely with the regulators and is searching for a new regional supplier for fresh onions. In one-fifth of its restaurants, Quarter Pounders have been removed from menus.The highest number of confirmed cases are reported here. At least 26 people have called ill in Colorado and the death has also been reported from here.Nebraska has nine confirmed cases of E. coli, the second highest.andeach have four confirmed cases of E. coli.each have one confirmed illness linked to E. coli.E. coli is a bacteria harbored in the guts of animals and also found in the environment including water and food. There are many kinds of harmless E. coli, but a few types can make people seriously ill.

ISLAMABAD: A court in Pakistan granted bail to the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in a case pertaining to the illegal sale of state gifts, his party said on Wednesday - a relief for the embattled politician who could see his spouse released from prison for the first time in months.Both Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , are currently in jail on multiple charges including illegally selling gifts worth more than 140 million rupees ($501,000) received during his 2018-2022 premiership from a state treasury known locally known as the "" Toshakhana "".The Islamabad High Court said Bibi was granted post-arrest bail for ""reasons to be recorded later,"" according to an order shared by the media office of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party.The Khans deny the charges and say they are trumped up by the government to victimise the 72-year-old former cricket star, who remains widely popular and whose candidates won the most seats in February's general election.PTI said a surety bond had been submitted for Bibi's release and hoped she would be freed from prison on Wednesday after ""264 days of unlawful incarceration"".Bibi, Khan's third wife, was first arrested in January. She was acquitted on charges of her marriage with Khan violating Islamic injunctions, but quickly arrested again in the state gifts case before she would be released.Khan has faced dozens of cases since he was removed as premier in 2022 and launched a protest movement against a coalition of his rivals led by current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .The Sharif-led government says it does not interfere in the judicial process.Khan's standoff with powerful military generals, who he says back Sharif, has spawned the worst political turmoil in decades in the nation of 241 million people.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, are currently in jail on multiple charges.

Marriage apps in Pakistan challenge traditional 'rishta aunties',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/marriage-apps-in-pakistan-challenge-traditional-rishta-aunties/articleshow/114491653.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: Lexica AI)

In Pakistan, the traditional matchmaking system is facing competition from marriage apps specifically designed for Muslims. These apps are being adopted as an alternative to the longstanding tradition of using "" rishta aunties ,"" or matchmakers, who facilitate arranged marriages .Ezza Nawaz, a textile designer in Lahore, decided to try an app after witnessing a friend's successful marriage through an online introduction .""When I saw my colleague happy after being married to someone she met online... I thought, since we have tried rishta aunties for four or five years, let's try this too,"" she told AFP. Nawaz married Waseem Akhtar just three months after meeting him on an app called Muzz.Traditionally, rishta aunties prepare women and present them to potential suitors' families in Pakistan, where dating is often seen as dishonorable. More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey, with families taking the lead in deciding unions.Despite offering features like the option to blur profile pictures and providing message transcripts to a relative, marriage apps still face stigma, according to an AFP report. They are seen by some as comparable to casual dating apps like Tinder, which is banned in Pakistan.Waseem Akhtar, married to Nawaz, admits to being discreet when discussing their meeting. ""I do not tell people how I met my wife until I am sure that the person would not judge us,"" he said.In Pakistani culture, marriage is viewed as an alliance between families, and choosing a spouse independently is seen as challenging traditional structures. Rida Fatima, who used a rishta auntie, found the advice limiting and invasive. She was told to list ""cooking and cleaning"" as her hobbies instead of her interests like hiking and photography. ""They had the audacity to talk about how I looked, what I did, how much I earned, who my family is, how many brothers I have, and what my future aspirations are. So every little thing is judged,"" she said.Marriage apps continue to rise in popularity, with 1.2 million Pakistanis signing up since the launch of some apps last year, according to an AFP report. Despite this, traditional matchmaking remains strong, reflecting deep-rooted cultural practices . Matchmaker Fauzia Aazam dismisses marriage apps, stating, ""People waste time on these apps. Chatting together all through the night, I just don't like it.""Feminist author Aisha Sarwari points to control issues in the traditional matchmaking process and suggests a balanced approach. ""I would say that we need to find a good middle ground, where the respect is equal on both sides and there is no sense of demeaning a human being just because they look a certain way or they are from a particular race,"" she said.Aneela, a digital media artist, experienced different challenges on marriage apps. She found men lying on profiles and admitted to using fake details herself to avoid being identified. Eventually, she considered returning to arranged marriage options.","More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey.

We have taken a number of initiatives to address the matter and now we are planning for artificial rain in the city.""She, however, did not declare any date for it.The Punjab government , led by Maryam Nawaz, has launched the 'Anti-Smog Squad' to monitor areas affected by smog as this hazardous pollution has caused significant health problems for city residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation, and skin infections.These squads will be educating farmers about alternative methods for residue disposal, the hazards of burning crop residues and promoting the use of super seeders.Smog is a specific phenomenon that arises from a mixture of smoke and fog, occurring when certain polluting microparticles combine with cold, moist air and linger near the ground. This results in reduced visibility and can lead to various health problems.Previously, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had also called for ""climate diplomacy"" with India to mitigate smog impact in the province.She said that stubble burning in Punjab, India also impacts across the border because of air direction and hence both sides should make joint efforts to combat smog.""This issue needs to be taken up with India forthwith,"" she said.""Obstacles to environmental improvement must be removed. Smog causes breathing difficulties and damages eyesight,"" the CM added.Meteorology plays an important role in determining the level of air pollution in north Pakistan, just as it is a major factor in the neighbouring region of northwest India. After the rainy season crop is harvested, farmers from both sides tend to burn stubble adding to the existing causes of pollution caused due to industrial emissions and transport.Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, the Environment Ministry said,""The positive effects of the measures taken to combat smog will become visible in 8 to 10 years. Environmental protection has been included as a subject in the curriculum in the province.”She also urged the farmers to avoid burning the crop residues, as it harms not only the crops but also their children's health.","Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world on Monday with an alarming AQI of 394.

Pakistan Parliament: Pakistan parliament clips powers of judiciary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-clips-powers-of-judiciary/articleshow/114436941.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s parliament clipped the powers of the Supreme Court in the early hours of Monday by empowering the executive through an amendment to the constitution passed with a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the National assembly.With full backing from the powerful military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ’s govt had been attempting since last month to introduce a set of constitutional changes in parliament apparently aimed at granting more powers to the executive in making judicial appointments.The 26th Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2024, passed during a late-night session of parliament, aimed at taking away the SC’s suo motu powers, setting the chief justice of Pakistan’s term at three years, and empowering the PM to appoint the next top judge from among the three most senior SC judges. It states that a 12-member parliamentary committee, comprising eight NA members and four from the Senate, will appoint the chief justice from a panel of the three most senior judges of the top court for a period of three years. The panel will forward the name to the PM who will then send it to the president for appointment.The bill, tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, was approved by the NA with 225 votes, one more than required for a two-thirds majority, after a handful of turncoats from jailed former PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) voted against the party’s policy. In the Senate, the required number for two-thirds was 64 and 65 members voted in favour. Hours later, President Asif Ali Zardari gave formal assent to the new law. Imran’s party, however, abstained from voting.An earlier attempt, in Sept, by the governing PML-N to bulldoze the amendments did not succeed as it failed to win the support of some opposition lawmakers and the legislation could not be tabled despite the two Houses being in session.Sharif’s govt said the constitutional amendment has ensured that parliament will not remain a rubber stamp in future. The current govt’s tensions with the judiciary have been on the rise since controversial nationwide general elections were held in Feb this year.The new legislation, specifically about judicial reforms, was passed just days ahead of the retirement of chief justice Qazi Faez Isa . Khan’s PTI has been accusing Isa of being aligned with govt, an allegation govt has repeatedly rejected.Under the previous law, Justice Isa would have been automatically replaced by the senior puisne judge, currently Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, who has consistently issued verdicts deemed favourable to Khan and PTI.PTI assailed the “conscience” of lawmakers affiliated with it who voted in favour of the amendment. “They won votes on Imran Khan’s name and sold their vote to the same mafia against whom the public gave them the mandate!” the party said on its ‘X’ account, sharing pictures of the said lawmakers and terming them “seditious”.“These conscience-sellers would be counted among the darkest characters in Pakistan’s history,” it added.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan criticised the bill, saying it would make the judiciary “subservient” for all time.",Pakistan's parliament clipped the powers of the Supreme Court in the early hours of Monday by empowering the executive.

The Hindu community in Narowal, numbering over 1,453 people, has since lacked a proper place to conduct their rituals.Narowal district once had 45 Hindu temples, all of which have fallen into disrepair over time.The restoration work is currently focused on constructing a boundary wall around the four kanals of land, after which the temple will be handed over to the Pak Dharamsthan Committee.Hindus represent the largest minority group in Pakistan.

Controversy over the amendments



Row over how Bill was passed

Historical achievement: PM Shehbaz Sharif



Charter of Democracy



In a late-night session that began at 11.36pm on Sunday and extended well past midnight, the Pakistan National Assembly passed at 5am on Monday the highly controversial 26th Constitutional Amendment that critics say effectively neuters the judicial system of the country.In another sign of the desperate hurry, President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the law mere hours after the approval of both houses of parliament.The Constitution (26th Amendment) Act, 2024, was introduced to address perceived issues within the judicial system of Pakistan, particularly focusing on the powers of the Supreme Court and the appointment of its Chief Justice.While proponents argue that these reforms are necessary for improving judicial efficiency and accountability, opponents contend that they threaten judicial independence and may pave the way for increased political interference in legal matters.The timing and nature of this amendment have raised suspicions about political motivations behind it.Critics argue that this move is an attempt by the ruling coalition led byShehbaz Sharif to exert control over an independent judiciary, particularly in light of ongoing tensions with former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).The PTI has vehemently opposed these changes, viewing them as a direct threat to judicial independence and an effort to undermine checks and balances within government institutions.Many legal experts and political analysts have expressed concern that limiting the CJP's tenure could lead to politicisation within the judiciary. By establishing a commission that includes political appointees, there are fears that judicial appointments may become more susceptible to political influence rather than being based solely on merit and legal expertise.The legal community has also voiced strong opposition against these amendments, stating that the changes could lead to a judiciary that is less willing to challenge government actions or uphold constitutional rights if they are perceived as beholden to political interests.There are serious allegations of coercion surrounding the passage of the 26th Constitutional Amendment.Local media reports suggested that members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) faced intimidation tactics, including threats of abduction, to ensure their support for the Bill. PTI leaders have claimed that their lawmakers were pressured into voting in favor of the amendment or faced consequences for non-compliance.The process leading up to the amendment has also been criticised for its lack of transparency and consensus among political parties. While some coalition members gave broad support for the amendment, others, particularly from PTI, expressed their refusal to participate in what they describe as a coerced vote.The hurried nature of this legislative process has raised questions about whether adequate deliberation occurred among lawmakers regarding such significant constitutional changes.The government required 224 votes to pass the Bill. As voting commenced under the chairmanship of NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, 225 members of the National Assembly supported the motion, while 12 members from the PTI and the Sunni-Ittehad Council (SIC) opposed it.The Bill comprised 27 clauses. After the passage of the first clause, the PTI members walked out of the assembly.Following the passage of the bill, PM Shehbaz Sharif delivered a speech and congratulated the parliament for the ""historical achievement"", said a report by Dawn.""This amendment, the 26th, is not just an amendment, but an example of national solidarity and consensus.

This is a political success, and I wish you wouldn't have portrayed your own victory as a loss.""PTI's Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, took over the floor of the NA and criticised the amendments, arguing that they did not reflect the will of the Pakistani people.Taking a jab at law minister Tarar and Bilawal, he said that those who had ""gone missing"" should have been thanked as well during the note of thanks. Ayub detailed how PTI lawmakers were ""tortured and harassed"".""These were all tactics to pressure us. The mistreatment of Imran Khan in jail is also an example,"" he said.Ayub also questioned the urgency behind passing the amendments, asking: ""What would have happened had it been passed on October 31?""He also said that the amendments were an attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary.Meanwhile, Defence minister Khawaja Asif said the amendment had been passed by the Senate ""to restore respect and dignity of the parliament and the House"". ""There must be consistency in our political behaviour otherwise we will not get the respect and dignity we seek,"" he said.As per the report by Dawn, Asif went on to say that the constitutional amendments were not something that the government had ""newly invented"" but it was a continuation of the Charter of Democracy that all political leaders, including Imran, had unanimously signed.The Charter of Democracy was signed in London on May 14, 2006, by major political parties in response to the military dictatorship of General Pervez Musharraf, with the aim of promoting democratic norms and preventing the abuse of power by unelected institutions such as the military and judiciary.",The amendment limits the tenure of the Chief Justice of Pakistan to three years. A new 12-member commission has been established to appoint the CJP. The amendment seeks to dilute the Supreme Court's suo motu powers. A performance evaluation system for judges is introduced to enhance accountability and efficiency within the judiciary.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114423400,imgsize-925818,width-400,resizemode-4/114423400.jpg"

HYDERABAD: In a public rally on Friday, leading Pakistpolitician Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari warned that if political parties in parliament do not reach a consensus on the 26th constitutional amendment , he will push the amendment through parliament using a brute, or two-thirds majority, Dawn reported. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party which is led by his father Asif Ali Zardari who is the President of Pakistan.Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ) is in coalition with PM Shehbaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N). These two parties along with Fazlur Rehman's Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) have come together to implement the 26th constitutional amendment in Pakistan's constitution.While addressing a PPP rally in Pakistan's Hyderabad city to mark the anniversary of the attack on his mother's homecoming parade in 2007, Bilawal Bhutto said, ""It is my desire to have consensus among all political parties in parliament for this amendment. The second option, which is not my preferred path, is to rely on the majority's vote to pass it,"" Dawn noted.He urged political parties to consider the future and work towards raising the dignity of parliament, adding that they operate within a certain ""political space"".Bhutto noted that while the PPP was unable to establish a constitutional court during its 2008-2013 government, he is committed to fulfilling the promise made by Benazir Bhutto.He acknowledged opposition to the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), particularly fromPTI leaders, but insisted that the new court would ensure equal representation for all provinces.PTI has been protesting across Pakistan against the implementation of the constitutional amendments as the Party alleges that the bill would undermine the powers of judiciary.PTI leaders have also alleged that bribes up to Rs 1 Billion are being offered to lawmakers to garner support for passing the amendment law.In the public rally, Bilawal Bhutto gave out historical justifications for implementation of the 26th amendment saying that even Muhammad Ali Jinnah had called for a separate court for routine justice matters at the 1930 Round Table Conference.The FCC, Bhutto claimed, would protect the rights of provinces by providing equal representation and addressing disputes between the federation and provinces.As per Dawn, Bhutto insisted that his mother and former Pakistan PM Benazir Bhutto had supported the establishment of the FCC because she understood the ""real face"" of the judiciary, which he said had repeatedly legitimised dictatorial rule.""After abolishing the 'One Unit' system in the country through parliament, my mother wanted to eliminate the concept of 'One Unit' in the judiciary as well,"" he added.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party.
