Voters swing to labour in English local elections: Key takeaways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/voters-swing-to-labour-in-english-local-elections-key-takeaways/articleshow/109830470.cms,"The Conservatives could be in serious trouble.

Labour's 'red wall' is returning to the fold

The election showed how Reform UK may siphon votes from the Conservatives

New voting regulations went well. (Just not for Johnson.)

While the votes in local elections in England and Wales were still being counted Friday, a picture has begun to emerge of significant losses for the governing Conservative Party .The voting Thursday to elect councilors, mayors and police commissioners in local elections, seen as a last test of public opinion before a general election expected later this year, portends a difficult road ahead for the party.Here are four takeaways.Leading up to the local elections, the question was not whether the Conservatives would suffer, but just how bad the blow might be. The party has trailed Labour, the main opposition party, in opinion polls for some time, after a series of scandals, the implosion of Boris Johnson 's administration and the embarrassment of the 45-day prime ministership of Liz Truss, leading many Britons to look elsewhere for leadership.By midday Friday, the early results suggested that the party might have fared even more poorly than its leaders had feared. When all is said and done, some analysts think the Conservatives could lose as many as 500 council seats, a signal of serious trouble ahead for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's beleaguered Conservative Party.About one-third of England's council seats were contested, along with 11 mayoral seats in major English metro areas. Although these elections were about local leadership, the results of Thursday's vote serve as an important barometer of overall public opinion, and ultimately a test of whether the Conservative Party can retain power in a general election expected this fall.Labour won control of a number of key councils, including Hartlepool, Thurrock, Rushmoor and Redditch, all of which were seen as battleground races that could gauge broader public sentiment.However, the Conservatives had some notable wins to cling to, including the Tees Valley mayoral race, where incumbent Ben Houchen received the majority of the vote, albeit with a much smaller percentage than in his last election.The election made clear that the opposition Labour Party was succeeding in winning back its longtime supporters in the working-class areas of northern England -- often called the ""red wall"" for their entrenched support for Labour, whose party color is red -- who had defected over Brexit and immigration.After Labour won control of the council in Hartlepool, a party representative said, ""Making gains here shows that the party is on track to win a general election and is firmly back in the service of working people.""In Blackpool South, a deprived seaside district, the Labour Party easily took a parliamentary by-election held Thursday after a Conservative lawmaker stepped down. The seat had long been held by Labour, but it was won by the Conservatives in 2019.Keir Starmer , the Labour Party leader, said the win was a message sent directly by the public to Sunak ""to say we're fed up with your decline, your chaos, your division, and we want change.""But Labour also faced some pushback, possibly as an effect of its staunch support for Israel in the war in the Gaza Strip and a delay in calling for a cease-fire, that could dampen the party's gains in some northern places, a senior Labour figure, Pat McFadden, acknowledged to Sky News. Notably, the party lost control of the Oldham Council, where a large Muslim population seemed to shift its votes to independent candidates, he added.Reform UK, a right-wing party founded by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, ran relatively few candidates in the elections. But their performance in some key races suggested that they could have a major effect on the general election.In the Blackpool South election, which was overwhelmingly won by the Labour candidate, Chris Webb, Reform UK received nearly as many votes as the Conservatives, with a margin of just 117 votes between the two (3,218 to 3,101.)The results seemingly confirmed opinion polls that put the party third behind Labour and the Tories, underscoring the threat it could pose to the Conservatives in the upcoming general election.Thursday's vote was the first test of new voting regulations stemming from the Elections Act of 2022, and election monitors said the process went smoothly, with some notable exceptions.The vote marked the first time in England that every voter needed to show photo identification, and Johnson, the former prime minister, was reportedly turned away from his polling place after arriving without it, according to Sky News. He later returned with the necessary identification and voted.Some veterans complained that they were unable to use veteran's identification cards to vote, as they were not an approved form of photo identification. Johnny Mercer, the minister of veterans' affairs, said in a post on the social media platform X that he was sorry it had become an issue. He vowed that the cards would be accepted in the next election.But Britain's Electoral Commission, the independent body that oversees the election, said in a statement that ""most voters who wanted to vote were able to do so,"" and that it would ""identify any potential obstacles to participation.""","Local elections in England and Wales were held Thursday.

"US protests on wane after crackdowns, Biden rebuke",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-protests-on-wane-after-crackdowns-biden-rebuke/articleshow/109829416.cms,"New York: Pro-Palestinian protests that have rocked US campuses for weeks were more muted Friday after a series of clashes with police, mass arrests and a stern White House directive to restore order. Police in Manhattan cleared an encampment at New York University after sunrise, with video posted to social media by an official showing protesters exiting their tents and dispersing when ordered by loudspeaker.The scene appeared relatively calm compared to crackdowns at other campuses in the country.University administrators, who have tried to balance the right to protest and complaints of violence and hate speech, have increasingly called on police to clear out the protesters ahead of year-end exams and graduation ceremonies - and some clashes with counter-protesters.More than 2,000 arrests have been made in the past two weeks across the US, some during violent confrontations with police, giving rise to accusations of over-use of force. President Joe Biden gave his first expansive remarks on the protests Thursday, saying that ""order must prevail"". ""We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent. But neither are we a lawless country. We're a civil society, and order must prevail,"" Biden said.His remarks came hours after police moved in on demonstrators at UCLA, which had seen a violent confrontation when counter-protesters attacked a fortified encampment there.On the east coast, protesters at New Jersey's Rutgers University agreed to take down their camp after reaching a compromise with administrators, similar to deal at other institutions, including Brown University. afp","Pro-Palestinian protests that have rocked US campuses for weeks were more muted Friday.

Israeli officials weigh sharing power with Arab states in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-officials-weigh-sharing-power-with-arab-states-in-gaza/articleshow/109829376.cms,"For months, PM Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has avoided detailed public discussion about Gaza's post-war future. Trying to placate both his far-right allies, who seek to rebuild Israeli settlements in Gaza, and Israel's foreign partners, who want Gaza returned to Palestinian governance, Netanyahu has stopped short of any specific declaration.Behind the scenes, however, senior officials in his office have been weighing an expansive plan for post-war Gaza, in which Israel would offer to share oversight of the territory with an alliance of Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as the US, according to three Israeli officials and five people who discussed the plan with members of the Israeli govt.According to that proposal, Israel would do so in exchange for normalised relations between itself and Saudi Arabia, according to the people.Far-right members of Netanyahu's coalition are almost certain to dismiss such an idea, and so are the Arab countries mentioned as possible participants. But it is the clearest sign yet that officials of Israel's govt are thinking about Gaza's future, and could be a starting point in future negotiations.Arab officials and analysts have called the power-sharing plan unworkable because it does not create an explicit path toward a Palestinian state, which the Emirati and Saudi govts have said is a prerequisite for their involvement in post-war planning. But others have cautiously welcomed the proposal as it at least suggests greater flexibility among Israeli leaders than their public statements suggest.Under the proposal, the Arab-Israeli alliance, working with the US, would appoint Gazan leaders to redevelop the devastated territory, overhaul its education system and maintain order. After 7-10 years, the alliance would allow Gazans to vote on whether to be absorbed into a united Palestinian administration that would govern in both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to the proposal. In the meantime, the plan suggests, the Israeli military could continue to operate inside Gaza. nyt","Senior officials in Netanyahu's office have been weighing an expansive plan for post-war Gaza.

"Pro-Palestinian Encampments Spread To Campuses In Canada, Aus, UK & France",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/pro-palestinian-encampments-spread-to-campuses-in-canada-aus-uk-france/articleshow/109829306.cms,"Pro-Palestinian students at one of France's most elite universities, Sciences Po, occupied a campus building overnight. Like-minded protestors at University College London set up an encampment. And tents with Palestinian flags stretched out this week across campuses in Australia. The tensions gripping universities in the US appear to be spreading to other countries, where students have challenged their schools' stances on war in Gaza and ties to Israel.Demonstrators at universities in France have put pressure on administrators to more forcefully condemn Israel's military offence in Gaza and review partnerships with Israeli universities and private donors. Police officers went into Sciences Po Friday to clear out a group of pro-Palestinian protesters who had occupied a campus building and refused to leave until their demands were met, according to a statement from the university. The intervention came after a town hall debate about the war at the university failed to defuse tensions.The university said students had breached an agreement not to disrupt classes and exams, and that it had made the ""difficult decision"" to involve police after multiple attempts at dialogue failed. Live video on Instagram showed students chanting, ""We ask for justice! We get the police!"" as officers pulled them out.In Britain, small encampments have begun to spring up at universities in Bristol, Newcastle and Warwick. And a coalition of students and staff at University College London put up tents on the campus grounds on Thursday to pressure the school to divest from companies complicit in what they called ""the genocide of Palestinians,"" among other demands.A union representing students at Trinity College Dublin said the university had fined it more than 214,000 euros, about $230,000, for losses incurred because of disruptive protests since last Sept, rising student fees and other issues. The university, a non-profit, cited the ""negative financial impact"" of protests blocking visitor access to the Book of Kells, a Medieval religious manuscript held at the university. Laszlo Molnarfi, president of the students' union at Trinity College, said the union could not afford the fine. He called it an attempt at intimidation, adding that the protests would continue. ""We will be escalating,"" he said.In Australia, encampments have come up at major universities in Adelaide, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. These protests have grown more tense as pro-Israel demonstrators have gathered nearby. University administrators have said they support students' right to protest, while warning them to abide by school policies.In Canada, encampments have sprung up in some of the country's largest universities, including universities of Toronto, British Columbia and Ottawa. Organisers at University of Toronto said the encampment will stay until the university discloses its investments, divests from any that ""sustain Israeli apartheid, occupation and illegal settlement of Palestine"" and ends partnerships with some Israeli academic institutions. At Montreal's McGill University, the administration requested police intervention to dismantle camps, but law enforcement instead said it was monitoring the situation.","Pro-Palestinian students at one of France's most elite universities, Sciences Po, occupied a campus building overnight.

"In a first, an orangutan is seen using medicinal plant to treat a wound",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/in-a-first-an-orangutan-is-seen-using-medicinal-plant-to-treat-a-wound/articleshow/109829227.cms,"Scientists observed a wild male orangutan repeatedly rubbing chewed-up leaves of a medicinal plant on a facial wound in a forest reserve in Indonesia.It’s the first known observation of a wild animal using a plant to treat a wound, and adds to evidence that humans are not alone in using plants for medicinal purposes.The male orangutan, Rakus , lives in Gunung Leuser National Park on the island of Sumatra and is thought to be around 35 years old.For years researchers have followed orangutans like him on his travels through the forest, threading his way through the canopy in search of fruits to eat.Scientists first noticed a wound on Rakus’ face on June 25, 2022, when they saw his self-medication behaviour begin.“Once I heard about it, I got extremely excited,” said Isabelle Laumer, a primatologist with Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour in Germany, in part because records of animals medicating themselves are rare — even more so when it comes to treating injuries. She and colleagues detailed the discovery in a study published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.The plant Rakus used, known as akar kuning or yellow root, is used by people throughout Southeast Asia to treat malaria, diabetes and other conditions. Research shows it has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.Orangutans rarely eat the plant. But in this case, Rakus ingested a small amount and also coated the wound several times. Five days after the wound was noticed, it had closed, and less than a month later “healed without any signs of infection,” Dr Laumer said.Primates have been observed appearing to treat wounds in the past, but not with plants. A group of more than two dozen chimpanzees in Gabon in Central Africa have been seen chewing up and applying flying insects to their wounds, said Simone Pika, an expert on animal cognition at Osnabruck University in Germany who documented that observation.Orangutans have been spotted using medicinal plants in a different way: In 2017, six orangutans in Borneo rubbed chewed-up leaves of a shrub with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties onto their legs and arms, probably to soothe sore muscles.Dr Laumer hopes the study of Rakus will help create more appreciation — and desire to protect — the Sumatran orangutan, a critically endangered species. “There are so many things we still don’t know about these apes,” she said.","The male orangutan, Rakus, lives in Gunung Leuser National Park on the island of Sumatra.

"Pro-Palestine protests: Fresh stir in US college campuses, over 2,300 arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pro-palestine-protests-fresh-stir-in-us-college-campuses-over-2000-arrested/articleshow/109801954.cms,"NEW DELHI: Police ordered pro-Palestinian protesters to abandon a tent encampment at New York University early Friday, following weeks of demonstrations and police crackdowns at college campuses nationwide that have resulted in more than 2,300 arrests.About a dozen protesters who refused police orders to leave were arrested and about 30 more left voluntarily, according to NYU spokesperson John Beckman.The school asked the New York Police Department to intervene “to minimize the likelihood of injury"" and disruption, Beckman said.Classes will proceed as scheduled on Friday, he said. A larger NYU encampment was dismantled on April 22, when more than 130 protesters were arrested.The protests and arrests have taken place in nearly every part of the country, but in the last 24 hours, the University of California, Los Angeles has been the center of attention, where tumultuous scenes unfolded early Thursday as officers in riot gear clashed with protesters.At UCLA, hundreds of demonstrators refused to comply with orders to disperse, with some creating human chains as police used flash-bangs to disperse the crowds.Later on Thursday morning, workers cleared the protesters' fortified encampment, removing barricades and using bulldozers to collect trash and tents. Some buildings were covered with graffiti.The protests began at Columbia University on April 17, with students demanding an end to the Israel-Hamas conflict, which has claimed the lives of more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the health ministry there. Israel initiated its offensive in Gaza after Hamas militants killed approximately 1,200 people, primarily civilians, and took around 250 hostages in an attack on southern Israel on Oct 7.UCLA Chancellor Gene Block stated on Thursday that the encampment had become ""a focal point for serious violence as well as a huge disruption,"" endangering people on campus, preventing students from attending classes, forcing building closures, and leading to class cancellations.California Highway Patrol officers arrived at the UCLA campus in large numbers early Thursday, wearing protective gear and using batons to separate themselves from protesters, who were equipped with helmets and gas masks and chanted, ""You want peace. We want justice.""Officers warned protesters for hours that they would be arrested if they did not disperse, and there were scuffles and shoving between protesters and police. Police helicopters circled overhead, and the sound of flash-bangs filled the air. As arrests were made, police removed protesters' helmets and goggles.The law enforcement response and ongoing warnings contrasted with the events of Tuesday night, when counter-demonstrators attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, throwing objects, using pepper spray, and tearing down barriers. The fighting continued for hours before police intervened, resulting in no arrests but at least 15 injured protesters. The lukewarm response from authorities drew criticism from various groups and leaders.By Wednesday afternoon, a small city sprang up inside the reenforced encampment, with hundreds of people and tents on the quad. Demonstrators rebuilt the makeshift barriers around their tents while state and campus police watched.Some protesters said Muslim prayers as the sun set, while others chanted “we’re not leaving” or passed out goggles and surgical masks. They wore helmets and headscarves, and discussed the best ways to handle pepper spray or tear gas.Israel has branded the protests antisemitic, while Israel’s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers — some of whom are Jewish — call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war.US President Joe Biden on Thursday defended the students’ right to peaceful protest but decried the disorder of recent days.Meanwhile, a Police officer fired the gun while clearing protesters from Columbia University administration building earlier this week.More than 100 protesters were taken into custody during Columbia's crackdown on Tuesday. They are part of more than 2,000 people who have been arrested during pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses across the United States in recent weeks.Columbia's demonstrators had seized Hamilton Hall early on Tuesday, ramping up their presence on the campus from a tent encampment that had been there since April 17. The encampment was one of the earliest on college campuses.Despite more than 100 arrests on April 18 and the clearing of the tents, the protesters defied threats of suspension to return to the encampment.

He said that companies like his will be ""eager"" to hire them, drawing a contrast to other executives who have suggested that involvement in such protests could hinder employability.In his post on X (formerly Twitter), Dudum emphasized the importance of moral courage over a college degree, writing, ""If you’re currently protesting against the genocide of the Palestinian people & for your university’s divestment from Israel, keep going.It’s working."" He further added, ""There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline,"" and included a link to the Hims careers page.Dudum's post received a critical response from Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir Technologies and current founder and managing partner of 8VC, an early-stage venture capital firm. Lonsdale argued that ""Real moral courage doesn't involve joining a mindless mob, chanting anti-US and other woke pablum, following instructions not to debate or discuss your positions at all yet being indignantly righteous, while large numbers in the mob chant for violence and block Jewish students.""In recent days, students across numerous campuses in the United States have gathered or established encampments to protest against Israel's ongoing conflict in Gaza, which has now entered its seventh month. Demonstrators are urging President Joe Biden, who has voiced support for Israel's right to self-defense, to take stronger action to halt the violence in Gaza. They are also demanding that schools divest from companies backing Israel's government.Several institutions, including the prestigious Ivy League Columbia University in New York City, have responded to the protests by deploying police forces to suppress the demonstrations.According to a statement released by the Gaza health ministry on Friday, Israel's military offensive on Gaza, which began on Oct. 7, has resulted in the death of at least 34,622 Palestinians and the injury of 77,867 others.","Andrew Dudum, founder and CEO of Hims, took to social media to encourage anti- Israel protesters on college campuses to persist in their efforts.

Amazon and Google suspend US green card applications for immigrants amid tech layoffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/amazon-and-google-suspend-us-green-card-applications-for-immigrants-amid-tech-layoffs/articleshow/109815272.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amazon and Google have halted US green card applications for immigrants for the year 2024, a decision made against the backdrop of recent tech industry layoffs , including those at Microsoft. The intensifying competition is making conditions increasingly challenging for foreign workers, the Daily Guardian reported.The suspension of the green card application process may exacerbate the difficulties faced by overseas candidates seeking employment in the US, particularly within the tech sector.Both Amazon and Google have paused PERM applications until the following year.PERM, administered by the US Department of Labor, is a procedure aimed at securing permanent labor certification. Its primary objective is to safeguard job opportunities, wages, and working conditions for American workers while admitting foreign workers. Often, PERM serves as the initial stage in the green card acquisition process.Amazon made an internal announcement earlier this year stating its decision to halt all PERM filings through 2024 due to operational constraints. Google similarly suspended its PERM applications in January 2023, coinciding with the layoff of 12,000 employees. Employees were informed that the PERM process would not resume until the first quarter of 2025.Ava Benach, founding partner of Benach Collopy, a distinguished immigration law firm in Washington DC, commented that tech companies are following Google's strategy due to its significant influence in the industry.Collopy said that, “With more US workers available for open positions, the labor market test fails and so the process becomes a waste of time and money for these tech companies.” Collopy explained.“If tech companies have done layoffs relatively recently, they also have to notify laid off workers of new positions that may be going to foreign workers. If some of these people say ‘yes, I’m interested,’ then you’re out of luck with the green card application,” she added, according to the Daily Guardian.","Both Amazon and Google have paused PERM applications until the following year.

Biden expands health insurance access for DACA immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-expands-health-insurance-access-for-daca-immigrants/articleshow/109812287.cms,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden 's administration will allow certain immigrants illegally brought to the US as children greater access to federally run health insurance , the White House said on Friday, addressing a sensitive issue ahead of elections in November.With the move, an estimated 100,000 previously uninsured participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, are expected to enroll in the Health Insurance Marketplace and Basic Health Program, both created under the Affordable Care Act, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said.The DACA program was launched in 2012 under former President Barack Obama, to whom Biden was vice president. The program offers deportation relief and work permits to so-called ""Dreamer"" immigrants who were illegally brought to the US as children or overstayed a visa."" Dreamers are our loved ones, our nurses, teachers, and small business owners,"" Biden said in a statement. ""And they deserve the promise of health care just like all of us.""DACA enrollees will have access to related financial assistance, such as tax credits and reduced out-of-pocket costs under the change, which will be effective Nov. 1, according to a White House fact sheet.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about any costs to the US government.Immigration has emerged as a top issue for voters ahead of the US presidential election in November pitting Biden, a Democrat, against Republican former President Donald Trump. Biden has sought to balance a tougher approach to border security with policies that protect asylum seekers and others in the US illegally.Trump, an immigration hardliner, tried to end DACA during his presidency but was denied by the US Supreme Court. About 530,000 people are currently enrolled in the program, which remains subject to an ongoing legal fight.HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said on Thursday that people without health care insurance delay preventative or routine medical care, leading to unnecessary costs later.The regulation will give DACA participants access to the Basic Health Program, which serves low-income residents, according to a White House fact sheet.The change will not open access to two other low-income programs, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, as was initially proposed in 2023.","US President Joe Biden's administration will allow certain immigrants greater access to federally run health insurance.

Heavy rains near Houston close schools and flood roadways as officials urge residents to evacuate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/heavy-rains-near-houston-close-schools-and-flood-roadways-as-officials-urge-residents-to-evacuate/articleshow/109804231.cms,"Mandatory evacuation orders were issued near Houston on Thursday for some residents following heavy rains in Texas that stranded motorists, flooded streets and closed schools as officials warned that conditions in some hard-hit areas could worsen.""This is a life-threatening situation,"" said Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top elected official in the nation's third-largest county.Storms over the past month in southeast Texas and parts of Louisiana have dumped more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service. Of particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to keep rising as more rain falls and officials release extra water from an already full reservoir.Videos posted to social media showed tractor-trailers partially submerged and water flooding over roadways. More than a dozen school districts north of Houston canceled classes Friday because of the weather and shelters opened in some communities.No injuries or death were immediately reported from the flooding. At least nine people were rescued from rising water, the Houston mayor's office said.Officials ordered an evacuation of people in an area along the river in northern Harris County, where Houston is located. It was unclear how many residents were under evacuation orders.""We want you out of this area,"" Hidalgo said at a news conference Thursday.Farther north in Montgomery County, officials issued a voluntary evacuation order and said roads were closed because of flooding along the river. The area got about 5 to 8 inches (13 to 20 centimeters) of rain within 24 hours, with some spots getting as much as 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain, said National Weather Service meteorologist Hayley Adams.The storm brought down trees and left vehicles stranded. It prompted the San Jacinto River Authority to close Lake Conroe and increase water releases from the dam that created the reservoir.Officials asked that residents farther south along the river leave or prepare to be stranded by rising water for two to three days, Harris said.The San Jacinto River is normally 45 to 50 feet (13.72 to 15.24 meters) above sea level, but is expected to reach 78 feet (23.77 meters), Hidalgo said.The county opened three shelters for displaced residents, with a fourth planned.Dawn O'Leary, a resident of Cleveland, about 45 miles (72.42 kilometers) northeast of Houston, was caught off guard by the rising floodwaters. ""I was trying to get to work,"" she said, but the roads were so bad that she could not make it.Emergency management officials said the area could see flooding similar to that caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda, which dumped more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) in some locations in 2019.","More than a dozen school districts north of Houston cancel classes Friday.

A tornado hit an Oklahoma newsroom built in the 1920s. The damage isn't stopping the presses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-tornado-hit-an-oklahoma-newsroom-built-in-the-1920s-the-damage-isnt-stopping-the-presses/articleshow/109805263.cms,"SULPHUR: When Oklahoma and national officials held a press conference Monday to discuss the scale of devastation following tornadoes two days earlier, Kathy John did what she always does: She showed up to report on it for the town's weekly newspaper, the Sulphur Times-Democrat.But before she could write her story, John had to help her staff salvage computers from the newsroom , which was at the center of the path of destruction on April 28.""We're gonna get a paper out. It may be a day late, but we're gonna get a paper out,"" John said from in front of the brick building built in 1926 that houses the newsroom.Sulphur suffered Oklahoma's worst destruction during an outreak of severe weather when a tornado plowed through downtown in the community of about 5,000 residents south of Oklahoma City. Four people were killed across the state, including a woman who was in a bar near the newspaper's offices.Kathy John's husband, James John, joined the staff in 1968, after his father ran it for 27 years. Together, the pair have been covering Sulphur, the county seat, for more than 50 years.In the 83 years their family has owned the paper, it has never missed a printing, Kathy John said. It has come close before.There was the time about 20 years ago when an overnight freeze followed torrential rains that caused trees and power lines to snap in two. Some residents were without power for weeks, but running on a generator, the newsroom of the Sulphur Times Democrat continued to churn.But this week has tested the paper's staff of three.""I've been trying to write a headline all day, but you just can't put into words what happened,"" James John said, looking at the paper's layout on a computer on his kitchen table.Their newsroom downtown is without power, so the Oklahoma Press Association delivered a wifi hotspot and other equipment to help the staff put out the paper from the John's home a few blocks away, where they rode out the storm and thankfully took no damage.The newsroom was built in 1926, the same year the newspaper started printing, and they're likely the original tenants, although no one can say for certain. The building was once a fallout shelter and might be one of the few buildings that will survive. But they worry the town may condemn the structure and raze it with the rest of downtown, James John said.Several buildings have completely crumpled. Others show the strange precision of tornadic winds, like a shop that is missing its front wall while the clothing inside remains neatly folded or hanging on a rack.Not far from the newsroom, a sports grill was flattened underneath its roof. One resident, Sheila Hilliard Goodman, died there Saturday night while sheltering from the tornado.Brick, wood and metal rubble has been pushed to the curbs and maintenance trucks line most of the downtown's modest five blocks, where disaster relief workers attend to downed power lines or sweep debris from the few remaining rooftops. Business owners and their families salvage what they can by loading truck beds and trailers.Some of the buildings in Sulphur's downtown predate statehood in 1907, and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The town is built on tourism for Chickasaw National Recreation Area, a nearly 10,000-acre (4,046.86-hectare) park across the street with natural springs that travelers once believed had medicinal qualities.Visitors often compare the smell of the sulfurous water in the springs to rotten eggs. But on Monday, the rich smell of leather hung in the air, wafting down the block through the busted windows of Billy Cook Harness & Saddle.Sulphur is crawling with reporters from all over the state and country, so the newspaper staff decided they could serve their community best by writing about its strength and resiliency.""This week we're trying to focus on all the people here helping and the helpers and how blessed we are that we only had one fatality,"" Kathy John said. ""I just think it's the most integral thing to do.""By Tuesday, the Johns had decided to publish the newspaper on Thursday, one day later than usual. The paper is printed in a nearby town that wasn't hit by the tornado.It had been a tough few days and their heads were still spinning while trying to keep up with the location of the next FEMA press conference or whether the city would let them back into their building to retrieve their archives.As the recovery continued around them, James John was still working on writing that headline.""It was a treasure,"" he said of the old downtown, thinking perhaps that was the angle. ""Something along that line, you know: 'Treasure Lost.'""","Sulphur suffered Oklahoma's worst destruction during an outreak of severe weather. Four people were killed across the state, including a woman who was in a bar near the newspaper's offices.

Federal judge Amit Mehta, whose decision is not expected until later in the year, raised his questions during two days of hearings that come six months after the conclusion of testimony.The case is the first of five major lawsuits by the US govt to reach trial, with Meta, Amazon, Apple and a separate case against Google also heading for federal court.The trial is the first time the US department of justice ( DoJ ) has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system. At the heart of the govt’s case is the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other firms to keep its search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products. In 2022, Google paid Apple $20 billion for the default status, documents unsealed this week showed.DoJ lawyers allege that Google achieved and perpetuated its dominance through these default deals that also expanded to Samsung and other device makers. But Mehta expressed doubts that the case had sufficiently demonstrated the negative consequences necessary to deem the deals anti-competitive according to US law and precedent. Mehta also said the Google case was very different from Microsoft’s as it did not involve agreements to outright exclude competing browsers and other products.He also poked holes in Google’s defence, wondering how any rival search engine could win access to default deals if the cost would require tens of billions of dollars.","The case is the first of five major lawsuits by the US govt to reach trial.

White House

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden has called Japan and India “xenophobic” countries that do not welcome immigrants , lumping the two with adversaries China and Russia as he tried to explain their economic circumstances and contrasted the four with the US on immigration .The US President made the controversial remark at a campaign fundraising event Wednesday evening.There was no immediate reaction from either the Japanese or Indian governments.Biden’s Xenophobia remark came just three weeks after the White House hosted Japanese PM Fumio Kishida for a lavish official visit, during which the two leaders celebrated what Biden called an “unbreakable alliance ,” particularly on global security matters. Japan is a critical US ally.The White House welcomed PM Narendra Modi for a state visit last summer. And India is a vital partner in the Indo-Pacific despite differences on human rights.At a hotel fundraiser where the donor audience was largely Asian-American, Biden said the upcoming US election was about “freedom, America and democracy” and that the nation’s economy was thriving “because of you and many others”. “Why? Because we welcome immigrants,” Biden said. “Look, think about it. Why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is Japan having trouble? Why is Russia? Why is India? Because they’re xenophobic. They don’t want immigrants.” The president added: “Immigrants are what makes us strong. Not a joke. That’s not hyperbole, because we have an influx of workers who want to be here and want to contribute.”White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Biden was making a broader point about the US posture on immigration. “Our allies and partners know well in tangible ways how Prez Biden values them, their friendship, their cooperation and the capabilities that they bring across the spectrum on a range of issues, not just security related,” Kirby said Thursday when asked about Biden’s “xenophobic” remarks. White House press secretary, Karine Jean Pierre, said, “The broader case that he was trying to make, which most leaders and allies across the globe understand that when it comes to who we are as a nation, we are a nation of immigrants. That is in our DNA. You have heard the prez say it, it makes us better, and we are stronger for it and that is a very important point to know.”",The US President made the controversial remark at a campaign fundraising event Wednesday evening.

"Russia using chemical weapons in Ukraine, says US; Kremlin denies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russia-using-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine-says-us-kremlin-denies/articleshow/109799225.cms,"The US has accused Russia of using chemical weapons , including poison gas, “as a method of warfare” against Ukrainian forces, in violation of a global ban on the use of such weapons.The state department said in a statement on Wednesday that Russia had used chloropicrin , a “choking agent” widely used during World War I, as well as tear gas , against Ukrainian troops.The use of these gases in warfare is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, an arms control treaty ratified by more than 150 countries, including Russia. “The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident and is probably driven by Russian forces’ desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,” the state department said.The state department also said that the US would impose sanctions on three state entities linked to Russia’s chemical and biological weapons programmes and four companies that support them.Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the US, called the accusations that Russian forces had used chemical weapons “odious and unsubstantiated” in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow remained bound by its obligations under the treaty that bans chemical weapons. “As always, such announcements are absolutely unfounded... Russia has been and remains committed to its obligations under international law in this area,” he said.The Ukrainian authorities have reported hundreds of cases of suspected chemical weapons use on the battlefield by Russia since invasion began in Feb 2022. Lt. Col. Artem Vlasiuk, an expert in the Ukrainian army department that deals with nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological security, said that about 250 cases of suspected chemical weapons use by Russian forces had been reported in Feb, about five times the number in March 2023. He said that most of the chemical substances used in the attacks had been identified as CS gas, a tear gas commonly used by riot police to control crowds.Although govts use tear gas for domestic law-enforcement purposes, it is considered a chemical weapon when used in warfare, according to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Civilians can usually escape tear gas during protests, but soldiers in trenches have little choice but to flee under enemy fire or risk being suffocated.Gyunduz Mamedov, Ukraine ’s deputy prosecutor general, said last week that the Russian army had used tear gas against Ukrainian troops at least 900 times in the past six months, with more than 1,400 incidents reported since the start of the war. In addition to tear gas, the state department said that Russian forces had used chloropicrin, a choking agent that irritates the nose, throat and the lungs when inhaled and can cause nausea and vomiting. Ukrainian army officials have said that the chemicals are usually contained in grenades that Russian forces throw at Ukrainian positions, forcing soldiers out of their fortified positions.",The use of these gases in warfare is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The state department also said that the US would impose sanctions on three state entities linked to Russia’s chemical and biological weapons programmes.

They are constructed in cubic shape, often weigh no more than a few kg, and are deployed in space for various purposes.Weighing around 7 kg, the iCUBE-Q orbiter carries two cameras to take images of the lunar surface and has other sensors and apparatus for deep-space communication, altitude control, and other functions.The primary criteria for mission success, officials said, will be achieved with the successful separation of the iCUBE-Q from the Chang’e-6 Orbiter. Following separation, the secondary criteria will involve the satellite receiving a beacon signal that will confirm that the orbiter is working satisfactorily.Finally, the orbiter will take pictures of the Earth, and Moon and try to take pictures of at least two objects together (Earth, Moon, and the orbiter).As part of data collection, authorities said, iCUBE-Q will also collect data on the lunar magnetic field, establish a lunar magnetic field model, and lay the groundwork for future missions and international lunar cooperation.Dr Khurram Khurshid, a senior member associated with Pakistan’s space programme, said the satellite will reach the lunar orbit in five days and will circle the moon for three to six months.He added that different pictures of the surface of the moon will be taken with the orbiter’s help, after which Pakistan will have its own satellite images of the Moon for research.","Pakistan launched its first-ever lunar mission, iCube-Qamar, on Friday.

All that is left for them is to now murder me,” writes Khan.“I have stated publicly that if anything happens to me or my wife (Bushra Bibi), Gen. Asim Munir will be responsible. But I am not afraid because my faith is strong. I would prefer death over slavery,” he says.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy. However, the military has denied meddling in the country's politics.Khan warned that the state was treading the same path it trod in 1971, when it lost East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.“At the same time, it is seeing an upsurge in terrorism and a growing alienation in Balochistan where the issue of enforced disappearances is growing in severity. On Pakistan's borders, India has already admitted to undertaking assassinations inside of Pakistan and the international border with Afghanistan remains volatile,” he notes.Khan notes the military establishment's expectation of “unquestioning support” from the US, in return for the provision of access to airspace and related facilities to the US for military purposes, has been punctured after the publication of the latest US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which highlights the many human rights violations in Pakistan.“With an economy in crisis, spiralling prices and a people politically angry at having their electoral mandate stolen and being economically beleaguered, the state stands isolated,” he writes.Khan hailed the “democratic revenge” of the February 8 general election, during which people came out and “voted overwhelmingly” for candidates supported by his party.“Unfortunately, instead of accepting the people's mandate, the military establishment went into a fit of rage and electoral results were manipulated to bring into power the losers. The same vote tampering was seen in the recent by-elections,” he notes.The PTI founder also praised the six “brave judges” of the Islamabad High Court who have written a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan highlighting instances of harassment and blackmail including of their families by intelligence agencies.“This is unprecedented in our history – although, informally, many knew what was happening to the senior judiciary but for such a letter to have come from these judges shows the level of despair, anger and frustration,” he writes.","Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country. He said all that is left for the powerful military leadership was to ""murder"" him.

According to Pakistan’s Institute Of Space Technology (IST), the moon-bound spacecraft is a lunar cubesat , designated ICube Qamar ( ICUBE-Q ), with a three-month mission span.The mission is a collaborative effort of IST’s faculty and students, Pakistan’s national space agency Suparco and China’s Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).In 2022, China National Space Agency (CNSA) had offered member-states a unique opportunity through Asia Pacific Space Cooperation Organisation (APSCO) to send a student-built payload to the moon on board the Change’6 mission. Pakistan’s ICUBE-Q was selected.According to IST, ICUBE-Q weighs approximately 7kg and is equipped with two optical cameras to capture the lunar surface. It features systems for attitude control, thermal management and deep-space communication.IST lists the main mission objectives as follows -- successful separation of ICUBE-Q CubeSat into lunar orbit from Change’6 Orbiter; use of Orbiter camera to record the release process of ICUBE-Q; successful reception of beacon signal from ICUBE-Q, confirming successful operation of CubeSat.Pictures will also be taken of the orbiter, earth and the moon, apart from two to three objects (moon, earth and orbiter) together, IST said.Change’6 will land on the far side of the moon, collect up to 2000 grams of lunar material and return to earth in a first-of-its-kind mission.","Pakistan is set to embark Friday on its maiden lunar mission on board China’s Change’6 orbiter.

Pakistan is now eyeing a new, longer and larger economic bailout package, but economists cautioned against the country’s continued reliance on overseas financial assistance, warning of potential dire consequences.IMF approved the immediate release of the tranche following a key meeting of the global lender’s executive board in Washington late Monday night.All board members favoured releasing the funds, except India, which abstained.Pakistan has been reeling from a severe economic crisis for more than two years, with its inflation at one point shooting up to nearly 38% and its foreign currency reserves depleted to $3bn in Feb 2023, enough to cover less than five weeks of imports.Last year, the global lender had approved a nine-month standby arrangement with Pakistan “to support its economic stabilisation programme”. The approval had allowed for an immediate disbursement of $1.2bn, with the rest phased over the programme’s duration — subject to two quarterly reviews.The IMF bailout proved important to save the country from default, the state broadcaster quoted PM Sharif as saying.Leading economist Qaiser Bengali expressed scepticism about the perceived stability, highlighting the temporary nature of the current situation and underscoring the necessity of meaningful reforms to address long-term economic challenges.“If the so-called stability was due to a rise in exports or better inflow of dollars, that would have been meaningful, but that is not happening,” Bengali said, adding that the economy cannot run on a policy of getting new loans to pay past loans.Pakistan’s external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.","PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country.

The pre-action letter sent on Monday outlines his civil claim for damages for harassment abroad, physical injury, trespass to the person, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.“While in office, Shahzad highlighted army and ISI interference with his accountability and anti-corruption objectives. Believing that he could not fix the rampant corruption in Pakistan, he resigned from Khan’s government in Jan 2022,” a spokesperson for UK law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Akbar, said. On April 17, 2022, he fled to London.“He continues to campaign against corruption in Pakistan and remains highly critical of the military establishment and govt officials,” the spokesperson added.Akbar said: “Compared to what was done to me, I believe a lot worse is being inflicted on dissidents in Pakistan by the current regime. They are targeting political workers, lawyers, judges andjournalists. However, what should be most alarming is that Pakistan is able to target its dissidents on British soil without any accountability.”A spokesperson for Hertfordshire constabulary confirmed to TOI it was investigating the acid attack and was appealing for witnesses and to trace the motorbike the suspects rode. No arrests have been made.The Pakistan high commission in London said: “The govt rejects all such attempts to malign the reputation of its institutions for motivated agendas.”A spokesperson for the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said last Dec, when asked about the attack: “We reject any insinuations of Pakistan's involvement and that of Pakistani agencies in such a heinous attack. It is not our policy to target our own nationals abroad. We hope that culprits in this case will be identified and treated as per UK law.”","Shahzad Akbar (46), a Pakistani citizen who fled to Britain after Khan was ousted, was nearly blinded in the attack in front of his young child at their home in Royston, Hertfordshire.

'Fuel for water': Heatwave piles misery on Myanmar displaced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/fuel-for-water-heatwave-piles-misery-on-myanmar-displaced/articleshow/109805863.cms,"A swelling camp

'Borrowing water'

Zay Yar Tun fills his truck with water for delivery to refugees in the parched hills of war-ravaged eastern Myanmar, where a heatwave is adding to the misery of life in displacement camps.Under a roof of plastic sheets in one of the camps in Kayah state, Augusta waits for the 10 gallons that must cover her family's drinking, cooking and washing needs for the next three days.More than 123,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Kayah by the conflict unleashed by the military's 2021 coup, according to the United Nations .Now, a heatwave that has sent the mercury in Myanmar to 48 degrees Celsius (118 Fahrenheit) in some places has added to uncertainties of life in the camps.""Last year, we got water from a spring nearby,"" Augusta told AFP.""But now we can't get water from that place as there is no water left there.""We have to be frugal... If we don't shower today, maybe tomorrow we can wash our hands and faces.""The scarcity means she and her children are often unable to wash properly or clean their clothes in the baking heat.""The children are itching and they seem dirty, and we also don't have clean clothes for them,"" she said.A dozen or so camp residents queue up at the truck for water rations that will have to last them three or four days.Children carry the containers home in baskets on their backs or via trolleys as hot wind whips up dust from the dirt road.""When there were only residents living in this place, there was enough water,"" said Zay Yar Tun, of the charity Clean Yangon.""But after the displaced people fled here, the population is too much for the amount of water we can get here.""Donations keep Zay Yar Tun's team and its two trucks running, and they make two deliveries to the camp each week.Finding the streams or springs to fill up their truck can be dangerous in Kayah, which has emerged as one of the hotspots of resistance to military rule.The military regularly calls in air and artillery strikes on its opponents and landmines are a constant danger.Transporting cargo to the camps is difficult too.The fuel the team needs to run their trucks and pumps is expensive because of military restrictions on importing fuel into Kayah, Zay Yar Tun said.""The price of fuel is very expensive, and it seems like we are exchanging fuel to get water,"" he said.Families like Augusta's are forced to make similar calculations as they try to get through the heat.""If we are going to take a bath in the creek, we have to go far away from the camp,"" she said.""It's not a walkable distance under this temperature.""""If we go by motorcycle, it's not worth it because of the cost of fuel. If we save money for fuel, we may as well use it to buy water.""Respite in the form of the rainy season may be some way off yet.Myanmar's weather office has forecast that the monsoon, which usually begins around May, is likely to arrive late this year, state media reported this week.Until then, water will be priceless in the camp, said Augusta.""Sometimes we say to each other: 'I haven't got any water left, have you got any? Please could you give me some?'"" she said.""Our life has come to this, where we have to borrow water.""","More than 123,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Kayah state.

The Islamic State group says it was behind a mosque attack in Afghanistan that killed 6 people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/the-islamic-state-group-says-it-was-behind-a-mosque-attack-in-afghanistan-that-killed-6-people/articleshow/109759726.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a deadly shooting this week targeting members of the country's minority Shiite community inside a mosque in western Afghanistan that killed six people. The militant group said in a statement posted on its Telegram website late on Tuesday that one of its members attacked a ""Shiite temple"" in Herat province with machine-gun fire.The attack, which took place on Monday night in the district of Guzara, also left one person wounded.The attacker fled the scene. The Taliban Interior Ministry has said that an investigation is underway.Local media reported that the mosque's imam was among those killed. The UN mission in Afghanistan condemned the attack, saying a child was among the victims. It called for urgent accountability for perpetrators and protection measures for Shiite communities.Afghanistan's former President Hamid Karzai said on the social media platform X that he considered""this terrorist act against all religious and human standards.""Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry said on Wednesday that ""the people and government of Pakistan extend their heartfelt condolences to the people of Afghanistan.""""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families in this hour of grief,"" it said.The statement added that Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms.The IS affiliate in Afghanistan is a major Taliban rival and frequently targets schools, hospitals, mosques and Shiite areas throughout the country.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, during the last weeks of the chaotic departure of US and Nato troops from the country after 20 years of war.Despite initial promises of a more moderate stance, the Taliban gradually reimposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, as they did during their previous rule of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.","Islamic State group claims responsibility for deadly shooting at mosque in Afghanistan.
