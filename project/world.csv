Bhutoria recognised the challenging nature of the contest, stating, ""The momentum and energy for Harris is real – and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states.""To harness this momentum, the Harris campaign is organising a weekend of action to mark 100 days until the election.

Campaign dynamics

Venezuelans anxiously awaited the results of Sunday’s pivotal presidential election, which could signal an end to 25 years of single-party rule. As polls remained open more than three hours past the official closing time, the uncertainty heightened tension across the nation.President Nicolás Maduro , seeking a third term, faced an unexpected challenger: Edmundo González , a retired diplomat who emerged as a late stand-in for opposition leader María Corina Machado .Machado, barred from the race by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court, saw González as her surrogate in a last-ditch effort to unseat the incumbent.Opposition supporters, buoyed by exit polls showing a strong lead for González, celebrated early victories at voting centers in Caracas. Despite Venezuelan law prohibiting exit polls, celebratory scenes unfolded with chants of “Freedom! Freedom!” echoing through the streets. Merling Fernández, a 31-year-old bank employee, expressed elation at what she perceived as a landslide win for González. “This is the path toward a new Venezuela,” Fernández said, overwhelmed with emotion.However, Maduro's campaign remained defiant. Campaign chief Jorge Rodríguez dismissed the early jubilation, stressing the need for official results. “We can’t give results, but we can show face,” Rodríguez said.Polls, originally set to close at 6 p.m., continued operating past the deadline at some centers, leading to calls from the opposition for the National Electoral Council to begin ballot counting. The delay fueled skepticism about the fairness of the process.In Caracas, voters lined up before dawn, preparing for long waits. Judith Cantilla, 52, voiced hope for change, emphasizing the need for better jobs and healthcare. “For me, change in Venezuela means jobs, security, and good pay for essential workers,” Cantilla said.The election's outcome is poised to influence not only Venezuela but also the broader Americas, with many contemplating emigration depending on the result. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris voiced support for Venezuelan voters, underscoring the importance of respecting their decision. “The United States stands with the people of Venezuela,” Harris stated on X.Maduro’s son, Nicolas Maduro Guerra, projected confidence in a victory for the ruling party. Meanwhile, González called for a peaceful transition and urged the armed forces to honor the people’s choice.Venezuela’s economic crisis and mass migration were focal points of the campaign. Maduro’s pitch included stories of economic recovery and stable currency, but many Venezuelans have seen little improvement. González and Machado's campaign promised to address the vast inequalities and reverse the economic decline.González, speaking after voting, emphasized his commitment to transformative change. “We will change hatred for love, poverty for progress, and corruption for honesty,” he declared.As Venezuelans wait for the official results, the election’s potential to reshape the nation’s future remains a subject of intense anticipation and concern.","Venezuelans anxiously awaited the results of Sunday’s pivotal presidential election.

'Scared of being booed!': Prince Harry's wife Meghan Markle has become 'British-phobic',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/scared-of-being-booed-prince-harrys-wife-meghan-markle-has-become-british-phobic/articleshow/112093316.cms,"Prince Harry 's wife and Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle has developed a phobia of Britain. A royal expert said that Meghan's reluctance to visit the UK is not due to concerns about her safety, but rather because she believes she would not receive a warm welcome from the British public.In a recent ITV documentary titled Tabloids on Trial, which focused on his battle with the British press, Prince Harry expressed his unwillingness to bring his wife to the country out of fear that she might become a victim of an acid or knife attack inspired by negative press coverage.However, the royal expert dismissed these concerns to GB News, saying, ""This is not about knives. This is not about acid. This is about Meghan's fear of booing.""""I think she is petrified that the great British public will vocalise their dislike of her. And I actually think now she's become quite Britain-phobic ,"" he added.The royal expert suggested that Meghan, being a ""California girl,"" has never truly fit into the British upper crust that Prince Harry is accustomed to. He argued that there was no valid reason for her absence from the Coronation, as the security measures in place should have been sufficient.""I don't think she actually likes this country because of all the negative associations she has with it from her time living here. I don't think she's ever really fit into this country anyway,"" the royal expert said adding, ""She's a California girl, she's not really part of that British upper crust that Prince Harry enjoys so much.""""I just don't think she really wants to come down here because there was no reason she couldn't have come for the Coronation,"" the expert said while arguing, ""The security was fine for the wife of the President. It should have been fine for the wife of Prince Harry.""The spokesperson also criticised Prince Harry for not bringing his children to visit his father, King Charles III, following his cancer diagnosis, noting that the monarch has only seen Lilibet once and Archie a handful of times.Since their relocation to California in 2020, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have rarely visited the UK together. The Duke of Sussex last visited in May for the Invictus Games, without his wife accompanying him.In the ITV interview, Prince Harry shared his concerns about the impact of media intrusion on his life, saying, ""All it takes is one lone actor, one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read. And whether it's a knife or acid, whatever it is, and these are things that are of genuine concern for me. It's one of the reasons why I won't bring my wife back to this country.""","A royal expert said that Meghan's reluctance to visit the UK is not due to concerns about her safety, but rather because she believes she would not receive a warm welcome.

"'She was a bum': Trump attacks Harris, complains about Biden's exit in first appearance without ear bandage",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/she-was-a-bum-trump-launches-fierce-attacks-on-kamala-harris-targets-immigration-and-abortion-policies/articleshow/112057684.cms,"Trump appeared without bandage since assassination attempt

Shift in campaign focus following Biden’s withdrawal

Dig at Harris’ name

'Kamala is Biden’s border czar'

Former President Donald Trump escalated his criticism of Kamala Harris on Saturday calling her a “bum” and accused her of failing in her role as Vice President. “She was a bum three weeks ago. She was a bum, a failed vice president ,” Trump said.In his first public appearance without an ear bandage since surviving an assassination attempt, Trump addressed a gathering at the Believers Summit in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he also portrayed Harris as a proponent of extreme left-wing policies and accused her of wanting to impose ""crazy San Francisco liberal values"" on the nation, citing her potential judicial appointments as a means to enforce these views nationwide.""Kamala Harris will appoint hundreds of extreme far-left judges to forcibly impose crazy San Francisco liberal values on Americans,"" Trump said.This speech marked Trump's second major campaign appearance since President Joe Biden's unexpected decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race earlier this week. The shift in the race dynamics led Trump to refocus his criticisms from Biden to Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee.The former president also declared Harris “worse than Joe Biden and, in a true sense, much more liberal.”Trump continued to take digs at President Biden, saying, ""Biden didn't want to do what he did. He said, 'I will never go out, I will never ever go out.' Two days later, 'I'm proud to go out.' Because the fascists threatened him with the 25th Amendment. They said we can do it the nice way or we can do it the hard way, Joe. That's what happened, I know. I know as many people on that side as I know on our side. But that's what happened. And now they are trying to make him a brave hero. 'He is so brave.'Trump also took aim at Biden’s recent speech regarding his decision to withdraw. ""The other night he made a speech. Look, I am not going to look into it, I am going to give people credit or no credit. It was horrible,"" Trump remarked, questioning the sincerity and quality of Biden’s address.The Republican presidential nominee also took jabs at Harris’ name, which he has been repeatedly accused of fumbling on purpose.“And by the way, there are numerous ways of saying her name. They were explaining to me, ‘You can say Comma-la, you can say Kah-mala,'” Trump said. He consistently uses the latter, which is incorrect.“I said, ‘Don’t worry about it. It doesn’t matter what I say,'” he continued. “I couldn’t care less if I mispronounce it.”Trump’s speech continued his campaign’s pattern of attacking Harris on immigration issues, despite her role not encompassing overall border policy. He described her as President Biden’s “border czar,” a designation not officially assigned but used by Republicans to criticize her handling of migration issues, reported the Washington Post.Trump's speech, aimed at a predominantly Christian audience, was notable for its direct assault on Harris's policies and beliefs. He claimed that Harris would expand the Supreme Court with “hard-core Marxists” to undermine the Constitution and religious freedoms. Trump's rhetoric also included controversial statements about abortion rights, accusing Harris of supporting extreme late-term abortions—a claim that is not supported by current laws or Harris’s actual policy positions.In addition to his abortion comments, Trump criticized Harris for her handling of immigration, broadly characterizing immigrants in a negative light and alleging without evidence that Harris and Democrats were encouraging illegal border crossings to increase voter rolls.Trump also took aim at Harris’s response to the Israel-Palestine conflict, accusing her of being “hostile to Americans of faith” and failing to support Israel adequately. He used his recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate to bolster his pro-Israel stance and further criticize Harris.James Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, condemned Trump's remarks as offensive and misleading. “Trump went on and on and on, and generally sounded like someone you wouldn’t want to sit near at a restaurant—let alone be president of the United States,” Singer said in a statement.",'Kamala is Biden’s border czar' 'She was a bum three weeks ago' 'I couldn’t care less if I mispronounce it’ 'She will appoint hundreds of extreme far-left judges to forcibly impose crazy San Francisco liberal values',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112058338,imgsize-3825983,width-400,resizemode-4/112058338.jpg"

In a dramatic act of protest , a pair of passengers took their frustration with Delta Airlines to a new level by raiding the airline’s VIP lounge after experiencing significant flight delays . Their bold antics, which included loading up on free food, emptying hand sanitizer dispensers, and more, have captured widespread attention online.A video documenting the escapade has garnered over 600,000 views on TikTok.Content creator Kyle Philippi, who posted the footage, captioned it, “POV: Delta doesn’t compensate for thousands of dollars lost from delaying our flights for days so we gonna get it back in the Sky Club.

They proceed to pour out bottles of wine, steal magazines, and squeeze all the hand sanitizer from its dispenser.

A UAE court has jailed 57 Bangladeshi citizens to lengthy prison terms for protesting against the Sheikh Hasina government over the controversial quota decision .The Bangladeshi citizens were jailed as unauthorised protests are banned in the Gulf country.Commenting on the case, Amnesty International 's UAE researcher Devin Kenney said it was ""the second mass trial in the UAE this month, with dozens of people sentenced to huge prison terms literally overnight, on charges involving no element of violence"".In a statement to news agency AFP, Kenney said the UAE's ""extreme reaction to the mere existence of a public protest on Emirati soil shows that the state places great priority on suppressing any manifestation of dissent in the country.""Meanwhile, a Bangladeshi student leader on Monday called for a 48-hour halt to the protest against the quota decision, which embroiled the nation in deadly clashes resulting in the death of over 100 people.""We are suspending the shutdown protests for 48 hours,"" Nahid Islam, the top leader of the main protest organiser Students Against Discrimination, told news agency AFP. Nahid Islam demanded the government to ""withdraw the curfew, restore the internet and stop targeting thestudent protesters "" in the halt period.In what could be deciphered as a sign of ease, the halt comes a day after the Bangladesh Supreme Court scaled down the controversial quota decision of the Sheikh Hasina government that facilitated 30 per cent reservation in government jobs to descendants of 1971 war heroes, who fought for the Independent against Pakistani regime.As the situation appears to head towards normalcy, the Bangladesh police have arrested more than 500 people, including some opposition leaders, over days of clashes in the capital Dhaka.""At least 532 people have been arrested over the violence,"" Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Faruk Hossain.""They include some BNP leaders,"" he added, referring to the opposition Bangladesh National Party.After days of deadly violence, normalcy returned to Bangladesh on Wednesday as factories, offices, and banks reopened following the easing of a nationwide curfew enforced by the army.

However, social media platforms remained suspended in the wake of student-led protests that turned violent last week.Despite the easing of restrictions, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, a junior technology minister, informed reporters that ""For now, all social media will remain shut,"" indicating that the government is still cautious about the potential for further unrest.","UAE court jails 57 Bangladeshi citizens to lengthy prison terms for protesting against the Sheikh Hasina government over the controversial quota decision.

Firefighters struggle as they battle to contain wildfires across US West,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/firefighters-struggle-as-they-battle-to-contain-wildfires-across-us-west/articleshow/112093209.cms,"Millions of people across the western United States and Canada were under air quality alerts on Sunday, with thousands of firefighters battling to contain the wildfires , including the largest wildfire in California this year.The Park Fire is said to be one of the major reasons behind the deteriorating air quality in northwestern US and western Canada.It had burned an area larger than the city of Los Angeles, spanning over 550 square miles (1,430 square kilometers) of inland Northern California.The Park Fire is compared to the devastating 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 85 people and destroyed 11,000 homes in the nearby community of Paradise.Firefighters made some progress on Saturday, aided by cooler temperatures and increased humidity, raising containment from zero to 12%.Although Paradise and several other Butte County communities were under an evacuation warning on Sunday, California Fire operations section chief Jeremy Pierce provided some positive news, stating that the southernmost front of the Park Fire, closest to Paradise, was ""looking really good."" Crews were focusing on extinguishing remaining hot spots and removing other hazards over the next three days, and they do not expect the fire to move further into Chico, a city of about 100,000 people just west of Paradise.Jay Tracy, a spokesperson at the Park Fire headquarters, said that the focus of first responders has shifted from saving lives and property to directly confronting the blaze. Nearly 4,000 firefighters are battling the fire, supported by numerous helicopters and air tankers.Tracy mentioned that reinforcements would provide much-needed rest to local firefighters, some of whom have been working continuously since the fire began on Wednesday.""This fire is surprising a lot of people with its explosive growth. It is kind of unparalleled,"" said Tracy.A portion of the town remained relatively untouched by the fire, according to the Butte County Fire Chief.""We have an unburned island in that community that we are continuing to patrol and ensure that there are no hot spots in it,"" Sjolund said.Coordinating evacuation orders can be challenging. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea stated that they were prepared to lower the evacuation order to a warning for Forest Ranch when they received reports of several hot spots in the vicinity.""That illustrates how rapidly things can change - we were all set to be able to reduce that order to get people back in there,"" Honea said.In Southern California, approximately 2,000 people were instructed to evacuate due to a fire raging through the Sequoia National Forest. The wind-driven fire was spreading rapidly, consuming over 60 square miles (155.40 square kilometers) in just four days, according to Kern County Fire Department public information officer Andrew Freeborn.The National Weather Service issued a ""red flag"" warning for the area on Sunday, indicating that dry fuels and stronger winds were increasing the risk of fire.As of now, no fatalities have been reported in the Park and Borel fires. However, some individuals in the area are choosing to ignore or disregard evacuation orders, which increases the risk for everyone, Freeborn noted.""When people are trying to ignore the orders and later call for rescue, that takes firefighters away from the task of fighting the fires,"" he said. ""This fire is moving at a pace and with such intensity that individuals should not be thinking they can wait until the last minute. They need to get out of the way.""Firefighters were also making headway on a complex of fires in the Plumas National Forest near the California-Nevada border, according to Forest Service spokesperson Adrienne Freeman.Despite the region expecting cooler-than-average temperatures through the middle of this week, ""that doesn't mean that fires that are existing will go away,"" said Marc Chenard, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.The Park Fire has caused significant damage, with at least 66 structures destroyed and five others damaged, according to Tracy. The initial estimate of 134 lost structures, based on drone footage, was revised after in-person assessments by teams. Tracy cautioned that the number might increase further, as damage inspections cannot be conducted in areas with active fire.The fire, which began on Wednesday, was allegedly started by a man who pushed a burning car into a gully in Chico and then fled the scene. The suspect was apprehended on Thursday and is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.Firefighting efforts on the northern half of the fire remained challenging on Sunday, as crews used heavy equipment to construct fire lines across difficult, rocky terrain in an attempt to prevent the flames from spreading further.The Park Fire was just one of over 100 wildfires burning across the United States on Sunday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Some of these fires were caused by weather conditions, with climate change increasing the frequency of lightning strikes as the western U.S. experiences extreme heat and dry conditions.Despite improved fire weather in Northern California, the National Weather Service warned of ""red flag"" conditions on Sunday across large areas of Idaho, Montana, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and parts of California, indicating a high risk for new fire outbreaks.","Millions of people across the western United States and Canada were under air quality alerts on Sunday.

Trump assassination attempt timeline: Text messages reveal key details of how Thomas Crooks was often a step ahead of secret service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-assassination-attempt-timeline-text-messages-reveal-key-details-of-how-thomas-crooks-was-often-a-step-ahead-of-secret-service/articleshow/112093040.cms,"The timeline

Security lapses and missteps

Crooks’ actions being probed

In a dramatic sequence of events on July 13, 2024, former President Donald Trump narrowly escaped an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The details, emerging from text messages and surveillance reports, reveal a troubling series of security lapses and miscommunications.Around 4:19 pm, a local countersniper, who was part of the broader security detail, texted his colleagues to notify them that his shift was ending.“Guys I am out. Be safe,” he texted to a group of colleagues.As he exited his post on the second floor of a warehouse overlooking the rally site, he observed a young man with long, stringy hair sitting on a picnic table outside the fenced area of the Butler Fair Show grounds. The countersniper texted his colleagues at 4:26 pm about the person, noting that he might have seen him with his rifle and might pose a threat, reported NYT.The person, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, aroused suspicion.By 5:10 pm, Crooks had moved closer to the warehouse where the countersnipers were stationed. One of the countersnipers took photographs of Crooks and sent them in a group chat, according to a law enforcement after-action report, advising that the Secret Service should be alerted. Despite these warnings, the security response failed to adequately address the threat.At 5:38 pm, text messages revealed that Crooks had been seen using a range finder to survey the stage area, prompting further concern. However, due to a shortage of volunteers and a lack of communication, the Secret Service and local law enforcement struggled to keep up with Crooks' movements. “Kid learning around building we are in. AGR I believe it is. I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out. I lost sight of him,” the text read, as reported by NYT.Crooks had been scouting the rally site even before the Secret Service conducted their first walk-through on July 8. He used a drone to survey the area and had researched past assassinations, including that of President John F Kennedy. On the day of the rally, he purchased ammunition and a ladder, which he later used to gain access to a roof about 400 feet from Trump’s podium.As Trump took the stage at 6:03 pm, rally attendees noticed Crooks on the roof. Crooks fired his first shot at 6:11 pm, narrowly missing Trump, who dived to the ground. Secret Service agents responded swiftly, returning fire and killing Crooks.Investigators are piecing together Crooks' motivations and actions leading up to the attempt. They found evidence of a plan involving rudimentary bombs and a fixation on high-profile figures. Despite the extensive security presence, the series of miscommunications and lapses allowed Crooks to get dangerously close to his target.Taken together, the text messages have revealed a comprehensive account of the hours leading up to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. These messages indicate that the gunman attracted police suspicion more than 90 minutes before the shooting—significantly earlier than the previously reported 60-minute window discussed in congressional hearings.The messages also add to the evidence that the would-be assassin was often one step ahead of security forces, and in particular the Secret Service.Despite the presence of countersnipers tasked with monitoring the rally, Crooks managed to observe them from his vantage point. After the attack, confusion persisted among police officers about how Crooks executed his plan. ""So, on TV, they’re saying Trump was shot at, and he got hit, but I don’t believe that,"" one officer was heard saying on body-worn camera footage 17 minutes after the shooting.Authorities are still investigating Crooks’ motivations and his preparatory actions. Evidence from his personal devices and interviews with investigators have shed light on his activities. Crooks had legally acquired an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle from his father in October 2013.In the lead-up to the attack, he received packages containing fertilizer pellets and radio devices, which he used to construct rudimentary bombs—two of which were found in his vehicle and another in his home.Crooks' online searches revealed a fixation on high-profile figures, including FBI Director Christopher Wray, Attorney General Merrick Garland, President Joe Biden, and Trump. He also researched ""major depressive disorder.""Following the announcement of Trump's rally in Butler on July 3, Crooks focused his attention on the event and historical assassinations. On July 6, he searched for ""How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?"" and visited the farm show grounds the following day, where he spent about 20 minutes scouting the location. He also registered to attend the rally.The Secret Service conducted their first walk-through of the site on July 8, joined by local and state law enforcement agencies. However, they decided to exclude the AGR warehouse complex—including Building No. 6, which Crooks later utilized—from their inner security perimeter. This oversight allowed Crooks to approach the building without passing through security screening.The confusion over who was responsible for monitoring the roof persists. Kimberly A Cheatle, then the director of the Secret Service, admitted before a House committee that she was unaware of the assigned duties for roof security. Cheatle resigned the following day, adding to the ongoing scrutiny of the security failures that nearly led to a catastrophic event.","Thomas Crooks, 20, shot and killed former President Donald Trump on July 13, 2024.

Al Gore endorses Kamala Harris for Democratic presidential candidate amidst climate crisis focus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/al-gore-endorses-kamala-harris-for-democratic-presidential-candidate-amidst-climate-crisis-focus/articleshow/112092897.cms,"In a significant boost to her presidential campaign, former Vice President Al Gore has formally endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate for the upcoming high-stakes election in November. Citing her unwavering commitment to climate action and middle-class advocacy, Gore's endorsement adds substantial weight to Harris's bid for the White House.Vice President Harris, 59, announced her presidential campaign just hours after incumbent President Joe Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race for a second term on July 20. While Harris has yet to be officially declared the Democratic candidate, her campaign has quickly gained momentum.In his endorsement statement on Sunday, Gore highlighted Harris's robust track record on environmental issues. “With so much at stake in this year's election – from strengthening democracy in the US and abroad, to expanding opportunity for the American people, to accelerating climate action – I'm proud to endorse Kamala Harris for President,” Gore said. “As a prosecutor, Kamala Harris took on Big Oil companies – and won. As Vice President, she cast the tie-breaking vote to pass the most significant investment in climate solutions in history, the Inflation Reduction Act. That's the kind of climate champion we need in the White House.”Gore's endorsement comes on the heels of support from four leading environmental groups: the League of Conservation Voters Action Fund, the Sierra Club, the NRDC Action Fund, and Clean Energy for America Action. These organizations have praised Harris's dedication to combating the climate crisis and fostering clean energy jobs.Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris's campaign manager, expressed gratitude for the endorsements. “Vice President Harris has been at the forefront of protecting our planet from the climate crisis and creating good clean energy jobs that will power our future and grow our middle class. We are deeply honored to have the support of Vice President Gore and these leading environmental organizations in the fight to protect our planet for our kids and grandkids.”Rodriguez also took aim at Harris's opponent, former President Donald Trump, who is the Republican Party's presidential candidate for the November 5 general election. “Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to sell out our future to his friends in Big Oil in exchange for campaign cash. Donald Trump is trying to take us backwards and let oil and gas executives write their own rules – Vice President Harris won't let that happen,” she said.The Biden-Harris administration has been lauded by environmental advocates for its significant efforts to address climate change and environmental injustice. “Whether holding polluters accountable as San Francisco District Attorney and California Attorney General, leading the charge on electric school buses in the US Senate, or casting the deciding vote on the biggest investment ever in climate, clean energy, and environmental justice and leading on climate on the world stage as Vice President, Kamala Harris has long been a climate champion,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs for the LCV Action Fund.Manish Bapna, President and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, echoed this sentiment. “Kamala Harris has been a driving force in delivering the strongest climate action in history. She's ready to build on those gains from day one as president. She'll advance the climate progress we've made at home and internationally. She'll raise climate ambition to make sure we confront the climate crisis in a way that makes the country more inclusive, more economically competitive, and more energy secure.”Ben Jealous, Executive Director of the Sierra Club, and Sarah Mason, Deputy Executive Director of Clean Energy for America Action, also praised Harris's long-standing commitment to environmental issues. “Kamala Harris is a courageous advocate for the people and the planet,” said Jealous. Mason added, “Vice President Harris is a proven champion and fierce advocate for climate action and clean energy, and we are confident she will carry on the impressive legacy of the Biden-Harris Administration as President.”As the election draws closer, Harris's focus on climate change and middle-class issues positions her as a formidable contender in a race that will shape the future of American environmental policy and beyond.",Former Vice President Al Gore has formally endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate for the upcoming high-stakes election in November.

How JD Vance's early missteps shake confidence in Trump campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-jd-vances-early-missteps-shake-confidence-in-trump-campaign/articleshow/112092874.cms,"Unearthed remarks stir controversy

Awkward public appearances

Trump's resilient campaign momentum

Criticism from unexpected allies

Campaign's public support for Vance

Impact on female voters

Digital era amplifies missteps

Future outlook for the Trump-Vance ticket

The choice of Senator JD Vance as former President Donald Trump’s running mate initially signaled a campaign brimming with confidence and looking to solidify Trump’s legacy beyond a second term. Yet, in less than two weeks, Vance’s candidacy has faced significant hurdles, shaking the sense of invulnerability that had surrounded the Trump campaign.A slew of years-old quotes, videos, and audio clips, recently unearthed by Democrats and the media, have emerged, casting a shadow over the campaign’s efforts to appeal to women, voters of color, and blue-collar voters—key demographics Vance was supposed to win over, as reported by NYT.His past remarks, which include derogatory comments about “childless cat ladies,” advocating for a “federal response” to stop abortions in Democratic states, and suggesting higher taxes for childless Americans, have incited widespread criticism. Attempts by Vance to clarify these statements have only added fuel to the fire, exemplified by a clip where he stressed that he did not intend to insult cats: “I’ve got nothing against cats,” he said.Vance’s initial public appearances have not helped his cause. During a rally in Middletown, Ohio, he awkwardly tried to preempt criticism by joking that his preference for Diet Mountain Dew could be deemed racist, assuring the audience that “Diet Mountain Dew is good.”These issues have emerged after a dramatic period for Trump, who survived an assassination attempt and managed to unify the Republican Party and even some skeptics. The Republican National Convention, which began with calls for national unity, saw the Trump-Vance ticket gain momentum and an increased lead in the polls.However, this success has brought unintended consequences. Vance was supposed to campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris. Instead, the Republican surge led to President Joe Biden withdrawing from the race, elevating Harris and energizing Democratic support. This shift left Vance without a clear opponent, struggling under the national spotlight.Criticism has come from unexpected quarters as well. Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports and a prominent figure in the Trump movement, questioned Vance’s policies: “You want me to pay more taxes to take care of other people’s kids? We sure this dude is a Republican? Sounds like a moron,” quoted by NYT as saying.Publicly, the Trump campaign has stood by Vance. Campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung dismissed the criticism as “liberal talking points” and reiterated their determination to defeat Harris. However, Vance’s controversial comments have particularly resonated with women, a group Trump has long struggled to win over.The addition of Vance to the ticket has mobilized new opponents, including actress Jennifer Aniston, who criticized his perceived denigration of childless women. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page lambasted Vance’s debut, comparing his remarks to Hillary Clinton’s infamous “basket of deplorables” comment in 2016.Supporters argue that the criticism is overblown, noting that Vance suggested lowering taxes for families with children rather than raising them for childless Americans. On SiriusXM’s “The Megyn Kelly Show,” Vance defended his stance, saying, “I’m proud to stand up for parents...I want to fight for your interests.”Vance has also faced backlash for a 2021 proposal to give parents more voting power and for comments on conservative podcasts that included antisemitic and racial stereotypes. His spokesperson clarified that Vance agrees with Trump that states should set their own abortion policies, dismissing the attacks as distractions.In today’s digital age, Vance’s comments have spread rapidly across social media, resonating beyond the internet. Democrats have mocked his proposals as “weird,” with Senators Brian Schatz and Chris Murphy recording a video ridiculing the idea of giving parents more votes.The Harris campaign has managed to maintain the focus on her presidential bid, successfully diverting attention from Trump. Harris aides revealed that many of the old videos circulating were unearthed by their campaign and the Democratic National Committee. They have relished defining Vance before he can establish himself.While some argue that any Trump running mate would face similar scrutiny, the Harris campaign is satisfied with the damage done to Vance.","Senator JD Vance's comments about 'childless cat ladies' and higher taxes for childless Americans have incited widespread criticism.

While acknowledging the attacks, Vance did not explicitly condemn them.Instead, he expressed his deep love and admiration for his wife, stating, ""Look, I love my wife so much. I love her because she's who she is.""""Obviously, she's not a white person, and we've been accused — attacked — by some white supremacists over that,"" said Vance.

While the Quad summit which India was hoping to host in January has been inordinately delayed, the ministers are expected to explore the possibility of having the same on the margins of the UNGA in September.According to government sources, PM Narendra Modi won’t mind having the summit in New York and while the US and Australia are also keen, there’s still doubt about whether Japanese PM Fumio Kishida will be able to make it as the UNGA 2024 clashes with the presidential election for Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The election as of now is expected to take place either on September 20 or 27.Amid renewed China-Philippines tensions, theQuad meeting on Monday will likely see a reiteration of the 4 democracies’ joint vision of keeping the Indo-Pacific stable and secure, free from intimidation and coercion, and where sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected. The Russia-Ukraine war is also expected to figure in the meeting with the ministers likely to focus on its humanitarian consequences.Despite India’s initial reluctance to include the war in Quad’s agenda, concerns over the global food security situation have seen the grouping focus on the implications of Russia’s actions in Ukraine in a big way. Apart from the US, Japan and Australia are also likely to appreciate Modi’s decision to visit Ukraine next month. The last foreign ministers’ meeting on the margins of the UNGA in 2023 saw the participants mourning in a joint statement the “terrible and tragic humanitarian consequences” of the war in Ukraine and underscoring the need for a “comprehensive, just, and lasting peace” in accordance with international law, consistent with the principles of the UN Charter. In the context of the Ukraine war, Quad has also described the threat of use of nuclear weapons as unacceptable.The ministers will also review cooperation on Quad initiatives for the Indo-Pacific announced during the 2023 Hiroshima summit last year, including in climate change, clean energy supply chains, and infrastructure.","The leaders met in Tokyo ahead of the Quad foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday.

There are around 500,000 Amadis in Pakistan according to their community leadership.The constitution has branded them non-Muslims since 1974, and a 1984 law forbids them from claiming their faith as Islamic or openly practising Islamic rituals.""Ahmadis' right to peacefully manifest their beliefs must be respected,"" the experts insisted, warning that ""judicial harassment serves to normalise violence against Ahmadis by non-State actors"".They welcomed Pakistan National Assembly 's adoption last month of a resolution urging federal and provincial governments to ensure the safety and security of all Pakistani citizens including religious minorities.But, they cautioned, ""such good-faith efforts to counter discriminatory discourse will be ineffective unless they address its structural drivers, (including) blasphemy laws and discriminatory legal provisions "".","The Ahmadiyya sect has been persecuted for decades in Pakistan.

"Anti-terrorism efforts being made controversial by illegal, political mafias, says Pak army",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terrorism-efforts-being-made-controversial-by-illegal-political-mafias-says-pak-army/articleshow/111937180.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan armyaccused its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts , including a new military operation, to the detriment of the country’s national interests following the arrest on Monday of Raoof Hasan, information secretary of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), headed by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan. The army said the party information secretary was in charge of PTI ’s digital media cell which, it alleged, was involved in running anti-state propaganda.Last month PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved a military offensive to counter aspikein terrorist attacks across Pakistan, particularly in volatile northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, but the idea was widely criticised by opposition parties, particularly PTI and the rights group Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). They termed it a ploy against Pashtuns to earn dollars from major powers and exploit their resources.Addressing a presser in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, asked, “Why did a mafia, a political mafia , and an illegal mafia say that they would not let this campaign (OperationAzm-e-Istehkam, or Resolve for Stability) happen?” He added that opponents of the offensive had tried to make it “controversial” and paint it as a purely military operation in which thousands of people would be displaced.He did not name any party or group butcalled the army’s critics “politicalandillegal mafias”,an apparent reference to PTI and PTM.Lt Gen Chaudhry said they were using “fake news and propaganda” to spread lies about the army and its intentions.“This is digital terrorism,” he said. “The physical terrorist also attacks law enforcement agencies and the army, and the digital terrorist also attacks the army. They are doing the same thing.”“Digital terrorists”, the spokesman said, would be deterred through laws, regulation and monitoring.He, however, questioned the lack of action against such individuals despite their activities against the leadership of the state and other institutions. “Instead of the courts and regulations moving forward against them, they’re given further space and they’re made heroes in the name of freedom of expression,” he said.Ahead of Sharif’s press conference, security forces had raided PTI’s offices and arrested Raoof Hasan from the party’s central secretariat. The raid came a week after the govt had said it planned to ban the party.“The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,” Islamabad police said, adding that those directly involved in anti-national propaganda were arrested and all evidence from PTI’s digital media cell wasconfiscated.The party issued a statement on X, saying: “It’s absolutely shameful how Islamabad police continues to completely mock and disregard every law in this country. Law of the jungle is reigning over Pakistan!”The crackdown on PTI follows several court rulings in its favour this month that threaten PM Sharif’s govt, which came to power in Feb this year with the military’s backing.","Pakistan army accuses its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts.

Islam and two other high-ranking members of the protest group were forcibly removed from a hospital in Dhaka by plainclothes detectives on Friday.The protests began earlier this month in response to the government's decision to reintroduce a quota system that reserves over 50% of all government positions for specific candidates.This move deeply frustrated graduates who are already grappling with a severe employment crisis, as government data indicates that approximately 18 million young Bangladeshis are currently unemployed.Opponents of the quota system argue that it is being used to fill public sector jobs with supporters of the ruling Awami League. Last week, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh reduced the number of reserved positions but did not meet the protesters' demands to eliminate the quotas entirely.","Bangladesh telecommunications minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak said that country's mobile internet will be restored later on Sunday.Palak told reporters the network would be restored at 3:00 pm (0900 GMT), following the restoration of fixed line broadband connections on Tuesday.
