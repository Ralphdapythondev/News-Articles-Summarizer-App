"Donald Trump's documents trial start delayed indefinitely, judge orders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-documents-trial-start-delayed-indefinitely-judge-orders/articleshow/109931196.cms,"(With inputs on agencies)

NEW DELHI: Former US President Donald Trump's trial in Florida, where he faces charges of illegally keeping classified documents after his presidency ended, was indefinitely postponed by US District Judge Aileen Cannon on Tuesday.Originally, Trump's trial in the documents case , brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, was set to begin on May 20. However, both the prosecution and defense acknowledged that this date would need to be postponed.Judge Cannon, appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020, confirmed the trial would not start on May 20 but did not provide a new date. Instead, she scheduled pre-trial hearings to continue through July 22.Trump has entered a plea of not guilty to 40 federal counts , which accuse him of ""retaining sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing US government efforts to retrieve them."" As the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated him in the previous election, Trump faces significant challenges.Smith encounters substantial obstacles in getting either federal case against Trump to trial before the election. Cannon has yet to make rulings on several critical legal issues in the documents case and has indicated support for Trump's defense on some matters. Trump's lawyers had argued for a trial date after the election, but also suggested August 12 in response to Cannon's order to propose a timeline. Smith, on the other hand, proposed a July start date.Randall Eliason, a law professor at George Washington University and an expert in white-collar criminal cases, commented on the unprecedented situation, stating, ""We're in this absolutely unprecedented situation where a defendant is potentially going to have the power to shut down his own prosecution. That's an argument for getting the case to trial before the election.""In addition to the federal cases, Trump has been on trial in New York state court since April 15, facing charges of unlawfully seeking to conceal hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has also been charged in Georgia state court over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results.",Former US President Donald Trump's trial in Florida has been indefinitely postponed.

Israeli tanks enter Rafah & take over border crossing with Egypt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-tanks-enter-rafah-take-over-border-crossing-with-egypt/articleshow/109929891.cms,"Israel's military said Tuesday that it had sent tanks into Rafah and established control over the Gaza Strip side of the border crossing with Egypt in what it called a limited operation. The move halted the flow of aid into the enclave, drawing immediate condemnation from international officials.The military said the incursion was aimed at destroying Hamas fighters and infrastructure in Rafah that were used in an attack that killed four Israeli soldiers over the weekend near the Kerem Shalom border crossing.It did not appear to be the long-promised full ground invasion of Rafah, which Israel's allies have been working to avert by pushing for a truce deal.It came after a dizzying day that saw Israel order people to evacuate parts of the city, then Hamas claims that it had accepted the terms of a ceasefire, followed by an announcement by Israel's military that it was carrying out ""targeted strikes"" in eastern Rafah.PM Benjamin Netanyahu is facing pressure to agree to a ceasefire with Hamas that is backed by the US and Arab nations and that would secure the release of hostages still held in Gaza. Analysts say Israel's actions in Rafah could either ratchet up the pressure on Hamas to make a deal or sabotage the talks.But the Israeli PM sounded defiant Tuesday, saying that Hamas' positive response to the ceasefire proposal the previous day ""was meant to torpedo"" troops' entry into Rafah. ""That didn't happen,"" he said, adding that he had sent a ""working-level"" delegation back to Cairo to continue the talks while ""in tandem, we continue waging the war on Hamas.""The head of a hospital in Rafah said that 27 bodies and 150 wounded people had been brought to his facility since the start of the incursion, and humanitarian agencies said that no aid was passing through the Rafah crossing. UN officials said Israeli troops had now ""choked off"" both the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings, the two main routes for getting aid into Gaza, and warned that the humanitarian crisis in the enclave would worsen.Israel's military declined to say how long it planned to stay in Rafah, calling Tuesday's incursion ""a very precise"" counterterrorism operation. Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said the operation there would continue until the last Hamas brigade in the city was destroyed ""or until the return of the first hostage to Israel"". Troops found three tunnel shafts in the area near the crossing, and about 20 militants were killed during the operation, the military said in a statement, without offering evidence. Israel has long viewed Gaza's border with Egypt as a main route for smuggling arms into the coastal enclave.","Israel's military said the incursion was aimed at destroying Hamas fighters and infrastructure in Rafah.

US has been holding up several weapons shipments to Israel for 2 weeks: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/us-has-been-holding-up-several-weapons-shipments-to-israel-for-2-weeks-report/articleshow/109930049.cms,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden's administration has been holding up certain Boeing-made arms shipments to Israel, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, in what two of them said was an apparent political message to the close US ally.The shipments, which have been delayed for at least two weeks, involved Boeing-made Joint Direct Attack Munitions, which convert dumb bombs into precision-guided ones, as well as Small Diameter Bombs.The sources did not elaborate further.The White House and Pentagon declined comment. The news of a delayed arms shipment was first reported by Axios over the weekend and Politico first reported on the types of arms delayed and the reasoning on Tuesday.Without addressing whether there had been a suspension in arms shipments, the Pentagon said on Monday that there had not been a policy decision to withhold arms from Israel, America's closest Middle East ally.Still, the delays appeared to be the first since Biden's administration offered its full support to Israel following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which killed about 1,200 people with about 250 others abducted, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.Israel's campaign to destroy Hamas has led to a seven-month-long military campaign that has killed a total of 34,789 Palestinians, most of them civilians, the Gaza Health Ministry said.The conflict has also left many of Gaza's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the US demanding that universities and Biden withdraw support for Israel -- including the provision of weaponry.A senior Israeli official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, did not confirm any specific hold-up in arms supplies but appeared to take the reports in stride: ""As the prime minister has already said, if we have to fight with our fingernails, then we'll do what we have to do.""","US President Joe Biden's administration has been holding up certain Boeing-made arms shipments to Israel, sources say.

Hamas' offer to hand over 33 hostages includes some who are dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hamas-offer-to-hand-over-33-hostages-includes-some-who-are-dead/articleshow/109930212.cms,"WASHINGTON: Hamas informed negotiators Monday that not all of the 33 hostages who would be freed in the first phase of a possible cease-fire deal with Israel are still living and that the remains of those who have died would be among the initial releases, according to two people familiar with the talks.The disclosure came as part of Hamas' counteroffer to Israel's latest proposal, which envisions a first-phase, six-week cease-fire in exchange for the return of some of the hostages taken during the Oct.7 terrorist attacks. It was not clear whether Hamas revealed how many of the 33 are still alive and how many are dead .The first group of hostages meant to be freed in the initial phase of the proposed agreement is supposed to include women, older men, and the sick and wounded who are among the more than 100 believed still to be held captive. The Israelis initially wanted 40 to be released in the first phase but came to understand that Hamas did not hold that many who fit the criteria. Israeli and US officials have long assumed that some of the hostages may be dead.The news that the first group of hostages to be released would include the remains of some taken seven months ago will surely upset families who have been pressing the Israeli government to do more to free their loved ones. The fate of the hostages has become a major issue with the Israeli public as thousands of demonstrators have poured into the streets to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to make a deal. Protesters blocked major roads in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv late Monday after Hamas' counteroffer.Israeli officials said that the Hamas counteroffer was not acceptable, but they have agreed to keep negotiating. Officials from various countries serving as intermediaries will gather again in Cairo this week to go over the counteroffer and see if further progress can be made.

"Spankings, satin PJs and Hugh Hefner’s mention: Stormy details Trump meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spankings-satin-pjs-and-hugh-hefners-mention-stormy-details-trump-meet/articleshow/109930687.cms,"NEW YORK: Stormy Daniels testified on Tuesday that Donald Trump greeted her in pajamas in his hotel room in 2006 where she spanked him at his request, telling jurors about the alleged encounter that would ultimately lead to the first criminal trial of a former US president.Wearing a black outfit and black glasses, Daniels, 45, said she grew annoyed by Trump's frequent interruptions and asked him: ""Are you always this arrogant and pompous?""She said Trump dared her to spank him, and she obliged.""That's bullshit,"" Trump appeared to say as he watched from the defendant's table.By midmorning, Daniels had yet to testify about the sexual intercourse she has said took place at that meeting. Her testimony was expected to resume after a break.Trump, 77 and the Republican candidate for president this year, is accused of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment to Daniels to buy her silence during the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty and denies having had sex with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.She said she met Trump at a Lake Tahoe golf tournament at which Trump was a competitor. She said he took note when an associate mentioned Daniels directed films, too.""He said, 'Oh, you direct too - you must be the smart one,'"" Daniels testified.Daniels told jurors that later in the day, Trump's bodyguard approached her and said Trump would like her to join him for dinner.""F no,"" Daniels said when asked how she initially responded.She said she changed her mind after a publicist convinced her the dinner could make a great story.When she arrived at his hotel suite, Trump greeted her wearing only satin pajamas.""I said, 'Does Hugh Hefner know you stole his pajamas?'"" Daniels recalled saying, referring to Playboy impresario Hugh Hefner.Daniels told Trump to change, and he politely obliged, she said. The alleged encounter took place while Trump was married to his current wife, Melania. Trump denies any sexual encounter with Daniels.Trump passed a note to his defense lawyer on Tuesday and sometimes appeared to close his eyes while listening to her testimony.After the break, Justice Juan Merchan told prosecutors to pull back on details of the encounter. ""The degree of detail that we're going into is just unnecessary,"" he said.Merchan had previously ruled that Daniels would be allowed to tell jurors that she had sex with Trump, over the objections of Trump's legal team.Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger said the testimony was needed to complete the story and establish Daniels' credibility.""In terms of the sexual act, it will be just very basic. It's not going to involve descriptions of genitalia or anything of that nature,"" Hoffinger said.Trump, running again for president in the Nov. 5 election, has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.Prosecutors have shown the former president's signature was on payments at the heart of the case. They say Trump falsely labeled payments to his lawyer Michael Cohen in 2017 as legal expenses, when they actually were reimbursements for the $130,000 hush-money payment, which Cohen had made to Daniels.Prosecutors say that amounts to an illegal scheme to influence the 2016 election by buying the silence of people with potentially damaging information.Trump's lawyers have suggested Daniels was seeking a role on Trump's reality TV show, ""The Apprentice.""Daniels has been at the receiving end of some of Trump's vitriolic attacks on social media.Merchan, who is hearing the case, has said some of those posts violated a gag order restricting Trump from speaking about witnesses, jurors, and others involved in the case if those statements are meant to influence the proceedings.Trump has been fined $10,000 so far for violating a gag order that prevents him from talking about witnesses. Merchan has warned Trump could be jailed if he keeps up his attacks.Trump has called the gag order a violation of his free speech rights and says the trial is an attempt to hobble his attempt to win back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden.The case is widely seen as less consequential than three other criminal prosecutions Trump faces, but it is the only one certain to go to trial before the election.The other cases charge Trump with trying to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat and mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all three.","Stormy Daniels testifies that Donald Trump dared her to spank him. Trump denies any sexual encounter with Daniels.

NEW DELHI: The Maldivian tourism minister , Ibrahim Faisal, has appealed to Indian tourists to continue visiting the archipelago nation, emphasising the historical ties between the two countries.In an interview with PTI Videos, Faisal stated, ""We have a history. Our newly elected government also wants to work together (with India). We always promote peace and a friendly environment.Our people and the government will give a warm welcome to Indian arrivals. As the Tourism Minister, I want to tell Indians to please be a part of Maldives' tourism. Our economy depends on tourism.""The minister's plea comes amidst a significant decline in Indian tourist arrivals following derogatory remarks made by three Maldivian officials against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media.The backlash led to numerous cancellations and a drop in India's position from the top visitor country to the sixth position after January. According to a report by sun.mv, tourist arrivals from India declined by 42 per cent in the first four months of this year compared to the same period last year.The strained relations between India and the Maldives have been attributed to the new administration led by President Mohamed Muizzu, who is widely seen as a pro-China leader.Since assuming office in November last year, Muizzu has maintained his election promise of evicting Indian military personnel from the Maldives, forcing the withdrawal of 88 Indian military personnel manning three aviation platforms gifted by India. Muizzu has previously accused India of meddling in the affairs of the Maldives and won the presidential elections in September last year with an ""India Out"" campaign.Despite the current challenges, the Maldives remains a key maritime neighbour for India in the Indian Ocean Region and holds a special place in India's initiatives like 'SAGAR' and the 'Neighbourhood First Policy' of the Modi government.

NEW DELHI: The trial of Kazakhstan’s former economy minister Kuandyk Bishimbayev for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova, has shocked the nation, with thousands calling for harsher penalties for domestic violence .CCTV footage depicted the minister dragging his wife by her hair, and subsequently punching and kicking her. Following the recorded incident, Nukenova succumbed to brain trauma.The footage, spanning eight hours, also captured Bishimbayev breaking down a door as Nukenova attempted to seek refuge in a bathroom.Nukenova, aged 31, was discovered dead in November within a restaurant owned by one of Bishimbayev’s relatives. Initially denying involvement, Bishimbayev confessed in court on Wednesday to assaulting her and inadvertently causing her demise.Bishimbayev's legal team contested medical evidence suggesting Nukenova died from repeated head trauma . They attempted to portray her as prone to jealousy and violence, despite no evidence from the restaurant's security cameras showing her attacking Bishimbayev.Bishimbayev, 44 years old, once celebrated as a modern, Western-educated figure within the Kazakhstani government under former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, was incarcerated for bribery in 2018. He was later granted a pardon, less than two years into his sentence.A 2018 study supported by UN Women revealed approximately 400 women in Kazakhstan die annually due to domestic violence, with many cases going unreported.In 2017, Kazakhstan decriminalized certain forms of domestic violence, categorizing them as causing ""minor"" physical damage, punishable by fines or brief imprisonment. This move mirrored Russia's actions that year, provoking outrage among advocates for women’s rights. Kazakhstan has since reversed this legislation, intensifying penalties for offenders and introducing new criminal charges, including harassment of minors.","Kuandyk Bishimbayev is on trial for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova.

"No pilots needed: US Air Force set to have over 1,000 AI-flown jets soon",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-pilots-needed-us-air-force-set-to-have-over-1000-ai-flown-jets-soon/articleshow/109883372.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the US Air Force, Artificial Intelligence is set to take the driver seat instead of a conventional pilot controlling the Air Force jet. US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall flew a fighter jet on Friday that was piloted by AI over the deserts in California, as reported by Fox news.Last month, Kendall announced his intention to pilot an AI-controlled F-16 to the US Senate appropriations committee’s defense panel, discussing the future of air warfare relying on autonomously operated drones.On Friday, the senior Air Force leader carried out his plans, achieving what might be one of the most significant advancements in military aviation since the introduction of stealth planes in the early 1990s.According to Fox news, the US Air Force plans to have more than 1,000 AI-flown planes in commission, with the first in operation by 2028Kendall traveled to Edwards Air Force base, which is the same desert facility where Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, to observe and participate in AI flight in real time.""It’s a security risk not to have it. At this point, we have to have it,"" the secretary said.The F-16, controlled by artificial intelligence and named Vista, flew Kendall in maneuvers that reached speeds exceeding 550 mph, exerting a pressure on his body equivalent to nearly five times the force of gravity.A human-piloted F-16 was flying alongside Vista and Kendall. The two jets raced within 1,000 feet of each other, performing twists and loops in an attempt to make their opponent surrender.He said that he had seen sufficient evidence to have faith in the AI technology when determining whether to use weapons in a war.Kendall said that human oversight will always be involved in the consideration of weapons.The US Air Force plans to have a fleet of more than 1,000 AI-operated drones, with the first one expected to be operational by 2028.In March, the Pentagon announced its plans to develop new artificial intelligence-guided planes. It offered two contracts to several private companies for them to compete against each other to win.The CCA project, known as the Collaborative Combat Aircraft project, is a component of a program worth $6 billion.The companies that are competing for the contract are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Atomics, and Anduril Industries.The Pentagon is interested in pursuing the project because cost-cutting is one of the elements of AI that appeals to them.In August 2023, deputy secretary of fefense Kathleen Hicks said deploying AI-enabled autonomous vehicles would provide ""small, smart, cheap and many' expendable units to the US military, helping overhaul the ""too-slow shift of US military innovation.""","US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall flew a fighter jet on Friday that was piloted by AI over the deserts in California.

Vladimir Putin: 'Leading Russia a sacred duty': Putin takes oath for record fifth presidential term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russian-president-vladidmir-purin-officially-begins-his-fifth-term/articleshow/109914444.cms,"NEW DELHI: Vladimir Putin took oath for a new term of five years as the president of Russia in a lavish Kremlin inauguration ceremony on Tuesday. Meanwhile, his critics said that he has eliminated his political rivals, initiated a devastating conflict in Ukraine, and consolidated all power under his control.He began his fifth term in a ceremony that was boycotted by the United States and many Western countries due to Russia's war on Ukraine.Putin, who has been in office for nearly 25 years since 1999 and is the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, will remain in power at least until 2030, with the option to run for another six years as per the constitution of Russia.During the inauguration ceremony, Putin told officials that leading Russia is a ""sacred duty"", and that Russia will emerge ""stronger"" after ""difficult"" period.""We will pass through this difficult period with dignity and become even stronger,"" Putin said, adding: ""We are a united and great nation, and together we will overcome all obstacles, realise everything we have planned, and together, we will win.""In a short speech, Putin also said that Russia was open to developing relations with other countries he described as ""the world's majority"".""Russia's state system must be resistant to any threats and challenges,"" he said.Russia has transformed from a nation recovering from economic collapse to a pariah state that poses a threat to global security under Putin's leadership. Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which has become Europe's largest conflict since World War II, Russia has faced severe sanctions from the West and is turning to other regimes like China, Iran, and North Korea for support.The main concern now is what the 71-year-old Putin will do over the next six years, both domestically and internationally. Russian forces are making progress in Ukraine, employing scorched-earth tactics as Kyiv struggles with shortages of men and ammunition. Both sides are suffering heavy losses.Ukraine has brought the battle to Russian soil through drone and missile attacks, particularly in border regions. In a speech in February, Putin pledged to achieve Moscow 's objectives in Ukraine and do what is necessary to ""defend our sovereignty and security of our citizens.""At home, Putin's popularity is closely linked to improving the living standards of ordinary Russians. He began his term in 2018 by promising to propel Russia into the top five global economies, declaring that it should be ""modern and dynamic.""However, Russia's economy has shifted to a war footing, and authorities are spending record amounts on defense.

"California rebrands, ditches ‘Dream Big’ slogan to avoid making political statement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-rebrands-ditches-dream-big-slogan-to-avoid-making-political-statement/articleshow/109931043.cms,"Perhaps you remember the commercials: images of the glittering blue Pacific, the majestic peaks of Yosemite, storybook vineyards and ancient redwoods stretching toward the sky.For more than 10 years, tourism advertisements have painted California as a place for dreamers, a place for adventure and testing your limits by surfing, rock-climbing and skiing. The state tourism agency, Visit California , led the campaign, which invited people from around the world to "" Dream Big "" and travel to the Golden State.Not anymore.This spring, Visit California replaced ""Dream Big"" with a new campaign and a new brand for the state, as the "" Ultimate Playground ."" The scenes in the ads are much the same as before -- with the addition of the Rady Shell, San Diego's outdoor concert venue that opened in 2021 -- but there's no longer any mention of dreams.Caroline Beteta, the CEO of Visit California, said there were a number of reasons for the switch, including that branding phrases like ""Dream Big"" tend to lose power over time and that the concept of dreaming had been popping up elsewhere, in corporate advertising.Another major driver of the ""Ultimate Playground"" campaign was a more polarized political climate across the United States, which has created antipathy toward California in some parts of the country.Beteta said that the agency's consumer research confirmed that Americans increasingly see the world through a political lens, and that framing California as a place to dream about was striking some viewers as a political statement. ""Ultimate Playground"" seemed to be a safer and less charged message.The new campaign is meant to tap into pent-up demand for excitement and travel after pandemic restrictions. Visit California's research found that 43% of consumers said vacations were the only time they could really let go and play.California's tourism sector was doing well even before the new campaign. Spending by tourists rose to a record-high $150.4 billion in 2023, Gov. Gavin Newsom said over the weekend -- surpassing 2019 and suggesting that the pandemic slump has ended. The surge generated billions of dollars in tax revenue for the state and helped create 64,900 new jobs last year.","Visit California replaced ""Dream Big"" with a new campaign and a new brand for the state.

It's a significant shift as the organization emerges from bankruptcy following a flood of sexual abuse claims and seeks to focus on inclusion .The organization steeped in tradition has made seismic changes after decades of turmoil, from finally allowing gay youth to welcoming girls throughout its ranks.With an eye on increasing flagging membership numbers, the Irving, Texas-based organization announced the name change Tuesday at its annual meeting in Florida.“In the next 100 years we want any youth in America to feel very, very welcome to come into our programs,” Roger Krone, who took over last fall as president and chief executive officer, said in an interview before the announcement.The organization began allowing gay youth in 2013 and ended a blanket ban on gay adult leaders in 2015. In 2017, it made the historic announcement that girls would be accepted as Cub Scouts as of 2018 and into the flagship Boy Scout program — renamed Scouts BSA — in 2019.There were nearly 1,000 young women in the inaugural class of female Eagle Scouts in 2021, including Selby Chipman. The all-girls troop she was a founding member of in her hometown of Oak Ridge, North Carolina, has grown from five girls to nearly 50, and she thinks the name change will encourage even more girls to realize they can join.“Girls were like: ‘You can join Boy Scouts of America?’” said Chipman, now a 20-year-old college student and assistant scoutmaster of her troop.Within days of the announcement that girls would be allowed, Bob Brady went to work. A father of two girls and a proud Eagle Scout himself, the New Jersey attorney eagerly formed an all-girls troop. At their first weekend gathering with other troops, the boys were happy to have the girls involved but some adult leaders seemed concerned, he recalled. Their worries seemed to melt away as soon as the girls led a traditional cheer around the campfire.“You could see a change in the attitude of some of the doubters who weren’t sure and they realized, wait, these kids are exactly the same, they just happen to have ponytails,” said Brady. His daughters are among the 13 girls in his troop and 6,000 girls nationwide who have achieved the vaunted Eagle Scout rank.Like other organizations, the scouts lost members during the pandemic, when participation was difficult. After a highpoint over the last decade of over 2 million members in 2018, the organization currently services just over 1 million youths, including more than 176,000 girls and young women. Membership peaked in 1972 at almost 5 million.The move by the Boy Scouts to accept girls throughout their ranks strained a bond with the Girl Scouts of the USA, which sued, saying it created marketplace confusion and damaged their recruitment efforts. They reached a settlement agreement after a judge rejected those claims, saying both groups are free to use words like “scouts” and “scouting.”While camping remains an integral activity for the Boy Scouts, the organization offers something for everyone today, from high adventures to merit badges for robotics and digital technology, Krone said: “About anything kids want to do today, they can do in a structured way within the scouting program.""The Boy Scouts’ $2.4 billion bankruptcy reorganization plan took effect last year, allowing the organization to keep operating while compensating the more than 80,000 men who say they were sexually abused as children while scouting.Angelique Minett, the first woman chairperson of Scouts BSA, gets excited about the future of scouting when she sees the about 20-person youth council from across the United States help guide the program by raising issues important to them, like sustainability, and things that they'd like to see changed, like the fit on some of the uniforms.“When we think scouts we think knots and camping, but those are a means to an end,"" Minett said. “We are actually teaching kids a much bigger thing. We are teaching them how to have grit, and we’re teaching them life skills and we’re teaching them how to be good leaders.”The organization won't officially become Scouting America until Feb. 8, 2025, the organization's 115th birthday. But Krone said he expects people will start immediately using the name.“It sends this really strong message to everyone in America that they can come to this program, they can bring their authentic self, they can be who they are and they will be welcomed here,” Krone said.","The organization began allowing gay youth in 2013 and ended a blanket ban on gay adult leaders in 2015.

'Met me in satin pants': Stormy Daniels testifies in Trump's hush money case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/met-me-in-satin-pants-stormy-daniels-testifies-in-trump-case/articleshow/109925606.cms,"NEW DELHI: Stormy Daniels , a pornstar, testified in the criminal trial of former US President Donald Trump on Tuesday.She described meeting Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006, where he was wearing satin pajamas when she arrived at his hotel suite, according to a Reuters report.During her testimony, Daniels recounted meeting Trump briefly at a meet and greet with adult actresses and golfers.She initially declined an invitation to join him for dinner but later changed her mind. When she arrived at his suite, Trump greeted her in satin pajamas, to which she quipped, ""Does Hugh Hefner know you stole his pajamas?"" Trump politely obliged when she asked him to change.Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford , is central to the case, which revolves around a $130,000 hush money payment made by Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen , to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.Justice Juan Merchan announced prior to her appearance on the stand that Daniels would be permitted to provide a straightforward account of the incident. Susan Necheles, a lawyer representing Trump, raised an objection, contending that the testimony was not directly relevant to a trial primarily focused on financial documents.In response, Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asserted that Daniels' testimony was necessary to provide a comprehensive narrative and establish her reliability as a witness. She said, “In terms of the sexual act, it will be just very basic. It’s not going to involve descriptions of genitalia or anything of that nature.”Trump, who is running for president again in the upcoming election, has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors allege that he falsely labeled reimbursement payments to Cohen in 2017 as legal expenses to cover up an illegal scheme to influence the 2016 election by buying the silence of people with potentially damaging information.The former president also received a gag order restricting him from speaking about witnesses, jurors, and others involved in the case if his statements are meant to influence the proceedings. He has been fined $10,000 for violating the order and could face jail time if he continues his attacks.This case is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump currently faces, but it is the only one certain to go to trial before the election. The other cases involve charges of trying to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat and mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all three.","Stormy Daniels, a pornstar, testified in the criminal trial of former US President Donald Trump on Tuesday.

New Russian space weapon raises alarm in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-russian-space-weapon-raises-alarm-in-us/articleshow/109919862.cms,"NEW DELHI: US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia 's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, which could potentially transform Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) into a perilous battleground. The discussions about this emerging threat were highlighted by Mallory Stewart, the US assistant secretary of state for arms control, and John Plumb, the assistant secretary of defense for space policy, underscoring the serious implications of such developments.The ASAT weapon in question, allegedly already tested by Russia in high radiation orbits under the guise of electronic testing, diverges from typical scientific satellite protocols. This weapon is designed to disrupt a wide array of satellite operations spanning civilian, commercial, and military sectors by detonating in LEO, which extends approximately 100 to 1200 miles above the Earth, a report in Asia Times said.While there is no immediate deployment, the indiscriminate nature of such a weapon could severely damage satellites and impair critical global services including communication, weather forecasting, and security operations. The US officials emphasized the widespread implications of deploying such technology, noting its potential to make LEO unusable for any satellite operations.The concept of using nuclear weapons in ASAT roles isn't new and harks back to Cold War anxieties. Historical precedents like the US's Project 437 during the Kennedy administration, which was later abandoned due to its potential to damage both enemy and US satellites and infrastructure indiscriminately, illustrate the complexities and risks associated with such weapons.Recent simulations, such as those conducted by Chinese military scientists, have explored the effects of a nuclear detonation at altitude on satellite functionality. These studies show that while a high-altitude nuclear explosion would not create a traditional explosive cloud due to the absence of air, it would generate a belt of high-energy particles trapped by Earth’s magnetic field, posing a significant risk to spacecraft.In response to the decisive role satellite constellations like Elon Musk’s Starlink have played in modern warfare, evidenced by their utility in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, both Russia and China have hinted at developing ASAT capabilities to counter these systems. Reports suggest that these nations view the neutralization of such satellite networks as crucial to diminishing their adversaries' operational effectiveness.US and allied commercial satellites, including those like Starlink which have been pivotal in supporting Ukraine, have been identified by Russian officials as potential targets in the event of escalating hostilities. This stance highlights the broader strategy of using space capabilities as a means of asserting dominance and the potential shift towards militarization of space, despite international treaties like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which seeks to bar such activities.The development and potential deployment of nuclear ASAT weapons pose not only a technological or tactical challenge but also a diplomatic and strategic one, threatening the fabric of international space law and the peaceful use of outer space.",US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite weapon.

"'Suicidal': Can China take on US, Japan navies with Fujian?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/suicidal-can-china-take-on-us-japan-navies-with-fujian/articleshow/109919659.cms,"NEW DELHI: The launch of China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian , has ignited discussions on the balance of naval power in Asia, with security analysts emphasizing the potential implications for regional dynamics, particularly affecting the Philippines . This development comes at a time of heightened military activities in the contentious South China Sea .Rommel Banlaoi, director of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, described the Fujian's deployment as a dual-edged sword. ""The sailing of China’s third aircraft carrier signals to all parties in the South China Sea that Beijing is prepared for battle,” Banlaoi told the South China Morning Post, suggesting that while the carrier could pose a threat, it might also contribute to regional stability under certain conditions.The Fujian, a Type 003 class vessel boasting 80,000 tonnes, marks a significant upgrade from China's other carriers, featuring electromagnetic catapults capable of launching more frequent sorties. This technological advancement comes as China aims to expand its blue-water navy to six aircraft carriers by 2035, positioning itself as a formidable naval power behind only the United States.The regional tension is further complicated by recent aggressive maneuvers, including an incident where the Chinese coastguard used water cannons against Philippine vessels near Scarborough Shoal. This action underlines the ongoing disputes and the volatile situation in the area, the SCMP report said.Despite this, Banlaoi emphasized the need for diplomatic engagement to de-escalate tensions. ""The situation in the waterways is becoming more worrisome now because all parties are increasing their military activities. And that is not good for regional peace and stability. What we need now is to de-escalate the current tensions in the South China Sea and conduct more diplomacy,” he said.While the Philippines and its allies, notably the United States and Japan, strengthen their military cooperation through exercises and strategic bases, analysts remain cautious. Jose Antonio Custodio noted the overwhelming power of combined US and Japanese naval forces and dismissed the idea of a direct challenge by China as ""suicidal."" He metaphorically described the regional military alignment as “the Japanese anvil for an American hammer” aimed at containing Chinese maritime ambitions.The strategic posturing in the South China Sea continues to draw international attention, with potential implications for regional security and the balance of power in Asia.","The launch of China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has ignited discussions on the balance of naval power in Asia.

The Dow Jones' recent gains notwithstanding, Cardone highlighted the alarming trend in the S&P's yield curve, which has been inverted for over 500 days—a historical precursor to significant market downturns including those in 1929, 1974, and 2009.In a recent statement on the social media platform X, Cardone outlined the dire consequences of such a crash, compounded by current inflation rates, which could effectively amplify total losses to feel more like 75%.""WARNING: Stock Market is due for 50 percent correction taking S&P below 2674,"" he cautioned, emphasizing the risk to retirement accounts heavily invested in the stock market at these levels, a Daily Mail report said.Cardone, who has advised companies such as Google and Morgan Stanley, drew parallels between the current market indicators and those that preceded major financial crises in the past. He explained that following the historical crashes, the market declines erased significant value from Americans' 401Ks, affecting their long-term savings and financial security.The financial expert also criticized the Federal Reserve's recent rate hikes, arguing that they have stifled the housing market rather than controlling inflation as intended. ""Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has not controlled inflation. He has failed miserably,"" Cardone said. He suggests that reducing interest rates might rejuvenate the housing market, encouraging more sales and potentially lowering house prices.To safeguard against potential financial turmoil, Cardone recommends transitioning retirement funds from stock market-dependent 401ks to real assets that generate consistent cash flow, such as property investments. He believes this strategy could provide retirees with a more stable and reliable income source.This warning comes as Manhattan sees a drop in rents for the first time since the pandemic, signaling potential shifts in the real estate market that could offer investment opportunities amid economic uncertainties.","Grant Cardone, a seasoned private equity fund manager, has issued a stark warning about an imminent stock market crash that could see values halve.

The event coincided with a globally observed ""Day of Rage"" organized by the activist group Within Our Lifetime.As per a New York Post report, the demonstrators, blocked by police from nearing the Met, redirected their protest to Central Park where they defaced the One Hundred Seventh Infantry Memorial.The base of this World War I memorial was spray-painted with the word ""Gaza"" in large black letters. Protesters also burned an American flag at the site and placed stickers and Palestinian flags on the statues, with messages that read “Stop the Genocide. End the apartheid. Free Palestine.”As the night unfolded, another monument in Central Park, the Gen William Tecumseh Sherman statue, was similarly vandalized. ""Free Gaza"" was written in red letters on the statue's base, and a Palestinian flag was affixed to the front.Earlier in the evening, police had arrested about two dozen protesters on Madison Ave and East 83rd Street as they marched from Hunter College toward the Met. Despite the large police presence, the crowd managed to block traffic along Fifth Avenue until being stopped near the East 79th Street Transverse in Central Park. They chanted, “Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest,” while displaying Palestinian flags and wearing keffiyehs.Confusion ensued as protesters, initially rerouted into Central Park by police, found themselves at a standstill without clear directions on how to proceed. After some time, they exited the park and attempted to approach the Met once more but were halted by a police blockade.In a separate but related event, nearly 1,000 pro-Israel demonstrators gathered at Riverside Park in support of Jewish students facing antisemitism at universities like Columbia University. The rally was held on Yom HaShoah, the day of Holocaust remembrance, emphasizing the need to combat antisemitism and remember past atrocities.Gilad Erdan, the Israeli ambassador to the UN, spoke at the rally, comparing the anti-Israel protests to actions of ""modern-day Nazis"" and criticized what he described as a selective outrage that overlooks other global injustices. Erdan emphasized the urgency of action against antisemitism, especially in academic environments.The day's events highlighted ongoing tensions and divisions regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, manifesting both locally and internationally.","On Monday, over 1,000 protesters advocating for Palestinian rights clashed with police and vandalized public monuments while attempting to reach the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Tuesday said the attack on a Chinese engineers' convoy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in March, which killed five Chinese nationals, was planned in Afghanistan .""The March suicide bombing connects to Afghanistan. The planning of this terror act was done in Afghanistan. Terrorists and their facilitators were also being controlled from Afghanistan and the suicide bomber was also an Afghan [national],"" said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Maj-Gen Ahmed.Over the past few months, Pakistan has repeatedly criticised the Taliban regime in Kabul for helping terrorists carry out attacks targeting security personnel, and Chinese nationals working on projects linked to Beijing's crucial Belt and Road Initiative.Speaking at a press conference, military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif strongly condemned the acts of terrorism and assured that necessary actions were being taken to bring the facilitators to justice.Despite Pakistan's efforts for peace in the region and hosting Afghan refugees, TTP terrorists continue to launch attacks from Afghan soil, he said.The DG added that Pakistan had presented concrete evidence to the Afghan interim government, but no positive progress has been made.""There is concrete evidence that TTP terrorists are still using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan ... In this regard, we have registered 12 protests and the army chief has taken a clear stance that Pakistan has its reservations on hideouts of banned outfits in Afghanistan,"" said Sharif.The DG ISPR emphasized that Pakistan will take all measures to eradicate terror networks and protect its citizens.""Pakistan will leave no stone unturned to eradicate terror networks and provide protection to its citizens at all costs ... the purpose of the armed forces is to establish peace in the country ... to ensure this, we will go to every extent to suppress the terrorists and their patrons and enablers,"" said Sharif.Pakistan recently carried out counter-attacks in Afghanistan's border areas, targeting terrorist safe havens.The DG ISPR mentioned that in 2024, security forces have conducted 13,135 operations against terrorists and their facilitators, resulting in the elimination of 249 terrorists and the arrest of 396 others.Pakistani forces are carrying out more than 100 operations daily against terrorism.","Pakistan says attack on Chinese engineers' convoy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in March was planned in Afghanistan.

This completes the NA’s total strength of 336 seats.In March, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had ruled that SIC was not eligible for reserved seats and decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries. The verdict was rejected by PTI as unconstitutional and the alliance had filed a plea against the electoral watchdog’s decision in the Peshawar HC, but it rejected the appeal.In response, SIC moved the Supreme Court last month urging it to allot the party the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and set aside the Peshawar HC ruling.Accepting SIC’s appeal for a hearing, the apex court clarified that the Peshawar HC order upholding ECP’s decision was suspended to the extent of the remaining reserved seats distributed among other parties.After losing the extra reserved seats, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government had lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities.

However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.

You are behaving like [government's] B-team against PTI.""Khan highlighted the unresolved issues regarding PTI's electoral symbol, alleged rigging during general elections and the status of PTI's petitions , behind his allegations of PTI being denied level playing field.He criticized the judiciary for what he perceived as coerced decisions and urged Supreme Court judges to emulate the stance of high court judges in rejecting wrongful decisions.Expressing a willingness to engage in dialogue, Khan conditioned it upon the return of what he claimed was a 'stolen mandate' and the release of imprisoned party workers. He stressed that dialogue typically occurs with adversaries, hinting at a potential negotiation with PTI's perceived adversaries.Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry had suggested that if Khan struck a deal with the establishment, he would effectively become Shehbaz Sharif.Chaudhry's remarks surfaced amidst discussions surrounding alleged talks between PTI and the establishment, which were initiated by senior PTI leader Shehryar Afridi.

They are constructed in cubic shape, often weigh no more than a few kg, and are deployed in space for various purposes.Weighing around 7 kg, the iCUBE-Q orbiter carries two cameras to take images of the lunar surface and has other sensors and apparatus for deep-space communication, altitude control, and other functions.The primary criteria for mission success, officials said, will be achieved with the successful separation of the iCUBE-Q from the Chang’e-6 Orbiter. Following separation, the secondary criteria will involve the satellite receiving a beacon signal that will confirm that the orbiter is working satisfactorily.Finally, the orbiter will take pictures of the Earth, and Moon and try to take pictures of at least two objects together (Earth, Moon, and the orbiter).As part of data collection, authorities said, iCUBE-Q will also collect data on the lunar magnetic field, establish a lunar magnetic field model, and lay the groundwork for future missions and international lunar cooperation.Dr Khurram Khurshid, a senior member associated with Pakistan’s space programme, said the satellite will reach the lunar orbit in five days and will circle the moon for three to six months.He added that different pictures of the surface of the moon will be taken with the orbiter’s help, after which Pakistan will have its own satellite images of the Moon for research.","Pakistan launched its first-ever lunar mission, iCube-Qamar, on Friday.

All that is left for Pak Army is to 'murder me': Imran Khan writes from prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/all-that-is-left-for-pak-army-is-to-murder-me-imran-khan-writes-from-prison/articleshow/109821286.cms,"LONDON/ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country where political leaders like him languish in jail and said all that is left for the powerful military leadership was to ""murder"" him.In a column for the UK's ‘Daily Telegraph' newspaper, penned from the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi where he is being held for disputed corruption charges, the 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician reiterated his previous assertion that if anything happens to him or his wife, General Asim Munir – the Chief of Army Staff, will be responsible.The founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said the cash-strapped country was at a “dangerous crossroads”, with the government a “laughing stock”.“The military establishment has done all they could against me. All that is left for them is to now murder me,” writes Khan.“I have stated publicly that if anything happens to me or my wife (Bushra Bibi), Gen. Asim Munir will be responsible. But I am not afraid because my faith is strong. I would prefer death over slavery,” he says.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy. However, the military has denied meddling in the country's politics.Khan warned that the state was treading the same path it trod in 1971, when it lost East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.“At the same time, it is seeing an upsurge in terrorism and a growing alienation in Balochistan where the issue of enforced disappearances is growing in severity. On Pakistan's borders, India has already admitted to undertaking assassinations inside of Pakistan and the international border with Afghanistan remains volatile,” he notes.Khan notes the military establishment's expectation of “unquestioning support” from the US, in return for the provision of access to airspace and related facilities to the US for military purposes, has been punctured after the publication of the latest US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which highlights the many human rights violations in Pakistan.“With an economy in crisis, spiralling prices and a people politically angry at having their electoral mandate stolen and being economically beleaguered, the state stands isolated,” he writes.Khan hailed the “democratic revenge” of the February 8 general election, during which people came out and “voted overwhelmingly” for candidates supported by his party.“Unfortunately, instead of accepting the people's mandate, the military establishment went into a fit of rage and electoral results were manipulated to bring into power the losers. The same vote tampering was seen in the recent by-elections,” he notes.The PTI founder also praised the six “brave judges” of the Islamabad High Court who have written a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan highlighting instances of harassment and blackmail including of their families by intelligence agencies.“This is unprecedented in our history – although, informally, many knew what was happening to the senior judiciary but for such a letter to have come from these judges shows the level of despair, anger and frustration,” he writes.","Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country.

Zay Yar Tun fills his truck with water for delivery to refugees in the parched hills of war-ravaged eastern Myanmar, where a heatwave is adding to the misery of life in displacement camps.Under a roof of plastic sheets in one of the camps in Kayah state, Augusta waits for the 10 gallons that must cover her family's drinking, cooking and washing needs for the next three days.More than 123,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Kayah by the conflict unleashed by the military's 2021 coup, according to the United Nations .Now, a heatwave that has sent the mercury in Myanmar to 48 degrees Celsius (118 Fahrenheit) in some places has added to uncertainties of life in the camps.""Last year, we got water from a spring nearby,"" Augusta told AFP.""But now we can't get water from that place as there is no water left there.""We have to be frugal... If we don't shower today, maybe tomorrow we can wash our hands and faces.""The scarcity means she and her children are often unable to wash properly or clean their clothes in the baking heat.""The children are itching and they seem dirty, and we also don't have clean clothes for them,"" she said.A dozen or so camp residents queue up at the truck for water rations that will have to last them three or four days.Children carry the containers home in baskets on their backs or via trolleys as hot wind whips up dust from the dirt road.""When there were only residents living in this place, there was enough water,"" said Zay Yar Tun, of the charity Clean Yangon.""But after the displaced people fled here, the population is too much for the amount of water we can get here.""Donations keep Zay Yar Tun's team and its two trucks running, and they make two deliveries to the camp each week.Finding the streams or springs to fill up their truck can be dangerous in Kayah, which has emerged as one of the hotspots of resistance to military rule.The military regularly calls in air and artillery strikes on its opponents and landmines are a constant danger.Transporting cargo to the camps is difficult too.The fuel the team needs to run their trucks and pumps is expensive because of military restrictions on importing fuel into Kayah, Zay Yar Tun said.""The price of fuel is very expensive, and it seems like we are exchanging fuel to get water,"" he said.Families like Augusta's are forced to make similar calculations as they try to get through the heat.""If we are going to take a bath in the creek, we have to go far away from the camp,"" she said.""It's not a walkable distance under this temperature.""""If we go by motorcycle, it's not worth it because of the cost of fuel. If we save money for fuel, we may as well use it to buy water.""Respite in the form of the rainy season may be some way off yet.Myanmar's weather office has forecast that the monsoon, which usually begins around May, is likely to arrive late this year, state media reported this week.Until then, water will be priceless in the camp, said Augusta.""Sometimes we say to each other: 'I haven't got any water left, have you got any? Please could you give me some?'"" she said.""Our life has come to this, where we have to borrow water.""","More than 123,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Kayah state.

The Islamic State group says it was behind a mosque attack in Afghanistan that killed 6 people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/the-islamic-state-group-says-it-was-behind-a-mosque-attack-in-afghanistan-that-killed-6-people/articleshow/109759726.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a deadly shooting this week targeting members of the country's minority Shiite community inside a mosque in western Afghanistan that killed six people. The militant group said in a statement posted on its Telegram website late on Tuesday that one of its members attacked a ""Shiite temple"" in Herat province with machine-gun fire.The attack, which took place on Monday night in the district of Guzara, also left one person wounded.The attacker fled the scene. The Taliban Interior Ministry has said that an investigation is underway.Local media reported that the mosque's imam was among those killed. The UN mission in Afghanistan condemned the attack, saying a child was among the victims. It called for urgent accountability for perpetrators and protection measures for Shiite communities.Afghanistan's former President Hamid Karzai said on the social media platform X that he considered""this terrorist act against all religious and human standards.""Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry said on Wednesday that ""the people and government of Pakistan extend their heartfelt condolences to the people of Afghanistan.""""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families in this hour of grief,"" it said.The statement added that Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms.The IS affiliate in Afghanistan is a major Taliban rival and frequently targets schools, hospitals, mosques and Shiite areas throughout the country.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, during the last weeks of the chaotic departure of US and Nato troops from the country after 20 years of war.Despite initial promises of a more moderate stance, the Taliban gradually reimposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, as they did during their previous rule of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.","Islamic State group claims responsibility for deadly shooting at mosque in Afghanistan.
