"Russian assassination plots against those supporting Ukraine uncovered in Europe, official says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russian-assassination-plots-against-those-supporting-ukraine-uncovered-in-europe-official-says/articleshow/111703277.cms,"WASHINGTON: Western intelligence agencies have uncovered Russian plots to carry out assassinations, arson and other sabotage in Europe against companies and people linked to support for Ukraine 's military - one of the most serious being a plan to kill the head of a German arms manufacturer , a Western government official said.The plots have sometimes involved recruiting common criminals in foreign countries to conduct the attacks, said the official, who is familiar with the situation but not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.One major plot recently uncovered had targeted Armin Papperger, CEO of defense company Rheinmetall, the official said.The official declined to offer any details on other plots, which were first reported by CNN. The CNN report said the US informed Germany, whose security services were able to protect Papperger and foil the plot.Rheinmetall is a major supplier of military technology and artillery rounds for Ukraine as it fights off Russian forces. The company last month opened an armored vehicle maintenance and repair facility in western Ukraine and also aims to start production inside the country.White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson declined to comment on the alleged plot to kill Papperger but said, ""Russia's intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months.""""The United States has been discussing this issue with our Nato allies , and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,"" Watson added. ""We have also been clear that Russia's actions will not deter allies from continuing to support Ukraine.""Neither Rheinmetall nor the German government would comment Friday on the reported plot against Papperger. The Interior Ministry can't comment on ""individual threat situations,"" spokesperson Maximilian Kall said, but he added that more broadly, ""we take the significantly increased threat from Russian aggression very seriously.""""We know that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's regime wants above all to undermine our support for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian war of aggression, but the German government won't be intimidated,"" Kall said.He noted that German security measures have increased significantly since 2022 and that ""the threats range from espionage and sabotage, through cyberattacks, to state terrorism.""European officials gathered for the Nato summit in Washington this week spoke of dealing with an escalation of ""hybrid"" attacks that they blame on Russia and its allies.That includes what authorities called suspicious recent fires at industrial and commercial sites in Lithuania, Poland, the United Kingdom, Germany and other nations, and charges that Russia-allied Belarus was sending large numbers of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa to the borders of Poland, Latvia and other countries belonging to Nato.When asked at a news conference at the Nato summit Thursday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he could not comment on the CNN report. He did note a widespread campaign by Russian security services to conduct ""hostile actions"" against Nato allies, including sabotage, cyberattacks and arson.""These are not standalone instances. These are part of a pattern, part of an ongoing Russian campaign. And the purpose of this campaign is, of course, to intimidate Nato allies from supporting Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said.In April, German investigators arrested two German-Russian men on suspicion of espionage, one of them accused of agreeing to carry out attacks on potential targets, including US military facilities, in hopes of sabotaging aid for Ukraine.Germany has become the second-biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine after the United States since Russia started its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the report of a plan to kill Papperger. ""All of this is again presented in the fake style, so such reports cannot be taken seriously,"" he told reporters Friday.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to his Russian counterpart, Andrei Belousov, on Friday, their second call in less than a month, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh announced at a briefing Friday. The call was initiated by the Russian defense minister, Singh said.She did not have further details to share, including whether the two leaders spoke about the accusations that Russia had attempted to assassinate top officials of Western defense firms producing weapons systems that are sent to Ukraine, but said ""maintaining lines of communication is incredibly important right now.""","Western intelligence agencies have uncovered Russian plots to carry out assassinations, arson and other sabotage in Europe. One of the most serious was a plan to kill the head of a German arms manufacturer.

'Cosmic ballet': Nasa unveils stunning images of two galaxies merging in Space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/cosmic-ballet-nasa-unveils-stunning-images-of-two-galaxies-merging-in-space/articleshow/111702750.cms,"Nasa on Friday unveiled a set of images of two galaxies merging in sort of a "" cosmic ballet "". The galaxies, affectionately named the Penguin and the Egg , are located 326 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra.The release of these images marked the second anniversary of the telescope's first scientific results.The image was taken by the James Webb Space Telescope which was launched in 2021 and began collecting the data since that year.Since becoming operational, Webb has observed galaxies teeming with stars that formed within a few hundred million years of the Big Bang event that marked the beginning of the universe about 13.8 billion years ago.""We see two galaxies, each a collection of billions of stars. The galaxies are in the process of merging. That's a common way that galaxies like our own build up over time, to grow from small galaxies - like those that Webb has found shortly after the Big Bang – into mature galaxies like our own Milky Way,"" Reuters quoted Jane Rigby, Nasa Webb senior project scientist, as saying.The Penguin and Egg galaxies, collectively known as Arp 142, are shown in the images connected by a haze of stars and gas as they slowly merge. The Penguin galaxy, formally called NGC 2936, is a distorted spiral galaxy, while the Egg galaxy, NGC 2937, is a compact elliptical galaxy. Their interaction began between 25 and 75 million years ago, and they are expected to become a single galaxy in hundreds of millions of years.Webb has made significant contributions to the understanding of the universe, detecting the earliest known galaxies and providing insights into exoplanet composition and star-forming regions.""This mission has allowed us to look back to the most distant galaxies ever observed and understand the very early universe in a new way,"" said Mark Clampin, astrophysics division director at NASA headquarters. ""For example, with Webb, we've found that these very early galaxies are more massive and brighter than we expected, posing the question: How did they get so big so quickly?""As the largest and most powerful telescope ever put in space, Webb specialises in capturing infrared light, allowing it to see through dust and gas and examine the composition of exoplanet atmospheres with unprecedented detail. Looking to the future, Clampin added, ""Some of Webb's most exciting investigations will be the things we haven't even thought of yet.""","Nasa unveils images of two galaxies merging in sort of a "" cosmic ballet"" The galaxies, affectionately named the Penguin and the Egg, are located 326 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra.

Turkey introduces contentious bill targeting stray dogs; sparks outcry from rights groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/turkey-introduces-contentious-bill-targeting-stray-dogs-sparks-outcry-from-rights-groups/articleshow/111702653.cms,"(With agency inputs)

Turkey's ruling party , led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , introduced a contentious bill in parliament aimed at addressing the country's rising stray dog population. The proposed legislation states that stray dogs would be removed from the streets and placed in shelters where they would undergo neutering and spaying.The proposal, presented by senior legislator from the ruling party Abdullah Guler, also said that dogs at risk of rabies, exhibiting aggressive behavior, and having no possibility of rehabilitation would be euthanized.The proposal also requires municipalities to improve conditions in existing shelters and encourages people to adopt the dogs.The proposal has raised concerns among critics who fear it will lead to dogs being held in overcrowded shelters and potentially result in the killing of many animals. The bill has sparked a debate between animal rights activists and those who advocate for measures to ensure the safety of streets from feral dogs.According to Erdogan , an estimated four million stray dogs are currently roaming on the streets and countryside of Turkey. The initial proposal, which was not submitted to parliament, reportedly called for the strays to be collected, placed in shelters, and euthanized if not adopted within 30 days. This proposal had sparked a public outcry, with animal rights activists arguing that it would lead to the mass killing of unadopted dogs.The Safe Streets and Defense of the Right to Life Association, an organization advocating for the removal of all stray dogs from the streets, released a report noting that 65 people have died in street dog attacks since 2022. The government pledged to address the issue earlier this year after a child in Ankara was severely injured in a dog attack.Animal rights groups argue that the existing legislation, which requires stray dogs to be caught, neutered, spayed, and returned to their original location, has not been properly implemented over the years, leading to the explosion of the feral dog population. They believe that proper implementation of these regulations would be sufficient to control the population.Recently, Britain issued a warning to travelers to Turkey regarding stray dogs, which pointed out that they often form packs and can be aggressive. Visitors were advised to exercise caution and avoid approaching them.",Turkey's ruling party introduced a contentious bill in parliament aimed at addressing the country's rising stray dog population.

Nepal PM Prachanda approves rail deal with China ahead of no-confidence vote: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-pm-prachanda-approves-rail-deal-with-china-ahead-of-no-confidence-vote-report/articleshow/111703179.cms,"KATHMANDU: A day before Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ' Prachanda ' lost a vote of confidence in Parliament, he gave a nod to an agreement to connect the Himalayan nation with China by rail under Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. Quoting government sources, the MyRepublica news portal said this decision carries more operational than political significance and aligns with Nepal's participation in Chinese President Xi Jinping 's multi-billion-dollar pet infrastructure project.""The Cabinet meeting held on Thursday decided to approve the 'Strengthening the Development Cooperation in Building the Trans-Himalayan Multidimensional Connectivity Network' agreement between Nepal and China,"" the report quoted Communication Minister and the government's spokesperson Rekha Sharma as saying.However, a minister downplayed its immediate impact, stating, ""This is an initial decision; details of project implementation and BRI modalities are yet to be finalised.""'Prachanda' lost the vote of confidence in Parliament on Friday after coalition partner Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) withdrew support for him, a development that will lead to the formation of a new government led by ex-prime minister K P Sharma Oli .Prachanda received only 63 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives (HoR) and there were 194 votes against the motion. At least 138 votes are needed to win the vote of trust. A total of 258 HoR members participated in the voting while one member abstained.Prachanda's move, made just before he departed from office, is viewed not only as progress towards implementing BRI projects but also crucial for initiatives like the Kerung-Kathmandu railway and broader infrastructure development along the Nepal-China border, the report said.Earlier, ahead of signing a power-sharing agreement with UML, the Nepali Congress had resolved to ""only accept grants and not loans under the BRI project"". The government was also set to decide on implementing the 2017 BRI agreement with China, which has been pending at the cabinet.The BRI has raised global concerns over China's debt diplomacy of extending huge loans to smaller countries for unsustainable infrastructure projects. The Hambantota port, which was funded by a Chinese loan, was leased to Beijing in a 99-year debt-for-equity swap in 2017 after Sri Lanka failed to pay off the debt.India has protested to China over BRI's USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor flagship project as it is being laid through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).",Cabinet meeting held on Thursday decided to approve the 'Strengthening the Development Cooperation in Building the Trans-Himalayan Multidimensional Connectivity Network' Prachanda's move is viewed not only as progress towards implementing BRI projects but also crucial for initiatives like the Kerung- Kathmandu railway.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111703212,imgsize-714575,width-400,resizemode-4/111703212.jpg"
These Picassos prompted a gender war at an Australian gallery. Now the curator says she painted them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/these-picassos-prompted-a-gender-war-at-an-australian-gallery-now-the-curator-says-she-painted-them/articleshow/111703332.cms,"WELLINGTON: They were billed as artworks by Pablo Picasso , paintings so valuable that an Australian art museum 's decision to display them in an exhibition restricted to women visitors provoked a gender discrimination lawsuit. The paintings again prompted international headlines when the gallery re-hung them in a women's restroom to sidestep a legal ruling that said men could not be barred from viewing them.But the artworks at the center of the uproar were not really by Picasso or the other famed artists billed as their creators, it emerged this week when the curator of the women-only exhibition admitted she had painted them herself.Kirsha Kaechele wrote on the blog of Tasmania's Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) on Wednesday that she was revealing herself as the works' creator after receiving questions from a reporter and the Picasso Administration in France about their authenticity.But they had been displayed for more than three years before their provenance was questioned, she said, even though she had accidentally hung one of the fake paintings upside down.""I imagined that a Picasso scholar, or maybe just a Picasso fan, or maybe just someone who googles things, would visit the Ladies Lounge and see that the painting was upside down and expose me on social media,"" Kaechele wrote. But no one did.The saga began when Kaechele created a women-only area at MONA in 2020 for visitors to ""revel in the pure company of women"" and as a statement on their exclusion from male-dominated spaces throughout history.The so-called Ladies Lounge offered high tea, massages and champagne served by male butlers, and was open to anyone who identified as a woman. Outlandish and absurd title cards were displayed alongside the fake paintings, antiquities and jewelry that was ""quite obviously new and in some cases plastic,"" she added.The lounge had to display ""the most important artworks in the world,"" Kaechele wrote this week, in order for men ""to feel as excluded as possible.""It worked. MONA - famous in Australia for its strange and subversive exhibitions and events - was ordered by the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in March to stop refusing men entry to the Ladies Lounge after a complaint from a male gallery patron who was upset at being barred from the space during a 2023 visit.""The participation by visitors in the process of being permitted or refused entry is part of the artwork itself,"" tribunal Deputy President Richard Grueber wrote in his decision, which found the exhibition was discriminatory.Grueber ruled that the man had suffered a disadvantage, in part because the artworks in the Ladies Lounge were so valuable. Kaechele had described them to the hearing as ""a carefully curated selection of paintings by the world's leading artists, including two paintings that spectacularly demonstrate Picasso's genius.""The tribunal ordered MONA to cease refusing men entry. In his ruling, Grueber also lambasted a group of women who had attended in support of Kaechele wearing matching business attire and had silently crossed and uncrossed their legs in unison throughout the hearing. One woman ""was pointedly reading feminist texts,"" he wrote, and the group left the tribunal ""in a slow march led by Ms Kaechele to the sounds of a Robert Palmer song.""Their conduct was ""inappropriate, discourteous and disrespectful, and at worst contumelious and contemptuous,"" Grueber added.Rather than admit men to the exhibit, Kaechele -- who is married to the gallery's owner, David Walsh -- installed a working toilet in the space, turning it into a women's restroom in order to exploit a legal loophole to allow the refusal of men to continue.International news outlets covered the development in May, apparently without questioning that a gallery would hang Picasso paintings in a public restroom. However, the Guardian reported Wednesday that it had asked Kaechele about the authenticity of the work, prompting her confession.A spokesperson for MONA told The Associated Press that the gallery would not supply more detail about the letter Kaechele said she had received from the Picasso Administration. When the AP asked MONA to confirm that the statements in Kaechele's blog post, titled ""Art is Not Truth: Pablo Picasso,"" were accurate, the spokesperson, Sara Gates-Matthews, said the post was ""truthfully Kirsha's admission.""The Picasso Administration, which manages the late Spanish artist's estate, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""I'm flattered that people believed my great-grandmother summered with Picasso at her Swiss chateau where he and my grandmother were lovers when she threw a plate at him for indiscretions (of a kind) that bounced off his head and resulted in the crack you see inching through the gold ceramic plate in the Ladies Lounge,"" Kaechele wrote this week, referring to the title card on one painting.""The real plate would have killed him - it was made of solid gold. Well, it would have dented his forehead because the real plate is actually a coin.""",Paintings by Pablo Picasso were displayed in an exhibition restricted to women. The gallery re-hung them in a women's restroom to sidestep a legal ruling that said men could not be barred from viewing them.

Donors to pro-Biden super PAC are said to withhold Roughly $90 Million,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donors-to-pro-biden-super-pac-are-said-to-withhold-roughly-90-million/articleshow/111703114.cms,"Some major Democratic donors have told the largest pro-Biden super political action committee, Future Forward , that pledges worth roughly $90 million are now on hold if President Joe Biden remains atop the ticket, according to two people who have been briefed on the conversations.The frozen contributions include multiple eight-figure commitments, according to the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, given the sensitivity of the situation.The decision to withhold such enormous sums of money is one of the most concrete examples of the fallout from Biden's poor debate performance at the end of June.Future Forward declined to comment on any conversations with donors or the amounts of any pledged money being withheld. A Future Forward adviser would say only that the group expected contributors who had paused donations to return once the current uncertainty about the ticket was resolved.Separately, one donor to the group described being approached multiple times by Future Forward since the debate for a contribution but said he and his friends had been ""holding off.""The two people briefed on the frozen pledges declined to say which individual donors were pulling back promised checks, which were estimated to total around or above $90 million. It was not clear how much of the pledged money was earmarked for Future Forward's super PAC versus its nonprofit arm, which has also been running advertising in key battleground states.A separate person close to the group said the super PAC had been shying away from making major strategic decisions until it gets more clarity on who will be atop the ticket, though Chauncey McLean, the president of Future Forward, said that characterization was inaccurate in a statement: ""Our decisions are solely made in service of supporting President Biden based on the resources available to us.""An aide to one major Future Forward donor, billionaire Reid Hoffman, who has given $7 million to the super PAC, said that donors were making a mistake in withholding money.""A funding freeze is a problematic strategy at this point in the election cycle,"" said Rae Steward, who advises Hoffman on his giving. ""If donors are committed to making a statement by withholding capital from Future Forward or the Biden campaign,"" she said, then they should make larger donations to progressive nonprofit groups that are ""agnostic about who is at the top of the ticket.""Steward said that Hoffman had donated $3 million more to the super PAC last month, before the debate.The cash freeze comes as some advisers around Biden are discussing how to persuade the president to exit the race and as his campaign has begun to test Vice President Kamala Harris in head-to-head surveys of voters against former President Donald Trump . The number of congressional Democrats calling for Biden to step aside is growing by the day.The potential shortfall in super PAC cash comes as the campaign itself is bracing for a rough July fundraising period as major donors question Biden's viability to win in November.In a news conference Thursday evening, Biden dug in. ""I believe I'm the best qualified to govern,"" he said. ""And I think I'm the best qualified to win.""Future Forward was anointed by Biden's campaign as its leading super PAC in the early stages of the 2024 race, and it has already announced $250 million in television and digital advertising reservations set to begin at the end of the Democratic National Convention next month.A leaked poll from a group closely linked with Future Forward after the debate showed that the super PAC had tested the strength of potential Biden alternatives, including Harris, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary.The poll showed that Biden had a worse overall favorability rating than all the alternatives.The group convened donors just before the debate for a discussion on the state of its fundraising and the race, according to two people who attended the briefing. Officials with the group told donors that between the super PAC and its nonprofit arm, they hoped to raise $700 million or more for the election and had collected $430 million at that point.","Some major Democratic donors have told the largest pro-Biden super political action committee that pledges are now on hold.

US President Joe Biden hit the campaign trail on Friday with the aim to reassure voters and fellow Democrats about his ability to lead, following a major press conference that failed to quell calls for his withdrawal from the race. During a visit to a diner in Northville, Michigan, a crucial swing state he must secure in November to defeat Donald Trump , the 81-year-old said, ""We've got to finish the job.And I promise you I am OK.""Later in Detroit, Biden delivered a speech cautioning against the ""nightmare"" of a second Trump term, based on a far-right agenda that his campaign is attributing to the former president.""There's been a lot of speculation lately. What's Joe Biden going to do, is he going to stay in the race, is he going to drop out?"" Biden told supporters in the city of Detroit, to chants of ""Don't you quit!""""Here's my answer: I am running and we're going to win! I'm not going to change that,"" Biden said.The president's communications director, Michael Tyler, told reporters that Biden understands the lingering concerns and is determined to prove he is the best candidate to take on and defeat Trump in November. He downplayed Biden's verbal missteps, noting that he has been known for making them throughout his lengthy political career.Despite Biden's efforts to reach out to lawmakers and the support of top Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, the debate surrounding his fitness for office continued to impact Democratic donors. Some high-profile supporters, such as actor George Clooney, have called for Biden to step aside, while a significant amount of pledged donations is reportedly on hold pending his decision to continue running.An increasing number of Democrats voiced their concerns about Biden's candidacy. Former Vice President's lackluster showing during a crucial debate against then-President Donald Trump only amplified these apprehensions.Trump, who mocked Biden on social media during the press conference, later said that the gaffe involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was ""unpardonable."" However, he added that Biden ""shouldn't allow complete losers like George Clooney, under the total auspices and control of Barack Hussein Obama, to push him out of office.

Slip-ups to addressing health concerns: Key takeaways from Biden's press conference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/slip-ups-to-addressing-health-concerns-key-takeaways-from-bidens-press-conference/articleshow/111674611.cms,"Here are the key takeaways from Biden's first solo news conference:

Slip-up came early

On Kamala Harris being a potential replacement

On Israel-Gaza war

Will Biden drop out of the race?

On health concerns

US President Joe Biden faced the much-anticipated challenge on Thursday - a solo press conference where he was questioned by the White House press corps.The purpose of this news conference was to reassure discouraged Democratic lawmakers, allies, and persuadable voters in the upcoming election that Biden still possesses the strength and stamina required to be president.Biden has blamed his dismal debate performance on ""feeling terrible"" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign.During the press conference, President Biden made a notable gaffe early on when he mistakenly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as ""Vice President Trump."" The slip-up occurred while explaining his decision to choose her as his running mate, believing she could defeat Trump in an election.Prior to the news conference, Biden had already committed a significant blunder at the NATO summit, which instantly lowered expectations for his performance. While introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Biden accidentally said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin."" The mistake immediately elicited gasps from the audience. Realizing his error, Biden quickly corrected himself, turning to Zelenskyy and saying, ""President Putin? You're going to beat President Putin.""When a reporter brought up Biden's reference to ""Vice President Trump"" and pointed out that the presumptive Republican nominee's campaign was already capitalizing on the slip-up, the President remained defiant. ""Listen to him,"" he said before exiting the stage, refusing to engage further with the question or acknowledge the potential impact of his mistake.When asked about Harris' capability to take over his role, Biden affirmed his confidence in her qualifications, stating, ""I wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president,"" and highlighted her experience as a prosecutor and US Senator.However, when questioned further, Biden admitted that he had shifted away from his 2020 campaign promise to serve as a ""bridge"" to a new generation of Democrats.He attributed this change to ""the gravity of the situation I inherited,"" without mentioning his vice president. Biden emphasized his commitment to completing his current responsibilities, repeatedly asserting, ""I've got to finish this job.""Biden announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire framework, although some details still need to be finalized. He mentioned that he had dispatched his team to the region to work out the specifics of the agreement.""That framework is now agreed on by both Israel and Hamas. So I sent my team to the region to hammer out the details,"" Biden said in a news conference.The President also stated that the conflict between Israel and Gaza must end immediately, and that Israel should not occupy the enclave once the war concludes. Additionally, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the outcome of some of his initiatives in Gaza, particularly the planned closure of the US military's humanitarian pier off the coast of Gaza. ""I was hopeful that would be more successful,"" he said.President Biden dismissed concerns about his capability to serve another term, despite stumbling over a reference to Donald Trump early in the press conference.""I'm not in this for my legacy. I'm in this to complete the job I started,"" Biden asserted, emphasizing that his support among voters remained strong and that he would continue his campaign and secure victory.Regardless of any missteps, the president countered all implications that he was slowing down, exhibiting significant signs of decline, or struggling to lead effectively. However, he faced increasing pressure from politicians, public figures, and prominent members of the Democratic Party to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race .""My schedule has been full bore,"" he affirmed. ""So if I slow down and I cant get the job done, that's a sign that I shouldn't be doing it. But there's no indication of that yet — none.""""I'm determined on running but I think it's important that I allay fears — let them see me out there,"" he concluded, expressing his commitment to the campaign while acknowledging the need to address any apprehensions about his candidacy.President Biden has affirmed that his health remains robust and that he is open to undergoing an additional neurological examination to assess his cognitive abilities if his medical team advises it.The President disclosed that he has already undergone three rigorous neurological evaluations, with the most recent one taking place in February. He stated, ""I am in good shape,"" based on the feedback from his physicians. Currently, there are no recommendations from his doctors for him to undergo another such examination.(With agency inputs)","US President Joe Biden held his first solo press conference on Thursday.

"Who is Priscila Barbosa, Brazilian immigrant who made $10,000 a month defrauding rideshare apps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/priscila-barbosa-brazilian-immigrant-uber-and-instacart/articleshow/111666866.cms,"Early days in US

A scheme of epic proportions

A web of deceit: The scheme unfolds

Legal consequences: The fall

In the annals of American dream-chasing, few stories are as dramatic or cautionary as that of Priscila Barbosa . Barbosa’s story began in Sorocaba, Brazil, an industrial city where she grew up as the eldest daughter of a hardworking family. Her parents, an electrician and a postal worker, invested in her education, providing English lessons and ballet classes.She studied IT, taught computer skills, and even ran a successful healthy meal delivery service, Fit Express, until Brazil’s recession hit hard. Desperate to support her family, Barbosa accepted a suggestion from an acquaintance to move to the US on a tourist visa and drive for Uber and Lyft.According to a Wired report, Barbosa's journey to the United States began on April 24, 2018, at New York's JFK International Airport. Standing just outside customs with two suitcases filled with clothes and Brazilian bikinis, she found herself in a predicament when her US contact, who had promised to help her settle and drive for Uber and Lyft, disappeared. With only an iPhone, $117, and no return ticket, Barbosa was determined to make her American dream a reality.As per the Wired report, Barbosa’s journey would eventually lead her to the center of a massive fraud conspiracy involving rideshare and delivery services. Alongside fellow Brazilian national Guilherme da Silveira and 17 other co-defendants, Barbosa was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. They had orchestrated a scheme to create fraudulent driver accounts using stolen identities, which they then rented or sold to unqualified drivers.Using the dark web and other sources, they obtained over 2,000 identities, bypassing stringent background checks required by companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. They exploited referral bonus programs and used ""bots"" and GPS spoofing technology to maximize earnings. According to the indictment, Barbosa's role in creating and managing these accounts was integral to the scheme's success, which netted her over $791,000.Barbosa, with da Silveira, used the stolen identities to create fraudulent driver accounts. They edited driver’s license images to match the photos of the drivers renting or buying the accounts, circumventing facial recognition technology. They advertised these accounts on WhatsApp, targeting Brazilian nationals living in the US, and managed the accounts by collecting rental payments and troubleshooting issues.The scheme was elaborate and far-reaching. They exploited referral bonus programs, used “bots” and GPS spoofing to inflate earnings, and managed to siphon off hundreds of thousands of dollars. The operation was so sophisticated that it exposed glaring vulnerabilities in the gig economy’s security measures, the Wired report said.In May 2021, Barbosa and her co-defendants were charged, and by April 2022, she and da Silveira had pleaded guilty. Barbosa was sentenced to three years in prison, three years of supervised release, and fined $20,000. Sixteen other defendants were arrested, with three still at large.For those who suspect they might be victims of this scheme, resources are available through the IRS and the US Department of Justice’s Victim Assistance Program.","Priscila Barbosa was sentenced to three years in prison, three years of supervised release, and fined $20,000.

‘I love Joe Biden. But we need a new nominee’: George Clooney,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-love-joe-biden-but-we-need-a-new-nominee-george-clooney/articleshow/111703296.cms,"I’m a lifelong Democrat; I make no apologies for that. I’m proud of what my party represents and what it stands for. As part of my participation in the democratic process and in support of my chosen candidate, I have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party’s history. Barack Obama in 2012. Hillary Clinton in 2016.Joe Biden in 2020. Last month I co-hosted the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden’s re-election.I say all of this only to express how much I believe in this process and how profound I think this moment is.I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced. But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe “big F-ing deal” Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, whom we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.Is it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor who I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.We love to talk about how the Republican Party has ceded all power, and all of the traits that made it so formidable with Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, to a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency, and yet most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks. But the dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.It is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information. We all think Republicans should abandon their nominee now that he’s been convicted of 34 felonies. That’s new and upsetting information as well. Top Democrats — Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi — and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside.All of the scary stories that we’re being told about what would happen next are simply not true. In all likelihood, the money in the Biden-Harris coffers could go to help elect the presidential ticket and other Democrats. The new nominee wouldn’t be left off ballots in Ohio. We Democrats have a very exciting bench. We don’t anoint leaders or fall sway to a cult of personality; we vote for a president. We can easily foresee a group of several strong Democrats stepping forward to stand and tell us why they’re best qualified to lead this country and take on some of the deeply concerning trends we’re seeing from the revenge tour that Donald Trump calls a presidential campaign.Let’s hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others. Let’s agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would. The short ramp to Election Day would be a benefit for us, not a danger. It would give us the chance to showcase the future without so much opposition research and negative campaigning that comes with these ridiculously long and expensive election seasons. This can be an exciting time for democracy, as we’ve just seen with the 200 or so French candidates who stepped aside and put their personal ambitions on hold to save their democracy from the far right.Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.",Sally Kohn: I’m a lifelong Democrat; I make no apologies for that. She says the one battle Biden cannot win is the fight against time. Kohn says Democrats are so terrified of a second Trump term that we’ve ignored every warning sign.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111703308,imgsize-985767,width-400,resizemode-4/111703308.jpg"

""I am shocked as to why they would select such a controversial and divisive individual to receive the award,"" she stated, expressing her disbelief at the decision.In her critique of the network's selection, Mary Tillman proposed that there were numerous other individuals within the veteran community who would have been more suitable recipients of the honor. Notwithstanding Mary's disapproval, Prince Harry expressed his gratitude to Pat Tillman's widow, Marie, and recognized Mary's efforts in preserving and promoting her son's legacy.Harry said, “Her advocacy for Pat's legacy is deeply personal and one that I respect. The bond between a mother and son is eternal and transcends even the greatest losses.”Accompanied by his wife Meghan, who joined in a standing ovation, the Duke of Sussex accepted the award from three service veterans injured during their tours.

He told the cheering crowd that he wasn't going to leave the race and warned that Donald Trump poses a serious threat.Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd in Detroit, Biden pivoted to warnings about the potential consequences of a second Donald Trump term and declared, ""You made me the nominee, no one else — not the press, not the pundits, not the insiders, not donors.You, the voters. You decided. No one else. And I'm not going anywhere.""As the Detroit crowd chanted ""don't you quit!"" and ""we got your back!"" Biden reaffirmed his commitment to running for reelection and vowed to ""shine a spotlight on Donald Trump"" and what the Republican would do if he returned to the White House. He criticized a far-right policy agenda crafted by conservative think tanks, which Trump has tried to distance himself from, while listing several items on his own wish list for the first 100 days of his second term.At the same school where, four years ago, then-candidate Biden positioned himself as a bridge to the next generation of Democratic leaders, the president made it clear he was not going anywhere.""You made me the nominee, no one else — not the press, not the pundits, not the insiders, not donors,"" Biden said, to cheers. ""You, the voters. You decided. No one else. And I'm not going anywhere.""Despite Biden's efforts to convince lawmakers, donors, and the electorate of his capability to be president at the age of 81, concerns within the party about his candidacy and prospects against Trump in November persist. So far, one Democratic senator and roughly 20 House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to step aside.During the rally, Biden criticized Trump's business failures and singled out Project 2025, a proposed overhaul of the federal government drafted by Trump's allies and former officials, which Trump has tried to distance himself from.Biden's campaign has acknowledged that his route to the White House is narrowing, focusing on the ""blue wall"" states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as the clearest pathway to victory.

Jeffries did not specify his personal stance on Biden’s candidacy but mentioned in a letter to colleagues, ""I directly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward.""Biden's recent press conference received mixed reactions. He mistakenly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as ""Vice President Trump"" and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as ""President Putin"" during the NATO summit.Nevertheless, Biden delivered detailed analyses on global issues, showcasing his extensive experience.An NPR/PBS poll released Friday indicated Biden leading Trump 50% to 48%, a slight improvement from before the June 27 debate.Regardless, some analysts warn that Biden is losing ground in crucial swing states. Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik wrote in the New York Times, ""If current trends continue, Mr. Trump could rack up one of the most decisive presidential victories since 2008.""Biden’s campaign faces critical decisions as the 2024 election approaches.

She concluded that this conduct was highly prejudicial to Baldwin, who immediately burst into tears upon hearing the decision. If found guilty, the Hollywood star could have faced up to 18 months in prison.The dismissal of the case centered around live bullets potentially linked to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins , which were handed to police by a ""Good Samaritan"" earlier this year. The former police officer and family friend of the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, claimed the bullets matched the rounds that killed Hutchins. However, the defense argued that police had ""buried"" this evidence by not filing it under the ""Rust"" case, depriving them of the opportunity to examine it.Despite the prosecution's attempts to salvage the case, Judge Marlowe Sommer remained unconvinced and dismissed the charges with prejudice. Legal experts believe that Baldwin is unlikely to face criminal proceedings again over the shooting due to double jeopardy protections. However, he may still be subject to civil suits. The withheld evidence could also benefit Gutierrez, who is currently serving an 18-month sentence for involuntary manslaughter and has launched an appeal, as well as David Halls, the film's first assistant director who took a plea deal and admitted negligence.","The involuntary manslaughter trial of Alec Baldwin came to an abrupt end on Friday in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Pressure bites on Biden as donors freeze $90 million cash; Jeffries meets Biden & 'bluntly' shares view of caucus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-promise-you-i-am-ok-biden-tells-supporters-amid-pressure-to-drop-out/articleshow/111698105.cms,"Democratic leader in the House shares 'blunt' view, stays away from endorsing prez

A defiant US President Joe Biden on Friday tried to reassure voters he was in good shape Friday as he returned to the campaign trail amid mounting pressure from Democrats to step aside.""We've got to finish the job. And I promise you I am OK,"" the 81-year-old told supporters at a diner in Northville in the battleground state of Michigan, which he must win in November to beat Donald Trump.Even as President Joe Biden tried to put up a brave fight in the high-stakes White House 'big boy' press conference, donors and a few members of his own party don't seem convinced that the 81-year-old has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump in the elections four months from now, let alone lead the country for the next four years.Though the president was able to present a detailed picture of his policies and was more adept at capturing the moment to take down his rival Trump on key issues, the continued verbal flubs referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as Vice President Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy as President Putin, seems to have given democratic donors, fellow colleagues, and more importantly skeptics, the incentive to pressure Biden into dropping out of the race.As a first response after the conference, several major donors on Friday informed the Biden campaign that they will be withholding around $90 million of promised funds due to reservations about President Biden running again, the New York Times reported. According to two individuals quoted, the frozen amounts include “multiple eight-figure commitments.” The report mentioned that Future Forward declined to comment beyond stating their belief that the contributions would be released once the uncertainty surrounding the Democratic ticket was resolved.While a few Democrats have refrained from publicly calling for Biden to end his campaign, they have expressed discontent privately. More than a dozen Democratic House members and at least one Democratic senator have openly called for Biden to withdraw from his reelection bid. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who remains in Congress and is one of the party's most influential figures, has privately voiced her concerns.However, over 70 members of the House and Senate have also publicly reaffirmed their support for Biden as the party’s presidential nominee following his poor debate performance late last month.Meanwhile, Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, met with President Joe Biden on Thursday night to discuss various perspectives on Biden's candidacy. Following this meeting, Biden decided to start a delayed outreach campaign targeting key lawmakers, a move Democrats have long advocated for, according to CNN.In a letter to his colleagues quoted by CNN, Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said that he “directly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward that the Caucus has shared in our recent time together.”However, Jeffries did not endorse Biden.Jeffries was candid and ""blunt"" about the Caucus's views but intentionally refrained from endorsing Biden or publicly stating that the decision was Biden’s to make, CNN quoted the source as saying.",President Joe Biden tried to put up a brave fight in the high-stakes White House 'big boy' press conference.

Joe Biden Gaffes: 'Biden will continue making gaffes like he has been for 40 years',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-will-continue-making-gaffes-like-he-has-been-for-40-years/articleshow/111698383.cms,"Biden's various gaffes over the years

President Joe Biden will probably continue to make gaffes, a Biden campaign official said Friday after his two big slips at the Nato event, a day earlier. He called Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky President Putin and referred to Kamala Harris as Donald Trump amid calls from Democrats for him to opt out of the race. The official said Biden has been making gaffes for the last 40 years, Reuters reported.81-year-old Biden makes international headlines from Nato summit not for his speech but for his gaffes as his ability to run for another presidency is being questioned.Democrats, Hollywood sponsors are withdrawing support from Biden with George Clooney, Ashley Judd writing opinion pieces on Biden's slim chances to win against Donald Trump this year.But it is true that Biden's gaffes are not new. In 2020, Biden made a quote from the Declaration of Independence and said: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women were created by the go-, uh, you know the, you know the thing!""In 2015, when he was vice president, Biden made a joke which was seen as awkward and probably a mix-up when then-Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny visited his house on St Patrick's Day. ""Anyone wearing orange, you're not welcome in... only joking,"" he said, wearing a green tie as they smiled for a picture. Orange is the colour associated with the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland, while green is used as a symbol by mostly Catholic Irish nationalists.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) revealed in a “Dear Colleague” letter Friday morning that he “was graciously granted a private meeting” with the 81-year-old president the previous day.“In my conversation with President Biden, I directly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward that the Caucus has shared in our recent time together,” the Brooklyn Democrat wrote.Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama reportedly discussed the concerns over Biden in private but they decided to wait and watch as they don't know what to do with the situation.","81-year-old Biden makes international headlines from Nato summit not for his speech but for his gaffes.

Of course, we still don't know the details of what actually happened when she met this horse and what happened. Apparently she has no memory of it. So maybe it will remain a mystery between her and the horse.""Following the incident, Buckingham Palace confirmed that on doctor’s advice, Anne's engagements would be cancelled until further notice.Anne was unable to carry out a scheduled trip to Canada following the injuries. Canada's Governor General read a message from the Princess in her absence at a memorial ceremony. Anne said: ""It is with deep regret that I am unable to be with you today, as you commemorate the brave efforts and sacrifices of the members of the Newfoundland Regiment who went into battle on the first day of the Somme.""I have fond memories of joining you in 2016, on the 99th occasion that the people of this Island commemorated the Battle of Beaumont Hamel, and I am deeply saddened that I’m unable to join you again, and I send you my warmest best wishes on this special day of commemoration.""",Princess Anne visited Riding for the Disabled Association National Championship.

A new documentary makes the case that America's 'greatest president' Abraham Lincoln was gay . Titled “Lover of Men: The untold history of Abraham Lincoln,” the film claims to reveal Lincoln’s romantic relationships with men, using insights from leading Lincoln scholars and previously unseen photographs and letters, according to promotional video material obtained by several media outlets.“Lincoln probably slept in the same bed with more men than he did with women,” the New York Post quoted one one expert in the film as saying.The documentary features interviews with historians from prestigious institutions, including Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Wellesley, and Rutgers. Directed by Shaun Peterson, the film explores Lincoln’s deep connections with men, delving into the history of human sexual fluidity and highlighting the stark differences between 19th-century sexual norms and those of today.Peterson, who described the film as a ""passion project"" on Instagram, has been working on it for years. The documentary aims to fill a significant gap in American history and challenge the audience to reconsider their views on human sexuality, he said.While this is not the first exploration of Lincoln’s sexuality—previous articles and books have discussed his close relationships with men, including a male ""roommate"" with whom he shared a bed—the film reportedly presents new insights and evidence.The trailer however shows Lincoln’s legacy of equality, suggesting that accepting a queer Lincoln can lead to greater acceptance of queer people and inspire the pursuit of true democracy for everyone.“Lincoln’s legacy is the insistence on equality”, the trailer adds. “If you can accept a queer Lincoln, you can accept queer people overall, he should inspire us to achieve a true democracy for everyone.”Lincoln, a moderate Republican renowned for his leadership during the Civil War and the Gettysburg Address, was assassinated in April 1865.","A new documentary makes the case that America's 'greatest president' Abraham Lincoln was gay.

After the polls, they had joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party to claim a share of reserved seats as independents were not eligible for the extra seats. The electoral body, however, ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim the reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats.”The commission had decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) and the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries with 16 and five additional seats in the National Assembly.Friday’s verdict, however, nullified the Peshawar high court’s order wherein it had upheld the election regulator’s decision denying the reserved seats to the SIC. The top court also declared the ECP’s ruling to be ultra vires to the constitution, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.“It is declared that lack of denial of an election symbol does not in any way affect the right of a political party to participate in an election,” the court order said, adding that PTI was and is a political party.It further stated that the elected members of PTI could not be declared independents or candidates of the SIC and gave the PTI 15 days to submit its list of candidates entitled for reserved seats to the election commission.ECP, the order said, should then publish the list of reserved seats of the candidates on its website within seven days.“The seats allocated to the PTI after this stage will be considered as their seats. Once the PTI gets its seats in parliament, it will be eligible for the reserved seats,” said the ruling.PTI spokesman Raoof Hassan lauded the SC for “breaking the barriers of intimidation”. “This is only the beginning of a long haul till we reach the final destination when Imran Khan shall take over as the Pakistan PM,” he said.The governing coalition still has well over 200 members of the 336-member lower house of parliament but the judgment has effectively denied a two-third majority to them that they were hoping for. Khan’s party strength stood at 84 in the National Assembly before the decision and is expected to rise to over 100.Under Pakistan’s election rules, parties are allocated 70 reserved seats – 60 for women, 10 for non-Muslims – in proportion to the number of seats they win. This completes the National Assembly’s total strength of 336 seats.",The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday declared his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party eligible for allocation of seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.

However, the election commission had stated that independents were not eligible for the allocation of 70 reserved seats , which were intended solely for political parties.The SC placed the present petitions before the three-judge committee that determines the constitution of the bench for the reconstitution of a larger bench when attorney general Mansoor Usman Awan highlighted that under Section 4 of the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, the present case should be heard by a larger bench since the issue concerns the interpretation of constitutional provisions, Dawn reported.A day ago, the court had reserved its decision on the matter after closing the hearing on a set of appe­als moved by the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).The SIC had filed a petition demanding that 77 seats for women and minorities, which were originally allotted to PM Shehbaz’s ruling coalition after the February 8 general elections, be reallocated to the alliance. However, in March, the Peshawar high court (PHC) and the election commission rejected the council’s appeal in separate rulings, declaring it ineligible for the reserved seats, as per the Dawn.Although the allocation of 23 reserved seats does not impact PM Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government's parliamentary majority, it does strengthen the political position of Khan's supporters. They have been claiming that the election commission and a pro-military caretaker government that supervised the polls engaged in electoral fraud to prevent them from winning.

Pakistani beggars primarily operate in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq.A parliamentary probe revealed that a significant number of beggars arrested in foreign countries were of Pakistani origin, with many exploiting pilgrim visas to travel to holy sites. The Interior Ministry has offloaded 44,000 individuals in the past two and a half years, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called for increased screening before issuing passports.Within Pakistan, begging is a highly organized and competitive business, with an estimated 38 million beggars in the country. The average daily amount collected by beggars varies across cities, with Karachi having the highest at Rs 2,000. Annually, beggars extract $42 billion, which is more than 12% of Pakistan's GDP. Turf wars between beggars for lucrative spots are common, with some even resorting to violence.The government has struggled to abolish beggary, and police action against beggars has often been met with resistance. In 2011, hundreds of beggars clashed with police officials in Faisalabad, throwing stones and bricks at the police station. One beggar remarked, ""Since when has begging become a crime in Pakistan?

The ban was clamped on Feb 17 based on ""intelligence reports"".""The hostile elements operating on X have nefarious intentions to create an environment of chaos and instability, with the ultimate goal of destabilising the country and plunging it into some form of anarchy,"" the ministry said.","Pakistan's ISI has received a carte blanche from the Shehbaz Sharif govt to intercept phone calls and messages ""in the interest of national security"" The move comes in the wake of criticism by some Pakistani judges, journalists, opposition politicians and supporters of jailed former PM Imran Khan.

""The government and allies should know that the same actions would be used against their leaders once out of power. They will be roaming around the courts when hit by the measures they are instituting now,"" he said.","The Pakistan government has granted the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency the authority to intercept and trace any phone call or message in the country.

The appeal was filed after the Election Commission of Pakistan rejected the SIC's plea for awarding its share in the 70 reserved seats in the National Assembly and another 156 in the four provincial assemblies.The SIC became prominent after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party-supported candidates joined the party after winning the elections as jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's PTI could not contest the polls and was not eligible to claim the seats reserved for women and minorities.The seats were awarded to the winning parties based on proportional representation .The ECP had rejected the SIC plea for reserved seats as it had not contested the elections and got strength when PTI-backed independently elected candidates joined after the elections.Its appeal against the ECP decision in the Peshawar High Court was also turned down. Subsequently, the party challenged it in the Supreme Court.A 13-member bench headed by Chief Justice Faez Isa and comprising justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Munib Akhtar, Yahya Afridi, Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Athar Minallah, Syed Hasan Rizvi, Shahid Waheed, Irfan Saadat Khan and Naeem Akhtar Afghan heard the case.Chief Justice Isa announced at the conclusion of the proceedings that the panel decided to reserve the verdict for mutual consultation.He did not give any date for the announcement of the judgment, which is expected this week.""We will see if a short judgment can be announced,"" the chief justice remarked while reserving the judgment.Earlier, the Supreme Court on May 6 in a major relief to the PTI, suspended the Peshawar High Court's decision about rejecting the SIC plea.Following the ruling, the ECP on May 14 suspended the victory notifications of 77 candidates who belonged to other parties and were declared successful on the reserved seats.The final ruling by the top court in the case would decide the fate of those 77 reserved seats. Though it may not change the current power structure, the changes in the overall number game in the assemblies may impact the law-making process in the country.The problem of the PTI began when just before the general election, it was deprived of its symbol of cricket bat by the ECP for failure to hold the intra-party election according to its Constitution. It forced PTI to field its candidates as independents.PTI candidates joined the SIC to secure a due share in the reserved seats, but the ECP rejected the SIC plea for reserved seats by saying that it had not contested elections and also did not provide a list of candidates for the reserved seats within the stipulated time, which was mandatory.",Pakistan's Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its judgment in a key petition by the opposition Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party.

However, the date for the new government to assume office has not been determined.To maintain power, Dahal, a former Maoist rebel chief, required at least 138 votes in his favor in the 275-member house.
