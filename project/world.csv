July's Buck Moon will become a Supermoon in August: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/julys-buck-moon-will-become-a-supermoon-in-august-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/111896155.cms,"How to view the full Moon

A full Moon , known as the Buck Moon, will peak in illumination early Sunday morning, offering a stunning view in the summer night sky. The Buck Moon is named after the antlers of bucks that grow during this time of year, will reach its peak at 6:17 am EDT( approximately 3 pm IST). The best time for viewing will be in the pre-dawn hours.According to the Farmers' Almanac, this full Moon is also referred to as the Thunder Moon or the Hay Moon.This Moon will appear average in size compared to the micromoons and Supermoons seen throughout the year.""The first moon landing was in the afternoon on (July 20, 1969), and then they did the moonwalk that night,"" Noah Petro, chief of Nasa ’s Planetary Geology, Geophysics and Geochemistry Laboratory said. ""There's no better way to celebrate that than by going outside and looking at the full moon and toasting Neil (Armstrong), Buzz (Aldrin), and Michael Collins, and all the people who helped make Apollo 11 a reality 55 years ago.""Clear skies will allow the Moon to become visible in the southeast sky during the early evening, according to astronomers. Additionally, Nasa suggests looking out for Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, although binoculars or a telescope might be necessary to see all the planets clearly.Although the Buck Moon will reach its fullest phase on Sunday morning, it will appear nearly full until Tuesday morning.In August, the Moon will appear brighter and larger due to its status as a Supermoon . Supermoons occur a few times a year when the Moon reaches perigee, its closest point to Earth, which will be less than 230,000 miles away. This increased proximity causes higher-than-normal tides, often called King Tides, which can result in coastal flooding.The peak of the Buck Moon coincides with the 55th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon on July 20, 1969. They left several mementos on the lunar surface, including an American flag, still standing near the landing site in the Sea of Tranquility.Another Moon, named the Sturgeon Moon, will peak on August 19, followed by four more full Moons through December.Depending on the local weather conditions the full Moon will be visible to those in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, Petro said. For optimal moon gazing, he recommends finding a spot with a clear view of the sky, away from tall buildings and trees. Even in cities with significant light pollution, the Moon will be visible in a clear night sky.No equipment is needed to view a full Moon, but a telescope or pair of binoculars could enhance its features—the dark areas observable on the Moon are ""vast volcanic lava flows that are billions of years old,"" Petro said.""Even with the naked eye … you can start seeing the history of the Moon in front of you. And that's one of the reasons why I love studying the Moon—is that it's laid bare for folks to see,"" he added. ""On a beautiful full Moon clear night, you can see differences in color, you can see differences on the surface that all go back to the history of the Moon.""To the average observer, the Buck Moon will look like almost every other full Moon, Petro said. But each full Moon varies month to month due to its slightly shifting orientation, known as libration, and the changing distance from Earth in its elliptical orbit. To observe the different perspectives, Petro recommends taking a photo of each lunar event as it occurs and then comparing it with the next one.","The Buck Moon, named after the antlers of bucks that grow during this time of year, will reach its peak at 6:17 am EDT.

Who was Ukrainian linguist Iryna Farion?

Iryna Farion , a former Ukrainian nationalist politician known for speaking out in defense of the Ukrainian language and against the use of Russian , has been shot dead in Lviv , Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko announced in the early hours of Saturday.Farion was shot in the head outside her home on Friday evening by an unknown gunman. She later died from her injuries at a local hospital.Klymenko said that authorities were examining multiple theories to explain the killing.""The main theories currently under consideration are personal animosity, social and political activities of Ms Farion. We do not rule out the possibility that it was a contract killing,"" Klymenko wrote on the Telegram messaging service.Lviv Regional Governor Maksym Kozytskyi said that Farion had died after being taken to hospital.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the killing and ordered Klymenko and Security Service chief Vasyl Maliuk to solve the crime.He said that all lines of inquiry were being investigated, ""including one leading to Russia.""The Svoboda party, of which Farion was a member, blamed Moscow for the death in a statement without providing evidence.Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of Russian state broadcaster RT, celebrated the killing but did not claim Moscow was responsible for it.""Iryna Farion, who dreamed of the 'complete elimination' of the Russian-speaking population, has been eliminated,"" Simonyan said in a post on Telegram.Russian President Vladimir Putin cited the defense of Ukraine's Russian-speaking and ethnic Russian population as one of Moscow's war aims when he launched the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Farion served as a deputy for the far-right Svoboda party in Ukraine's parliament, known as the Verkhovna Rada, from 2012 to 2014.She was known for statements in defense of the Ukrainian language and criticizing the widespread use of Russian in Ukrainian society, including by officials and soldiers.Ukrainian is the country's only official language but substantial sections of the population, especially in Ukraine's south and east, speak Russian as their primary language.Farion was herself from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, which is predominantly Ukrainian-speaking.Following student protests, she temporarily lost her position as a Ukrainian language professor at the University of Lviv, but was reinstated following a court ruling.She had criticized the fact that members of Ukraine's Azov regiment continued speaking their mother tongue, Russian.The ultranationalist Azov militia was integrated into the Ukrainian military in 2014 and was a major force in the defense of the city of Mariupol in the eastern Donetsk region. The city was captured by Russian troops in May 2022 following a siege lasting nearly three months.","Iryna Farion was shot in the head outside her home in Lviv, Ukraine.

Crowdstrike: Crowdstrike: What is CrowdStrike and how is it linked to Microsoft outage?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-crowdstrike-and-how-is-it-linked-to-microsoft-outage/articleshow/111862845.cms,"What is CrowdStrike ?

What is their history?

What damage did the outage cost?

Millions of Windows users worldwide are experiencing the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error, causing sudden shutdowns or restarts. This severe outage has impacted airports, banks, companies, and superstores, leading to widespread chaos. Microsoft has traced the root of this issue to a recent update from CrowdStrike .CrowdStrike is a US-based cybersecurity company primarily used by large organizations, government agencies, and critical sectors like airports and banks.Unlike more commonly known cybersecurity companies such as Kaspersky or Symantec, CrowdStrike's products are not typically used by individual consumers. Founded in 2011, CrowdStrike focuses on high-profile cybersecurity, having assisted the US government in addressing hacks from North Korea and Russia.Due to its reputation for combating advanced and state-sponsored cyber attacks, CrowdStrike is a go-to for government agencies and critical infrastructure.The current BSOD issue, described as one of the most significant cyber incidents of 2024, is linked to a software update in CrowdStrike's EDR product, which protects endpoints. The malfunction requires a manual fix, expected to take days, as it cannot be resolved remotely. CrowdStrike has acknowledged the issue, stating that their engineers are working on a resolution. The problem stems from an update to their Falcon Sensor software suite, causing the BSOD.They have provided a manual solution for affected users:1. Boot Windows into Safe Mode or WRE.2. Go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike.3. Locate and delete files matching ""C-00000291*.sys.""4. Boot normally.Microsoft is prioritizing this incident, working to mitigate the impact on Microsoft 365 apps and services. They are rerouting affected traffic to alternate systems to restore functionality. For now, there is no automatic solution, but both CrowdStrike and Microsoft are actively addressing the issue.CrowdStrike was co-founded in 2011 by George Kurtz (CEO), Dmitri Alperovitch (former CTO), and Gregg Marston (retired CFO). In 2012, Shawn Henry, a former FBI official, was hired to lead CrowdStrike Services, Inc., focusing on proactive and incident response services. The company launched its first product, CrowdStrike Falcon, in June 2013, providing endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and attribution.In May 2014, CrowdStrike's reports assisted the U.S. Department of Justice in charging five Chinese military hackers for economic cyber espionage against U.S. corporations. The company also uncovered the activities of Energetic Bear, a group linked to the Russian Federation, targeting global energy sector entities.Following the Sony Pictures hack, CrowdStrike identified the involvement of the North Korean government and detailed the attack's execution. In 2014, they also identified members of Putter Panda, a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group.In May 2015, CrowdStrike disclosed the VENOM vulnerability in the Quick Emulator (QEMU) hypervisor, which allowed attackers to access sensitive information. By October 2015, CrowdStrike had identified Chinese hackers targeting technology and pharmaceutical companies around the time of a U.S.-China agreement against economic espionage, suggesting a violation of that agreement.In July 2015, Google invested in CrowdStrike's Series C funding round. Subsequent Series D and Series E rounds brought total funding to $480 million by May 2019. In 2017, CrowdStrike achieved a valuation exceeding $1 billion with an estimated annual revenue of $100 million, and by June 2018, its valuation surpassed $3 billion. Key investors include Telstra, March Capital Partners, Rackspace, Accel Partners, and Warburg Pincus.CrowdStrike went public on the Nasdaq in June 2019.The widespread outage has disrupted flights, hospitals, banks, media outlets, and other companies globally. Major US airlines like American Airlines, United, and Delta grounded all flights, while hospitals and banks reported system outages. Social media is flooded with reports of electronic medical record (EMR) system crashes in hospitals and error messages on self-checkout tills, ATM machines, and television channels worldwide.DownDetector recorded growing outages in services at Visa, ADT security, and Amazon. Many of these outages are linked to a CrowdStrike update related to its Falcon Sensor, causing crashes on Windows PCs. As the most used operating system globally, Windows' outage affects nearly every part of the global economy.Airlines experienced significant disruptions, with American Airlines citing a 'technical issue with CrowdStrike.' United and Delta paused operations but later reported restored functionality. The outage affected banks, businesses, newsrooms, and television networks. In Australia, airports and broadcasters like Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin, SBS, Network 10, ABC, and Sky News were impacted. The UK also experienced disruptions, with Sky News apologizing for broadcast interruptions.The Australian National Cyber Security Coordinator confirmed the outage was due to a technical issue with third-party software, not a cyber security incident. This follows recent disruptions to low-cost carriers like Frontier due to a Microsoft cloud outage.Microsoft is taking mitigation actions to address the service disruptions, ensuring continuous improvements and treating the event with the highest priority.","Microsoft has traced the root of this issue to a recent update from CrowdStrike.

RNC LIVE: Trump gives speech at Republican National Convention Day 4

Donald Trump , the Republican presidential candidate, on Thursday recounted his personal experience of the assassination attempt on his life during a rally at Pennsylvania rally.While delivering his speech at the closing night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump called for unity among Americans.Trump vividly described the moment when the assassin's bullet nearly struck him, missing by a mere quarter of an inch.He shared the details of the incident, stating, ""I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear. I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet. If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the bullet would have perfectly hit its mark. I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack, and in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground.""Trump said that the attack was swiftly ended by a Secret Service sniper, who took out the assassin with a single shot from a greater distance.“There was blood pouring everywhere, yet, in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side,"" Trump said. “I'm not supposed to be here tonight.""The crowd responded with chants of ""Yes you are,"" to which Trump replied, ""I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God. And watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a 'providential moment.' Probably was.""In the face of the assassination attempt, Trump described how he raised his fist in the air and began shouting ""fight, fight, fight,"" demonstrating his resilience and determination to continue his presidential campaign.Trump's speech served as the culmination of a four-day Republican rally that attracted thousands of conservative activists and elected officials to Wisconsin, a crucial swing state.With both candidates currently facing low popularity, Trump seized the opportunity presented by his near-death experience to adopt a new tone that he believes will generate more momentum in an election that seems to be shifting in his favor.Meanwhile, 81-year-old Democrat Biden faces mounting pressure from key congressional allies, donors, and even former President Barack Obama , who are concerned about his ability to secure reelection following his poor debate performance.","Trump vividly described the moment when the assassin's bullet nearly struck him, missing by a mere quarter of an inch.

Pelosi delivers speech to NC Democrats with notable absence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pelosi-delivers-speech-to-nc-democrats-with-notable-absence-bidens-future-as-nominee/articleshow/111896329.cms,"RALEIGH NC: In a state expected to help decide the presidency, House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi did little to quell speculation on President Joe Biden 's path forward as the Democratic nominee to a room full of North Carolina Democrats on Saturday.Pelosi addressed more than 900 people at the North Carolina Democratic Party fundraiser in Raleigh - an event billed as the annual ""Unity Dinner"" during a time of significant national discord over how the party will proceed in the 2024 presidential election .All eyes are on Democratic leaders like Pelosi, who colleagues say has her finger on the party's pulse, to get a glimpse of what Biden's future holds.The power she holds in the Democratic Party - and in the direction the party takes - was no better emphasized than in her introduction by US Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C.""When Nancy Pelosi speaks, everybody listens,"" Adams said.And with everybody listening, Pelosi gave a speech largely absent of mentions to Biden's presidential bid.Pelosi spent most of her speech recounting battles over budget and policy in the US House, highlighting the importance of funding public education and reiterating the dangers of the Republican agenda. When she did mention Biden, it was mostly to tout his administration's policies.At the end of her speech, Pelosi shifted to discussing the party's plans in the coming months and chose to focus on Democratic mobilization efforts rather than who to mobilize behind.""Are you ready for a Democratic president?"" Pelosi said amid cheers. ""I thought so.""Since Biden's dismal showing in the June 27 debate with former Republican President Donald Trump, significant fallout has ensued within the Democratic Party on whether the president is capable of defeating Trump.The former speaker is among a growing group of prominent Democratic leaders who have expressed concerns behind closed doors on Biden's ability to win in November. Pelosi told Biden in private that Democrats may fail to control the House if he doesn't drop out, but she later said her conversations were misrepresented.Despite a swell of Democratic lawmakers calling for Biden to drop out, none of North Carolina's seven Democratic representatives have publicly signaled support for finding a new nominee to lead the ticket.While some reports say Biden is more open to the idea of leaving the race in private discussions, his campaign staff has continually reaffirmed his commitment to staying in as the nominee.Brenda Pollard, a Durham delegate who has attended five Democratic conventions, said she's had conversations with Democrats around the state who want Biden to stay in.""As a pledged delegate, until he says 'I'm not,' I'm going to continue to be pledged,"" the 73-year-old said, adding later that she felt Vice President Kamala Harris has the qualifications to be president if Biden dropped out.About 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris has the makings of a good president, according to a recent AP-NORC Center poll.North Carolina is also home to one of the most hotly contested gubernatorial races in the country, pitting Democratic state Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson. The latter has become known for his similar, brash politicking style to Trump, which has made Robinson a lightning rod for criticism about statements some have found offensive and harmful.To reiterate the stakes of his race, Stein told the audience that voters have a choice between ""two competing visions"" in a competitive election - one that he said North Carolina will play a large role in deciding.""People in other states hunger for the kind of power that we have here in North Carolina. To possess this political power is a privilege,"" Stein said.Stein did not mention Biden, but instead wrapped up his speech saying Democrats will ""keep the White House and defeat Donald Trump.""Met by a standing ovation, Gov. Roy Cooper also took the stage, saying Biden and Harris are ""all in for North Carolina."" But most of his speech highlighted other issues, such as breaking the GOP legislative supermajority and getting Democrats in other statewide offices.Cooper has become part of the national conversation on the presidential race, as pundits consider who could be Harris' running mate if Biden leaves the race. Cooper's status as a term-limited governor, as well as his strong support of the Biden-Harris administration, has piqued some interest on his prospects.","House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi spoke at the North Carolina Democratic Party's annual ""Unity Dinner"" Pelosi did little to quell speculation on President Joe Biden's path forward as the Democratic nominee.

The mother-son duo made their initial appearances in federal court on Friday, as per court records.According to the warrants for the state charges, from October to March, Kingston and Turner stole nearly $500,000 in jewelry, more than $200,000 from Bank of America, $160,000 from a Cadillac Escalade dealer, over $100,000 from First Republic Bank, and $86,000 from a customized bed maker.The federal indictment alleges that Kingston and Turner falsely claimed to have executed bank wire or other monetary payment transfers for high-end items, despite no such transfers having taken place. Investigators stated that the duo kept over $1 million worth of fraudulently purchased items without paying for them.Kingston was arrested on May 23 at Fort Irwin, an Army training base in California's Mojave Desert, where he was performing, and was booked into the Broward County jail on similar state charges.

Secret Service turned down Trump's request to beef up security for 2 years: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secret-service-turned-down-trumps-request-to-beef-up-security-for-2-years-report/articleshow/111895771.cms,"In the two years leading up to last week's assassination attempt , Donald Trump 's camp sought more security , including magnetometers at large public events and extra snipers for outdoor venues, but was repeatedly turned down by top officials in the Secret Service citing a lack of resources to meet the former president's demands, the Washington Post reported.The Secret Service initially denied claims that someone from Trump’s camp had asked for more help ahead of the deadly shooting, calling them “absolutely false.” However, the report stated that every request by the Trump team in the last two years was turned down, with the agency claiming it lacked the resources Trump was asking for.Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Secret Service was quoted as admitting to The Washington Post that the agency had denied Trump’s request for additional security , but claimed it had only learned about the new information in the wake of the tragedy.“The Secret Service has a vast, challenging, and intricate mission,” Guglielmi said in a statement. “Every day we work in a dynamic threat environment to ensure our protectees are safe and secure across multiple events, travel, and other difficult environments. We execute a comprehensive and layered strategy to balance personnel, technology, and specialized operational needs.”The spokesperson also confirmed that Secret Service Director Kimberly A Cheatle will testify before the House Oversight Committee on Monday regarding the failures leading up to the attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.“The Secret Service is fully accountable for the safety of its protectees. We are committed to better understanding what happened before, during, and after the assassination attempt of former President Trump to ensure it never happens again,” he added.Since the assassination bid, Trump's security has been significantly increased.

She's as crazy as a bed bug.""Trump's rally tactics remained unchanged, despite briefly calling for national unity earlier in the week.Security measures were heightened at the Grand Rapids rally, with a heavy police presence and Secret Service officers positioned throughout the venue.Trump appeared alongside his new vice presidential pick, senator JD Vance from Ohio, following the Republican nominating convention in Milwaukee, where the party united behind them.In contrast, uncertainty surrounds Biden's position as the Democratic Party's nominee for the upcoming election. Some senior Democrats have called for Biden to end his re-election bid due to concerns about his ability to defeat Trump or complete another term. Trump capitalized on this, claiming that Democrats want to remove Biden from the ticket despite his victory in the nominating contest.Trump referred to the assassination attempt several times during the rally, expressing his hope that he would not have to go through such a horrible experience again.

"Colombia president pushes for health, labour changes as he opens new session of congress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/colombia-president-pushes-for-health-labour-changes-as-he-opens-new-session-of-congress/articleshow/111895724.cms,"BOGOTA: Colombia 's government will propose legislation aimed at overhauling the health sector and will pursue changes to labour laws , president Gustavo Petro said Saturday as he inaugurated a new session of congress . Petro, Colombia's first left-wing president, has pushed an ambitious set of economic changes that includes changing the pension system, raising the minimum wage and redistributing land to farmers affected by Colombia's armed conflict.He managed to get the minimum wage boosted last year and his pension plan approved by congress earlier this year, but he has struggled to persuade legislators to adopt his ideas on labour laws and the health system.The coalition of political parties that joined Petro's government at the beginning of his term has broken up due to ideological differences. Meanwhile, numerous corruption scandals involving government ministers and the president's eldest son have decreased Petro's popularity.Leftist parties loyal to the president have their highest number of legislative seats in Colombia's history, but they lack the 50% majority needed to pass legislation on their own and have been forced to bargain with parties on the centre and the right.For healthcare , Petro wants a government agency to be in charge of collecting billions of dollars in insurance fees from Colombians, sidelining the private insurance companies that currently manage much of the health system.For the labour sector, he wants to make it harder for companies to hire workers on temporary contracts and also require employers to pay workers full wages on rest days. He also proposed Saturday that legislators reduce the work week from 47 hours to 40, arguing that could increase employment and spur productivity.Petro told congress Saturday that increasing the minimum wage by 16% last year helped to reduce poverty, which decreased 10% in 2023 and is now at similar levels seen in 2019, according to the national statistics department.""We are fulfilling our promises"" to reduce inequality, the president said.Petro is nearing the halfway point of his four-year term, which ends in August 2026. Critics say his government has struggled to contain inflation and collect taxes.In his speech to congress, Petro urged Colombia's central bank to reduce interest rates as a way to boost economic growth. He suggested congress could help curb inflation by ""controlling speculation"" in real estate rentals and reining in electricity fees.Petro also said his government will propose a bill that would enable congress to speedily approve legislation related to Colombia's 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia . He said implementation of the accord is lagging in areas such as land distribution and economic development projects for rural communities.Critics have expressed concern about efforts to expedite legislation, arguing that such mechanisms could be used to give the president more power and eliminate term limits.",President Gustavo Petro has pushed an ambitious set of economic changes.

"Trump campaign releases letter on his injury, treatment after last week's assassination attempt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-campaign-releases-letter-on-his-injury-treatment-after-last-weeks-assassination-attempt/articleshow/111895645.cms,"NEW YORK: Donald Trump's campaign released an update on the former president's health Saturday, one week after he survived an attempted assassination at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.The memo, from Texas representative Ronny Jackson , a staunch supporter who served as Trump's White House physician, offers new details on the nature of the GOP nominee's injuries and the treatment he received in the immediate aftermath of the attack.It is the most thorough accounting to date of the former president's condition since the night of the shooting, which also left one rally-goer dead and injured two others.According to Jackson, Trump sustained a gunshot wound to the right ear that came ""less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear.""The bullet track, he said, ""produced a 2 cm wide wound that extended down to the cartilaginous surface of the ear. There was initially significant bleeding, followed by marked swelling of the entire upper ear.""While the swelling has resolved and the wound ""is beginning to granulate and heal properly,"" he said Trump is still experiencing intermittent bleeding, requiring the dressing that was on display at last week's Republican National Convention.""Given the broad and blunt nature of the wound itself, no sutures were required,"" Jackson wrote.Trump was initially treated by medical staff at Butler Memorial Hospital. According to Jackson, doctors ""provided a thorough evaluation for additional injuries that included a CT of his head.""Trump, he said, ""will have further evaluations, including a comprehensive hearing exam, as needed. He will follow up with his primary care physician, as directed by the doctors that initially evaluated him,"" he wrote.""In summary, former President Trump is doing well, and he is recovering as expected from the gunshot wound sustained last Saturday afternoon,"" he added.Jackson said in the letter that, as Trump's former doctor, he was worried and traveled to Bedminster, New Jersey, where Trump had flown late Saturday after he returned from Pennsylvania, ""to personally check on him, and offer my assistance in any way possible.""He said he has been with Trump since that time, evaluating and treating his wound daily, and would remain with Trump through the weekend, including traveling to Michigan, where Trump held his first rally since the shooting, joined by his new running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. At Saturday's rally, the white gauze on Trump's ear was replaced by a skin-colored bandage.Jackson appears to be licensed to practice medicine in Florida, according to a state health department database. Records from the American Board of Emergency Medicine also show that Jackson has a certification in Emergency Medicine, valid through the end of 2025.A spokesperson for the congressman did not immediately provide a response when asked about the status of his license, and Trump campaign 's did not immediately respond to questions.Jackson has come under considerable scrutiny. After administering a physical to Trump in 2018, he drew headlines for extolling the then-president's ""incredibly good genes"" and suggesting that ""if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200 years old.""In 2001, the Department of Defense inspector general released a scathing report on his conduct as a top White House physician that found Jackson had made ""sexual and denigrating"" comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy on drinking alcohol on a presidential trip and took prescription-strength sleeping medication that prompted worries from his colleagues about his ability to provide proper medical care.Jackson denied the allegations, claiming he was the victim of a ""political hit job"" because of his close ties to the former Republican president.Last year, Trump's campaign released a letter on President Joe Biden's 81st birthday from Dr. Bruce A. Aronwald, a New Jersey physician, who said he had been the former president's doctor since 2021.Trump's campaign and federal law enforcement had released little information on his condition or treatment in the days after the the attack, declining to disclose medical records or hold briefings with the doctors who treated him at the hospital.After a would-be assassin shot and gravely wounded President Ronald Reagan in 1981, the Washington, D.C., hospital where he was treated gave regular, detailed public updates about his condition and treatment.Trauma surgeon Babak Sarani, who said he has been treating more patients with wounds from AR-15 style assault rifles, said the description in the letter was ""exactly in line with what you would expect from a bullet wound.""While the indirect damage is still usually minor, he said the risk of extensive damage is greater than if another gun were used.""If a bullet whizzes by your ear from a low-caliber handgun, it's not a big deal. ... You get a headache or feel dizzy like a bad concussion,"" said Sarani, chief of trauma at George Washington Hospital in Washington, D.C. ""But if the bullet is from an assault rifle, the energy is bigger, broader, and you're more likely to develop bruises.""He added, ""in Trump's case, he got very lucky. The majority of the energy was released in the air. If it had hit him in the head, we would be having a completely different conversation.""Former Secret Service agent Rich Staropoli said the AR-15-style rifle used by the gunman fires a 5.56 millimeter bullet at such high speeds - over 2,000 miles an hour - that just the air pressure as it passes can cause extensive damage.""The shock wave alone could have ripped his ear off,"" Staropoli said of Trump. ""It's amazing the bullet nipped him"" and didn't do any other damage.""It's a one in a billion type of thing,"" he added. A fraction of a millimeter closer, ""and this would be a different story. It really is incredible the thin line here between just a nick and devastating bodily damage.""","Ronny Jackson, who served as Trump's White House physician, wrote the letter. The bullet came ""less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head,"" he said. The swelling has resolved and the wound ""is beginning to granulate and heal,"" Jackson said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111895688,imgsize-1167088,width-400,resizemode-4/111895688.jpg"

He mentioned that his wife, Usha, was taking their children, aged 7, 4, and 2, ""out on the town"" in Grand Rapids.Former President Trump, returning to the campaign trail days after accepting the Republican nomination for president at the Republican National Convention, wore a smaller, beige-colored bandage on his ear.

The former president vehemently denied any extremist affiliations, refuting alleged connections to Project 2025, a controversial manifesto spearheaded by his close associates.Critics have denounced the project as a far-right, authoritarian agenda.Trump also took aim at the Democratic Party, which is grappling with unprecedented calls for US President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race due to concerns about his age and ability to effectively serve until 2029 if reelected.The former president mockingly remarked, ""They have no idea who their candidate is... This guy goes and he gets the votes, and now they want to take it away.

It stated that security forces killed all 10 assailants in the ensuing gunfight.The attack on Bannu cantonment, the ISPR said, had been orchestrated by militants based in Afghanistan. “The attempt to enter the cantonment was effectively thwarted by security forces personnel, which forced the terrorists to ram an explosives-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall of the cantonment,” ISPR said.It added that the suicide car bombing destroyed a portion of the wall and damaged adjoining infrastructure, resulting in the deaths of the eight soldiers.“In the ensuing operation, our troops effectively engaged the terrorists as a result of which all 10 terrorists were sent to hell,” the army said. “This timely and effective response by the security forces prevented a major catastrophe, saving precious innocent lives,” it added.Locals said the blast was heard miles away and caused damage to nearby houses and shops. They said they saw black smoke billowing above the site and heard gunshots in the cantonment area.A militant outfit allied with the globally designated terrorist group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) took responsibility for the attack shortly after it started.The ISPR statement attributed the assault to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group which, according to it, operates from Afghanistan and has used Afghan soil to orchestrate acts of terrorism inside Pakistan in the past.Bannu and adjoining districts in the border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have particularly seen frequent TTP attacks targeting military and police forces since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan three years ago.Pakistan maintains TTP leaders and fighters are being increasingly facilitated by the de facto rulers of Afghanistan.

Authorities had earlier closed universities and colleges from Wednesday.During the week, police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and hurled sound grenades to scatter protesters throwing bricks and setting fire to vehicles. With the death toll climbing and police and other security forces unable to contain the protests, authorities imposed a national curfew and deployed the military, who were given orders to shoot on sight if needed.Those venturing out had their identification cards inspected by army personnel at check points. TV footage showed troops had set up roadblocks and bunkers using sandbags across strategic locations of Dhaka. Reuters TV footage showed armed soldiers surveying roads littered with stones and debris as shops remained shuttered. Trees and barricades were uprooted on streets where charred vehicles stood. Young men played football on a deserted road during the relaxation in the curfew.Nationwide unrest broke out following student anger against the quotas for government jobs, which included 30% reserved for the families of those who fought for independence from Pakistan.

Bangladesh: Bangladesh imposes strict curfew with a 'shoot-on-sight-order' following deadly protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-imposes-strict-curfew-with-a-shoot-on-sight-order-following-deadly-protests/articleshow/111884919.cms,"DHAKA: Police imposed a strict curfew with a ""shoot-on-sight"" order across Bangladesh as military forces patrolled parts of the capital Saturday after scores were killed and hundreds injured in clashes over the allocation of civil service jobs.The curfew began at midnight and was relaxed from noon to 2 p.m. for people to run essential errands, and is expected to last until 10 a.m.Sunday, allowing officers to fire on mobs in extreme cases, said lawmaker Obaidul Quader, the general secretary of the ruling Awami League party.The demonstrations - called for mainly by student groups- started weeks ago to protest a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. Violence erupted Tuesday, with the Daily Prothom Alo newspaper reporting the death of at least 103 people.Friday was likely to be the deadliest day so far; Somoy TV reported 43 killed, while an Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they all died on Friday. On Thursday, 22 others were reported dead as protesting students attempted to ""completely shut down"" the country.The United States Embassy in Dhaka said Friday that reports indicated ""hundreds to possibly thousands"" were injured across Bangladesh. It said the situation was ""extremely volatile.""Bangladeshi authorities haven't shared any official numbers of those killed and injured.Officials said the curfew was to quell further violence after police and protesters clashed in the streets and at university campuses in Dhaka and other cities across the South Asian country. Authorities blocked online communications by banning mobile and internet services. Several television news channels also went off the air, and the websites of most local newspapers were down. Meanwhile, some key government websites, including Bangladesh's central bank and the prime minister's office, appeared to have been hacked and defaced.Local media also reported that some 800 inmates fled from a prison in Narsingdi, a district north of the capital, after protesters stormed the facility and set it on fire Friday.The chaos highlights cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of youths who lack good jobs upon graduation. They also represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after January's elections, boycotted by the main opposition groups.Protesters argue the quota system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, saying it should be replaced with a merit-based system. Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war against Pakistan, regardless of their political affiliation.Representatives from both sides met late Friday in an attempt to reach a resolution. At least three student leaders were present and demanded the reform of the current quota system, the reopening of student dormitories shut by the police following the clashes and for some university officials to step down after failing to protect campuses from the violence. Law Minister Anisul Huq said late Friday the government was open to discussing their demands.The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protests, vowing Friday to organize its own demonstrations as many of its supporters joined the students' protests. However, BNP said in a statement its followers were not responsible for the violence and denied the ruling party's accusations of using the protests for political gains.The Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures. Hasina's government had accused the opposition party of attempting to disrupt the vote.In 2018, the government halted the job quotas following mass student protests. But in June, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of 1971 veterans filed petitions. The Supreme Court suspended the ruling, pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take the issue up Sunday.","Police impose a strict curfew with a ""shoot-on-sight"" order across Bangladesh.

Bangladesh is reeling under deadly clashes. The streets of Dhaka , Bangladesh's capital, were empty on Saturday as soldiers patrolled the city during a curfew. The curfew was imposed to suppress the deadly protests led by students against government job quotas, which have resulted in the loss of more than 100 lives this week.Since Thursday, internet and text message services have been suspended, isolating Bangladesh from the rest of the world.Massive crowds of Bangladeshi citizens, including university students, have flooded the streets in recent weeks, demanding a reform of the government job distribution system .Police have fired tear gas and hurled sound grenades to scatter protesters as demonstrators clashed with security personnel, throwing bricks and igniting vehicles.On Saturday, police fired live round towards the protesting students in Dhaka. The incident occurred in Rampura area, and at least one individual among the thousands of protesters sustained injuries.Here are the top developments:Ministry of external affairs on Saturday informed that around 1000 students have safely returned to India, so far. According to a statement released by the MEA, efforts are being made to ensure a smooth passage for Indian citizens. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that it continues to coordinate with civil aviation, immigration, land ports and BSF authorities to ensure a smooth passage for Indian citizens.The majority of the students, numbering 778, have crossed back into India through various land ports. Additionally, around 200 students have taken advantage of regular flight services, departing from Dhaka and Chittagong airports, to return home safely, MEA said.The protests have escalated in violence , leading to a surge of anger against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina following her deployment of police and paramilitary forces to control the protesters. The protests have resulted in the loss more than 100 lives this week, and hundreds of others injured.Students have been protesting for weeks against a quota system for government jobs that favors certain groups, including the families of those who fought for independence from Pakistan.University of Dhaka students began protests on July 1, which later expanded to other prestigious universities in the country. The demonstrations escalated when the Sheikh Hasina's Awami League's pro-quota student wing began assaulting the protesters, according to media reports.The government has deployed police and paramilitary forces, including an anti-terrorism unit, to quell protests. They have also closed down schools and colleges. Authorities claimed to have reduced internet speed to prevent the circulation of misinformation and ensure public safety, making it more challenging for protesters to coordinate and plan via social media.The ministry of external affairs has assured that all Indian citizens residing in Bangladesh are secure, and the government is closely observing the current situation while maintaining contact with officials in the country. This statement comes amidst the ongoing violent protests taking place in Bangladesh.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, during the weekly press briefing on Friday, said, ""As you are aware, there are protests which are happening in Bangladesh. We have around 8500 students and somewhere around 15,000 Indian nationals resident in the country.""The ministry has issued an advisory for Indian nationals in Bangladesh, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar is personally overseeing the situation.The Minister of State for External Affairs, Kirti Vardhan Singh, has referred to the ongoing protests in Bangladesh against the quota system in government jobs as an internal matter of the country. He expressed his concern over the current situation, saying that it is ""worrying"".Speaking to news agency ANI, Singh said, ""This is a worrying issue. Students' issues should always be heard, and we are hopeful that the Bangladesh government will resolve is matter soon.""The Bangladesh government on Friday announced the implementation of a nationwide curfew and the deployment of military forces in response to ongoing demonstrations led by students, BBC Bangla reported.On Saturday, streets of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, were empty as soldiers patrolled the city during a curfew. Those venturing out on the streets had their identification cards inspected by army personnel at different check pointsProtesters on Friday stormed a prison in the district of Narsingdi in the central Bangladesh, and set free hundreds of prisoners.Despite a police-imposed prohibition on public assemblies, massive demonstrations continue to take place in Dhaka.On Thursday, protesters set fire to the state broadcaster's headquarters, as demonstrations intensified.Police used rubber bullets to disperse hundreds of protesters. The demonstrators fought back and pursued the retreating officers to the broadcaster's headquarters.The protesters set fire to the network's reception building and numerous vehicles parked outside. BTV stated in a Facebook post that ""many people"" were trapped inside the building, but a station executive later informed that they had safely evacuated the premises.Just a day before the incident, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had appeared on the network in an attempt to calm the escalating clashes.The ongoing protests in Bangladesh are being led by young people who are against the reinstatement of a 30 per cent quota in government jobs at all levels for those who fought for the country's independence from Pakistan, as well as their descendants.The situation escalated after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made a statement on July 14, seemingly comparing the protesters to the descendants of razakars, who were mercenary collaborators of the Pakistan military during the 1971 war. These collaborators were responsible for a brutal campaign of murder and rape, resulting in an estimated 3 million Bangladeshi deaths within a few months.On June 5, the high court division of the supreme court of Bangladesh ruled on a case filed by the ""children of nationally recognised freedom fighters"", reinstating the 30 per cent reservation and overturning a government circular from October 2018 that had abolished the freedom-fighter and other quotas.Prior to the national elections in December 2018, Prime Minister Hasina had announced decision. From April onwards, students and teachers had been protesting, demanding that quotas be limited to 10 per cent. There had been instances of violence since then, although on a smaller scale compared to this week, with protesters clashing with police and members of Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of Hasina's ruling Awami League party.The government says that it agrees with the students this time as well. It has filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, which has put the high court's order on hold and will consider the case on August 7. Hasina has urged the protesters to remain patient until then.The government of Bangladesh has enforced a stringent curfew, accompanied by a ""shoot-on-sight"" directive, following a wave of deadly clashes over the distribution of government jobs. The curfew, which began at midnight, was briefly lifted from noon to 2 pm to allow citizens to attend to essential tasks. It is set to remain in effect until 10 am on Sunday, granting law enforcement the authority to open fire on unruly crowds in extreme situations.The government imposed a curfew to suppress additional unrest following confrontations between law enforcement and demonstrators on the streets and at universities in Dhaka and other urban areas throughout the nation. To disrupt online communication, officials restricted mobile and internet services. Furthermore, multiple television news networks ceased broadcasting, and most local newspaper websites were inaccessible.","Around 1000 Indian students have safely returned to India, so far.

What is Bangladesh's quota system and will it be reintroduced?

The United Nations human rights chief on Friday called the attacks on student protesters in Bangladesh ""shocking and unacceptable,"" as the death toll from the crackdown by authorities crossed the 100 mark.Almost daily demonstrations broke out at the beginning of July against plans to reintroduce job quotas for public sector jobs , which were abolished in 2018 after earlier student protests.The students are demanding a merit-based system.""I am deeply concerned by this week’s violence in Bangladesh , resulting in reports of dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries. The attacks on student protesters are particularly shocking and unacceptable,"" UN human rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.""There must be impartial, prompt and exhaustive investigations into these attacks, and those responsible held to account,"" the statement continued.Turk said he was very worried about reports of the deployment of paramilitary police units , which he said have ""long track records of violations.""He urged the government to take measures to ensure the safety of students in peaceful protests and to guarantee the right to freedom of assembly without fear of attacks.Violence continued in the capital Dhaka on Friday as several hundred student demonstrators blocked roads and clashed with police, the day after the bloodiest day of the protests.Police fired tear gas to scatter protesters in some areas, journalists from Reuters news agency said. One reporter said many fires could be seen across the city.A tally by AFP news agency, based on victims from hospitals around the country put the death toll at 105, late Friday. They included at least 52 people killed Friday, according to a list drawn up by the Dhaka Medical College Hospital.The government has not released a figure for the number of dead.Also Friday, Dhaka's police force banned all public gatherings for the day - a first since the protests began.A group of demonstrators stormed a jail in the central Bangladeshi district of Narsingdi, freeing hundreds of inmates and setting the facility on fire, AFP news agency reported, citing a police officer.Trains services were suspended nationwide, communications networks were disrupted and television news channels, including the state broadcaster BTW, fell silent.The official websites of the central bank, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's office and the police appeared to have been hacked by a group calling itself ""THE R3SISTANC3,"" Reuters reported.Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior leader of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which has backed the protests, was arrested.Hasina's office late Friday announced a nationwide curfew and deployed military personnel to keep order.The quota system would allow for more than half of public-sector jobs to be reserved for certain groups.Some 30% of jobs would be set aside for the descendants of ex-military personnel who fought for the country's independence against Pakistan in 1971. A smaller quota would be earmarked for women, the disabled and people from poor neighborhoods.Critics say the proposals are discriminatory and will benefit those groups aligned with the Awami League party of Hasina, who has ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist for the past 15 years.Competition for stable and lucrative public-sector jobs in Bangladesh is fierce. Each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.The quota system is potentially being reintroduced after the High Court last month overturned a ban when relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions.That ruling was suspended by the Supreme Court pending an appeal hearing scheduled for Sunday.On Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to ""wait with patience"" for the court verdict, saying that she believes they ""will get justice"" and ""will not be disappointed.""The government also said it had offered to hold talks with the protesters but the call was rejected.","UN human rights chief calls attacks on student protesters in Bangladesh ""shocking and unacceptable"" Death toll from crackdown by authorities crosses the 100 mark.
