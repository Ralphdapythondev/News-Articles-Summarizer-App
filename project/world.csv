Why is Biden going to Europe twice in a week?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-is-biden-going-to-europe-twice-in-a-week/articleshow/110952455.cms,"Air Force One is plenty comfortable if you are its most privileged frequent flier, with a comfortable bedroom and a spacious office. Still, most US presidents will try to avoid making two back-to-back round trips to Europe, separated by about 60 hours on the ground at home. Yet that is what Prez Joe Biden is pulling off this week - for reasons few at the White House seem eager to discuss.Biden left the US for D-Day celebrations in France last Wednesday, June 5, stayed the weekend for a state dinner in Paris, and returned to his home in Delaware late Sunday. He left Washington again early Wednesday, June 12, to fly to Italy for the annual gathering of the G7 .When Biden looks back at those two round trips - roughly a day and a half of flying, all told - he may remember only what happened in between: the conviction of his only living son, Hunter Biden , on charges of lying to obtain a gun permit.But the two round trips beg the question: Why didn't he just stay in Europe for a couple days? He is, after all, 81, and some of his aides who are half his age were complaining about lost sleep cycles.The White House's explanation for four trans-Atlantic crossings in nine days was simply that Biden had commitments in Washington. But by presidential standards, his public schedule looked light: a lunch with vice-president Kamala Harris and a speech to a gun-safety group. Hunter Biden's trial also loomed over the planning, though it was impossible to know when these trips were planned that the case would go to the jury and a verdict would be rendered in the three days between the D-Day trip and the G7 meeting.But privately, some aides said there were election-year optics to be considered. There was no urgent reason to stay in Europe, and a few down days ""might not look right"", one of Biden's advisers conceded. In any case, no one wanted images of the president on what his political opponents might cast as a European holiday, at least while he is running for re-election.The presidency, of course, is the ultimate work-from-anywhere job. There are instant communications (a White House van, bristling with antennas, travels in every motorcade) and a staff of hundreds ready to cater to every contingency, whether that involves sending off a thank-you note or launching a retaliatory nuclear strike.The intolerance for seeing presidents abroad, save for work, has a long history. Franklin D Roosevelt loved to camp at Campobello Island, in Canada, though as president he kept the visits brief. When Harry S Truman went to Potsdam, Germany, to negotiate with Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill about what post-WWII Europe would look like, he stayed for more than two weeks. There were days off from the negotiations, but not for long, and the nearest big city, Berlin, was a bombed wreck. And there was a reminder of the risks of being out of town: Churchill's party lost to Labour during the conference, and he got booted out of office while it was still going on.","Biden left the US for D-Day celebrations in France last Wednesday, June 5, stayed the weekend for a state dinner in Paris, and returned to his home in Delaware late Sunday.

UN inquiry says Israel & Hamas committed war crimes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/un-inquiry-says-israel-hamas-committed-war-crimes/articleshow/110952432.cms,"A United Nations commission investigating the Oct 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent conflict in Gaza has accused both Palestinian armed groups and Israel of committing war crimes , and the panel said that Israel's conduct of the war included crimes against humanity.In a report released on Wednesday, the three-person commission - led by South African of Indian Tamil origin Navi Pillay, a former UN human rights chief - provided the most detailed UN examination yet of events on and since Oct. 7. The report does not itself carry any penalties, but it lays out a legal analysis of actions in the Gaza conflict that is likely to be weighed by the International Court of Justice and in other international criminal proceedings. Israel did not cooperate with the probe and protested the panel's assessment, the panel - which also included Miloon Kothari, an Indian expert on human rights - said.The report said Hamas's military wing and six other Palestinian armed groups - aided in some instances by Palestinian civilians - killed and tortured people during Oct 7 assault on Israel in which over 800 civilians were among the over 1,200 killed. An additional 252 people, including 36 kids, were taken hostage, the report said. ""Many abductions were carried out with significant physical, mental and sexual violence and degrading and humiliating treatment, including in some cases parading the abductees,"" it said.

NEW DELHI: Johnson & Johnson has agreed to a $700 million settlement to resolve an investigation by 42 US states and Washington, DC. The probe scrutinized the marketing of their baby powder and other talc-based products, linked to allegations of causing cancer .The agreement addresses accusations that Johnson & Johnson misled consumers regarding the safety of its talc products . These products have been sold for over a century before the company ceased their sales.J&J has not admitted to any wrongdoing as part of this settlement with the states, which included leaders like Florida, North Carolina, and Texas. The company maintains that its talc products are safe and do not cause cancer. They announced a settlement in principle in January.""This is a major advancement for consumer product safety,"" Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said in a statement.Johnson & Johnson is dealing with a significant number of lawsuits related to their talc products. As of March 31, around 61,490 individuals have sued the company.The majority of these cases involve women diagnosed with ovarian cancer, while some plaintiffs have mesothelioma, a cancer attributed to asbestos exposure.Last year, J&J discontinued the sale of its talc-based baby powder worldwide, opting for corn starch as the primary ingredient. The company maintains that its products are asbestos-free.In an effort to manage the litigation , J&J created a subsidiary to handle its talc liabilities and attempted to place it in bankruptcy twice. Both attempts were unsuccessful in court.On May 1, J&J proposed a $6.48 billion settlement to resolve most of the litigation through a third bankruptcy filing.

US President Joe Biden's son Hunter convicted of all three felony charges in gun trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hunter-biden-convicted-on-all-three-felony-charges-in-gun-trial/articleshow/110916748.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hunter Biden has been convicted of all three felony charges related to his 2018 purchase of a revolver. Prosecutors argued that the president’s son lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs. The jury found him guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application, and illegally possessing the firearm for 11 days.Facing up to 25 years in prison, Biden will be sentenced by Judge Maryellen Noreika. However, first-time offenders typically do not receive the maximum sentence, and it is uncertain if he will serve any prison time.Reacting to the conviction, Hunter Biden said that he's grateful for support from family and friends but 'disappointed' by the verdict.The Hunter Biden case, brought by US Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss—a Trump appointee—includes charges of three felony and six misdemeanor tax offenses in California. Weiss also alleges that Hunter Biden failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019, while spending millions on drugs, escorts, exotic cars, and other high-ticket items.The trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Trump, marking the first time a former US president was found guilty of a felony. Trump, the Republican challenger, is set to face Democrat Joe Biden in the November 5 election.President Joe Biden has avoided the Delaware courtroom where his son was tried and has commented little on the case, conscious of not appearing to interfere in a matter prosecuted by his own Justice Department. Democratic allies are concerned about the emotional toll on the 81-year-old president, who has long worried about his son’s health and sobriety.Hunter Biden and Trump both claim they are victims of politically motivated prosecutions. While Trump insisted the verdict against him was rigged, President Biden reacted to the conviction he will accept the verdict and will not seek to pardon his son.President Biden issued a statement affirming his unwavering support for his son, alongside First Lady Jill Biden but emphasized his commitment to respecting the judicial process and indicated his readiness to accept the outcome, while also noting Hunter's consideration of an appeal.Expressing their enduring love and support, President Biden underscored their pride in the person Hunter has become, despite the challenges he has faced. He acknowledged the struggles many families endure with loved ones battling addiction, drawing attention to the shared sense of pride in witnessing their strength and resilience in recovery. “So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,"" said Biden.Hunter Biden's legal troubles are not over. He faces a September trial in California for failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes, and congressional Republicans plan to continue their impeachment efforts against President Biden. The president has not been accused of any wrongdoing in these investigations.During the trial, the prosecution emphasized the severity of Hunter Biden's drug addiction, presenting personal testimonies and embarrassing evidence. Jurors heard from his ex-wife and a former girlfriend about his habitual crack cocaine use and saw images and videos depicting his addiction. Although Hunter Biden did not testify, prosecutors played excerpts from his 2021 memoir ""Beautiful Things,"" where he describes his struggle with addiction.The prosecution argued that this evidence was crucial to show Hunter Biden was addicted when he purchased the gun, making his denial on the form a lie. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell contended that Hunter's state of mind was different at the time of the purchase and that he did not consider himself addicted then. Lowell suggested that Hunter might have acknowledged a drinking problem but not a drug problem, and alcohol abuse does not disqualify one from purchasing a firearm.Hunter Biden had hoped to resolve the federal investigation with a plea deal last year, avoiding a trial close to the 2024 election. The deal, which included pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and avoiding prosecution for the gun charge if he remained out of trouble for two years, fell apart after Judge Noreika raised concerns about its unusual terms. Subsequently, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Delaware’s US Attorney David Weiss as a special counsel, leading to Hunter Biden’s indictment in August.Hunter Biden claims that the charges were a result of the Justice Department yielding to Republican pressure, alleging he received special treatment. The investigation into the revolver began when Hallie Biden, Beau’s widow, found it unloaded in Hunter's truck and disposed of it in a garbage can, where it was later discovered by a man who retrieved it inadvertently. Hallie, who had a romantic relationship with Hunter after Beau's death, eventually called the police. The case was initially closed due to Hunter’s lack of cooperation, where he was considered the victim.(With inputs from agencies)","Hunter Biden found guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application, and illegally possessing the firearm for 11 days.

'We have the Israelis right where we want them': Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's cold calculation on rising Gaza deaths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/we-have-the-israelis-right-where-we-want-them-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwars-cold-calculation-on-rising-gaza-deaths/articleshow/110900869.cms,"Sinwar on children as hostages

NEW DELHI: Revealing the cold calculations of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar amid the rising death toll in the Israeli-Gaza war, correspondence obtained by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) between Sinwar and Hamas officials in Qatar, show that the militant group believes that civilian casualties in Gaza will help it politically.According to the WSJ, Sinwar's messages show he believes that images of dead Palestinians , even if killed by Hamas rockets misfiring, will turn world opinion against Israel and strengthen Hamas's hand. He has instructed his forces to accept some civilian casualties as the price of battle and ""necessary sacrifices"".As per the report, Sinwar, while referring to the war recently wrote to Hamas officials negotiating a hostage deal: ""We have the Israelis right where we want them.""This is not the first time that Sinwar has aired such thoughts.When the three sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh were killed in an Israel Air Force strike in Gaza in April, Sinwar affirmed both their deaths and that of other Palestinians would ""infuse life into the veins of this nation, prompting it to rise to its glory and honor"".The correspondence, however, also reveals that he did not approve of women and children being taken hostages during the deadly October 7 attack.The WSJ report cites his messages to negotiators as saying, ""Things went out of control"".""People got caught up in this, and that shouldn't have happened,"" he wrote.Sinwar was also reportedly discontent with Hamas officials meeting with other factions in December to debate reconciliation after the war, which he labeled ""shameful and outrageous"".He reportedly added: ""As long as fighters are still standing and we have not lost the war, such contacts should be immediately terminated ... We have the capabilities to continue fighting for months.""Referring to the recent ground operation in Rafah that has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Gazans, Sinwar wrote to Hamas leaders in Qatar that ""Israel's journey in Rafah won't be a walk in the park"".The WSJ report further noted that Sinwar’s recent messages to Hamas allies illustrate an inclination to die while fighting.Sinwar equated the Gaza war to the battle of Karbala in Iraq, which occurred in the 7th century and in which the grandson of the prophet Muhammed was killed. ""We have to move forward on the same path we started,"" Sinwar said, adding ""or let it be a new Karbala"".More than 37,124 Palestinians have been killed and 84,712 have been injured in Israel's military offensive on Gaza since October 7, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Monday.","Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar believes that images of dead Palestinians will turn world opinion against Israel.

They also added a speech bubble to the cartoon figure, reading: ""No cheese, Gromit.

NEW DELHI: Malawi mourns the loss of its Vice President Saulos Chilima and nine others following a fatal plane crash , confirmed by President Lazarus Chakwera on Tuesday.The wreckage of the military aircraft transporting Vice President Chilima was discovered in a rugged mountainous area in the northern region of the country after an extensive search spanning more than a day. Regrettably, there were no survivors, President Chakwera announced in a somber live address broadcast on state television.The tragic incident unfolded as the aircraft, carrying Vice President Chilima and former first lady Shanil Dzimbiri, among others, vanished from radar during its scheduled 45-minute flight from the capital city, Lilongwe, to Mzuzu in the north.Air traffic controllers redirected the plane away from Mzuzu's airport due to adverse weather conditions and poor visibility, instructing it to return to Lilongwe. However, contact with the aircraft was abruptly lost thereafter, leaving authorities grappling with the unfolding crisis.The aircraft, identified as a small, propeller-driven plane operated by the Malawian armed forces, was carrying seven passengers and three military crew members, according to President Chakwera. The search and rescue operation, spanning a vast forest plantation in the Viphya Mountains near Mzuzu, involved approximately 600 personnel, comprising soldiers, police officers, forest rangers, and volunteers from organizations like the Malawi Red Cross.General Valentino Phiri, commander of the Malawian armed forces, described the challenging terrain and dense forest cover as formidable obstacles impeding search efforts. Despite the daunting conditions, authorities remained resolute in their commitment to locating the wreckage and any possible survivors.President Chakwera expressed gratitude for the international support extended by the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Israel, who offered specialized technologies to aid in the search operation. Assistance from neighboring Zambia and Tanzania was also enlisted, with additional helicopters and drones dispatched to bolster search efforts.Chilima was serving his second term as vice president. He was also in the role from 2014-2019 under former President Peter Mutharika. He was a candidate in the 2019 Malawian presidential election and finished third, behind the incumbent, Mutharika, and Chakwera. The vote was later annulled by Malawi’s Constitutional Court because of irregularities.Chilima then joined Chakwera’s campaign as his running mate in an historic election rerun in 2020, when Chakwera was elected president. It was the first time in Africa that an election result that was overturned by a court resulted in a defeat for the sitting president.Chilima had previously been facing corruption charges over allegations that he received money in return for influencing the awarding of government procurement contracts for the Malawi armed forces and the police, but prosecutors dropped the charges last month. He had denied the allegations, but the case led to criticism that Chakwera’s administration was not taking a hard enough stance against graft.","Malawi mourns the loss of its Vice President Saulos Chilima and nine others following a fatal plane crash.

The dark side of host clubs: Hundreds of women in Japan coerced into sex,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-dark-side-of-host-clubs-hundreds-of-women-in-japan-coerced-into-sex/articleshow/110881740.cms,"NEW DELHI: Japan ’s host clubs , renowned for their glamorous male hosts who entertain female clients, are facing increasing scrutiny over allegations of debt and exploitation . The industry, which thrives on the allure of companionship and luxury, has come under fire as former hosts and clients reveal troubling practices behind the scenes.

As per a CNN report, several ex-hosts described a work environment where debt is often used as a tool of control. One former host, Tatsuya, recounted how he was lured by the promise of high earnings but quickly found himself trapped in a cycle of debt. “They told me I could make a lot of money, but I ended up owing the club more than I made,” Tatsuya said. The pressure to meet sales quotas led many hosts to spend their own money to buy expensive drinks for clients, further deepening their financial woes.

Clients, too, have fallen victim to these practices. Many women, enticed by the attention and affection of hosts, spend exorbitant amounts of money to maintain these relationships. Some end up in significant debt, forced to take on multiple jobs or even engage in sex work to pay off what they owe. “I felt special and wanted, but it came at a huge cost,” said one former client who wished to remain anonymous.

The darker side of the host club industry extends beyond financial exploitation . Reports have emerged of emotional manipulation, where hosts use affection and psychological tactics to encourage clients to spend more. Former host Ryo explained, “We were trained to make clients feel valued and loved, but it was all a strategy to get them to spend more money.”

These revelations have sparked a public outcry and calls for regulatory action. Critics argue that the host club industry preys on vulnerable individuals and perpetuates cycles of debt and exploitation. Advocacy groups are urging the Japanese government to implement stricter regulations to protect both hosts and clients from these predatory practices.

""We must always maintain our vigilance and cannot rule out the possibility of taking countermeasures.""In March, two Taiwanese fishermen strayed into Chinese waters near the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen islands, which sit next to China's coast. One, a Taiwanese military officer, remains in detention in China, while the other was released soon after.","Taiwan's coast guard arrested the man on Sunday after his boat entered a river that leads into Taipei.

US inflation cooled in May in a sign that price pressures may be easing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-inflation-cooled-in-may-in-a-sign-that-price-pressures-may-be-easing/articleshow/110945323.cms,"WASHINGTON: Inflation in the United States eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that a pickup in prices that occurred early this year may have passed. The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs — the closely watched “core” index — rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, below last month’s 3.6% rise. That was the mildest such increase in three years.Fed officials are scrutinizing each month’s inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago — a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden’s re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.Wednesday's report suggested that consumers are beginning to get some relief from the price spikes of the past three years. Grocery costs were unchanged, on average, from April to May, after actually falling 0.2% the previous month. Food prices have risen just 1% over the past 12 months, though they're still up about 20% from three years ago.Average gas prices tumbled 3.6% nationally just from April to May, though they're 2.2% higher than they were a year earlier. Those declines have continued, with gas averaging $3.45 a gallon Wednesday, down 17 cents from a month ago. Americans didn't drive as much over the Memorial Day weekend as they have in previous years, reducing demand, and oil prices have fallen.Overall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May. Measured from a year earlier, prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.“It's certainly welcome news,” said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. ""It drives home that the inflation challenge in the United States is not as challenging as monetary policy makers believe.”Airfares, furniture and clothing also dropped in price last month, helping keep inflation in check. And the cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier.The Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed’s target level.Persistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates — or keeps them high — to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.The longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.Inflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a “soft landing,” whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.But inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.In early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.Some signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending. In response, several major retail and restaurant chains, including Walmart, Target, Walgreen’s, McDonald’s and Burger King, have responded by announcing price cuts or deals.","Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs rose 0.2% from April to May.

Blinken says some of Hamas' proposed changes to a cease-fire plan in Gaza are workable and some not,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-says-some-of-hamas-proposed-changes-to-a-cease-fire-plan-in-gaza-are-workable-and-some-not/articleshow/110945200.cms,"Hamas asks for amendments'

Revenge for slain commander

BEIRUT: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the war in Gaza would go on after Hamas proposed ""numerous"" changes to a US-backed cease-fire plan, some that he said were ""workable"" and some not. He did not spell out what the changes were. Speaking to reporters in Qatar, Blinken said the US and other mediators will keep trying to ""close this deal.""Blinken is in the region to push a cease-fire proposal with global support that has not been fully embraced by Israel or Hamas. The militant group submitted its first official response late Tuesday, requesting ""amendments"" to the deal.The American's comments came as Lebanon's Hezbollah fired a massive barrage of rockets into northern Israel to avenge the killing of a top commander, further escalating regional tensions.Hezbollah, an Iran-backed ally of Hamas, has traded fire with Israel nearly every day since the 8-month-long Israel-Hamas war began and says it will only stop if there is a truce in Gaza. That has raised fears of an even more devastating regional conflagration.Air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel, and the military said that about 160 projectiles were fired from southern Lebanon, making it one of the largest attacks since the fighting began. There were no immediate reports of casualties as some were intercepted while others ignited brush fires.Hamas has expressed support for the broad outline of the deal but wariness over whether Israel would implement its terms.Hamas spokesman Jihad Taha told the Lebanese news outlet ElNashra that the ""amendments"" requested by the group include guarantees of a permanent cease-fire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.Hamas's official reply to the proposal, which it conveyed to mediators on Tuesday, appeared to be short of outright acceptance but kept negotiations alive.Qatar and Egypt, which have been key mediators alongside the United States, said they were studying it.Blinken is on his eighth visit to the region since the start of the war.The proposal has raised hopes of ending a conflict in which Israel's bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza have killed over 37,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and driven some 80 per cent of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Israeli restrictions and ongoing fighting have hindered efforts to bring humanitarian aid to the isolated coastal enclave, fueling widespread hunger.Israel launched its campaign after Hamas and other militants stormed into Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Over 100 hostages were released during a weeklong cease-fire last year in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.Hamas is still holding around 120 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead.The proposal announced by Biden calls for a three-phase plan that would begin with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes.Phase one also requires the safe distribution of humanitarian assistance ""at scale throughout the Gaza Strip,"" which Biden said would lead to 600 trucks of aid entering Gaza every day.At the same time, negotiations would be launched over the second phase, which is to bring ""a permanent end to hostilities, in exchange for the release of all other hostages still in Gaza, and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.""Phase three would launch ""a major multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of the remains of any deceased hostages still in Gaza to their families.""The militant group accepted a similar proposal last month that was rejected by Israel.Netanyahu's far-right coalition allies have rejected the latest proposal and have threatened to bring down his government if he ends the war leaving Hamas intact. But Netanyahu is also under mounting pressure to accept a deal to bring the hostages back.Thousands of Israelis, including families of the hostages, have demonstrated in favor of the US-backed plan.Hezbollah said it fired missiles and rockets at two military bases in retaliation for the killing of Taleb Sami Abdullah, 55. Known within Hezbollah as Hajj Abu Taleb, he is the most senior commander killed since the fighting began eight months ago. The Israeli strike destroyed a house where Abdullah and three other officials were meeting, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border, late Tuesday.A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press that Abdullah was in charge of a large part of the Lebanon-Israel front, including the area facing the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, which Hezbollah has repeatedly attacked in recent days, causing fires in the area.The official, who was not authorized to speak to media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Abdullah had joined Hezbollah decades ago and took part in attacks against Israeli forces during their 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon that ended in May 2000.Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 400 people, most of them Hezbollah members, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began.Other groups allied with Iran, including powerful militias in Iraq and Syria, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, have also attacked Israeli, US and other targets since the start of the war, often drawing Western retaliation.In April, Israel and Iran traded fire directly for the first time.US President Joe Biden 's administration has said the best way to calm regional tensions is for Hamas to accept a proposal for a phased cease-fire that it says would end of the war in Gaza and bring about the release of the remaining hostages abducted in Hamas' October 7 attack that ignited the war. The UN Security Council voted overwhelmingly in favor of the plan on Monday.Biden says it is an Israeli proposal, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sent conflicting signals, saying Israel remains committed to destroying Hamas.It's unclear how it would do that if the US-backed proposal, which includes an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, is fully implemented.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the war in Gaza would go on after Hamas proposed ""numerous"" changes to a US-backed cease-fire plan.

techie got the USA off to a dream start. He added the cherry on the cake by also dismissing his former Mumbai senior and current India captain Rohit Sharma.These lines from The New Colossus, the 1883 poem by Emma Lazarus, are etched in bronze on the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal and stand as a promise of the American Dream at the heart of the message for any immigrant coming to the US.One of those stories that took a roundabout route involved Santiago Munez, the fictional protagonist of Goal: The Dream Begins (2005), an illegal immigrant from Los Angeles who travels to the Premier League and becomes a big-time ball player with Newcastle United. The tale of an illegal American immigrant from Los Angeles crossing the oceans to become a big-game ball player was a little different from the one promised by the words etched on the Statue of Liberty, but 19 years later, Saurabh Netravalkar, not an illegal immigrant per se, seems to be living the same dream but with whipped cream on top.Netravalkar is living both the American dream (becoming a professionally successful migrant in the Shining City on the Top of the Hill) and the Indian dream (beating Pakistan in a crunch match) at the same time. Next up he faces off against the nation he represented as a youngster, against team members with whom he has shared the dressing room.Netravalkar’s story is remarkably amazing.As a profile in The Times put it: “Such is the fine balance America’s newest — and perhaps most unlikely — sporting hero has had to strike to keep his cricket dreams alive that software engineer Saurabh Netravalkar has even been known to spend the lunch interval during club matches hunched over his work laptop, either coding or in a meeting with colleagues via video call. At last, however, all those hours spent juggling the demands of a full-time job with tech giant Oracle while simultaneously playing professional sports have finally paid off.”When he’s not bowling at Pakistan with the fury of an engineer asked to do a task without a valid JIRA ticket, Netravalkar’s day job is as a Principal Engineer at Oracle. And, as if being an international-level cricketer and a coder par excellence wasn’t enough to brag about, Netravalkar is also a talented Ukulele player and married to Devi Snighda Upalla, who also happens to be a Principal Oracle Engineer and a talented Kathak dancer whose Bolly X Fitness program is quite the rage. It would appear that talent and luck are not democratically allocated when it’s being handed out either by a higher being or evolution.Netravalkar’s meteoric rise as an Indian-American migrant comes at a time when folks of Indian origin can be found on both sides of the political spectrum as well as the upper echelons of American society with the exception of sports. It’s fair to say that of all immigrant groups – turning up on American shores for a better life – none have made their mark on America much like Indian-Americans. They are the highest-earning minority group. In politics, the so-called Samosa Caucus – a term to describe a modest number of Indian-Americans in Congress – has exploded on both sides of politics. On the Republican side, you’ve Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, whilein the Democrats setup includes the vice-president Kamala Harris and several others serving in the House of Representatives. In business, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella are the headliners among 21 billion-dollar companies that are led by Indian Americans. Even among Nobel Laureates, you have the likes of Amartya Sen, Abhijit Banerjee, and Venki Ramakrishnan but none of them appear to have ticked more than one box like Netravalkar.As one Instagram user put it: “Bro casually sings, works as an engineer full time, and owns Pakistan for a hobby.”So, how did Saurabh Netravalkar become the poster child of the Indian and American dream? It all started in the greatest cricketing city on the planet: Mumbai.The abode of many cricketing legends including Sachin Tendulkar , Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri, and current India captain Rohit Sharma, many youngsters grow up in the city with the hope of playing for India.Mumbai has won the most Ranji trophies with 42 wins in 88 seasons. The wide gulf in class is evident from the fact that the number 2 spot is held by Karnataka who have won the domestic tournament 8 times. But Mumbai’s success can also be a hindrance and it’s perhaps the hardest team to break into for any player. Even Sachin Tendulkar’s son Arjun – a nifty fast bowler – had to switch allegiances to Goa to get regular game time.But the odds didn’t appear to deter Netravalkar who came into the limelight in 2009 when he rattled Yuvraj Singh’s stump at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru. Yuvraj by then had already become part of Indian cricketing folklore after his stupendous India debut in the 2000 ICC Knock Out Trophy when he scored 84 unbeaten in 80 runs against an Aussie pace attack consisting of Bret Lee, Glen McGrath, and Jason Gillespie.Fortune seemed to be smiling on Netravalkar when he was called up for the BCCI Corporate Trophy where he shared the dressing room with the likes of Yuvraj Singh, Robin Uthappa, and Suresh Raina, while the opposing camp had Messrs Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. He also had a superlative 2010 U-19 Cricket World Cup, where he was the leading wicket-taker for India. However, breaking into the senior setup proved more difficult. At that time, the Mumbai squad was teeming with pacers like Ajit Agarkar, Zaheer Khan, and others.Taking a call to give his cricket career a boost, he missed a full semester to focus on the game. Netravalkar made his Ranji debut in 2013 but being in and out of the team meant he bid adieu to the game he loved and took the more practical route of going back to his studies.Fate appeared to have shut the cricket door forever when Cornell University in New York in 2015 offered him a scholarship after being impressed with his player analysis app called CricDecode (If you search, you can still find the app’s code on the developer platform GitHub).After he graduated from Cornell, he was offered a job by Oracle in San Francisco and having left his cricket kit back home, started playing recreationally on weekends to fit in.Fate intervened when the ICC changed its rules – from four years to three years – for residents to represent their adopted nations. An H1B card holder, Netravalkar broke into the US squad in 2018 and even captained the team for three years.Like all cricket-crazy fans in India, Netrvalkar and his father Naresh watched many matches together in the 1990s and 2000s. His favorite bowlers were Wasim Akram, Chaminda Vaas, and Zaheer Khan. Perhaps those fantasies would have remained a dream had it not been for the US co-hosting the T20 Cricket World Cup as Netravalkar showed that he had what it takes to face off against the big boys. Incidentally, in 2010, in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup, Netravalkar faced heartbreak when Team India lost to the Pakistan team that had a young Babar Azam.On June 12, Netravalkar will face off against players he knows from a lifetime ago, whose exploits he might have followed on the news or social media.While Virat Kohli was in the opposing camp in the BCCI Corporate Championship, current captain Rohit Sharma was a senior in the Mumbai squad. Meanwhile, Surya Kumar Yadav, a batsman who has redefined T20 cricket with his avant-garde batting style was a contemporary in the Mumbai dressing room.Opposing coach Rahul Dravid, who watched him bowl the Super Over against Pakistan, is also someone he bowled to at the National Cricket Academy many years ago.In fact, there’s an almost epochal tinge to Netravalkar’s exponential rise in the first T20 tournament held in the land that Columbus thought he had discovered, and the one he actually discovered as Columbus as the USA faces off against the land that Columbus hoped to discover. That at the heart of the story would be a young man from Mumbai in US colours makes this an even greater tale.In the vintage video game Cricket ’97, the sagacious Richie Benaud had a line that went: “You know not much is wrong with the world when you can hear the sound of leather hitting the willow.” For a long time, the United States was one nation where the sound of willow and leather hitting was missing (unless one counts baseball) but all that looks set to change after this World Cup. Americans, not just the diaspora, appear to have fully embraced the sport and amid the heart of that has been an Oracle engineer simultaneously living the American and Indian dream. There are engineers who play cricket and cricketers who are engineers, but there's hardly anyone who is so proficient at both.In fact, there’s a video on his Instagram where Netravalkar, while watching the India vs Pakistan game says in chaste Marathi that would make even South Bombay residents stop in their tracks: “Definitely come on June 12 to support us on the ground.” Many fans – irrespective of their nationality or giving a fig about the Tebbit Test - would be forgiven if, for a small moment, they decide to back the young lad from Mumbai in US colours who dared to dream as he bowls against the likes of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.","Saurabh Netravalkar is living both the American dream and the Indian dream at the same time. The software engineer is also a talented Ukulele player and married to Devi Snighda Upalla, who also happens to be a Principal Oracle Engineer and a talented Kathak dancer.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110944189,imgsize-129366,width-400,resizemode-4/110944189.jpg"

'Exposed himself, offered to buy horse'

'Have my babies'

'Month-long sex'

NEW Delhi: Elon Musk had several phases of 'strange' relationships with several women employees at his SpaceX during which he asked one to have his babies, offered to buy a horse to one in exchange for sex acts, the Wall Street Journal reported.The explosive report is based on the accounts of four women - all of them claimed to have relationship with the billionaire, and several other former employees who accused Musk of using illegal drugs. The report did not have any comment from Elon Musk but SpaceX said it investigates all complaints of harassment. Calling Elon Musk 'one of the best humans', SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said the allegations paint a completely misleading narrative.According to the report, a women met Musk when she was still in college. She approached Elon Musk with ideas for improving SpaceX. Her outreach had led to a date, which led to a kiss, and eventually sex, she told friends. The year after her internship, the billionaire had the fresh college graduate flown out to a resort in Sicily, before they ended things, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Musk was 20 years senior to her.They kept their relationship alive even after they officially broke up. Elon Musk texted her often and invited her to come over to his Los Angeles mansion. The report said the woman sometimes accepted the invitations.One woman, a SpaceX flight attendant, alleged that in 2016 Musk exposed himself to her and offered to buy her a horse in exchange for sex acts, WSJ reported.Another woman who left the company in 2013 alleged in exit negotiations with SpaceX human resources and legal executives that Musk had asked her to have his babies.A fourth woman claimed to have a month-long sexual relationship with Musk in 2014 while she directly reported to him. The relationship ended badly, the reports said, leading to recriminations over text and email as she left the company and signed an agreement prohibiting her from discussing her work for Musk.Several former employees quoted in the WSJ report confirmed that the culture in SpaceX is 'Elon is SpaceX and SpaceX is Elon' and therefore he can act with impunity.",The report is based on the accounts of four women - all of them claimed to have relationship with the billionaire.

Will US President's son Hunter Biden go to jail? Here's what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-us-presidents-son-hunter-biden-go-to-jail-heres-what-we-know/articleshow/110928961.cms,"Hunter Biden conviction: Here's all you need to know

Hunter Biden was convicted of lying on a mandatory gun purchase form as he said he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs. He had the gun illegally for 11 years. So the first two counts were for lying and the third was for possessing the gun while addicted to drugs. In Hunter Biden's defense, his gun was not used in a crime. His lawyers said he never fired the gun and it was thrown in trash after 11 days. Hunter Biden will appeal against the conviction but it's not clear on what grounds. Joe Biden said he would not pardon his son. So a presidential pardon stands ruled out as of now. This is the first time that a president's immediate family member has been found guilty of a crime during the term of the president. But Hunter Biden's crimes took place before his father's tenure as president. What Hunter Biden said after the verdict: He said he is ""more grateful for the love and support"" of his family than he is ""disappointed by the outcome"". CNN reported that the jury was split during the deliberations. One said the case ""seemed like a waste of taxpayer dollars"", while three jurors quoted by CNN said they believed that they had no choice but to find Hunter Biden guilty. After the verdict, as Joe Biden landed at the Delaware Air National Guard base, his first gesture was to hug Hunter. 53-year-old Hunter Biden is not new to controversies and his life has been a saga of personal, professional tragedies. Hunter and his father together survived the deaths of Biden's first wife, eldest daughter and eldest son. Hunter Biden maintained that he had been sober since 2019.

US to send another patriot missile system to Ukraine after repeated demands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-to-send-another-patriot-missile-system-to-ukraine-after-repeated-demands/articleshow/110926529.cms,"KYIV : US president Joe Biden has approved the deployment of another patriot missile system to Ukraine amid raging conflict with Russia , senior administration and military officials said.Biden's decision came last week, the officials said, after a series of high-level meetings and an internal debate over how to meet Ukraine's pressing needs for bolstered air defences without jeopardizing US combat readiness. This comes as Kyiv is struggling to fend off Russian attacks on its cities, infrastructure and electrical grid.The new patriot system, the second that the United States has sent to Ukraine, will come from Poland, where it has been protecting a rotational force of American troops who will be returning to the US, officials said.According to the officials, the system could be deployed to Ukraine's front lines in the next several days, depending on any maintenance or modifications it needs.Considered one of the United States' best air defence weapons, the Patriot includes a powerful radar system and mobile launchers that fire missiles at incoming projectiles.It is also one of the scarcest weapons systems in the US arsenal. Pentagon officials refuse to disclose how many it has, but one senior military official said that the army has deployed only 14 of them, in the US and around the world.Notably, patriots are also held by American allies and two of those nations have sent a couple to Ukraine, but US officials say they hope European powers will send more.Pentagon officials did not want to move any batteries from the US. There is a patriot battery at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for training American and Ukrainian troops, but moving it would take away training, the officials said. Other batteries protecting bases and troops in the US, including in Hawaii, were either deemed too far away or necessary for homeland defence.Defence secretary Lloyd Austin and other senior Pentagon leaders have appealed to European allies to transfer their systems to Ukraine.Two other nations have responded to Ukraine's plea for more Patriots. Germany has so far deployed one Patriot system, and Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said a second would be deployed by the end of June. The Netherlands has also deployed a Dutch-American battery in Ukraine, and negotiations are underway to send a second.The Biden administration officials hope the deployment of another US patriot system will nudge allies to do the same.During US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Kyiv last month, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine urgently needed ""seven batteries, of which two batteries are necessary, and they were necessary so that we could protect the city of Kharkiv and the entire region of Kharkiv.""Beyond Kharkiv, Ukraine must take urgent steps to protect Odesa in the south, military analysts said, as well as the country's electrical grid.In recent months, a barrage of Russian missile and drone strikes on Ukraine's power plants and substations has severely hobbled energy infrastructure, forcing Ukrainian authorities to order nationwide rolling blackouts. This has raised concerns about what will happen when the cold weather arrives and the use of heating devices increases the load on the energy system.The US officials said there was little high-level debate over whether to supply Ukraine with another patriot. But officials said that Austin and general Charles Q Brown Junior, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, debated which of the US Patriots to send.The two men assessed that the Pentagon could move a patriot battery in Poland, which had the benefit of being next door to Ukraine.The issue is again expected to come up this week when Austin and general Brown travel to Belgium for Nato and allied defence meetings.""I think you can expect to see air defence will, for all the obvious reasons, be a topic of discussion,"" major general Patrick S Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, said on Monday.The patriot is by far the most expensive single weapon system that the United States has supplied to Ukraine, at a total cost of about USD 1.1 billion: USD 400 million for the system and USD 690 million for the missiles.","US president Joe Biden has approved the deployment of another patriot missile system to Ukraine amid raging conflict with Russia.

US judge strikes down Florida ban on gender-affirming healthcare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-strikes-down-florida-ban-on-gender-affirming-healthcare/articleshow/110924075.cms,"A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that parts of Florida's ban of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender children and restrictions on gender-affirming healthcare for adults are unconstitutional and ordered that it not be enforced.Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed the restrictions into law in 2023, banning people under the age of 18 from receiving puberty blockers or hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria, though the law allowed children who had begun receiving gender-affirming care before May 17, 2023, to continue to do so with new restrictions.The law, part of a slew of restrictive legislation in recent years advanced by Republicans to regulate the lives of transgender people, also imposed new restrictions on adults receiving gender-affirming healthcare.US District Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee ruled that all those elements violated the US Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law, noting that some Florida legislators ""plainly acted from old-fashioned discriminatory animus.""""Gender identity is real,"" he wrote in his order, ruling that it was unconstitutional to discriminate against transgender people. ""In time, discrimination against transgender individuals will diminish, just as racism and misogyny have diminished.""A spokesperson for DeSantis, who signed the ban into law shortly before announcing his failed bid to become the Republican nominee for the US presidential election, said the state would appeal the ruling and referred to gender-affirming healthcare as an aspect of ""radical, new age 'gender ideology.'""""These procedures do permanent, life-altering damage to children, and history will look back on this fad in horror,"" the spokesperson, Julia Friedland, said in a statement.The judge noted that doctors who treat transgender patients, multiple medical associations and the US Department of Health have widely accepted that the therapies banned by Florida are ""well-established standards of care for treatment of gender dysphoria.""Several parents of transgender children, who were plaintiffs in the lawsuit, gave testimony to the court that gender-affirming healthcare was allowing their children to flourish and be happy. A transgender man, another plaintiff, testified that Florida's new restrictions had interrupted his taking of testosterone when his prescription lapsed, causing distress, anxiety and depression.Because the law allowed healthcare providers to continue providing puberty blockers or hormone therapy to children and adults who are not transgender, Hinkle ruled that the law unconstitutionally discriminated on the basis of sex.Doctors who violated the law faced up to five years in prison.The judge noted that Florida lawmakers and Governor DeSantis, in passing the law, spoke openly about their moral disapproval of transgender people. This hindered the state's lawyers from successfully arguing that the law was a good-faith effort to regulate healthcare and not motivated by unconstitutional discriminatory animus.""The statute and the rules were an exercise in politics, not good medicine,"" the judge wrote. ""The great weight of medical authority supports these treatments.""","A federal judge ruled that parts of Florida's ban of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender children are unconstitutional.

Pakistan has been in talks with the IMF for a loan estimated to range from $6 billion to $8 billion as it seeks to avert a default in the face of its economy growing the slowest among all countries of the region.Islamabad entered into a $6.5 billion three-year agreement with IMF in 2019. It received a final $3 billion under a standby arrangement last year, just before the agreement was to expire.The finance ministry and IMF were reportedly locked in last-minute talks as the global lender presented some more tough conditions last week to include in the budget.A ministry official said the IMF's key demands include a higher tax revenue target, withdrawal of subsidies, taxes on the agriculture sector, increased taxes and levies on the power, gas, and oil sectors, privatisation of sick govt organisations and units, and improved administration.Despite Pakistan's aggressive pursuit of economic diplomacy to improve trade and investment ties with other nations, finance ministerMuhammad Aurangzeb , who presented the budget in parliament, explicitly said there were no alternatives to IMF under the current circumstances.""As you all know, I have been in this role for about three to three and a half months,"" he said at a presser. ""But even when I was in the private sector, I was very loud and clear that we should go into the IMF programme because there is no plan B. If there were a plan B, the IMF would not be called the lender of last resort.

This allowed elected local representatives to continue the provision of services to their electorate. The local elections were subsequently held in August 2023 for 72 key positions in 21 districts.Commenting on the law and order situation in the province, the rights body alleged that over 160 policemen, 70 military personnel, 60 civilians, and more than 170 alleged militants were killed in dozens of targeted militant attacks and security operations in 2023.Attempting to address the situation, Pakistan forcibly deported over 1.5 million documented and 0.7 million undocumented Afghan refugees and migrants from the province following an announcement by the federal caretaker government.Shedding light on the financial issues faced by people, the rights body stated that hundreds of teachers, doctors, health workers, and sanitation workers protested against delays in payment of salaries and other dues in separate demonstrations across the province in 2023.The report also addressed the status of Public health and environmental crises which has been a major issue of concern to the citizens. The HRCP report stated, that at least 11 per cent of the population suffers from drug abuse, and around 40 fatalities from rains, flash floods, and dust storms occur in several districts.Persons with disabilities also remained deprived of essential accessibility measures in most buildings despite court orders, and 4.7 million children, 66 per cent of which included girls, remained out of school in 2023, the report added.According to HRCP's media monitoring for 2023, there were at least 20 cases of domestic violence, 72 cases of sexual violence, 49 'honour' killings, and 246 femicide-related murders that reportedly took place in the province.HRCP cited a report from the Digital Rights Foundation, which stated that 112 complaints related to cyber harassment and gender-based violence were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In January, women councilors from the Khyber district elected in the 2021 local government polls protested the denial of functional authority and development funds to help female constituents of their areas.While over 100 women contested in the polls and several were elected, they had neither been provided offices nor resources, unlike their male counterparts, thereby lowering their status in people's perceptions, the report added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in its annual report, highlighted the precarious situation of human rights, law and order.

Pak PM says his China trip was successful,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-pm-says-his-china-trip-was-successful/articleshow/110919451.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that his trip to China last week was successful, while the opposition parties took him head-on, describing the tour as one that focused mainly on the security of Chinese people in Pakistan.Sharif’s visit came as Islamabad is seeking more foreign investment and looking to boost exports in a time of economic crisis and security concerns .Accompanied by the powerful army chief, General Asim Munir, Sharif took more than 100 Pakistani businessmen with him.Apprising cabinet members of his visit, PM Sharif said that despite the security issue highlighted during engagements with the Chinese leadership and business community, his five-day visit concluded on a “positive note”.“During the conversation with the Chinese ambassador at the banquet hosted by the Communist Party secretary during my visit to Shanxi province, I got a deep feeling that the visit remained very successful,” Sharif remarked, adding that a high-powered Chinese delegation would visit Pakistan soon.A joint statement issued at the end of the visit had stated that China and Pakistan had signed 23 agreements and MoUs in different fields. The joint declaration, however, noted that Beijing would not push businesses to take unwarranted risks or make concessions to Pakistani companies. Instead, the statement said, Beijing would support businesses to invest in Pakistan in line with market and commercial principles.Observers, however, pointed out that obstacles still stand in the way of strengthening Beijing-Islamabad economic collaboration, primarily as a result of Pakistan’s misguided policies.Pakistan is currently experiencing a debt crisis and looking for new loans to pay off previous debt.The total debt that Pakistan owes just to power (electricity) plants established under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) stands at around $7.5 billion. Islamabad also owes nearly $2 billion in circular debt, or unpaid bills, to Chinese electricity producers.During Sharif’s visit, no public statement was issued on restructuring debt but experts believe the issue is crucial and cannot be ignored.Pakistan’s current foreign debt, media reports suggest, is close to $130 billion, and Chinese officials say around 13% of it is owed to China.During the visit, Sharif, along with Gen Munir, also held talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping for more than three hours, indicating that the security of its nationals in Pakistan is a key concern for Beijing. Five Chinese workers were killed in a suicide attack in Pakistan’s northwestern Bisham region in March. Pakistan had blamed Afghanistan-based terrorists for the attack. The ruling Afghan Taliban had rejected Pakistan’s claim, saying Islamabad was trying to sour Kabul’s relations with Beijing.In the joint statement, both sides urged Afghanistan to “firmly combat terrorism, including not allowing its territory to be used for terrorist acts”.","Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that his trip to China last week was successful. Opposition parties took him head-on, describing the tour as one that focused mainly on the security of Chinese people in Pakistan.Sharif’s visit came as Islamabad is seeking more foreign investment and looking to boost exports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110919549,imgsize-22306,width-400,resizemode-4/110919549.jpg"

"Nawaz reaches out for peace, PM Modi says security remains India’s priority",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/nawaz-reaches-out-for-peace-pm-modi-says-security-remains-indias-priority/articleshow/110883535.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time but more significant was a felicitation message from the elder Sharif - former PM Nawaz Sharif - who spoke about replacing hate with hope and seizing this “opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia”. Modi expressed appreciation for the message, saying the people of India have always stood for peace, security and progressive ideas.“Advancing the well-being and security of our people shall always remain our priority,” said Modi, who did not invite Pakistan for the inauguration of his third term. Modi’s emphasis on security is in line with his government’s long held position that Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism is not conducive for dialogue.Nawaz had just before the election outcome too reached out to India’s incoming government by reiterating his position that it was Pakistan which had violated his 1999 peace agreement with India in the form of the Lahore Declaration through its Kargil offensive. However, his remarks now constitute the first direct peace outreach to India since the coalition government in Pakistan took power earlier this year.Nawaz said Modi’s success in elections reflects the confidence of the people in his leadership. “Let us replace hate with hope and seize the opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia,” said Nawaz, who was recently re-elected president of his party, in a post on X.Coming from the most powerful civilian leader in Pakistan, and one who is known to share a close rapport with Modi himself, the remarks are particularly significant. Modi thanked Shehbaz for his message.It was under Modi and Nawaz - in 2015 when then foreign minister Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad - that the 2 sides had their last substantive bilateral engagement. That dialogue saw India and Pakistan relaunching the dialogue process under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. This was followed by Modi’s famous drop by, and only visit to Pakistan as PM, in Lahore on Nawaz’s birthday but that initiative also quickly fizzled out because of the Pathankot terror attack and later the Uri attack.India has refused to have any diplomatic engagement ever since, except for the Indus Waters Treaty talks, and Pakistan itself decided to downgrade ties by recalling its high commissioner in 2019 after India revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K.The 2 countries will have an opportunity to attempt a reset in ties next month when both PMs travel to Kazakhstan for the SCO summit. However, it’s unlikely India will propose any meeting, given the understanding in the government that Pakistan is yet to act decisively against cross-border terrorism. Official sources also maintain Pakistan has to review its decision to downgrade ties before nursing any thought of forward movement in the relationship.Nawaz’s call for working together also doesn’t sit well with Pakistan’s official position that India must reverse its “unilateral and illegal” measures in J&K for talks to take place. With the Supreme Court upholding the revocation of the special status, the Indian government believes Pakistan cannot have any say in how the internal affairs of J&K are run.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time.

Pakistan installs social media firewall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-installs-social-media-firewall/articleshow/110883200.cms,"Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms (AP photo)

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has started installing a nationwide firewall system to regulate social media platforms and stop the spread of undesirable content. Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms like Facebook, YouTube and X.

The firewall, a senior official said, seeks to identify sources of propaganda material, examine data from various internet protocol addresses and limit the content’s visibility. One of the system’s primary functions is keyword filtering, which identifies and hides offensive content .

Additionally, protocols are being developed to oversee Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which many have employed to evade limitations placed on X, formerly Twitter. Initial restrictions on VPNs drew criticism from the corporate sector, which led the govt to temporarily suspend its implementation.

The X blockade has brought its usage in Pakistan to almost half, from 4.5 million to 2.4 million users. It seems the management of X is gradually adhering to govt directives to block accounts that disseminate fake news, allow conversations on sensitive subjects or circulate contentious ideas.

In April, the home ministry had provided the Islamabad high court a detailed report outlining the rationale for X’s prohibition. The report brought attention to X’s non-registration and its disregard for Pakistani legal requirements.

The report claimed that X’s refusal to comply with Pakistani regulations was the reason for its blocking. It argued that the action did not infringe on fundamental rights.

Nations in West Asia and elsewhere have also reached out to them.Recently, Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan had a meeting in Kabul with Taliban home minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, who also heads the Haqqani network, a powerful faction within the governing group.Kabul had approached New Delhi, through its deputy foreign minister Sher Muhammad Abbas Stanikzai, soon after the formation of the interim govt in Afghanistan in 2021. The correspondence between the two sides had opened a window for communication, which culminated into formal contacts.On the contrary, the ties between Islamabad and Kabul are growing more hostile every day. Kabul’s refusal to curb the alleged activities of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants on its soil has seriously dented relations between the two countries. Travel restrictions on Afghan nationals and the expulsion of Afghan refugees from Pakistan further worsened the ties.Experts suggest that Kabul’s diplomatic efforts will not yield any results until they focus on solving problems such as human rights, women's education and employment.Sweden-based Afghan analyst Nur Rehman Sherzad said that since coming to power in August 2021, the Taliban govt has not formulated any foreign policy.According to him, a govt that is not officially recognised by any country does not have diplomatic and legal status in its relations with the international community and neighbouring countries.“The representatives of the Taliban govt are now gradually realising that the policies of the last three years are not bringing any significant results,” Sherzad said, adding that officials of the international community and other countries in the region visit Afghanistan also to inform Kabul about their security concerns.Describing the acceleration in the Taliban's diplomatic efforts, Arif Yusufzai, an expert on Afghan affairs, told TOI that these types of contacts help build mutual intelligence ties. According to him, the Taliban are making many claims on their own, but they are not doing what the international community is asking them to do. “They are not changing their behaviour at all,” he added.Afghan journalist Abdul Haq Omari believes that Taliban currently face two challenges for the survival of their power. One is to establish formal relations with foreign countries and the other is to maintain their religious narrative internally under which they had fought for two decades.“The survival of the religious narrative is important for the Taliban because if they withdraw suddenly, Taliban's rival groups in Afghanistan, Islamic State or Daesh Khorasan, may strengthen the anti-Taliban narrative,” he added.","Afghan Taliban has intensified its efforts to open different channels of communication with the regional and neighbouring countries.

Additionally, the deeply conservative culture makes it difficult to be openly gay.As a result, the man was transferred to the Sarhad hospital for psychiatric diseases in Peshawar on May 9. He faced significant abuse for his application from local citizens and politicians alike.As per the Telegraph report, the leader of the Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI) party, a conservative religious group, claimed that the applicant's attempt to set up the club followed a recent return from the UK. A local MP from the far-Right Pakistan Awami Tehreek party expressed extreme opposition, stating he would have doused the club with petrol and set it alight, while the party leader, Naseer Khan Nazir, warned of ""very severe consequences"" if the club was allowed to open.Friends of the man, who were also unnamed, expressed fear for his well-being and reported being blocked from visiting him or obtaining any information about him. ""Everyone is afraid that talking about it will put them in danger,"" one friend said. ""I do not know about his well-being for many days,"" they added, noting their unsuccessful attempts to gather information about him.Before his hospitalization, he told the paper, ""I talk about human rights and I want everyone's human rights to be defended."" He emphasized his commitment to advocating for the rights of the most neglected community in Pakistan, saying, ""If the authorities refuse, then I will approach the court, and I hope that like the Indian court, the Pakistani court will rule in favor of gay people.""His application clearly said that there would be ""no gay (or non-gay) sex (other than kissing)"" at the club, with a notice on the wall warning, ""no sex on premises.""

Pakistan and IMF disagree over new income tax rates that will burden salaried class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-and-imf-disagree-over-new-income-tax-rates-that-will-burden-salaried-class/articleshow/110836835.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons and the imposition of a standard 18 per cent sales tax on agriculture and health sector goods, according to a media report on Sunday.On Friday, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) authorities discussed the outstanding issues related to taxation and the energy sector.Citing sources, the Express Tribune newspaper reported that both sides could not resolve their differences on the income tax threshold, the merger of salaried and non-salaried rates and the maximum income tax rate for individuals.Discussions are revolving around whether to charge a new backbreaking 45 per cent income tax from salaried and non-salaried individuals on a monthly income of just over Pakistani Rs 4,67,000, sources said.At present, the maximum rate of 35 per cent applies to a monthly income of over Pakistani Rs 5,00,000.However, both sides have converged on the issue of increasing the income tax burden on exporters in the next budget who paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 86 billion this year, which is 280 per cent less than the taxes paid by the salaried people.Pakistan also showed a willingness to tax pensions beyond a certain income threshold.In the latest talks, the international money lender insisted on merging the slabs related to salaried, non-salaried and other incomes.On the government's proposal of increasing the annual threshold of taxable income to Pakistani Rs 9,00,000, the IMF is asking for the maximum income tax rate to be increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent.However, the government is unwilling to increase the maximum rate for salaried individuals to 45 per cent but showed flexibility to keep the taxable income threshold at the current Pakistani Rs 6,00,000.It is also asking to keep the salaried and non-salaried slabs separate but is willing to increase the highest tax rate for non-salaried persons to 45 per cent, said the sources.The non-salaried business individuals pay tax after excluding expenses while the salaried persons pay tax on their gross income without excluding the expenses.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is until now unwilling to increase the burden on the salaried class .According to a proposal, if the taxable income threshold is increased to Pakistani Rs 900,000 per annum, the income tax rate can be up to 7.5 per cent on a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 100,000. The current rate is 2.5 per cent for this category.For the next slab, if the monthly income is up to Pakistani Rs 133,000, the under-discussion tax rate is 20 per cent. The current rate is 12.5 per cent, that too for up to a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 200,000.The IMF wants a higher rate at the lower income level. This slab will directly hit Pakistan's middle-income group.At present, on an income of over Pakistani Rs 500,000, a 35 per cent tax rate is charged. The salaried class has until now paid Pakistani Rs 325 billion in income tax in 11 months, which is expected to rise to around Pakistani Rs 360 billion at the end of the current fiscal year.If the revised income tax rates are accepted, the tax contribution of the salaried class will jump to Pakistani Rs 540 billion in the next fiscal year, said the sources. To absorb this increase in the tax rates, even a 30 per cent pay hike will not be sufficient.Sources said that the IMF had asked Pakistan to share alternative proposals, in case it was unwilling to increase the tax burden on the salaried class. Another round of discussions is expected soon.Sources said that an understanding had been reached between Pakistan and the IMF on changing the tax regime for the richest exporters.As against the existing one per cent final income tax on exporters, it has been proposed that from the next fiscal year, the one per cent rate should be treated as a minimum, according to government sources.Pakistan's taxation system promotes inequality and puts a higher burden on people who have little capacity to bear it. The IMF has asked Pakistan to end all special tax regimes, like the low-income tax on gains made by investing in the stock market and bank deposits.The global lender has recommended treating these gains as part of normal income. The IMF is pushing Pakistan to increase the burden on the salaried class until the country recovers higher taxes from the non-salaried business individuals.During the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the exporters paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 85.5 billion in taxes, which was Pakistani Rs 241 billion, or 280 per cent, less than the amount paid by the salaried class.During July-May FY24, the salaried class paid Pakistani Rs 326 billion in taxes, higher by 40 per cent, or Pakistani Rs 93 billion, compared to the same period last year.The record Pakistani Rs 326 billion in tax payments by the salaried class is also 223 per cent more than the combined tax paid by the rich exporters and influential retailers.Sources said that there was also no consensus on slapping the standard 18 per cent sales tax on fertiliser, pesticides and seeds – the crucial inputs for the agriculture sector.The government was also unwilling to impose an 18 per cent sales tax on medicines, solar panels and medical and surgical equipment. In case, the 18 per cent tax is imposed on medicines, there will be an additional collection of Pakistani Rs 130 billion in the next fiscal year.Similarly, taxing the medical and health-related supplies will generate another Pakistani Rs 100 billion, according to the paper.Pakistan urgently needs a new loan from the IMF to keep the fear of default at bay. The government is eager to ink the agreement before the end of June when the fiscal year ends.","Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons. The IMF is asking for the maximum income tax rate to be increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent. However, the government is unwilling to increase the maximum rate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110839031,imgsize-60334,width-400,resizemode-4/110839031.jpg"
