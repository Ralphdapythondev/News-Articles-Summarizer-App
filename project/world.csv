Will Hamas get a new chief after Yahya Sinwar's death? Here's what reports suggest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/will-hamas-get-a-new-chief-after-yahya-sinwars-death-heres-what-reports-suggest/articleshow/114443946.cms,"The Palestinian militant group Hamas is leaning toward appointing a ruling committee based in Doha rather than a single successor following the death of their chief, Yahya Sinwar Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces last week, a move that has spurred discussions within the group about its leadership moving forward.According to sources within Hamas, the group has decided not to name a new leader until the next internal elections scheduled for March, provided circumstances allow.“The Hamas leadership's approach is not to appoint a successor to the late chief, the martyr Yahya Sinwar, until their next elections,” a source from the group told AFP.Mewanwhile, a five-member committee, which was formed in August after the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, will assume leadership responsibilities. Sinwar, who was appointed Gaza chief of Hamas in 2017, ascended to the top leadership role after Haniyeh's assassination in July.The committee, comprised of key representatives from Gaza, the West Bank, and the Palestinian diaspora, includes Khalil al-Hayya (Gaza), Zaher Jabarin (West Bank), and Khaled Meshaal (representing Palestinians abroad). Two other key members are Mohammed Darwish, head of Hamas's Shura advisory council, and the political bureau's secretary. All members of the committee are currently based in Qatar.The committee has been tasked with governing Hamas during the ongoing conflict, making strategic decisions, and shaping the group's future plans. “The committee will govern the movement during the war and exceptional circumstances, as well as its future trajectory,” the source said.Another source revealed that there had been internal discussions about appointing a political chief whose identity would remain secret, but the leadership ultimately chose to proceed with collective rule through the committee.Sinwar's death came as Israeli forces intensified their military operations in Gaza. He was killed in southern Gaza, more than a year into the war that erupted after Hamas launched a major offensive on October 7.The death of Yahya Sinwar has created a leadership vacuum within the Palestinian terrorist organization. Various reports speculated about potential candidates who could step into the role.","Hamas is leaning toward appointing a ruling committee based in Doha rather than a single successor following the death of their chief, Yahya Sinwar Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces last week.

Bangladesh President: Bangladesh president in interim government's crosshairs over denial of Hasina quitting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-president-in-interim-governments-crosshairs-over-denial-of-hasina-quitting/articleshow/114443541.cms,"Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin and Sheikh Hasina

DHAKA: Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin found himself in the crosshairs of the interim government on Monday after law adviser Asif Nazrul accused him of lying about not having ""documentary evidence"" of ex-PM Sheikh Hasina resigning before her Aug 5 flight from the country.Shahabuddin's remark that he had ""only heard"" about Hasina's resignation supported her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy 's statement to Reuters from Washington that his mother ""never officially resigned"" as she ""didn't have the time"" to do so once anti-government protesters stormed her Dhaka residence.""When things came under control, one day the cabinet secretary came to collect the copy of the resignation letter. I told him that I was also looking for it,"" a report in the magazine Janatar Chokh quoted the president as saying.Section 57(a) of the Bangladesh constitution states that the prime ministerial office falls vacant only if the incumbent steps down by writing to the president.The resurgence of conspiracy theories about the circumstances of Hasina's departure led law adviser Nazrul to criticise the president for making what he said was a ""self-contradictory"" remark and ""akin to a violation of his oath"".He referred to Shahabuddin's address to the nation on August 5, in which he said the ex-PM had handed him her resignation. This was hours after Hasina flew out of the country.A political insider said he wouldn't be surprised if the interim government removed Shahabuddin as president. ""The government's response suggests that the council of advisers will discuss in a meeting whether Shahabuddin is fit to remain in office."" Nazrul hinted as much to the media. ""We know that the constitution says if the president lacks the physical or mental capacity to hold office or commits serious misconduct, steps can be taken regarding that position,"" he said. ""If someone contradicts their own statements made publicly, that could be considered misconduct. Then questions may arise about their mental capacity to serve as president. The president himself has opened the door to such scrutiny.""BNP functionary Hafizuddin Ahmed said the discussions around Hasina's resignation had added a new dimension to the ongoing political drama . ""Disturbing and concerning news is being circulated,"" he said. Hasnat Abdullah, one of the coordinators of the anti-discrimination student movement, accused Awami League of secretly plotting to regain political power.","Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin found himself in the crosshairs of the interim government.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

"Watch: Trump puts on Apron, works at McDonald's drive-through in latest viral video",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-trump-puts-on-apron-works-at-mcdonalds-drive-through-in-latest-viral-video/articleshow/114409685.cms,"In an unconventional campaign stop that blended fast food with politics, Donald Trump took over the fry station at a Pennsylvania McDonald's on Sunday. Wearing an apron over his suit and tie, the Republican presidential nominee took aim at Kamala Harris ’ long-standing claim of working at the fast-food chain in her college days.With reporters and MAGA aides gathered around, Trump received a crash course in fry-making, eagerly dunking baskets of fries into sizzling oil, salting them, and scooping them into boxes.Trump, a well-known fan of McDonald's, said, ""I don’t even have to touch them with my hands! Incredible!"", grinning as he maneuvered his way around the fry station. “It requires great expertise, actually, to do it right and to do it fast,” he added with a smirk.Trump's impromptu stint behind the counter was more than just a quirky photo op. As Election Day looms just weeks away, the visit was a thinly veiled jab at Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Harris has spoken about her time working at McDonald's during her college years, a story Trump has repeatedly questioned, dubbing her ""Lyin' Kamala.""Seizing the opportunity, Trump claimed he had worked longer at the McDonald's fry station that day than Harris did during her college stint. “Fifteen minutes longer, believe me!” he said. ""I love McDonald's, I love jobs, and I love seeing good jobs,” he added.But the show didn’t stop at the fry station. Trump, apron still on, took to the drive-thru window for an impromptu press conference, leaning out to answer questions from reporters huddled outside. Asked what message he had for Kamala Harris on her 60th birthday, which coincidentally fell on the same day, Trump said, ""Happy Birthday, Kamala! I think I’ll get her some flowers.""Trump’s fry-slinging tour in the battleground state was part of a broader effort to keep Harris’s McDonald's story in the spotlight, continuing to question the legitimacy of her summer job experience. “I could do this all day,” he boasted, poking fun at the notion of Harris having done the same years ago.As the fast-food spectacle wound down, aides nudged Trump to wrap things up, reminding him of his next campaign stop. With a final flourish, he leaned out of the window and declared, “Wasn’t that a strange place to do a news conference?”Before leaving, Trump, who has often sidestepped questions about minimum wage policies, took a moment to praise the McDonald’s crew. “These people work hard. They’re great. I just saw something … a process that’s beautiful.” He sidestepped directly addressing whether his presidency would support wage increases for those manning the fryers.The former president left Pennsylvania, proving that in Trump’s world, even McDonald’s can be a campaign battlefield.","Donald Trump took over the fry station at a Pennsylvania McDonald's on Sunday.

Exonerated Five: Exonerated Central Park Five file defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/exonerated-central-park-five-file-defamation-lawsuit-against-donald-trump/articleshow/114443460.cms,"File photo: The Central Park Five (Picture credit: AP)

The Exonerated Five , formerly known as the Central Park Five , have filed a defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump , accusing him of making false statements during a recent presidential debate.According to a report by the Associated Press, the lawsuit seeks to hold Trump accountable for the harm caused by his repeated false claims.The legal action, filed in a Philadelphia federal court, stems from remarks Trump made during his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris , where he falsely claimed that the five men had killed someone and pleaded guilty to the crime.""Defendant Trump falsely stated that plaintiffs killed an individual and pled guilty to the crime. These statements are demonstrably false,” the group wrote in their complaint.The Exonerated Five—Yusef Salaam, Korey Wise, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, and Antron McCray—were wrongfully convicted in 1989 for the rape and assault of a jogger in Central Park. Their convictions were overturned in 2002 following the discovery of new DNA evidence and a confession from another individual. Trump’s recent comments during the debate have reopened old wounds for the men, who have spent years working to rebuild their lives after their wrongful imprisonment.During the nationally televised debate, Trump stated, ""They admitted, they said they pled guilty… if they pled guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately.” In reality, no one was killed in the attack, and the confessions obtained from the men were later proven to have been coerced.The lawsuit seeks both compensatory and punitive damages, arguing that Trump’s statements were made recklessly, with a complete disregard for the truth. Shanin Specter , the attorney representing the group, emphasized the harm caused by Trump's remarks, noting that ""Trump essentially defamed them in front of 67 million people."" Specter further clarified that there was no political motive behind the lawsuit, stating that the men were simply seeking justice in court.Trump's spokesperson, Steven Cheung, dismissed the lawsuit as politically driven, labeling it ""just another frivolous, election interference lawsuit, filed by desperate left-wing activists."" The Trump campaign has yet to formally respond to the legal action.The Central Park Five case has long been a contentious issue between Trump and the group. In 1989, Trump took out a full-page advertisement in several New York newspapers, calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty in response to the crime. Despite their exoneration, Trump has consistently refused to retract his statements or offer an apology. In 2019, he reaffirmed his belief that ""they admitted their guilt"" even after DNA evidence proved their innocence.Now known as the Exonerated Five, the men have been vocal critics of Trump, with Yusef Salaam recently becoming a member of the New York City Council.","The Exonerated Five, formerly known as the Central Park Five, have filed a defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump.

The US and its allies, including South Korea and the United Kingdom, have warned of the potential geopolitical consequences if such actions are confirmed.Deputy US Ambassador to the United Nations, Robert Wood, emphasized the gravity of the situation during a UN Security Council meeting on Monday.""We are consulting with our allies and partners on the implications of such a dramatic move,"" Wood stated, underscoring the deepening ties between North Korea and Russia. This follows allegations from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who claimed that Pyongyang is preparing to send 10,000 soldiers to assist Moscow.Ukraine’s UN Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya further added that North Korean troops are expected to be ready for combat by November 1. South Korea’s intelligence agency had previously reported that North Korea had already sent 1,500 special forces to Russia’s Far East for training, with plans to deploy them in the conflict.Wood stressed that if these reports are accurate, it would signify a significant escalation in the relationship between Russia and North Korea. ""This marks an obvious deepening of the DPRK-Russia military relationship,"" he said, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).The Kremlin has not directly addressed these allegations. However, Russian spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Moscow's cooperation with Pyongyang is not intended to target any third countries. Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia dismissed the reports as part of a larger pattern of Western ""scare-mongering,"" accusing Western nations of exaggerating threats involving Iran, China, and North Korea.British UN Ambassador Barbara Woodward, however, stated it was ""highly likely"" that North Korea is sending troops, suggesting that Russian President Vladimir Putin is struggling to recruit domestic forces for his war. ""It seems that the harder Putin finds it to recruit Russians to be cannon fodder, the more willing he is to rely on DPRK in his illegal war,"" she said.South Korean UN Ambassador Joonkook Hwang also weighed in, warning that North Korea will likely demand substantial compensation from Moscow for its involvement, which could include military or financial support. He also raised concerns that this could extend to nuclear weapons-related technology.North Korea has been under UN sanctions since 2006 due to its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, with Russia previously supporting these international measures. The potential for increased military cooperation between the two countries has sparked widespread concern among Western nations.","Reports suggest that North Korea may be sending troops to support Russia in its war against Ukraine.

Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations , expressed grave concern over Biden 's comments in a letter addressed to UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres and the Swiss presidency of the UN Security Council The controversy stems from President Biden's response to a reporter's question on Friday, where he affirmed his understanding of how and when Israel would respond to Iran's missile barrage on October 1.Iran had launched approximately 200 ballistic missiles at Israel as retaliation for the killing of leaders from Hamas, Hezbollah, and an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general. In response, Israel, currently engaged in conflicts with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, pledged to seek revenge against Iran for the strikes.In his letter, Iravani strongly criticised Biden's statement, describing it as ""profoundly alarming and provocative."" He said that the US president's words implied ""tacit approval and explicit support for Israel's unlawful military aggression against Iran.""""Therefore, the United States will bear full responsibility for its role in instigating, inciting and enabling any acts of aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,"" he added.According to reports from the Washington Post, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has informed President Biden of his intention to target Iran's military sites, while avoiding strikes on nuclear or oil infrastructure.","Iran's ambassador to the U.N. expressed grave concern over Biden's comments in a letter addressed to UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres and the Swiss presidency of the UN Security Council.

She looks forward to the next chapter of her career.”A major controversy broke out after it was reported that a New York magazine reporter was in a relationship with Kennedy Jr, who is an aide of Donald Trump in the election 2024. Nuzzi said the relationship was not physical and was based on text messages. Kennedy Jr denied the relationship and said he met Olivia Nuzzi only once when she interviewed him for a profile last year when he was in the presidential race.Much of mudslinging followed with Kennedy Jr camp claiming that Olivia Nuzzi used to send Kennedy nudes and even after being blocked by the politician, she found ways to get unblocked. Nuzzi camp hit back claiming that the first move was made by Kennedy Jr who grabbed her arm during the interview which creeped Nuzzi out.Apparently, Nuzzi's engagement with a fellow reporter of Politico, Ryan Lizza, broke off because of Nuzzi's involvement with Kennedy Jr. Nuzzi accused Lizza of orchestrating a harassment and blackmail campaign against her.","The New York Magazine Monday announced that the reporter, Olivia Nuzzi, who was placed on leave over her undisclosed relationship with RFK Jr, has parted ways with the magazine.

Big donors for Trump

The quarter ending in September has been the biggest fund-raising quarter ever for Vice President Kamala Harris as her campaign managed to raise $1 billion in three months -- $378 million in September alone. And Trump campaign in September raised $160 million -- despite the backing of the world's richest man Elon Musk.According to an NYT report, Harris campaign entered October with $348 million on hand and Trump campaign with $283 million.Kamala Harris was seen as the winner of the ABC News presidential debate and every month since June, when Joe Biden opted out of the presidential race, Harris out-raised and outspent Trump.The previous record for the highest fund-raising quarter across all party committees is probably held by Joe Biden in the third quarter of 2020 when his campaign raised $888 million. September fund this year is less that September 2020 for both Biden-Harris and Donald Trump.Trump has consistently raised less money than his 2020 run, NYT reported and attributed it to the struggle that his low-dollar fund raising apparatus is doing to keep up with the pace four years ago. Trump campaign is resorting to some cash crunch measures -- by offloading some traditional campaign expenditures.The Democratic National Committee had $46.6 million on hand after spending some $102 million during September.The main big-money pro-Harris group is Future Forward but her campaign did not disclose the biggest donor. A few Democratic billionaires disclosed eight-figure checks to Future Forward in September: The Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and the crypto billionaire Chris Larsen gave about $10 million each, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois gave $5 million.Timothy Mellon, the heir to the Gilded Age banking fortune, put $25 million more into a pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc. Mellon has now donated a staggering $150 million this cycle to that group, which entered October with $59 million on hand.

Donald Trump: US Presidential Election Top 10: Donald Trump – McDonald’s ‘Employee of the Month’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-election-top-10-donald-trump-mcdonalds-employee-of-the-month/articleshow/114433720.cms,"One of politics' greatest drawbacks is that it favours gifted thespians or orators over able administrators. How natural one appears while serving takeout at McDonald’s or buying Doritos shouldn’t decide who gets to hold the nuclear football and become the leader of the free world. Sadly, that’s not how the ball rolls, and ever since being shoehorned in at the last minute after Democrats refused to accept the reality about Joe Biden Kamala Harris has been going all out to prove she’s relatable, which has been a hard sell so far.She also appears to have a bizarre strategy of media engagement, where she first avoided interviews, but then started giving more, getting stuck in David Sacks’ prophetic “doom loop”: the more interviews Harris gives, the more her ratings suffer. On the other hand, Donald Trump appears to have found a second wind in recent weeks and is looking stronger than ever, the bumbling old man of the ABC debate completely forgotten.Trump’s mini-renaissance appears to have started from the Flagrant podcast . He was in fine form during the Al Smith Dinner that Kamala Harris skipped, a curious choice given Catholics aren’t just a significantly high voting bloc but consist of much of the “haves and have-lots”, who George W Bush once joked was his base. Of course, Harris’ decision to skip the Al Smith Dinner could have been mediated by her strong pro-abortion stance, given Donald Trump’s role in overturning Roe vs Wade .Trump chose his McDonald’s stint to coincide with Kamala Harris’ 60th birthday. During the gig, Trump appeared to have been doing this his entire life, the bankrupt billionaire looking like he had finally found his most natural habitat. Of course, Trump has always been fixated with McDonald’s, being a huge fan of the Big Mac and even greeting guests at the White House with fare from the Golden Arches.In its own way, McDonald’s is America, and Trump appeared to have morphed into Mr America in his red tie and golden hair. He joked with the owner (“How much are you paying me?”), before putting on the apron, working the French fry counter, and handing out a few bags of food to drive-in customers. The customers, carefully handpicked, included a black couple and an Indian-origin couple, clearly designed to show the new diverse MAGA that includes the likes of Vivek Ramaswamy.The fact is that McDonald’s isn’t just a fast-food chain; it’s an enduring symbol of American capitalism and everything great about it. It unifies beyond race, gender and creed, the North Star of the American story where any hardworking individual could – through grit and hard work – own a joint that fuels obesity and diabetes. There are nearly 14,000 McDonald’s outlets in America, and a 'like' from McDonald’s on social media is the American equivalent of a knighthood. They serve 25 million people a day, and 85% of the American population visits an outlet at least once a year. It’s also an enduring symbol of Americana across the world, and the fact that Russia had lost the Cold War was confirmed when the first McDonald’s opened in Moscow in 1990. Much like NASCAR or WWE, it’s an American institution that Donald Trump has been associated with for a very long time.After working for fifteen minutes, Trump announced that he had already worked at McDonald’s longer than Harris. Despite Harris’ claim to have worked at a McDonald’s on Central Avenue in Alameda, California during her freshman year at Howard University, the Harris campaign hasn’t been able to show an iota of proof that the event actually took place.There were no pay stubs or any sort of documentation, and the campaign has refused to let any friend or family member of Kamala Harris speak about her memories of her time at McDonald’s. Recently, the Nostradamus-like data analyst Nate Silver shared 24 reasons he believed Donald Trump could win. If he had seen Donald Trump’s performance at McDonald’s, he might have been tempted to add a 25th.Top 10 US Election Must Reads:","Kamala Harris has been going all out to prove she’s relatable, which has been a hard sell.

Trump and Harris get roasted and toasted as campaigns ignite passions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-and-harris-get-roasted-and-toasted-as-campaign-ignite-passions/articleshow/114433119.cms,"WASHINGTON: It was a day of drama, spectacle -- and roasts and toasts – in the US Presidential election campaign. Donald Trump jumped from the fryer into the fire as his attempt to troll Kamala Harris by visiting a McDonald's misfired. At the opposite end, Kamala Harris got baked when her effort to woo the Black Christian vote by visiting a church on her birthday was panned by MAGA faithful.The hashtag #McIdiot, promoted by Trump's niece Mary Trump among others, sizzled across social media as the MAGA supremo made a show of preparing french fries at a McDonald's -- except it turned out the outlet was closed for business to allow him to stage the event with handpicked supporters. That too at a franchise that had failed a health inspection in March.Critics were quick to note that Trump, a big fan of McDonald's and a self-professed germophobe, went straight to work without washing his hands. He wore an apron over his shirt and tie but did not wear gloves or a hairnet during his visit, asserting his hands were ""nice and clean.""The taunts that followed were biting. ""Oh the delicious irony of Trump pretending to work at a McDonald’s, considering that most franchisees have policies against hiring convicted felons,"" chirped one troll. A meme showed him asking a customer, ""Would you like lies with that?"" Another said ""It's like training for his job in the prison commissary.""""Perhaps no stunt in the history of U.S. politics deserves more ridicule than the grotesquely embarrassing mummery Trump put on at a Pennsylvania McDonald's today … The McDonald's was closed, the customers were fake, Trump did nothing."" Seth Abramson, a journalist and lawyer, wrote on X. And from Harris' running mate Tim Walz -- ""This guy spent decades stiffing workers pay, cut overtime benefits for millions of people, and opposed any effort to raise the minimum wage. You know who has actually worked at McDonald's, joined workers on picket lines, and fights for working people? @KamalaHarris.""Trump's MAGA followers meantime took aim at Harris' visit to a church in Atlanta to woo evangelical Christians, pointing to an episode the previous day where a protester who shouted ""Jesus in Lord"" was told ""You are at the wrong rally!"" ""You MOCK GOD in your Wisconsin rally and now you PANDER Christians in Church for votes? You are a FRAUD!"" steamed one Trump loyalist while others questioned the betrayal of liberal values of keeping church and politics apart.But at the rousing event, the congregation toasted Harris with a rendering of Stevie Wonder's Happy Birthday, as she urged them to vote as part of a nationwide drive known as "" souls to the polls ."" The push came amid polls showing her support from the young black male demographic has diminished, with some of it drifting towards Trump although she has majority support.Meanwhile, Trump also a facepalm from Peggy Palmer, the daughter of legendary golfer Arnold Palmer, about whose manhood the MAGA megaphone had mused about at a campaign rally, when she said the MAGA man had taken a “poor choice of approach” towards remembering her father.She was more restrained in her criticism than in 2018, when she told The Sporting News that her dad, shortly before his death, had been “appalled” by Trump’s behavior during his 2016 presidential run. “My dad didn’t like people who act like they’re better than other people. He didn’t like it when people were nasty and rude. My dad had no patience for people who demean other people in public. He had no patience for people who are dishonest and cheat. He was appalled by Trump’s lack of civility and what he began to see as Trump’s lack of character.” she said.The multiple smackdowns and roasts did not appear to make the slightest difference to the candidates in pre-poll surveys: they showed them in a dead heat across the battleground states.","The hashtag #McIdiot sizzled across social media as the MAGA supremo made a show of preparing french fries at a McDonald's.

McDonald’s Corp . said it’s not taking sides in the presidential election following Donald Trump ’s visit to a Pennsylvania restaurant on Sunday.“McDonald’s does not endorse candidates for elected office and that remains true in this race for the next president,” the company said in an internal message seen by Bloomberg News. “We are not red or blue — we are golden.”The burger chain has been dragged into the election conversation in part because candidate Kamala Harris has said she worked at the chain when she was a student.Trump’s visit — in which he cooked food, bagged fries and worked the drive-thru, according to his campaign — added more fuel to the discussion.In its message, McDonald’s said local franchisee Derek Giacomantonio got a request from law enforcement about Trump’s “desire to visit a Pennsylvania restaurant.”Pennsylvania is considered one of the key swing states that will determine the election. In an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last week, Trump singled it out as one of the states that he would be closely watching on election night.A perfectly executed order of fries from President Trump.“Upon learning of the former president’s request, we approached it through the lens of our core values: we open our doors to everyone,” McDonald’s said in its message.McDonald’s said franchisees — who independently own and operate more than 95 per cent of US locations — have also invited Harris and her running mate Tim Walz for a visit.Trump has sought to discredit, without evidence, Harris’ claim about her job at the Golden Arches in the 1980s.

Pakistan Parliament: Pakistan parliament clips powers of judiciary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-clips-powers-of-judiciary/articleshow/114436941.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s parliament clipped the powers of the Supreme Court in the early hours of Monday by empowering the executive through an amendment to the constitution passed with a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the National assembly.With full backing from the powerful military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ’s govt had been attempting since last month to introduce a set of constitutional changes in parliament apparently aimed at granting more powers to the executive in making judicial appointments.The 26th Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2024, passed during a late-night session of parliament, aimed at taking away the SC’s suo motu powers, setting the chief justice of Pakistan’s term at three years, and empowering the PM to appoint the next top judge from among the three most senior SC judges. It states that a 12-member parliamentary committee, comprising eight NA members and four from the Senate, will appoint the chief justice from a panel of the three most senior judges of the top court for a period of three years. The panel will forward the name to the PM who will then send it to the president for appointment.The bill, tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, was approved by the NA with 225 votes, one more than required for a two-thirds majority, after a handful of turncoats from jailed former PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) voted against the party’s policy. In the Senate, the required number for two-thirds was 64 and 65 members voted in favour. Hours later, President Asif Ali Zardari gave formal assent to the new law. Imran’s party, however, abstained from voting.An earlier attempt, in Sept, by the governing PML-N to bulldoze the amendments did not succeed as it failed to win the support of some opposition lawmakers and the legislation could not be tabled despite the two Houses being in session.Sharif’s govt said the constitutional amendment has ensured that parliament will not remain a rubber stamp in future. The current govt’s tensions with the judiciary have been on the rise since controversial nationwide general elections were held in Feb this year.The new legislation, specifically about judicial reforms, was passed just days ahead of the retirement of chief justice Qazi Faez Isa . Khan’s PTI has been accusing Isa of being aligned with govt, an allegation govt has repeatedly rejected.Under the previous law, Justice Isa would have been automatically replaced by the senior puisne judge, currently Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, who has consistently issued verdicts deemed favourable to Khan and PTI.PTI assailed the “conscience” of lawmakers affiliated with it who voted in favour of the amendment. “They won votes on Imran Khan’s name and sold their vote to the same mafia against whom the public gave them the mandate!” the party said on its ‘X’ account, sharing pictures of the said lawmakers and terming them “seditious”.“These conscience-sellers would be counted among the darkest characters in Pakistan’s history,” it added.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan criticised the bill, saying it would make the judiciary “subservient” for all time.",Pakistan's parliament clipped the powers of the Supreme Court in the early hours of Monday by empowering the executive.

The Hindu community in Narowal, numbering over 1,453 people, has since lacked a proper place to conduct their rituals.Narowal district once had 45 Hindu temples, all of which have fallen into disrepair over time.The restoration work is currently focused on constructing a boundary wall around the four kanals of land, after which the temple will be handed over to the Pak Dharamsthan Committee.Hindus represent the largest minority group in Pakistan. Official estimates suggest that there are around 7.5 million Hindus in the country, though the community claims the number is closer to 9 million.

Controversy over the amendments



Row over how Bill was passed

Historical achievement: PM Shehbaz Sharif



Charter of Democracy



In a late-night session that began at 11.36pm on Sunday and extended well past midnight, the Pakistan National Assembly passed at 5am on Monday the highly controversial 26th Constitutional Amendment that critics say effectively neuters the judicial system of the country.In another sign of the desperate hurry, President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the law mere hours after the approval of both houses of parliament.The Constitution (26th Amendment) Act, 2024, was introduced to address perceived issues within the judicial system of Pakistan, particularly focusing on the powers of the Supreme Court and the appointment of its Chief Justice.While proponents argue that these reforms are necessary for improving judicial efficiency and accountability, opponents contend that they threaten judicial independence and may pave the way for increased political interference in legal matters.The timing and nature of this amendment have raised suspicions about political motivations behind it.Critics argue that this move is an attempt by the ruling coalition led byShehbaz Sharif to exert control over an independent judiciary, particularly in light of ongoing tensions with former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).The PTI has vehemently opposed these changes, viewing them as a direct threat to judicial independence and an effort to undermine checks and balances within government institutions.Many legal experts and political analysts have expressed concern that limiting the CJP's tenure could lead to politicisation within the judiciary. By establishing a commission that includes political appointees, there are fears that judicial appointments may become more susceptible to political influence rather than being based solely on merit and legal expertise.The legal community has also voiced strong opposition against these amendments, stating that the changes could lead to a judiciary that is less willing to challenge government actions or uphold constitutional rights if they are perceived as beholden to political interests.There are serious allegations of coercion surrounding the passage of the 26th Constitutional Amendment.Local media reports suggested that members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) faced intimidation tactics, including threats of abduction, to ensure their support for the Bill. PTI leaders have claimed that their lawmakers were pressured into voting in favor of the amendment or faced consequences for non-compliance.The process leading up to the amendment has also been criticised for its lack of transparency and consensus among political parties. While some coalition members gave broad support for the amendment, others, particularly from PTI, expressed their refusal to participate in what they describe as a coerced vote.The hurried nature of this legislative process has raised questions about whether adequate deliberation occurred among lawmakers regarding such significant constitutional changes.The government required 224 votes to pass the Bill. As voting commenced under the chairmanship of NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, 225 members of the National Assembly supported the motion, while 12 members from the PTI and the Sunni-Ittehad Council (SIC) opposed it.The Bill comprised 27 clauses. After the passage of the first clause, the PTI members walked out of the assembly.Following the passage of the bill, PM Shehbaz Sharif delivered a speech and congratulated the parliament for the ""historical achievement"", said a report by Dawn.""This amendment, the 26th, is not just an amendment, but an example of national solidarity and consensus. A new sun will rise, emanating across the nation,"" PM Shehbaz said.PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari thanked the PML-N, MQM-P, IPP, JUI-F, ANP, and other parties for their contributions to the Bill.He also extended his gratitude to the PTI, stating: ""I also thank the PTI for playing a part in this historic achievement. This is a political success, and I wish you wouldn't have portrayed your own victory as a loss.""PTI's Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, took over the floor of the NA and criticised the amendments, arguing that they did not reflect the will of the Pakistani people.Taking a jab at law minister Tarar and Bilawal, he said that those who had ""gone missing"" should have been thanked as well during the note of thanks. Ayub detailed how PTI lawmakers were ""tortured and harassed"".""These were all tactics to pressure us. The mistreatment of Imran Khan in jail is also an example,"" he said.Ayub also questioned the urgency behind passing the amendments, asking: ""What would have happened had it been passed on October 31?""He also said that the amendments were an attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary.Meanwhile, Defence minister Khawaja Asif said the amendment had been passed by the Senate ""to restore respect and dignity of the parliament and the House"". ""There must be consistency in our political behaviour otherwise we will not get the respect and dignity we seek,"" he said.As per the report by Dawn, Asif went on to say that the constitutional amendments were not something that the government had ""newly invented"" but it was a continuation of the Charter of Democracy that all political leaders, including Imran, had unanimously signed.The Charter of Democracy was signed in London on May 14, 2006, by major political parties in response to the military dictatorship of General Pervez Musharraf, with the aim of promoting democratic norms and preventing the abuse of power by unelected institutions such as the military and judiciary.",The amendment limits the tenure of the Chief Justice of Pakistan to three years. A new 12-member commission has been established to appoint the CJP. The amendment seeks to dilute the Supreme Court's suo motu powers.

HYDERABAD: In a public rally on Friday, leading Pakistpolitician Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari warned that if political parties in parliament do not reach a consensus on the 26th constitutional amendment , he will push the amendment through parliament using a brute, or two-thirds majority, Dawn reported. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party which is led by his father Asif Ali Zardari who is the President of Pakistan.Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ) is in coalition with PM Shehbaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N). These two parties along with Fazlur Rehman's Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) have come together to implement the 26th constitutional amendment in Pakistan's constitution.While addressing a PPP rally in Pakistan's Hyderabad city to mark the anniversary of the attack on his mother's homecoming parade in 2007, Bilawal Bhutto said, ""It is my desire to have consensus among all political parties in parliament for this amendment. The second option, which is not my preferred path, is to rely on the majority's vote to pass it,"" Dawn noted.He urged political parties to consider the future and work towards raising the dignity of parliament, adding that they operate within a certain ""political space"".Bhutto noted that while the PPP was unable to establish a constitutional court during its 2008-2013 government, he is committed to fulfilling the promise made by Benazir Bhutto.He acknowledged opposition to the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), particularly fromPTI leaders, but insisted that the new court would ensure equal representation for all provinces.PTI has been protesting across Pakistan against the implementation of the constitutional amendments as the Party alleges that the bill would undermine the powers of judiciary.PTI leaders have also alleged that bribes up to Rs 1 Billion are being offered to lawmakers to garner support for passing the amendment law.In the public rally, Bilawal Bhutto gave out historical justifications for implementation of the 26th amendment saying that even Muhammad Ali Jinnah had called for a separate court for routine justice matters at the 1930 Round Table Conference.The FCC, Bhutto claimed, would protect the rights of provinces by providing equal representation and addressing disputes between the federation and provinces.As per Dawn, Bhutto insisted that his mother and former Pakistan PM Benazir Bhutto had supported the establishment of the FCC because she understood the ""real face"" of the judiciary, which he said had repeatedly legitimised dictatorial rule.""After abolishing the 'One Unit' system in the country through parliament, my mother wanted to eliminate the concept of 'One Unit' in the judiciary as well,"" he added.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: Over 34 universities in Pakistan 's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been facing a financial crisis , with a collective loss of Pakistani Rupees ( PKR ) 15 billion, ARY News reported.According to the details, the financial crisis is due to the significant disparity between the income of the universities and expenditures.

The protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger and demonstrations in four cities.Reports of the incident spread on social media, increasing tensions on college campuses. Students in Rawalpindi, Punjab province, burned furniture and blocked a key road before vandalizing a college building.Earlier, a security guard died during clashes between student protesters and police in Gujrat, also in Punjab province. Authorities arrested one person related to the guard's death and another for spreading misinformation about the alleged rape.In Lahore, over two dozen students were injured earlier this week while demanding justice for the alleged victim, who students claim was raped at the Punjab Group of Colleges.In response to the growing unrest, the government banned rallies in Punjab. The Federal Investigation Agency filed cases against 36 people accused of spreading misinformation on social media.Authorities, including the Punjab chief minister, and the woman’s parents denied any assault happened. However, Punjab police called on the public to share any information regarding the alleged rape.The unrest seems to have started spontaneously, as student unions in Pakistan have been banned since 1984.These protests also come after a woman reported being gang-raped during a polio vaccination drive in Sindh province last month. Police arrested three men involved, but the woman's husband expelled her from home, citing damage to the family name.","Protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger.

LAHORE: Describing foreign minister S Jaishankar ’s visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting as a positive development that should provide an opening for more substantive engagements between the 2 countries, former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi saying the latter’s decision to visit Sharif’s home in 2015 was not an ordinary gesture. Sharif sought progress in ties saying the relationship should not be held captive by the past.Sharif, a 3-time PM and elder brother of Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.“Achhe bhare talukkat ko tabah aur barbad karne waali baat ki (he worked to destroy a healthy relationship). I would have never used that kind of language. We believe in certain values that must be respected,” said Sharif, adding he had fond memories of Modi’s only visit to Pakistan on December 25, 2015, Sharif’s birthday.As then Pakistan PM, Sharif had received Modi at his home in Lahore. “I got a call from him saying he was in Kabul and wanted to visit me on his way back to India. I told him he was most welcome. He also met my mother during the visit. What he did wasn’t a chota (small) gesture,” said Sharif, in a meeting with Indian journalists in Lahore who travelled to Pakistan to cover Jaishankar’s engagements. The former PM is also the leader of the ruling PMLN party. His daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Sharif was also present in the interaction.Khan’s personal attacks against Modi after India revoked the special status of J&K only led to further deterioration of relations between the 2 countries. Sharif did not comment on India’s recent actions in the union territory as he said this wasn’t the occasion to discuss it. PM Shehbaz too had avoided raking up the Kashmir issue even in a roundabout manner at the SCO meeting.Sharif also called upon both sides to look ahead and not be held back by the past even though he didn’t make any specific commitment on resumingtrade ties or reappointing high commissioner. He did say that if there’s an opening, cheezein niklengi (things will emerge).Asked about his 2015 peace initiative with Modi that was scuttled quickly by the Pathankot terror attack, Sharif said it’s important to ensure any such effort is not disrupted. “India is our hamsaya (neighbour) mulk and we can’t change that even if we want it. We would have liked Modi to come (for SCO) but it’s good Jaishankar came. We have tried and tried again (to normalise ties). We lost the past 75 years and it’s important we don’t lose another 75 years,” said Sharif, who is known to share a close personal rapport with Modi.“Both sides have their giley-shikwe (grievances). It will be better if we can bury the past,” he added. When asked if he would play the role of building bridges, he said he was doing it.Sharif also backed SAARC, trade and cricket ties with India, saying neither country gains anything by not allowing their teams to play each other. He also recalled how former Indian PM A B Vajpayee had approached him to buy electricity from Pakistan. “I would allow my team to play. If there’s a cricket tournament on India and Pakistan and India are playing in the final, I’ll travel to India to watch it. There should be progress. SAARC or any such opportunity should not be missed. It’s important to make full use of it,” he said.“I believe we are a potential market for each other. Why should Indian and Pakistani farmers and manufacturers go outside to sell their products. Goods now go from Amritsar to Lahore via Dubai. Who is benefitting from this? What should take 2 hours takes 2 weeks,” he added.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi. Sharif sought progress in ties saying the relationship should not be held captive by the past. He also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114332425,imgsize-945823,width-400,resizemode-4/114332425.jpg"

Lahore, Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday dismissed allegations of an on-campus rape incident at a Lahore college as fabricated, accusing Pakistan's jailed former premier Imran Khan's party of using the false claim to incite widespread student protests and create unrest in the province. She also demanded that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party be treated in the same way as ""banned organisations"" in the country.Maryam, daughter of former three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, claimed that the rape incident was fabricated to create unrest in Punjab. She accused political opponents, particularly PTI, of using students and the media to propagate false information for political gains.On Wednesday, a large number of students held demonstrations in Jehlum, Faisalabad, and Gujrat, demanding justice for the alleged rape victim.However, the chief minister stated that no incident of rape took place at the Punjab College for Women in Lahore. She alleged that PTI and its media supporters spread the fake news to destabilise the province by manipulating innocent students.On Monday, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured during clashes with police over the alleged rape incident. Protesters claimed that the college administration had deleted CCTV footage to cover up the case.Maryam accused PTI of attempting to destabilise the government by spreading false narratives, particularly during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which portrayed Pakistan positively on the global stage. The two-day SCO summit concluded on Wednesday.She warned of strict action against those spreading fake news, including media personnel. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said, adding that the girl in question had suffered a back injury, not a rape, and was in the hospital ICU since October 2, contradicting the circulated claims.Addressing PTI founder Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail for the last 15 months, she remarked, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are.""The chief minister also accused certain individuals from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and abroad of fuelling the controversy through fake news.""The issue isn't social media, but rather PTI, which needs to be controlled...and everything will be fine. They are operating through fake accounts,"" she alleged.Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has launched a probe against those involved in spreading disinformation through social media platforms about the alleged on-campus rape incident.A seven-member team headed by Deputy Director Cybercrime Lahore Waqas Saeed will identify individuals responsible for the disinformation campaign and the subsequent law-and-order situation.","Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz dismisses rape claims as fabricated.

"No bilateral but India, Pak ‘break the ice’ with Jaishankar visit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-bilateral-but-india-pak-break-the-ice-with-jaishankar-visit/articleshow/114294074.cms,"Modi, Sharif likely to come face to face at COP29 in Nov



ISLAMABAD: External affairs minister S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days even though there was no formal bilateral meeting between the foreign ministers on the margins of the SCO heads of government summit in Islamabad, diplomatic sources said. The fact that the first visit by an Indian foreign minister to Pakistan in almost 9 years went off without a hitch was seen as a positive development by the Indian government.As he departed after a 24-hour stay in Islamabad from the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, Jaishankar, who had said recently India isn’t passive on Pakistan and will react to positive and negative developments accordingly, thanked Shehbaz and Dar in a post on X for the hospitality and courtesies.While Indian government sources described the talks as casual conversations, Pakistan officials said there was a brief pull aside, which lasted for 5 to 7 minutes, between Jaishankar and Dar on the sidelines of the dinner hosted by Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday evening. Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), is learnt to have joined Jaishankar and Dar.A source speaking on condition of anonymity said Pakistan suggested resumption of bilateral cricketing ties as a way of “breaking the ice”. Naqvi was later quoted as saying that Jaishankar’s visit was an ice-breaker even though neither side proposed a bilateral meeting. Pakistan is looking to host the Champions Trophy next year and would like India to participate.The relationship between the 2 countries has remained in deep-freeze since the abortive bid to resume the dialogue process in 2015 under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. Things only worsened after Pakistan recalled its high commissioner in August 2019, following India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K.Indian government sources appreciated the fact that Shehbaz didn’t rake up any bilateral issue in his remarks as the host of the summit.While Jaishankar’s remarks on terrorism were seen as a message for Pakistan, Indian sources said the minister had only spoken about issues that the SCO has identified as key challenges and that other member-states can also relate to.Jaishankar is learnt to have had another extended conversation with Dar at the SCO lunch table on Wednesday where both were seated next to each other. “It wasn’t initially planned that way but later they sat together and spoke over lunch in the presence of other delegates,’’ said.Both sides denied that there was any proposal for resumption of dialogue. Shehbaz and Indian PM Narendra Modi are expected to come face to face next month at COP29 in Azerbaijan but for any substantive engagement, India will want Pakistan to first reappoint high commissioner.After his return from Pakistan, Jaishankar said in another post on X that India made a positive and constructive contribution to the talks in Islamabad and identified 8 takeaways from India’s perspective from the documents that were signed. These included upholding fair and balanced connectivity projects in accordance with international law, the goals and principles of the UN Charter and SCO Charter and a fair, open, inclusive and transparent multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.Significantly, another Pakistan minister, Ahsan Iqbal, had told visiting Indian journalists on Tuesday that Pakistan wants the 2 countries to return to the 1999 Lahore Declaration that called upon both sides to refrain from intervening and interfering in each other’s internal affairs. Shehbaz’s brother Nawaz Sharif, who reached the agreement with then Indian PM A B Vajpayee, has repeatedly accused former president Pervez Musharraf of scuttling the Declaration through his Kargil adventurism.","S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days.

"SCO must root out terrorism, respect territorial integrity: Jaishankar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/sco-must-root-out-terrorism-respect-territorial-integrity-jaishankar/articleshow/114294032.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Combating terrorism , extremism and separatism – characterised as “3 evils’’ by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) since its inception in 2001 – is essential for the Eurasian group to realise its goals of balanced growth and integration, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said, addressing the 23meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government in Islamabad.However, Jaishankar did not name or single out Pakistan and ensured his remarks fell strictly under the ambit of the SCO Charter that doesn’t allow bilateral issues to be raised at the forum.Without skirting round the issue of terrorism though, the minister said activities across borders characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism would be detrimental to trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchangesJaishankar sought an honest conversation on the issue saying, “if trust is lacking or cooperation inadequate, if friendship has fallen short and good neighbourliness is missing somewhere, there are surely reasons to introspect and causes to address”. He said attaining these original SCO objectives was even more important in an uncertain world marred by conflicts and debt.“It is axiomatic that development and growth requires peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the three evils,’’ said the minister.In a message to both China and Pakistan, the minister also said SCO cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and connectivity must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. “It should recognize territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas,’’ said the minister, adding cooperation can’t progress if global practices are cherry-picked, especially of trade and transit.India was again the only country in SCO to not endorse China’s BRI in the SCO joint statement. BRI’s flagship China Pakistan Economic Project ( CPEC ) passes through PoK, which India sees as under illegal occupation of Pakistan. Since it became a full member of SCO in 2017, India has repeatedly reminded member-states that it’s important for them to respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. China was represented by Premier Li Qiang in the meeting.The minister also spoke about the need to make the UN Security Council more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable. “The SCO must be in the lead of advocating such change, not hold back on a matter of such importance,’’ said the minister. China is the only P5 country not to publicly declare support for India’s UNSC permanent membership bid.“While we each make our contribution, the world order is more than the sum of its parts. As it changes, global institutions do need to keep pace. That is why the case for ‘reformed multilateralism’ gets stronger by the day. Comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council, both in the permanent and non-permanent categories, is essential,’’ said the minister.","S Jaishankar said activities across borders characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism would be detrimental to trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges. He did not name or single out Pakistan and ensured his remarks fell strictly under the ambit of the SCO Charter that doesn’t allow bilateral issues to be raised.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114294030,imgsize-1573189,width-400,resizemode-4/114294030.jpg"
