SEOUL: Chinese Premier Li Qiang praised what he called a restart in relations with Japan and South Korea as he met their leaders for the first three-way talks in four years on Monday in Seoul, striving to revive trade and security dialogues hampered by global tensions.Li, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will adopt a joint statement on six areas including the economy and trade, science and technology, people-to-people exchanges and health and the aging population, Seoul officials said.They may also agree to resume three-party free trade agreement negotiations, which have been stalled since 2019, according to Japanese media reports.At the summit , Li called for the comprehensive resumption of trilateral cooperation with an open attitude and transparent measures, China's official Xinhua news agency reported.He said relations between the three nations had not changed despite profound global transformations.""Our meeting today, first in more than four years, is both a restart and a new beginning,"" Li said, according to a post on X by China's foreign ministry.China and US-allied South Korea and Japan are trying to manage rising distrust amid the rivalry between Beijing and Washington and tensions over democratically ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own.Yoon and Kishida have charted a closer course with each other and to Washington, embarking on unprecedented three-way cooperation with the United States on military and other measures.Monday's summit comes a day after the leaders met separately for bilateral talks with each other.In those meetings, Li and Yoon agreed to a diplomatic and security dialogue and resume free trade talks, while Kishida and the Chinese premier discussed Taiwan and agreed to hold a new round of bilateral high-level economic dialogue.Yoon also asked China to play a constructive role with its partners in North Korea, which is expanding its nuclear weapons and missile arsenal in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions.North Korea has notified Japan of its plan to launch a rocket carrying a space satellite between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday.Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and demanded that North Korea cancel the launch because it would use ballistic missile technology in violation of the UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said.The trade relationship between China, South Korea and Japan has evolved over the past decade to become increasingly competitive.Those ties have been further tested by US calls for its allies to shift their supply chains for key products, such as semiconductors, away from China.Officials and diplomats from South Korea and Japan have set a low bar for the summit, saying it is uncertain whether there will be major announcements but that just gathering will help the three countries revive and reinvigorate their strained relations.The three leaders are also due to attend a forum with top business executives.South Korea, Japan and China held 16 rounds of official negotiations over a three-way FTA after they first kicked off in 2012.At their last negotiation in November 2019, the three countries agreed on liberalisation at a level higher than the Regional Comprehensive Economic partnership (RCEP), of which they are all members, encompassing areas from trade of goods and services to investment, customs, competition and e-commerce.","Chinese Premier Li Qiang praised what he called a restart in relations with Japan and South Korea. Li, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will adopt a joint statement on six areas.

France to lift state of emergency in bid to allow talks in riot-hit New Caledonia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/france-to-lift-state-of-emergency-in-bid-to-allow-talks-in-riot-hit-new-caledonia/articleshow/110450052.cms,"NEW DELHI: French President Emmanuel Macron decided on Monday to lift the state of emergency in New Caledonia , a French Pacific territory. This decision aims to facilitate political dialogue after the recent unrest, which resulted in seven fatalities and significant damage, according to his office.The president's office said in a statement that state of emergency won't be extended 'for the moment' and will therefore end Monday at 8pm in Paris , which is 5am Tuesday in New Caledonia.The decision aims at ""enabling meetings of the various components' of pro-independence movement FLNKS, the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front , and allow elected officials and other local leaders ""in a position to call' for lifting the barricades to go there and meet with protesters, the statement said.Macron repeatedly urged the leaders from both sides of New Caledonia's conflict to remove the protesters' barricades. The two sides involved are the Indigenous Kanaks, who seek independence, and the pro-Paris leaders who oppose it.In the statement, he insisted it is ""the necessary condition for the opening of concrete and serious negotiations'.Macron made the decision after traveling to New Caledonia on Thursday.The statement said 480 additional gendarmes are to arrive on the archipelago ""in the next few hours,"" putting security reinforcements at more than 3,500. Among the seven individuals who lost their lives in the shootings, two of them were gendarmes.Paris imposed a state of emergency on May 15 for a minimum of 12 days in order to enhance police powers. These emergency measures grant authorities increased powers to address violence. This includes the option of house detention for individuals considered a threat to public order. Additionally, authorities have expanded powers to carry out searches, confiscate weapons, and limit movements, with potential imprisonment for those who violate the rules.This month's unrest started when the French legislature in Paris was discussing changes to the French constitution regarding voter lists in New Caledonia.The leader of a pro-independence party in New Caledonia on Saturday called on supporters to ""remain mobilised' across the French Pacific archipelago and ""maintain resistance' against the Paris government's efforts to impose electoral reforms that the Indigenous Kanak people fear would further marginalize them.Christian Tein is the leader of the pro-independence party called The Field Action Coordination Unit. He addressed supporters and protesters in a video message that was posted on social media.In a separate statement, the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front called on French President to withdraw the electoral reform bill if France wants to ""end the crisis'.New Caledonia became French territory in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon's nephew and heir. After World War II, it became an overseas territory. French citizenship was granted to all Kanaks in 1957.(With inputs from agencies)","French President Emmanuel Macron decided on Monday to lift the state of emergency in New Caledonia.

At least 15 dead after severe weather carves path of ruin across multiple states in the South,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-least-15-dead-after-severe-weather-carves-path-of-ruin-across-multiple-states-in-the-south/articleshow/110449589.cms,"A deadly series of storms

Homes destroyed, roads blocked

Widespread power outages

More severe weather in forecast

VALLEY VIEW: Powerful storms killed at least 15 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction Sunday across Texas , Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter in a restroom during the latest deadly weather to strike the central US.The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas, and the system threatened to bring more violent weather to other parts of the Midwest later in the day. By Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City.Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas governor Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff.Storms also killed two people and destroyed houses in Oklahoma, where the injured included guests at an outdoor wedding, five people in Arkansas and one person in Kentucky. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region.In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, said Abbott, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest-hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph (217 kph), officials said.""The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,"" said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts ofsevere weather , including storms that killed eight people in Houston.Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot.""A firefighter came to check on us and he said, 'You're very lucky,'"" Parra said. ""The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.""Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas.No more deaths are expected and nobody was reported missing in Texas, said Abbott, though responders were doing one more round of searches just in case.At least five people were killed in Arkansas. One was a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county's emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said.In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said.In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed it was a storm-related death on social media.The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection.Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. ""If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!"" the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X.Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months.Brooks recommended that travelers passing through threatened areas over the Memorial Day weekend have a plan for a weather emergency.Travelers who have already chosen where to get food and other essentials ""probably ought to be thinking about what could I do if there's a dangerous situation to save my life,"" Brooks said.Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home.In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area.Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed.As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris, and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said.""They were conscious but severely injured,"" Dorantes said. ""The father's leg was snapped.""The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms.By late Sunday, more than 80,000 customers in Arkansas were without power. In neighboring Missouri, more than 90,000 were also without power. Texas reported 27,000 outages while 3,000 were reported in Oklahoma, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us.Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was ""shut down"" due to the damage.The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend.The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans.More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee.The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.","NEW: Death toll rises to 15 in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kentucky.

His mother, Scarlett Wactor, confirmed the heartbreaking news to Fox News Digital.Johnny and a co-worker had stayed late at a rooftop bar where Johnny was bartending to help clean up. They were heading to their cars around 3 or 3:30am when the incident occurred. Scarlett Wactor recounted, ""They were walking to their car, and when they get there, Johnny’s car, which was parked in front of the co-worker’s, looked like it was jacked to one side. From what I understand, he said, ‘Hey, man, you towing my car?’ … And the person looked up and had a mask, and so then I guess he knew they weren’t doing that, and so he stepped in front of the co-worker and then backed up and put his hands up or both, and the person shot him.""The attack took place during an apparent car theft attempt. TMZ reported that the suspects were trying to steal the catalytic converter from Johnny's car. While authorities have not confirmed Johnny's identity, the details match a reported case of three suspects attempting such a theft. Descriptions of the suspects have not been released, a Fox News report said.Scarlett Wactor expressed her anguish, saying, ""What I’d like for everybody to know is that they took a great human being. It is leaving a very large hole in me and his brother’s lives. We just buried my husband, their dad, four years ago. And he was very loved by his friends, his families. He lived life to the fullest, he chased his dreams, a very optimistic, positive person.""Reflecting on the tragic loss, Scarlett added, ""And the crazy thing is, he wasn’t trying to stop them from taking it. They could have just left or taken it, he probably would have just given them the car. They were very much a cowardly person … I hope they catch them, and I hope there’s justice for Johnny. That’s all I can hope and pray for. I will see him again. But down here on Earth, it’s going to be a very, very long road without him for me and his brothers.""Johnny Wactor began his acting career on television in the series ""Army Wives"" and later appeared in shows like ""Animal Kingdom,"" ""Criminal Minds,"" and ""Westworld."" His tenure on ""General Hospital"" spanned 164 episodes from 2020 to 2022. His most recent work was in the horror anthology film ""Dead Talk Tales: Volume I.""Authorities are planning an autopsy, and Johnny's family will bring him back to South Carolina for funeral services once his body is released. He is survived by his mother Scarlett and brothers Lance and Grant.",Johnny and a co-worker had stayed late at a rooftop bar where Johnny was bartending to help clean up.

Palestinian health and civil emergency service officials provided this information.The Israeli military said its air force struck a Hamas compound in Rafah and that the strike was carried out with ""precise ammunition and on the basis of precise intelligence."" It took out Hamas' chief of staff for the West Bank and another senior official behind deadly attacks on Israelis, it said.""The IDF is aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.""The spokesman for the health ministry in Gaza, Ashraf Al-Qidra, reported that 35 people were killed and many others, mostly women and children, were injured in the attack.The strike occurred in the Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah. Thousands of people sought shelter there after many had fled the eastern areas of the city, where Israeli forces initiated a ground offensive more than two weeks ago.The International Committee of the Red Cross mentioned that its field hospital in Rafah was receiving a large number of casualties. Additionally, other hospitals were also admitting a significant number of patients.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described the attack in Rafah as a ""massacre', holding the United States responsible for aiding Israel with weapons and money.""The air strikes burnt the tents, the tents are melting and the people's bodies are also melting,"" said one of the residents who arrived at the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah.Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military reported that eight projectiles were observed crossing from the area of Rafah. Rafah is located at the southern tip of the Gaza Strip. Despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering Israel to stop attacking the city, Israel continued its operations in the area.A number of the projectiles were intercepted. The report stated this. No casualties were reported.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was gathering his war cabinet on Sunday to talk about ongoing operations in Rafah. Israel claims that the UN court's decision provides space for certain military actions in that area.In a statement on its Telegram channel, the Hamas al-Qassam Brigades said the rockets were launched in response to ""Zionist massacres against civilians'.Rafah is situated approximately 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the south of Tel Aviv.Israel has stated its intention to eliminate Hamas fighters who are hiding in Rafah and to rescue hostages believed to be in the area. However, the military operation has exacerbated the suffering of civilians and sparked international criticism.Israeli strikes on Sunday resulted in the deaths of at least five Palestinians in Rafah, as reported by local medical services. The Gaza health ministry confirmed that the deceased individuals were civilians.Israeli tanks have been exploring the outskirts of Rafah, close to the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. They have also moved into certain eastern districts, according to residents. However, they have not made a full-scale entry into the city since the beginning of operations earlier this month.Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz said the rockets fired from Rafah ""prove that the (Israel Defense Forces) must operate in every place Hamas still operates from'.Defence Minister Yoav Gallant held an operational assessment in Rafah where he was briefed on ""troops' operations above and below the ground, as well as the deepening of operations in additional areas with the aim of dismantling Hamas battalions', his office said in a statement.Itamar Ben Gvir, a hardline public security minister who is not part of Israel's war cabinet, urged the army to increase the intensity of the attacks on Rafah. ""Rafah with full force,"" he posted on X.According to Gaza's health ministry, almost 36,000 Palestinians have lost their lives in the Israeli offensive. The operation by Israel was initiated in response to an attack by Hamas-led militants on southern Israeli communities on Oct 7. The attack resulted in the death of approximately 1,200 individuals and the capture of over 250 hostages, as reported by Israeli sources.The fighting in the northern Gaza area of Jabaliya persisted, which had been a site of intense combat in the earlier stages of the war. In a single raid, the military discovered a weapons storage site at a school, containing dozens of rocket parts and weapons.It refuted the claims made by Hamas that Palestinian fighters had kidnapped an Israeli soldier.Hamas media reported that a house in a neighborhood near Jabaliya was targeted by an Israeli airstrike, resulting in the death of 10 people and injuries to others.Truce talks are discussions aimed at reaching a ceasefire or peace agreement.Efforts to agree on a ceasefire and release over 120 hostages have faced obstacles for weeks. However, there were indications of progress over the weekend after discussions between Israeli and US intelligence officials and the Prime Minister of Qatar.An official with knowledge of the matter said a decision had been taken to resume the talks this week based on new proposals from Egyptian and Qatari mediators, and with ""active US involvement.""However, a Hamas official played down the report, telling Reuters: ""It is not true.""Netanyahu's war cabinet will discuss the new proposals, as stated by his office.A second Hamas official named Izzat El-Reshiq mentioned that the group had not yet received any information from the mediators regarding new dates to resume talks, contrary to what was reported by Israeli media.Reshiq restated Hamas's demands, which include: ""Ending the aggression completely and permanently, in all of Gaza Strip, not only Rafah'.Israel is working to secure the release of hostages. Netanyahu has emphasized that the conflict will only cease once Hamas, an organization committed to Israel's annihilation, is eradicated.Aid trucks have entered Gaza.Israel has received requests to increase the delivery of aid to Gaza. This comes after over seven months of conflict that has led to extensive damage and food shortages in the area.Khaled Zayed, a representative of the Egyptian Red Crescent, informed Reuters that a convoy of 200 trucks carrying aid, which includes four fuel trucks, is scheduled to arrive in Gaza on Sunday via Kerem Shalom.An agreement was made between US President Joe Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Friday. The agreement involves temporarily sending aid through the Kerem Shalom crossing, as the Rafah crossing has been blocked for weeks.Egypt's state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV posted a video on social media platform X. The video displayed aid trucks entering Kerem Shalom. Kerem Shalom was previously the primary commercial crossing station connecting Israel, Egypt, and Gaza.The Rafah crossing has been closed for nearly three weeks. This happened when Israel gained control of the Palestinian side of the crossing while intensifying its offensive.Egypt has become more and more concerned about the possibility of a large influx of Palestinians crossing into its territory from Gaza. As a result, Egypt has declined to open its side of the Rafah crossing.Israel has stated that it is not limiting the flow of aid and has opened new crossing points in the northern region. Additionally, Israel is collaborating with the United States, which has constructed a temporary floating pier for aid shipments.(With inputs from agencies)","Israeli air strikes in Rafah kill at least 35 Palestinians and injure many others.

The bombers, belonging to the eastern theatre command of the People's Liberation Army, formed multiple attack formations in waters east of Taiwan and conducted simulated attacks in coordination with naval vessels, Chinese state television CCTV reported.Meanwhile, Taiwan tracked numerous Chinese warplanes and navy vessels near its coast, coinciding with the second day of a significant exercise conducted by China's People's Liberation Army in response to the inauguration of Taiwan's new leadership.China has extensively advertised these maneuvers, showcasing Taiwan's encirclement by forces affiliated with the ruling Communist Party's military arm, the People's Liberation Army. A recent video presentation depicted animated Chinese forces closing in from all directions, effectively enclosing Taiwan within a circular target zone.Despite the situation, there was little evident concern among Taiwan's 23 million citizens, who have lived under the threat of Chinese invasion since the bitter and bloody civil war in 1949 led to the division between the two sides.Taiwan's parliament faced a dispute between political parties over procedural matters on Friday, yet daily activities continued as usual in the bustling capital of Taipei.According to the defense ministry, 49 warplanes, 19 navy vessels, and Chinese coast guard vessels were tracked. Of these, 35 planes crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait, the de facto boundary between the two sides, within a 24-hour period from Thursday to Friday.Marine and coast guard vessels, along with air and ground-based missile units, have been placed on high alert, particularly around the Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu, situated just off the coast of China and distant from Taiwan's main island by approximately 160 kilometers (100 miles) across the Taiwan Strait.""Facing external challenges and threats, we will continue to maintain the values of freedom and democracy,"" Taiwan's new President Lai Ching-te told sailors and top security officials on Thursday as he visited a marine base in Taoyuan, just south of the capital, Taipei.Lai in his inauguration speech on Monday had called on Beijing to stop its military intimidation and said Taiwan was ""a sovereign independent nation in which sovereignty lies in the hands of the people"".China's military said that its two-day exercises around Taiwan were intended as punishment for separatist factions advocating independence. Almost daily, it dispatches navy ships and warplanes into the Taiwan Strait and other surrounding areas to erode Taiwan's defenses and attempt to intimidate its populace, who staunchly support the island's de facto independence.""As soon as the leader of Taiwan took office, he challenged the one-China principle and blatantly sold the two-state theory',"" China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Chen Binhua said in a statement on Thursday night.","China dispatches bombers armed with live missiles for mock strikes as part of its Taiwan drills.

NEW DELHI: Kabosu, the beloved Shiba Inu who became an internet sensation as the Doge meme, has passed away. Kabosu’s owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the sad news, stating that Kabosu ""fell into a deep sleep"" at 7:50 am on May 24. A farewell party is scheduled for Sunday at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City, from 1 pm to 4 pm.

Kabosu's fame began in 2010 when pictures of her went viral online, leading to the creation of the Doge meme. The meme's popularity skyrocketed and even inspired the creation of Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 using Kabosu’s image as its logo. Initially conceived as a joke, Dogecoin's success spurred the creation of several other dog-themed cryptocurrencies.

In April last year, Elon Musk briefly changed Twitter's logo to an image of Kabosu, causing a surge in Dogecoin's value. Musk has been an outspoken supporter of the meme-based cryptocurrency.

Kabosu had been diagnosed with cholangiohepatitis and chronic lymphoma leukemia in 2022. Her passing marks the end of an era for meme enthusiasts and the cryptocurrency community.

""The faces of some of the women are bruised and bloodied,"" the Forum said. The video has intensified calls for immediate international intervention to secure the release of the hostages and ensure their safety.According to a New York Post report, in the video, a Hamas militant is heard saying, ""Here are the girls who can get pregnant,"" a statement that underscores the degrading treatment of the captives. This quote has sparked particular outrage, with many calling it a blatant example of gender-based violence and exploitation.Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have condemned the actions of Hamas, labeling the treatment of the hostages as a gross violation of human rights. An IDF spokesperson declared, ""This inhumane treatment is unacceptable and must be met with swift and decisive action from the international community.""The release of this video comes at a time of heightened tensions and escalating violence in the region. It underscores the urgent need for a resolution to the conflict and the critical importance of protecting innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.The video serves as a grim reminder of the human cost of the ongoing conflict, where civilians, including women and children, often bear the brunt of the violence. The Hostages Families Forum has called on world leaders to take immediate steps to facilitate the hostages' release and hold those responsible for their mistreatment accountable.International response to the video has been swift, with several countries condemning the actions depicted in the footage and urging both sides to adhere to international humanitarian laws. Human rights organizations have also voiced their concerns, emphasizing the need for all parties involved in the conflict to respect the rights and dignity of civilians.As the situation continues to unfold, the families of the hostages remain in a state of anguish and uncertainty.

Deadly turbulence: How Singapore Airlines flight's 400-foot drop happened within minutes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/air-turbulence-singapore-airlines-flights-400-foot-rise-and-drop-within-minutes-how-it-happened/articleshow/110324673.cms,"Passenger accounts and crew response

Aftermath and safety protocols

Investigations and future precautions

A Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore encountered severe turbulence, causing a rapid ascent and descent of 400 feet within a minute, resulting in the death of one passenger and injuries to at least 30 others. The Boeing 777-300ER, which departed from London’s Heathrow Airport, was diverted to Bangkok, where it made an emergency landing.The turbulence hit about 10 hours into the flight, as the plane flew over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar, a region known for severe weather conditions.The aircraft, carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members, was at an altitude of 37,000 feet when it suddenly encountered ""sudden extreme turbulence,"" causing it to drop 6,000 feet in about three minutes.Andrew Davies, a 54-year-old passenger from London, recounted his experience during the turbulence to the Wall Street Journal. He was deciding between taking a nap and watching a movie when the seatbelt sign flashed on. Just as he secured his seatbelt, the plane began to drop violently. ""Pillows, plates and cups were thrown in the air. His seat belt tugged at his waist, and he found himself covered in his neighbor’s coffee. Oxygen masks dropped down,"" Davies told the WSJ.The chaos in the cabin was immediate and severe. ""I saw a woman with a deep gash on her head, covered in blood. Flight crew members also appeared bloody and injured, hobbling around trying to help passengers,"" Davies added. An elderly passenger, identified as Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British national with a history of heart problems, likely suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by the crew to perform CPR for 20 minutes, they were unable to revive him.The plane's abrupt altitude change was documented by FlightRadar24, which reported a ""rapid change in vertical rate, consistent with a sudden turbulence event."" The turbulence was likely clear-air turbulence (CAT), which is difficult to detect and can occur without warning. ""Developing thunderstorms often have strong updrafts, a zone of upward moving air, that rises very rapidly, sometimes at more than 100 mph, and can leave pilots little time to react if it occurs directly in front of the plane,"" explained Dan DePodwin, Senior Director of Forecasting Operations at AccuWeather.Former pilot Marco Chan noted the turbulence likely occurred within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, notorious for thunderstorms. ""With turbulence of such magnitude, it is likely the [Singapore Airlines] flight was navigating through difficult thunderstorms,"" he said.Following the incident, Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong expressed condolences and assured that the airline was providing necessary support to affected passengers and their families. ""We are very sorry for the traumatic experience that everyone on board SQ321 went through,"" Goh said.Of the injured, 18 were hospitalized, with seven in critical condition. The Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok treated 71 passengers. The incident has renewed calls for strict adherence to safety protocols, emphasizing the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during a flight. ""It is a matter of life and death,"" said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.This event marked the first fatal incident involving Singapore Airlines in almost 25 years. The airline, recognized as one of the world's leading carriers, has a strong safety record, with its last major accident occurring in October 2000.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the US and Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau are investigating the incident. Preliminary findings suggest that climate change may be increasing the frequency and intensity of turbulence events. ""For clear-air turbulence, climate change is increasing the temperature difference across the jet stream between the cold poles and the warm tropics,"" explained Dr Paul Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading.As investigations continue, the aviation industry is urged to enhance real-time weather data sharing and improve safety protocols to better prepare for such unpredictable turbulence events.(With inputs from agencies)","Singapore Airlines Flight SQ321 was flying from London’s Heathrow airport to Singapore.

US: At least 15 dead after severe weather carves path of ruin across multiple states in the South,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-at-least-15-dead-after-severe-weather-carves-path-of-ruin-across-multiple-states-in-the-south/articleshow/110446083.cms,"TEXAS: Powerful storms killed at least 15 people and left a wide trail of destruction Sunday across Texas , Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter in a restroom during the latest deadly weather to strike the central US.The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas, and the system threatened to bring more violent weather to other parts of the Midwest later in the day. By Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City.Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, officials said. Storms also killed two people and destroyed houses in Oklahoma, where the injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region.""It's just a trail of debris left. The devastation is pretty severe,"" Cooke County Sheriff Ray Sappington told The Associated Press.The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5, the sheriff said. The Texas county includes the small community of Valley View, which was among the hardest-hit areas. Three family members were found dead in one home, Sappington said.Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop near Valley View. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot.""A firefighter came to check on us and he said, You're very lucky,'"" Parra said. ""The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.""Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, Texas, also north of Dallas. But officials did not immediately know the full extent of the injuries.At least five people were killed in Arkansas, including a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county's emergency management office. Another person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said.Elsewhere, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville, Kentucky, when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed it was a storm-related death on social media.The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection.Tornadoes in Iowa this week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.Meteorologists and authorities had issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday morning. ""If you are in the path of this storm take cover now,"" the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.Harold Brooks, senior research scientist researcher at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent weather pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months.Brooks recommended that travelers passing through threatened areas over the Memorial Day weekend should have a plan for a weather emergency.Travelers who have already chosen where to get food and other essentials ""probably ought to be thinking about what could I do if there's a dangerous situation to save my life,"" Brooks said.The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend.The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. The weather put a year's worth of planning in jeopardy when the band of thunderstorms swept through ahead of pre-race festivities.More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky.The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.","Storms kill at least 15 people in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.

Trump trial reaches its end game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-trial-reaches-its-end-game/articleshow/110442788.cms,"- Other cases -

NEW YORK: The historic trial of Donald Trump enters its final act Tuesday, with closing arguments to the jury who must then decide whether to hand down the first ever criminal conviction of a former US president .Less than six months before American voters choose whether to return Trump to the White House, the stakes riding on the verdict are hard to overstate -- for the 77-year-old personally, but also for the country as a whole.Trump is accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels about a 2006 sexual encounter between them that could have damaged his 2016 presidential bid .If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.Crucially, a conviction would not bar Trump from appearing on the ballot in November as the Republican presidential challenger to Democrat Joe Biden.It has taken nearly five weeks, the testimony of more than 20 witnesses and a few courtroom fireworks to reach closing arguments -- the last chance for the prosecution and defense to impress their case on the anonymous, 12-member jury.As expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to unnecessary legal jeopardy and forensic cross-examination.For a man who has always prided himself on being in charge and in control, the role of silent, passive defendant did not come easily.At times it has been downright excruciating, especially when Trump was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail.Speaking to reporters before and after each day in court, Trump launched regular tirades against Judge Juan Merchan -- calling him ""corrupt"" and a ""tyrant"" -- and condemned the whole trial as ""election interference"" by Democrats intent on keeping him off the campaign trail.The politics of the case were in full view in the final days when a coterie of leading Republicans -- including several vice-presidential hopefuls -- came to the court and stood behind Trump in a gesture of support as he spoke to the press.In all, he was cited 10 times for contempt of court and fined $10,000 by Merchan for failing to heed a gag order prohibiting him from publicly attacking witnesses, the jury, court staff or their relatives.The judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday.He will then give his final instructions to the jury, who will likely begin their deliberations on Wednesday.To return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.Aside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former ""fixer"" turned bitter foe who arranged the $130,000 hush money payment.Walking jurors through the reasoning behind the payments, Cohen said they were made ""to ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.""Trump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.The defense called only two witnesses of their own before resting.In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.He also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.None of those trials are expected to take place before the November election.",The historic trial of Donald Trump enters its final act Tuesday. The jury must then decide whether to hand down the first ever criminal conviction of a former US president.

Its fifth patrol, described by the NHHC as its ""most successful,,"" saw it engage Japanese destroyers, sinking three and inflicting heavy damage or destruction on two others within four days.During its final patrol, the USS Harder, aided by the USS Haddo, targeted and neutralized three escort ships off the Philippines province of Bataan.Japanese records later revealed that on August 24, 1944, the Harder launched three torpedoes at CD-22, another escort ship in the vicinity, according to the Fox News digital citing the NHHC.""The Japanese ship evaded the torpedoes and began a series of depth charge attacks,"" it added, with the ""fifth depth charge attack sinking Harder and her crew.""Following its service in World War II, the USS Harder received the Presidential Unit Citation and six battle stars, the NHHC says","The USS Harder vanished on August 24, 1944, with 79 sailors onboard.

There are unconfirmed reports of a man having been allegedly lynched,"" the HRCP posted on X.""The Punjab police @OfficialDPRPP and district administration must immediately restore calm and bring the perpetrators to book while ensuring that the Christian community comes to no further harm,"" it added.Last year in August, a similar but larger-scale incident occurred in Jaranwala, Pakistan, where over 21 churches and more than a hundred houses were burned down, some reduced to rubble, in a mob attack over allegations of 'blasphemy'. The incident also involved widespread looting and burning of hundreds of homes across 11 areas in the Faisalabad district. As a result, 10,000 Christians were immediately displaced, and 20,000 were affected by the incident.","A mob of Muslims went on a violent spree in eastern Pakistan following accusations against a Christian man for desecrating the pages of Quran. They vandalized and set fire to his house, assaulting him in the process, before police intervened and rescued the man and his father. The HRCP expressed serious concern about the situation in Sargodha's Gillwala village.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110424581,imgsize-964769,width-400,resizemode-4/110424581.jpg"
Pakistan's Punjab government approves registration of more cases against Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-punjab-government-approves-registration-of-more-cases-against-imran-khan/articleshow/110421656.cms,"LAHORE: Pakistan's Punjab government has approved the registration of more cases against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and his party men for inciting hate against the state institutions, especially the powerful Pakistan Army . The 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician has been in jail since August last year after being convicted in some of the nearly 200 cases slapped on him since his ouster in April 2022.""The Punjab Cabinet of Maryam Nawaz has approved legal action against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder leader Imran Khan and his other party leaders for building a hate narrative against the state institutions,"" Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari told a press conference after a cabinet meeting on Friday evening.The minister said Khan is trying to become Mujeebur Rehman (of Bangladesh). Mujeebur Rehman had successfully led the Bangladeshi independence movement against Pakistan. He became the first prime minister of Bangladesh in 1971.Bokhari said those who meet Khan in Adiala Jail Rawalpindi also follow him in spreading hate against the institutions.The Punjab government is likely to book Khan and his close associates for writing an article in a British newspaper on a complaint from a journalist, she said.Earlier this month, in an article in The Telegraph newspaper, Khan alleged that the military establishment, under the direct guidance of Gen Asim Munir, the chief of army staff, has tried every tactic to decimate his party's presence from the political environment of Pakistan but failed.""The oppression, torture and denial of our election symbol have been extensively documented, but nothing has worked for the military and the powerless civilian leadership acting as its puppets. Pakistan's general elections on February 8 2024, showed the utter failure of their design.""With no single electoral symbol in a country where the vast majority of voters are guided by a party symbol, the people came out and voted overwhelmingly for candidates supported by my party, the PTI, despite standing as 'independents' with a host of diverse symbols,"" he wrote.Khan further said this democratic revenge by the people of Pakistan against the agenda of the military establishment not only was a national defiance by the people but also a complete rejection of the official state narrative of May 9 2023, when PTI supporters were falsely accused - as a pretext for a crackdown - of attacking military installations.""Instead of accepting the people's mandate, the military establishment went into a fit of rage and electoral results were manipulated to bring into power the losers. The constitutional functioning of state institutions must be restored, the military establishment has done all they could against me. All that is left for them is to now murder me.""I have stated publicly that if anything happens to me or my wife, Gen Asim Munir will be responsible. But I am not afraid because my faith is strong. I would prefer death over slavery,"" Khan wrote.",The Punjab government has approved the registration of more cases against Imran Khan.

During these last two decades, in the name of counter-insurgency operations and peace, a large number of young men, mostly students, engineers, doctors, political activists, and journalists have been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security agencies,"" she said.She further stressed that these people have been detained in detention centres, and tortured, and their families didn't know about their whereabouts.""Not for days, but for years, even though there are cases that have been enforcedly disappeared for decades. And the family didn't know that their beloved ones were alive or dead,"" Baloch added.Mahrang Baloch emphasised that even today, it has been practised by fascist states, the oppressive states like Pakistan.She further added, ""Still today, it's been practised by the fascist states, by the oppressive states like Pakistan. During these last two decades, in the name of counter-insurgency operations and peace, many of our assets have forcibly disappeared. And then their mutilated bodies were found in Balochistan. They were being killed in detention centres.""Baloch said that the exact number of disappeared is unknown, as the state has not allowed international groups such as the United Nations or Amnesty International to investigate the nature of this human tragedy.""But when local activists' rights groups tried to document the number or raise their voices, they themselves disappeared. It is very difficult to tell these stories of victims of forced disappearances,"" she said.While sharing her own experience of suffering at the hands of the Pakistani administration Baloch said, ""I myself am a victim. My own father was disappeared by agents of Pakistani state in 2009. He was killed and his bullet-ridden body was found in 2011. When I was at 10th standard that was the day when my result was announced. That day, I found the body of my father, my younger brother disappeared when I was doing my graduation in medicine in 2017.""She highlighted that she campaigned and launched rallies for him in Balochistan, adding that after three months he was released.""But my case is not exceptional.

I have been campaigning and pressing the Pakistan Supreme Court , Parliament and security forces to release those who have disappeared or at least present them before a court if they have committed any crime,"" she said.Baloch added that the Pakistani authorities instead of addressing these issues, have resorted to violence.She also mentioned the long march which failed due to the ignorance and ill-treatment of the Pakistani administration.""I marched more than 1600 km in December for over a month and arrived in Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan on a cold evening with children and women. We were beaten, charged, humiliated and tortured by police. The controlled media was used to run a malicious campaign against us. On social media, we were abused and trolled by state accounts,"" she said.Stressing that the journalists were intimidated and stopped from giving the media coverage, Baloch said that the powerful intelligence agencies of Pakistan forced the people not to respond to the peaceful movement.""The media ignored us through our protests. Scams were sent just outside the National Press Club of Islamabad. And there was no coverage of this peaceful movement. We have been sitting there for more than one month,"" she said.Baloch further expressed hope and said that they are hopeful because those who are behind this violence and those who are using violence, are less in number.""Maybe they have the power to rule us. But those who believe in humanity, who believe in peace, we are large in number,"" she added.","Prominent Baloch leader, Mahrang Baloch highlighted the ongoing issue of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

NEW DELHI: Coming down heavily on a Pakistani lawmaker for his comments on Lok Sabha elections , Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday responded strongly and said that India was fully capable of solving its own problems and that the Pakistani leader's tweet of support was not needed.The former Pakistan minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain shared Arvind Kejriwal's post on X on voting with his family, and said, “May peace and harmony defeat forces of hate and extremism”, with the hashtags ""MorePower"" and ""IndiaElection2024"".Minutes after Hussain's post, Kejriwal hit back at him, saying his post was unnecessary.“Chaudhary Sahib, I and the people of my country are fully capable of handling our issues. Your tweet is not needed. The situation in Pakistan is very bad right now. You take care of your country,” Kejriwal said on X.In another post, the chief minister said the elections are India's internal matter and the country will ""not tolerate interference by the biggest sponsors of terrorism"".Responding to Kejriwal's posts, Hussain said, ""CM sb!
