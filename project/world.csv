"Ecuador, country of 18m, hit by nationwide blackout",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ecuador-country-of-18m-hit-by-nationwide-blackout/articleshow/111151506.cms,"Quito: Ecuador was plunged into a nationwide blackout on Wednesday. Around 3.15pm, the majority of Ecuadorians found themselves without power. By evening, the sound of cars honking and drivers shouting filled the streets of Quito and the port city of Guayaquil as traffic lights stopped working and vehicles overwhelmed the cities' streets. The public transit systems and some water supply companies suspended services in both major cities. The mayor of Quito expressed surprise on X that the blackout had affected the city's subway system, which uses an ""isolated"" power source.The the country's public works minister, Roberto Luque, said on X that he had received a report from the national electricity operator, CENACE, about ""a failure in the transmission line that caused a cascade disconnection, so there is no energy service nationwide."" Within hours, power had begun to return to some parts of Quito, the capital.The South American nation of 18 million people has been struggling with an energy crisis for several years. Failing infrastructure, a lack of maintenance and a dependence on imported energy have all contributed to rolling blackouts. Most of the country's energy comes from neighbouring Colombia, a nation that has struggled to generate enough power for its own domestic consumption. A $2.25bn Chinese-built hydroelectric power plant was supposed to help. The project has instead become a headache. There have been several construction errors leading to a dispute between officials and the China firm.","Around 3.15pm, the majority of Ecuadorians found themselves without power.

Louisiana schools told to display Ten Commandments in all classrooms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/louisiana-schools-told-to-display-ten-commandments-in-all-classrooms/articleshow/111151434.cms,"Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom, the latest move from a GOP-dominated legislature pushing a conservative agenda under a new governor. The legislation that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in ""large, easily readable font"" in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. ""If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses"" who got the commandments from God, Landry said. Opponents questioned the law's constitutionality and vowed to challenge it in court. The law prevents students from equal education and will keep kids who have different beliefs from feeling safe, the American Civil Liberties Union said.

"'Global warming makes killer heat in Mexico, US 35 times more likely'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/global-warming-makes-killer-heat-in-mexico-us-35-times-more-likely/articleshow/111151351.cms,"WASHINGTON: Deadly heat that blanketed the US, Mexico and Central America recently was made 35 times more likely due to global warming , an international network of climate scientists said on Thursday. The World Weather Attribution also said that extreme highs witnessed over that region were four times as likely to occur today as a quarter of a century ago.

For its study, WWA analysed the hottest five consecutive days and nights during a ""heat dome"" that lingered over the southwest US, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras in late May and early June. They concluded ""that human-induced warming from burning fossil fuels made the five-day maximum temperature event about 1.4 hotter and about 35 times more likely"". WWA warned if humans continue burning fossil fuels in the near term, these extremes could become more frequent still. ""The additional 1.4C of heat caused by climate change is the difference between life and death,"" said Karina Izquierdo of Red Cross Climate Centre.

Russia mulling lowering nukes use threshold? Putin doesn't rule it out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russia-mulling-lowering-nukes-use-threshold-putin-doesnt-rule-it-out/articleshow/111151189.cms,"Russian Prez Putin said on Thursday that Russia was thinking about possible changes to its doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons. The existing doctrine states that Russia may use such weapons in response to a nuclear attack or in the event of a conventional attack that poses an existential threat to the state.

Since the start of the war in Ukraine, some hawks among Russian military analysts have been advocating that Russia should lower its threshold for nuclear use. Putin said, however, that there was no need for Russia to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike.

He was speaking to reporters a day after visiting nuclear-armed North Korea for a summit with its leader, Kim Jong-un. The two leaders signed a treaty under which each side promised to provide immediate military assistance to the other in the event of armed aggression against either one of them. Russian state media quoted Putin as saying that Moscow expected that its cooperation with North Korea would serve as a deterrent to the West, but that there was no need to use North Korean soldiers in the war in Ukraine.

Putin also said he did not rule out Russia supplying high-precision weapons to North Korea. This announcement prompted South Korea to say it would consider sending arms to Ukraine, a major policy change. The Russian prez said, in response, Seoul would be making ""a big mistake"" if it decides to supply arms to Ukraine. He added South Korea has ""nothing to worry"".

",Russia and North Korea have signed a deal to share information on nuclear weapons. The two countries have agreed to share intelligence on the development of nuclear weapons in the event of a conflict. Russia has said it will not send nuclear weapons to North Korea if the two countries agree.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111151218,imgsize-50444,width-400,resizemode-4/111151218.jpg"
Rift between Israel's military & govt over plan for postwar Gaza spills out into open,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/rift-between-israels-military-govt-over-plan-for-postwar-gaza-spills-out-into-open/articleshow/111150944.cms,"Jerusalem: The Israeli army's chief spokesman on Wednesday appeared to question the stated goal of destroying the Hamas militant group in Gaza in a rare public rift between the country's political and military leadership.

PM Netanyahu has insisted Israel will pursue the fight against Hamas until its military and governing capabilities in the Palestinian territory are eliminated. But with the war now in its ninth month, frustration has been mounting with no clear end or postwar plan in sight. ""This business of destroying Hamas, making Hamas disappear - it's simply throwing sand in the eyes of the public,"" Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, told Israel's Channel 13 TV. ""Hamas is an idea, Hamas is a party. It's rooted in the hearts of the people - whoever thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong.""

Netanyahu's office responded by saying that the country's security cabinet, chaired by the PM, ""has defined the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities as one of the goals of the war. The Israeli military, of course, is committed to this."" The military quickly issued a clarification, saying it was ""committed to achieving the goals of the war as defined by the cabinet"" and that it has been working on this ""throughout the war, day and night, and will continue to do so."" Hagari's comments, it said, ""referred to the destruction of Hamas as an ideology and an idea"".

There have already been open signs of discontent over the handling of the war. Benny Gantz, an ex-military chief, withdrew from war cabinet this month. Early this week, Netanyahu expressed displeasure with the army's decision to declare a ""tactical pause"" in Rafah for humanitarian aid.

Breakthrough in MH370 search: Researchers detect promising new signal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/breakthrough-in-mh370-search-researchers-detect-promising-new-signal/articleshow/111118450.cms,"Initial search and early efforts (2014-2015)

A newly detected signal might finally provide answers to the long-standing mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 , which vanished nearly ten years ago. British researchers from Cardiff University have identified a fresh clue that could help pinpoint the final resting place of the ill-fated jet.The signal, detected recently, is being hailed as a significant development in the search for MH370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board. Despite extensive searches over the years, the plane's exact location has remained elusive.Richard Godfrey, a British engineer who has been heavily involved in the search efforts, said, ""We have detected a weak signal that could potentially be from the aircraft. This is the first time we have such a lead in years.""The researchers believe the new signal could help narrow down the search area in the southern Indian Ocean, where the aircraft is believed to have ended its flight. The signal's detection comes after years of using advanced technology and simulations to trace the plane's final moments.Experts involved in the search are cautiously optimistic about this development. ""This signal could be the breakthrough we have been waiting for. We hope it will bring closure to the families of those on board,"" said another member of the research team.The disappearance of MH370 has been one of aviation's greatest mysteries, leading to numerous theories and extensive international search efforts. The search for MH370 has been one of the most challenging and complex in aviation history, involving multiple countries, advanced technology, and extensive resources.Following the disappearance, a massive international search operation was launched. Initial efforts focused on the South China Sea but later shifted to the southern Indian Ocean based on satellite data.The first phase involved surface searches by ships and aircraft, covering thousands of square kilometers. Despite the vast efforts, no debris was found in the initial stages.In April 2014, Australia's Ocean Shield vessel, equipped with advanced underwater search technology, was deployed. It searched for acoustic signals from the aircraft's black boxes but found no conclusive evidence.Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) like Bluefin-21 and GO Phoenix were deployed to conduct detailed seafloor searches in the Indian Ocean's search zones, covering areas with depths of up to 6,000 meters.In July 2015, a flaperon from MH370 was discovered on Réunion Island, confirming the aircraft had ended in the Indian Ocean. This discovery spurred new hope and directed the focus on the southern Indian Ocean.Over the next year, more debris washed ashore on islands in the Indian Ocean and African east coast, including parts of the wing, stabilizers, and cabin interior.After covering over 120,000 square kilometers of seafloor without locating the main wreckage, the official search was suspended in January 2017. The challenging underwater terrain, including deep trenches and volcanic activity, hindered efforts.Ocean Infinity Search: In early 2018, private company Ocean Infinity conducted a renewed search using advanced AUVs, covering an additional 112,000 square kilometers. Despite their efforts, no new debris was located.","The signal detected recently is being hailed as a significant development in the search for MH370.

Legal age for marriage in Pakistan

The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72-year-old man named Habib Khan was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town. While the police managed to arrest the groom and the 'Nikah Khwan' (a person who solemnizes the marriage), the girl's father managed to escape.A case has been registered against the girl's father, the 72-year-old man, and the 'Nikkah Khwan' under the Child Marriage Act , according to ARY News. Despite the existence of laws prohibiting child marriage, such incidents continue to occur in various parts of Pakistan. The minor girl was sent to a hospital for a medical examination.The girl's father, Alam Syed, had reportedly agreed to sell his daughter to the elderly man for PKR 500,000.In recent times, law enforcement agencies have thwarted similar attempts in Rajanpur and Thatta, where young girls were being coerced into marrying older men. In Rajanpur, Punjab, an 11-year-old girl was set to marry a 40-year-old man, while in Thatta, a young girl was forcibly married to a 50-year-old landlord before the police took action and rescued the girl.In another incident on May 6, a 70-year-old man was arrested by the police for marrying a 13-year-old girl in Swat. The girl's father had arranged the marriage, but the police swiftly took the groom and the father into custody. The 'Nikkah Khwan' and the marriage witnesses were also arrested, and the minor girl was sent to a hospital for a medical examination.In Pakistan, the legal age for marriage differs based on gender. While the internationally recognized minimum age for both males and females is 18, the country's laws allow males to marry at 18 but permit females to wed at the younger age of 16.Although Sindh province took a step towards gender equality in 2013 by passing legislation to raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 for both genders, this progressive change has not been adopted and implemented throughout the nation.

That figure brought the total reported dead so far to 922, according to an AFP tally of figures released by various nations.A diplomat in Saudi Arabia said 68 Indian nationals had died during the haj pilgrimage. ""Some are because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,"" the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP.In addition to Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed by Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.Saudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of ""heat exhaustion"" on Sunday alone. The country has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.Social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information. Those searching for news include family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday. ""The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive,"" said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia.The haj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once. Its timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar. For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer. According to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4C each decade. A 2019 study by experts at MIT found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Haj would be held in temperatures exceeding an ""extreme danger threshold"" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.Deaths aren't uncommon at the Haj, which has drawn at times over 2 million people to Saudi Arabia. Last year more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead. There have also been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage's history. A 2015 stampede in Mina during the haj killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, an AP count showed. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people. The second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.","Friends and family search for missing haj pilgrims as death toll surges past 900.

A series of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have occurred in disputed areas.New Chinese coast guard rules took effect on Saturday, June 15, which reinforce a 2021 law granting its coastguard the authority to use deadly force against foreign vessels in contested waters.Under these new rules, China's coastguard is empowered to apprehend suspected trespassers and detain them for up to 60 days without the need for a trial.In a statement, the Beijing's Coast Guard said, ""Philippine replenishment ship ignored many solemn warnings from the Chinese side"".It ""approached the... Chinese vessel in an unprofessional way, resulting in a collision"", the statement said.""The Chinese Coast Guard took control measures against the Philippine ship in accordance with the law,"" it added.Beijing accused the ship of having ""illegally broken into the sea near Ren'ai Reef in China's Nansha Islands"", using the Chinese name for the Spratly Islands.Manila has accused the Chinese coast guard of ""barbaric and inhumane behaviour"" against Philippine vessels, and President Ferdinand Marcos has called the new rules a ""very worrisome"" escalation.China has defended its new coast guard rules, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying last month that they were intended to ""better uphold order at sea"".The Group of Seven bloc criticised what it called ""dangerous"" incursions by China in the South China Sea on Friday. Recent confrontations between China and the Philippines have raised concerns about a wider conflict over the sea that could involve the United States and other allies.Multiple dollars in ship-borne trade passes through the South China Sea annually, and vastly unexploited oil and gas deposits that are believed to lie beneath its seabed, although estimates vary greatly.The Philippines has encountered various challenges while attempting to provide supplies to its troops stationed on an old naval vessel that was intentionally grounded to assert the country's maritime claims.Chinese Coast Guard ships have employed water cannons to target boats from the Philippines on multiple occasions and several collisions have occurred, resulting in injuries to the Filipino troops.","Beijing claims nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, a vital waterway facilitating over $3 trillion in annual maritime trade.

United Airlines jet turns back after engine piece falls off,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/united-airlines-jet-turns-back-after-engine-piece-falls-off/articleshow/111153625.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

A United Airlines flight bound for Denver returned to Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, on Thursday after a piece of the engine's sound-dampening outer liner fell off during takeoff. The crew of the Airbus A320 heard an ""abnormal noise"" shortly after departure and decided to turn back, according to the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ).The airline said that the missing portion of the liner was found on the runway, and there were no reported injuries among the 124 passengers and five crew members on board. The FAA announced that it would investigate the incident .This event follows a series of mishaps involving United Airlines earlier this year, which prompted the FAA to tighten its oversight of the carrier. These incidents included a piece of fuselage falling off a plane, a wheel coming loose during takeoff, an engine fire, and other problems. CEO Scott Kirby assured travelers that the incidents were unrelated and that the airline is safe, but he also mentioned that United would review its safety training for employees.The aircraft involved in the latest incident is 22 years old. While the cause is not yet known, issues with older planes are often isolated and not indicative of systemic problems or manufacturing defects. According to a recording of conversations between the airport control tower and the plane, the aircraft lost several pieces of sheet metal during takeoff, which were recovered from the runway, and additional debris fell off upon landing.A nearby JetBlue Airways pilot initially reported the debris to the tower, causing some planes to be diverted to other runways. The United pilot informed the tower that one of the engines was slightly exceeding normal exhaust gas temperatures, and he was concerned they had hit a bird or blown a tire during takeoff. The pilot declared an emergency but noted that ""Everything is running fine, the engine is within parameters.""The ongoing FAA review has limited United's certification activities, effectively restricting the carrier's growth. However, United stated last month that it could begin the process of adding new planes and routes again. CEO Scott Kirby has said that the airline is ""embracing"" the FAA evaluation as an opportunity to improve its already high level of safety.","A piece of the engine's sound-dampening outer liner fell off during takeoff.

Floodwaters inundate Minnesota towns while another storm transformed New Mexico village into a lake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/floodwaters-inundate-minnesota-towns-while-another-storm-transformed-new-mexico-village-into-a-lake/articleshow/111152179.cms,"COOK: Several small-town tourist meccas in northern Minnesota have been inundated by floodwaters after a deluge of rain earlier this week, while another powerful storm turned a New Mexico village into a lake.In St. Louis County, Minnesota - the home of Duluth - people navigated flood-ridden streets with kayaks and other small boats, photos taken by KARE-TV showed.Meanwhile, a storm in the 200-person village of Willard, New Mexico, on Wednesday unleashed a thick curtain of 6 to 8 inches of rain and lime-sized hail in the town outside of Albuquerque, as fire crews farther south in the mountain village of Ruidoso were still battling a pair of deadly wildfires . Some parts of New Mexico don't see that much rainfall in an entire year, National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Guyer said.The National Weather Service warned that more significant rain is possible in Minnesota over the next three days in areas with saturated ground and swollen rivers after receiving more torrential rain on Tuesday. Parts of St. Louis, Itasca and Lake counties recorded more than 7 inches of rain.Dozens of roads were washed out across northern Minnesota after the storm, totally cutting off access to lakeside resorts and causing tens of millions of dollars' worth of damage. Officials in St. Louis County declared a disaster after estimating the floods had caused at least $50 million in damage and prompted the closure of more than 40 roads there.Duluth itself fared better thanks to the improvements it made in its flood defenses after the record floods of 2012. But other smaller towns like Cook and Biwabik were not as fortunate. Gov. Tim Walz plans to tour the damage there on Friday.""It's just sheer devastation,"" said Ryan Horner, who runs the 85-year old Comet Theater in downtown Cook that is covered with at least three feet of water. Inside the theater, Horner told Minnesota Public Radio that the water has filled the basement and is now more than chest deep at the bottom of the auditorium.Elsewhere near Lake Vermillion, the flooding cut off all the roads into Glenwood Lodge, meaning the only way into the fully booked resort is by boat right now.""We're stuck in here. We're not going anywhere with a vehicle,"" resort owner Billy Muelken said.Willard, New Mexico, is feeling the effects of what happens when the state's wildfire and monsoon seasons overlap.""We went from catastrophic wildfires one day to catastrophic flooding the next,"" said Guyer, of the National Weather Service.Within minutes after commercial truck driver Mike Bischoff received an emergency alert that a storm was on the way, he was already stuck in it. The 54-year-old was driving his semi-truck on Highway 42 when the hail started to pour down and the flash floods surrounded him and the other drivers on the road.Stuck in the storm, Bischoff said the hail poured down and a funnel cloud appeared in the sky.""My semi weighs 80,000 pounds, and it was rocking,"" Bischoff said.Much of the Southwest has been exceedingly dry and hot in recent months. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped flames out of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire into Ruidoso. Evacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses, a regional hospital and the Ruidoso Downs horse track.",Several small-town tourist meccas in northern Minnesota have been inundated by floodwaters after a deluge of rain earlier this week.

"Donald Sutherland, whose career spanned 'M.A.S.H.' to 'Hunger Games', dies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-sutherland-whose-career-spanned-m-a-s-h-to-hunger-games-dies/articleshow/111150499.cms,"Donald Sutherland , whose ability to both charm and unsettle, both reassure and repulse, was amply displayed in scores of film roles as diverse as a laid-back battlefield surgeon in ""M*A*S*H"", a ruthless Nazi spy in ""Eye of the Needle"", a soulful father in ""Ordinary People"" and a strutting fascist in ""1900"", has died. He was 88. His son Kiefer Sutherland announced the death, but did not specify the cause.With his long face, droopy eyes, protruding ears and wolfish smile, the 6-foot-4 Sutherland was never anyone's idea of a movie heartthrob. He often recalled that while growing up in eastern Canada, he once asked his mother if he was good-looking, only to be told, ""No, but your face has a lot of character."" He recounted how he was once rejected for a film role by a producer who said: ""This part calls for a guy-next-door type. You don't look like you've lived next door to anyone."" And yet across six decades, starting in the early 1960s, he appeared in nearly 200 films and TV shows - some years he was in as many as half a dozen movies. His chameleon-like ability to be endearing in one role, menacing in another and just plain odd in yet a third appealed to directors, among them Federico Fellini, Robert Altman, Bernardo Bertolucci and Oliver Stone. ""For me, working with these great guys was like falling in love,"" Sutherland said of those filmmakers. ""I was their lover, their beloved.""Sutherland first came to the attention of many moviegoers as one of the army misfits and sociopaths in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), set during WWII. His character had almost no lines until he was told to take over from another actor . ""You with the big ears - you do it!"" he recalled the director, Robert Aldrich, yelling at him. ""He didn't even know my name.""While Sutherland worked almost nonstop to the very end, some of his more memorable roles fell in a stretch from 1970 to 1981, when he appeared in 34 films, often playing men who walked a fine line between sanity and madness - and on occasion erased that line. His fascist in Bertolucci's ""1900"" (1976), his heavily made-up Lothario in ""Fellini's Casanova"" (1976) and his murderous WWII spy in ""Eye of the Needle"" (1981) were examples of his capacity for the grotesque and the ominous.But he could also be winningly irreverent, as in a pivotal early role: Hawkeye Pierce, an insolent mobile-hospital surgeon, in Robert Altman's ""M*A*S*H"" (1970), set during the Korean War but with distinctly Vietnam-era sensibilities. Despite the critical acclaim that he usually enjoyed, he never received an Academy Award nomination. There were other honours, though, including a 1995 Emmy for his role as a Soviet investigator in ""Citizen X"", an HBO film. He also won two Golden Globes - for ""Citizen X"" and for his 2002 portrayal of the presidential adviser Clark Clifford in HBO's ""Path to War"". Well-received performances included the kindly Mr. Bennet in ""Pride & Prejudice"" (2005) the president in the dystopian "" Hunger Games "" series of the 2010s.","His son Kiefer Sutherland announced the death, but did not specify the cause.

Thompson, who hails from Elyria, Ohio , is being represented by a Hall County public defender.Sgt. Joshua Moline of the Hall County Sheriff's Office stated in an affidavit filed in court that a portion of the attack was recorded on a trucker's dash cam, while some of it occurred out of sight inside Gary and Mary Weaver 's RV around 7 am Wednesday. The video footage showed a man entering the RV and making stabbing motions toward the woman before moving out of view. When the woman exited the RV, the man followed and stabbed her multiple times in the head before she collapsed to the ground, briefly pausing to shout at the trucker in the semi.Inside the RV, deputies discovered Gary Weaver with wounds to his chest and head. The 72-year-old later succumbed to his injuries at a Grand Island hospital. Mary Weaver, 71, was found sitting on the ground beside the RV, bleeding. Initially in critical condition with what the sheriff described as life-threatening injuries, her condition has since improved to stable as of Thursday.The Jeep, which had been detached from the RV, had blood on it. The Weavers, who are from Eureka, Missouri, had been traveling through Nebraska when they were attacked.Before officers arrived at the rest area, Thompson fled in a Ford Focus. However, a Nebraska State Trooper quickly spotted him exiting the highway at Wood River. Thompson sped away at 120 mph over I-80, passing another driver before crashing into the Platte River. He was apprehended nearby, with blood on his shirt and several cuts on his hand.","James Thompson Jr, 22, was officially charged with first-degree murder and 10 other felonies, a day after the attack at a rest area near Grand Island in eastern Nebraska.

US Supreme Court upholds Trump-era tax rule on foreign income over challenge backed by business interests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-upholds-trump-era-tax-rule-on-foreign-income-over-challenge-backed-by-business-interests/articleshow/111146781.cms,"NEW DELHI: The US Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of a tax imposed on Americans who have invested in certain foreign corporations . The 7-2 ruling, delivered on Thursday, comes at a time when some Democrat lawmakers are pushing for a wealth tax on the super-rich.The case involved Charles and Kathleen Moore , a retired couple from Redmond, Washington, who challenged the ""mandatory repatriation tax"" (MRT) imposed on foreign company earnings, even if those profits have not been distributed to shareholders. The tax, which was part of a Republican-backed tax law passed in 2017, applies to owners of at least 10% of a foreign company controlled by Americans.The central issue in the case was whether this tax on unrealized gains was permitted under the US Constitution's 16th Amendment , which allows Congress to ""collect taxes on incomes."" The Moores, supported by various conservative and business groups, argued that ""income"" refers only to gains that are realized through payment to the taxpayer, not merely an increase in the value of property.Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in his majority opinion joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's three liberal members, stated that the MRT ""does tax realized income - namely, income realized by the corporation,"" attributes that undistributed income to shareholders, and taxes them on their share of it. ""The MRT therefore falls squarely within Congress's constitutional authority to tax,"" Kavanaugh wrote.However, Kavanaugh clarified that the court was not deciding on the key dispute of whether an economic gain must be realized or not to be considered income - a crucial question related to the concept of a wealth tax. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in a separate opinion joined by Justice Samuel Alito, expressed her view that the Constitution does not allow Congress to tax unrealized sums without apportionment among the states.Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented, also noting that ""unrealized gains could not be taxed as 'income'"" under the 16th Amendment.The Moores sought a refund of nearly $14,729 in taxes they were required to pay as minority shareholders in a company based in Bangalore, India. The Justice Department had warned that a ruling invalidating the MRT could have cost the US government $340 billion over the next decade and potentially more if other tax provisions were also affected.The ruling also has implications for legislative proposals favored by some Democrats, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, who advocate for a tax on the net worth of super-rich Americans. However, such proposals face significant challenges in Congress, particularly with the House of Representatives under Republican control.","US Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of a tax imposed on Americans who have invested in certain foreign corporations.

This shift coincides with a rise in positive views of the economy, marking the highest level of approval for economic conditions during Biden's presidency.The survey reveals a 3-point change in the presidential race since May. Previously, Trump was ahead by 1 point, but Biden now leads with 50 per cent to Trump's 48 per cent, which is within the margin of error. Biden's current 50 per cent support is his best in this election cycle; he last led Trump in October 2023 by a mere 1 point (49 per cent-48 per cent).The survey notes several events since May that could influence voter preferences , including Trump's hush money conviction, Hunter Biden’s gun trial conviction, a positive US jobs report, and Biden’s immigration executive order.""There is not a lot of movement in this poll since May, but it is enough to make this a welcome poll for Biden,"" said Democratic pollster Chris Anderson. ""The vote preference improvement is one thing, but perhaps more importantly, we saw notable erosion of Trump’s advantage on the economy and immigration, while Biden built on his advantages on abortion and health care.""The expanded ballot shows Biden leading Trump by 1 point (43 per cent -42 per cent), with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 10 per cent , and Cornel West and Jill Stein each at 2 per cent . Last month, Trump led Biden by 3 points (43 per cent -40 per cent).Trump maintains strong support among men (+15), rural voters (+17), White men without a degree (+30), and White evangelical Christians (+46). Biden counters with strong backing from voters aged 65 and over (+15), women (+17), urban voters (+23), and White women with a college degree (+28 per cent). Biden receives 73 per cent support from Black voters, slightly down from the 79 per cent before the 2020 election when he ultimately won 91 per cent of the Black vote.As per the Fox News survey, partisan loyalty remains high, with 95 per cent of Democrats supporting Biden and 95 per cent of Republicans backing Trump. Independents, however, now favor Biden by 9 points, a change from May when they preferred Trump by 2 points. Leadership and integrity are extremely important to Independents, who view Biden as having more integrity by 23 points, while Trump is seen as a stronger leader by 11 points.""The underlying demographic tendencies that have defined the race remain in place,"" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw. ""Biden has improved slightly with women and seniors, which keeps him afloat despite significant reductions from 2020 in support from younger voters and African Americans.""Three-quarters of voters consider it highly important who wins the presidential election, with a 5-point preference for Biden. More women than men and more voters aged 65+ than younger voters believe the outcome matters greatly, potentially benefiting Biden.In terms of personal favorability, majorities have a negative view of Trump (57 per cent), Vice President Harris (57 per cent), Biden (56 per cent), and Kennedy (51 per cent). Among Democrats, 84 per cent have a positive view of Biden, 82 per cent of the first lady, 77 per cent of Harris, and 35 per cent of Hunter Biden, while 86 per cent of Republicans view Trump favorably.Economic sentiment has improved slightly, with 32 per cent of voters rating the economy as excellent or good, the highest during Biden's presidency. Fifty-nine percent say they are financially stable or improving, up 5 points since last summer, and 44 per cent feel optimistic about the economy, a 9-point increase from 2023.Biden’s job approval stands at 45 per cent , unchanged from last month but the best since January 2023. Thirty-four percent are satisfied with the country's direction, the highest in over three years but still lower than when Biden took office in 2021.Voters prioritize handling issues over candidate character by a 59 per cent -29 per cent margin. Trump is trusted more on immigration (+9 points) and the economy (+5 points), though these advantages have narrowed since May. Biden is trusted more on health care (+10 points) and the future of American democracy (+6 points), with his biggest advantages on abortion (+13 points) and climate change (+20 points).Kennedy’s support has declined, with his net favorability now at -11 points. His supporters are evenly split between Biden and Trump in a two-way race.The survey, conducted June 14-17, included 1,095 registered voters and has a margin of error of ±3 percentage points.","US President Joe Biden has emerged as the frontrunner in a hypothetical matchup against former President Donald Trump for the first time since October.

Akhter, a resident, expresses the struggles faced by daily wage workers and labourers, highlighting the impact of soaring prices not only on milk but also on related products such as Ghee (clarified butter).""We can't sustain our households in such inflationary times,"" he laments, urging the government to consider the plight of its citizens amidst these challenging circumstances.Faizan echoes similar sentiments, explaining that milk prices have escalated due to the rising costs faced by dairy farm owners for essentials like fodder, high rents, and water.""They have no choice but to pass on these expenses to consumers,"" he observes, urging the government to prioritise the welfare of the common people regardless of how they came into power.In Karachi, and across Pakistan, the struggle against inflation is not just about economic numbers but about the daily realities faced by the citizens.According to local media reports, the cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers, in collaboration with commissioner Karachi , settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.The decision came after an extensive consultation session that lasted several hours, where the commissioner met with stakeholders from the dairy farming, wholesaling, and retail sectors to discuss and finalise the price adjustment.Following thorough deliberations, all parties reached a consensus to implement the PKR 20 per litre hike, setting the new price of milk at PKR 220 per litre, which represents a significant increase compared to previous rates.","The cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.

Pakistan: Report highlights alarming trends of religious persecution against Christians,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-report-highlights-alarming-trends-of-religious-persecution-against-christians/articleshow/111082577.cms,"FAISALABAD: Human Rights Focus Pakistan ( HRFP ) has published a detailed fact-finding report uncovering disturbing incidents of religious persecution against Christians , particularly in Sargodha.HRFP is a group that raises the voices of minorities , women, and marginalized communities in Pakistan.This comes in the wake of a mob attack last month, where Nazir Masih's family was attacked on the accusations of blasphemy. The incident unfolded on May 25 in Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, where Nazir and other Christians were accused of blasphemy , sparking violent outrage among locals.After fighting for his life for eight days, Masih succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.The incident showed a troubling pattern in Pakistan where blasphemy accusations lead to violence against Christian communities.HRFP has expressed deep concern over the swift post-arrest bail granted to 52 attackers involved in the Sargodha incident.Despite the First Information Report (FIR) being filed against 44 identified and 400 unidentified suspects under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), progress in police investigations and court proceedings has been slow and inadequate.Compounding the community's apprehensions are threatening videos released by Islamic groups following the incident, exacerbating fears among the Christian community.Drawing parallels with the August 16, 2023, attack in Jaranwala, the HRFP report highlighted similar incidents of mob violence and property destruction against minorities. It underscores a recurring pattern involving provocation, and subsequent violence, often followed by the expedient release of perpetrators.HRFP has called for decisive action, citing intelligence reports linking extremist groups to multiple blasphemy allegations. The organization has also urged stringent measures to address these threats.The report also documented individual cases of violence and harassment against Christians across Pakistan.Farooq Masih's family in Jaranwala continues to face threats. Despite the FIR filed in February, the perpetrators are still at large.Similarly, the case of Saima Bibi, who suffered an assault in April, was downplayed as an 'accident' despite clear evidence of the attack.The plight of Rawal Masih, Romeo Masih, Waqas Masih, Rakhsana Bibi, Asifa Bibi, Shazia Zaulfiqar, and Ahsan Masih, who all were abducted and murdered, also underscores the ongoing oppression faced by PakistChristians.Naveed Walter, president of HRFP, emphasized the ""dire circumstances"" for minorities in Pakistan and urged increased protection and support for the Christian community. He called for an end to the misuse of blasphemy accusations and fabricated justifications for violence, stressing the need for systemic reforms to ensure minority safety.The HRFP report underscores the urgent situation faced by Christians in Pakistan and advocates for international and local intervention to uphold human rights and justice.","Human Rights Focus Pakistan (HRFP) has published a detailed fact-finding report uncovering disturbing incidents of religious persecution against Christians.

Massive protests threatening to send the government packing used to be held across the country.""Oh, how the times have changed. Days after dropping tax bombs that will further eviscerate the struggling masses, the authorities have announced that not only will they be taking more money out of the pay cheques of salaried individuals, they will also be squeezing whatever is left through significantly jacked-up electricity bills ,"" the editorial read.Citing news reports, it said that Nepra (National Electric Power Regulatory Authority) has hiked the uniform national tariff for the base price of electricity by almost 20 per cent to hand over electricity distribution companies almost half a trillion rupees more over the next fiscal year.The average base tariff for a single unit of electricity, which was PakistRupees (PKR) 27.78 in the outgoing year, will be PKR 35.50 from July 1.On top of this, various duties, taxes, and surcharges, as well as fuel and tariff adjustments, will be levied, forcing ordinary citizens to pay through their noses, not just for the fuel and operation and maintenance costs involved in generating electricity, but also for capacity charges that past governments have promised power generation companies, as well as the theft and transmission losses that distribution companies have shown a complete unwillingness to mitigate for many years.The average middle-class bill-paying customer will be forking out between PKR 65-72 for each unit of electricity they use in a month. Meanwhile, the federal government will present this as an 'achievement' in front of the IMF to ask for even more loans to keep a clearly failing system running for a few years longer, the editorial added.However, at the same time, the government has announced a PKR 10.69 per unit 'relief' for the industrial sector to 'make it competitive'. There can probably be no better example of crony capitalism.While the average salaried individual is finding it difficult to meet their ends on a shrinking real wage amidst month after month of unceasing, unchecked inflation, it is the big industries who get a break in the form of cheaper electricity so that they can pad up their profits while paying little back to the country in the form of taxes.""That the government is failing the people seems like an understatement. It is clearly least bothered by their plight. Its financial planning shows that it has no interest in going after those who dodge their dues; it just wants to take the easy route and enjoy the ride for however long it is in power,"" the Dawn editorial stated.","The average base tariff for a single unit of electricity, which was PakistRupees (PKR) 27.78 in the outgoing year, will be PKR 35.50 from July 1.

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching display of their persistent sorrow and discontent, families affected by enforced disappearances in the Balochistan region of Pakistan decided to abandon customary Eid festivities. Instead, they planned to stage a protest to voice their outrage against state agencies alleged to have perpetrated atrocities against the Baloch people.

Mama Qadir Baloch , a key member of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), declared the protest in a video statement, asserting, ""For the past 15 years, the atrocities committed by the Army and intelligence agencies of Pakistan have led the Baloch to boycott Eid celebrations. While Muslims across the world celebrate this occasion, the Baloch mourn.""

Coinciding with this, families of the missing persons organized a sit-in protest at Shaheed Fida Chowk on Eid day, following a similar demonstration in front of the DC office just days prior. The earlier protest concluded after the district administration provided assurances to the families.

The decision to protest on Eid emphasizes the profound impact of enforced disappearances on the Baloch community, who have been tirelessly seeking justice and answers regarding the fate of their loved ones, allegedly taken by state forces.

Nobody is stopping you from the politics but this negative and inimical political would not be allowed.""Earlier on June 14, former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan said that holding talks with politicians would be futile if decisions are dictated from elsewhere, Pakistan-based Dawn reported.PTI founder Imran Khan made these remarks while speaking to reporters after hearing in the £190 million corruption case. He said that PTI was not opposed to political dialogue.He alleged that political parties during previous talks with politicians, facilitated by former chief justice Umar Ata Bandial, said that the ""top man"" had decided not to participate in elections until his retirement, according to Dawn report.Imran Khan stressed that lawmakers always seek talks, citing PTI's dialogue with General Pervez Musharraf's representative during his tenure, instead of the government.","Pakistan government's spokesperson on legal affairs, barrister Aqeel Malik, said there was no precedent to PTI's country enmity. He warned that no anti-state agenda and narrative would be allowed by the state. He said the PTI had hired lobbyists and PR firms to promote anti-Pakistan campaigns abroad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111049632,imgsize-488053,width-400,resizemode-4/111049632.jpg"
Pakistan: Tomato prices soar to PKR 200 per kg ahead of Eid festivities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tomato-prices-soar-to-pkr-200-per-kg-ahead-of-eid-festivities/articleshow/111049153.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha, despite the district government setting the price cap at PKR 100 per kilogram, as per reports.This annual occurrence during Ramadan and Eid al-Adha typically goes unnoticed by authorities, despite their assurances to the contrary.In response to the situation, the Peshawar Deputy Commissioner has taken action by imposing a ban, under Section 144, on transporting tomatoes out of the district.With Eid al-Adha merely two days away, local retail markets have seen tomato prices double, aligning with earlier predictions that tomatoes, along with onions, would once again be sold at inflated prices during this festive period.Residents of the area have expressed frustration, noting that prices have escalated by Rs100 per kilogram in just one day. Many believe that the district administration's efforts will likely be limited to verbal instructions, as has been the case in previous instances, as per reports.During the budget presentation, one of the standout assertions was the government's commitment to maintaining inflation at 12 per cent in the upcoming fiscal year. On the surface, this goal appears supported by various planned initiatives aimed at curbing inflation rates.However, the implementation of aggressive tax measures, highlighted as key revenue strategies, seems paradoxical as they could potentially escalate prices instead of stabilising them.Regardless of the method used to gauge inflation, the stark reality is that any figure exceeding the previous fiscal year's average monthly inflation rate of 24.9 per cent will inevitably lead to increased consumer prices.Abid Suleri, Executive Director of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), argues that the government ought to have adjusted the minimum taxable income thresholds to factor in inflation when outlining personal income tax brackets. He criticises the current monthly exemption of PKR 50,000 as insufficient and warns that doubling taxes on those falling within the initial tax slab could reduce their disposable income, thereby exacerbating economic hardships.Moreover, heightened fuel expenses stemming from amplified levies and augmented GST rates in specific sectors are anticipated to drive inflation even higher, intensifying the overall cost of living. Suleri emphasises the absence of any mention regarding the taxation of agricultural income, which he believes could substantially broaden the tax base, Dawn reported.","The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha.

Imran should stay in jail for 5 years: Pakistan minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-should-stay-in-jail-for-5-years-pakistan-minister/articleshow/111043178.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan will have to be kept behind bars for five years to maintain the country’s “economic stability”, minister Ahsan Iqbal said Sunday. The five years coincide with the full term of the current govt led by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) that took office earlier this year.“People come to us and tell us that if Pakistan has to progress, then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,” Iqbal, the minister for planning and development as well as PML-N secretary-general, said.His comments came hours after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif pledged to rid the country of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying the next deal for a bailout package with the global lender would be the last in Pakistan’s history. IMF ties such loans to tough reform measures.According to Iqbal, if Imran came out of jail, “there would be sit-ins and fights again, which the country cannot afford”. “There is a voice of the people that Imran should remain in jail for five years,” Iqbal said. The minister added that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder was an “angry man” and it wasn’t known with whom he had a quarrel.The minister also made a subtle jab at the legal system by claiming Imran always relied on the “shoulder of the judiciary” for support during trying times. The allusion appeared to be to some court orders that went in favour of Imran in recent times.Asked about confrontation between the judiciary and the military establishment, Iqbal replied: “Both should think whether this is better for the country.”Iqbal recalled the past when politicians used to fight the military and vice versa. “Now we must cooperate for the benefit of the nation because fighting between institutions has put the country’s sovereignty at stake,” the minister said.","Ahsan Iqbal says Imran Khan will have to be kept behind bars for five years.
