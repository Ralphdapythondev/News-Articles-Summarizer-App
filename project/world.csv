September 11 Attacks: US reinstates death penalty for 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-reinstates-death-penalty-for-9/11-mastermind-khalid-sheikh-mohammed/articleshow/112236887.cms,"US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday nullified a plea agreement for the accused mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , reinstating the death penalty option for him and two other defendants, as per Associated Press.“In light of the significance of the decision, I have determined that the authority to make a decision on accepting the plea agreements is mine,” Austin wrote in an order released Friday night, thereby nullifying the agreements.The decision came just days after the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, announced it had reached plea deals with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his alleged accomplices, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Under the agreements, the three would have received life sentences .The letters sent to the families of nearly 3,000 victims stated that the plea agreement would result in life sentences for the accused, sparking outrage among some relatives. Many criticised the deal for eliminating the possibility of full trials and death penalties. Republicans swiftly blamed the Biden administration for the agreement, although the White House claimed it was unaware of the arrangement.Mohammed and the other defendants anticipated formally entering their pleas under the deal as early as next week. The US military commission, which has been handling the cases of five defendants involved in the September 11 attacks , has been bogged down in pre-trial hearings and preliminary court actions since 2008.","US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin nullified a plea agreement for the accused mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

Hamas: US boosts Israeli defence with warships and aircraft amid Iranian threats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/us-boosts-israeli-defence-with-warships-and-aircraft-amid-iranian-threats/articleshow/112236852.cms,"The United States is deploying additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to bolster Israel 's defences against potential threats from Iran and its proxies, the Pentagon announced.Tensions have escalated in the region following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and a key Hezbollah commander in Lebanon. In response, the US has placed missile defence forces on heightened alert and reaffirmed its ""ironclad"" commitment to Israel's security.Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, has vowed ""harsh punishment"" against Israel for Haniyeh's killing and declared three days of national mourning.Haniyeh, 62, was killed in Tehran on Wednesday. Both Iran and Hamas blame Israel for the attack, although Israel has not commented on the matter.The Pentagon's statement highlighted that the new deployments are intended to ""improve US force protection, increase support for the defence of Israel, and ensure the US is prepared to respond to various contingencies"", according to Reuters. This will include additional ballistic missile defence-capable cruisers and destroyers.John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator for the National security council, told CNN, “We’ve heard the Supreme Leader loud and clear that he intends to avenge this killing of a Hamas leader in Tehran, and that they want to conduct another attack on Israel. We can’t just assume that we are also potentially going to be victims of that kind of an attack, so we’ve got to make sure we’ve got the right resources and capabilities in the region.”In addition to some 80 land-based combat aircraft, the Pentagon has already deployed more than a dozen warships in the region. According to New York Times, the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, equipped with about 40 F/A-18 Super Hornet and F-35 attack planes, is now steaming near the Arabian Gulf, while the USS Wasp amphibious ready group, with 30 airplanes and helicopters as well as 4,500 Marines and sailors, is operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.The Pentagon's spokesperson, Sabrina Singh, remarked that the US does not believe escalation is inevitable.

He mentioned the recent ""crushing blows"" delivered to Israel's enemies, including the killing of Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah military commander, in Beirut.An Israeli delegation is set to travel to Cairo in the coming days to negotiate a Gaza ceasefire and a potential hostage release deal.This comes after Hamas sparked the current conflict with its October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in 1,200 deaths.

"Harris campaign says it raised $310m in July, more than double Trump's haul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harris-campaign-says-it-raised-310m-in-july-more-than-double-trumps-haul/articleshow/112232862.cms,"Kamala Harris 's campaign survived a brutal few weeks of fund-raising in July to bounce back so dramatically before the end of the month that she more than doubled the amount of money raised by Donald Trump , her campaign announced on Friday. The Harris campaign , which for the first 20 days of July was the Biden campaign, said it had raised $310 million during the month, including $200 million in just 7 days after Biden dropped out of the race.The Trump campaign and its own allies said Thursday that they had collected $139 million in July, an enormous sum but well short of Harris campaign's. The Harris campaign raised almost as much in July as the Biden campaign had raised in March, April, May and June combined. The surge in fund-raising has allowed Democrats, for the first time in months, to have a cash-on-hand advantage over Republicans. The Harris campaign said it now had $377 million in its war chest, in contrast to the $327 million that the Trump campaign has said it has.Neither campaign disclosed precisely how much of the money was raised or held by the campaigns themselves versus their allied party committees.Democrats' fund-raising was said to have plummeted in the first three weeks of the month, in the aftermath of Mr. Biden's disastrous debate, although precise figures were not known or released by the Biden campaign. But after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, the fund-raising spigot was opened wide. The $200 million that the Harris campaign said it had raised in the week after Mr. Biden ended his re-election bid was more than Mr. Biden's haul in the first three months of the year.The Trump campaign's own fund-raising was strong - and most likely would have far outstripped the Democrats' had the party not changed its standard-bearer. The $139 million raised in July amounted to one of the Trump team's strongest fund-raising months to date, just off the sum raised in May, when Mr. Trump's supporters responded to his felony conviction with $141 million in donations.","The Harris campaign said it had raised $310 million during the month, including $200 million in just 7 days after Biden dropped out of the race.

H1B Scam: What is H-1B lottery scam? Who is Indian-American Kandi Srinivasa Reddy allegedly behind this?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-h-1b-lottery-scam-who-is-indian-american-kandi-srinivasa-reddy-behind-this/articleshow/112205692.cms,"10 things you need to know about Reddy and H-1B scam

The scam is based on a process called 'multiple registrations'. If one individual submits many applications under different company names, chances of getting selected in the lottery that takes place every April increases. Srinivasa Reddy controlled several companies which had shared addresses -- like Cloud Big Data Technologies LLC, Machine Learning Technologies LLC through which he rigged the system and got hundreds of H-1B visas. Those who applied for H-1B visa through Reddy's companies were assured of the visa. The system created disadvantage for companies that follow rules. Reddy created what Bloomberg called ""the Amazon of staffing"". A Telugu NRI, Reddy studied masters in the US and worked as a tech consultant as he settled there. After Reddy got a worker a visa, it used to take 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the worker's pay -- which is around $15,000 or more each year. In the 2020 lottery, Reddy's Cloud Big Data submitted some 288 names. At the same time, other companies under Reddy submitted the same names. His companies in 2020 entered the lottery more than 3,000 times. Reddy told Bloomberg that he is just a registered agent for the companies and has no involvement in them but official documents say otherwise. In his election data, he said he is the owner of all the staffing companies. Reddy has a foundation to help farmers in his hometown in India. He also has his own television and online news operation. Reddy told TOI that there is nothing illegal in what he did. ""When multiple visa entries are filed, the choice is up to the employees to choose which company they would like. From 20924, changes were made, and passport numbers need to be entered. Now, if multiple entries are filled, it will reflect everywhere,"" he said.

A major H-1B lottery scam has surfaced in which multiple companies submitted multiple applications for the same individuals rigging the system of getting American visas. Kandi Srinivasa Reddy, an Indian-American businessman, has been named behind the fraud. Interestingly, Reddy was a candidate of the Congress, now the ruling party in Telangana in the recent local election -- and lost.An investigation by Bloomberg has unearthed the scam going on for some years and now many other firms are doing the same.","Scam is based on a process called'multiple registrations' If one individual submits many applications under different company names, chances of getting selected in the lottery increases.

Our planet is home to billions of people, each navigating the complexities of daily life through work, thought, play, and planning. In the midst of this chaos, some individuals manage to stay focused and disciplined, creating entirely new perspectives on life, the universe, and its meaning. Among these exceptional individuals are those who receive Nobel Prizes.The Nobel Prizes are far from ordinary awards.Established in 1895 by Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel, they honour significant contributions in six fields: literature, peace, economics, chemistry, physics, and medicine. Laureates receive a diploma, a gold medal, and a monetary award, which usually exceeds $1 million. While most prizes are awarded to individuals, the Peace Prize can also go to organisations. Occasionally, multiple recipients share a prize, but no more than three people can share one award.Since their inception in 1901, Nobel Prizes have been awarded 573 times to 900 recipients and organisations. Some have won more than once. Although prizes are generally awarded annually, there may be years when no prize is given if no achievement meets the high standards set.The significance of these awards lies not just in the accolades themselves but in the groundbreaking work they recognize. Nobel laureates are trailblazers who dedicate their lives to uncovering the mysteries of our existence, thereby advancing human knowledge and understanding. This article highlights ten such transformative figures who have made a profound impact on our world.Marie Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, made significant contributions to science with her research on radioactivity. Born in 1867, Curie and her husband Pierre, along with Henri Becquerel, were awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics for their studies on radiation. She later won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her discoveries of radium and polonium, becoming the first individual to receive Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. During World War I, Curie applied her knowledge to develop mobile X-ray units, enhancing battlefield medical care. Her groundbreaking work continues to impact medicine and technology, and her daughter, Irene Joliot-Curie, also won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935.Albert Einstein transformed our understanding of physics and the universe. Awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which showed that light consists of particles, Einstein’s work laid the foundation for technologies such as television and motion pictures. His theories of relativity further revolutionised physics, reshaping our perception of time, space, and the fundamental nature of reality. Einstein's contributions advanced both quantum theory and technological innovations.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times: in 1917, 1944, and 1963. Founded in Geneva in 1863, the ICRC is committed to providing aid to the wounded and sick in wartime, regardless of nationality. It plays a vital role in upholding the Geneva Conventions, documenting violations, and assisting prisoners of war and civilians. The ICRC’s efforts exemplify humanitarian principles amidst global conflicts.Alexander Fleming, Ernst Chain, and Howard Florey were honoured with the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of penicillin. Fleming discovered that mould (Penicillium notatum) produced an antibacterial substance, leading to the development of penicillin-based antibiotics. These antibiotics revolutionised medicine by effectively treating diseases such as tuberculosis, gangrene, and syphilis, thereby saving countless lives.Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her extensive charitable work. In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Catholic organisation dedicated to helping the poor, sick, and orphaned in India. The organisation expanded its mission to assist those affected by AIDS, war, and famine. Mother Teresa’s lifelong commitment to humanitarian work continues through her organisation, which operates in over 130 countries and supports thousands of people in need.Ivan Pavlov, awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology, is renowned for his research on conditioned reflexes. His experiments with dogs demonstrated that they could be conditioned to salivate in response to a stimulus, such as a bell, when it was repeatedly associated with feeding. Pavlov’s work had a profound impact on psychology and behaviourism, shaping our understanding of learned behaviours. His influential research also led to significant advancements in behavioural science.Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his leadership in the American civil rights movement. King advocated for racial equality and freedom through non-violent protests and activism, notably leading the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955. His extensive efforts to combat racial discrimination and his influential speeches made a lasting impact on American society. Despite his assassination in 1968, his legacy endures as a symbol of non-violent resistance and social justice.James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the molecular structure of DNA. Their discovery of the double-helix structure was crucial in understanding genetic information transmission within organisms. Their achievements were greatly aided by Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray photographs of DNA, though her contributions were overshadowed by her male counterparts. Franklin passed away before the Nobel committee could consider her for the prize, as posthumous awards are not allowed.Hermann Muller received the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on the effects of X-rays, demonstrating that they cause genetic mutations. His studies in the 1920s showed that X-rays caused genetic damage in Drosophila flies, leading him to conclude similar effects in humans. Although he struggled to publicise his findings, the atomic bombings of Japan during World War II highlighted the dangers of radiation, leading to the recognition of his work. Muller’s discoveries and his anti-nuclear stance provided a crucial counterbalance to technological advancements of the Atomic Age.Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 but1, but was unable to accept it until 2012 due to her detention by Myanmar’s oppressive military regime. Her advocacy for democracy and human rights led to her house arrest starting in 1990, which lasted intermittently until 2010. After her release, Suu Kyi led her party, the National League for Democracy, to a major electoral victory in 2015. Although she was barred from the presidency due to her sons' foreign citizenship, she served as state counsellor. However, her reputation has been marred by criticism over her handling of the Rohingya crisis, with some arguing that her power was limited by the military’s control.","The Nobel Prizes honour significant contributions in six fields: literature, peace, economics, chemistry, physics, and medicine.

""We know for a fact that it's not going to make up for what they lost.""Hawaii governor Josh Green said in a statement that seven defendants will pay the $4.037 billion to compensate those who have already brought claims for the August 8, 2023, fires that killed 102 people and destroyed the historic downtown area of Lahaina on Maui.Green said the proposed settlement is an agreement in principle. He said it was subject to the resolution of insurance companies' claims that have already been paid for property loss and other damages.Green said the settlement ""will help our people heal.""""My priority as governor was to expedite the agreement and to avoid protracted and painful lawsuits so as many resources as possible would go to those affected by the wildfires as quickly as possible,"" he said in a statement.He said it was unprecedented to settle lawsuits like this in only one year.""It will be good that our people don't have to wait to rebuild their lives as long as others have in many places that have suffered similar tragedies,"" Green said.Lowenthal noted there were ""extenuating circumstances"" that made lawyers worry the litigation would drag on for years.Some lawyers involved have expressed concern about reaching a settlement before possible bankruptcy of Hawaiian Electric Company .Now that a settlement has been reached, more work needs to be on next steps, like how to divvy up the amount.""This is the first step to allowing the Maui fire victims to get compensation sooner than later,"" Lowenthal said.More than 600 lawsuits have been filed over the deaths and destruction caused by the fires, which burned thousands of homes and displaced 12,000 people.

Dry, hot conditions posed similar threats across the fire-stricken West.Weather, fuels and terrain will pose challenges for the nearly 6,400 firefighters battling the Park Fire , which has spread over 624 square miles (1,616 square kilometers) since allegedly being started by arson in a park in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of the Sacramento Valley city of Chico.It is now California's fourth-largest wildfire on record.Suppression crews working on more than 200 miles (322 kilometers) of active fire front gained 24% containment by early Friday, Cal Fire said. Temperatures were expected to range up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius).The fire originated at low elevations where it quickly burned through thick grass and oaks, destroying at least 542 structures and damaging 50 since erupting July 24. As it has climbed higher, the vegetation has changed to a greater concentration of trees and brush, Cal Fire said.The fire's push northward has brought it toward the rugged lava rock landscape surrounding Lassen Volcanic National Park , which has been closed because of the threat.""Lava rocks make for hard and slow work for hand crews,"" Cal Fire said in situation report. ""Crews are being flown into access areas that have been hard to reach because of long drive times and steep, rugged terrain.""After days of benign weather, increasing winds and a surge of monsoonal moisture were expected to increase fire activity and bring a chance of thunderstorms Friday night into Saturday, saidRyan Walbrun , incident meteorologist with the National Weather Service.""The concern with thunderstorms is any gusty outflow winds that would push the fire itself or create some new fire ignitions within the vicinity of the Park Fire,"" Walbrun said.The collapse of thunderstorm clouds can blow wind in any and all directions, said Jonathan Pangburn, a fire behavior analyst with Cal Fire.""Even if there's not lightning per se, it is very much a safety-watch-out environment for our firefighters out there,"" Pangburn said.Walbrun said there was little prospect of beneficial rains from the storms and the forecast for next week calls for continued warming and drying.""As we look forward in time, we're really just entering the peak of fire season in California,"" he said.The Park Fire is among almost 100 large fires burning across the western US evacuation orders were in effect for 28 of the fires, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.Three wildfires burned in Colorado on Friday near heavily populated areas north and south of Denver, with some 30 structures damaged or destroyed, thousands of people under evacuation orders and human remains found in a destroyed house earlier this week.The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office disclosed Friday that a blaze threatening hundreds of homes near the Colorado city of Littleton was being investigated as arson. Karlyn Tilley, a spokesperson for Jefferson County Sheriff's Office at a news conference late Friday said the investigation is ongoing and they are using a dog specially trained to sniff out sources and causes of fires. Tilley said just because they suspect the fire was human-caused doesn't mean it was intentional. Firefighters were making good progress on the fire despite the steep, rocky terrain and blistering heat , and no houses had been burned, officials said.The cause and origin of a fatal blaze west of the town of Lyons was being probed by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, with specially trained fire investigators from the agency helping local authorities, agency spokesperson Crystal McCoy said. The area blackened by that fire remained relatively unchanged after it burned five houses.The largest of the Colorado fires, west of Loveland, grew to 13 square miles (33 square kilometers) after previously burning about two dozen homes and other structures. Its cause is under investigation.Cooler weather was expected across the region Friday with some scattered showers, before hot dry conditions return for the weekend.A new fire sparked Friday afternoon in Oregon's high desert, near the popular vacation destination of Bend, prompting evacuation notices, cutting power to thousands and slowing traffic along a highway. Fire officials said the blaze was showing a rapid rate of spread amid 100-degree F (38-degree C) heat and a warning from the National Weather Service about the potential for extreme fire behavior.Scientists say extreme wildfires are becoming more common and destructive in the US West and others parts of the world as climate change warms the planet and droughts become more severe.",The Park Fire is now California's fourth-largest wildfire on record.

Like, what do you mean? He said sometimes you know people have another spouse, other kids in a place like Alaska,"" Vance said.""Oh by the way, if I did I am not gonna admit it in front of my wife.

JD said his son at that time was talking continuously about Pikachu. ""I told him, son shut hell up for 30 seconds... I have the most important phone call of my life..."" Vance said adding that Trump overheard the conversation and asked him to put the phone of the speaker so that his son could hear the news.

"US justice department sues TikTok, accusing the company of violating a children's online privacy law",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-justice-department-sues-tiktok-accusing-the-company-of-violating-a-childrens-online-privacy-law/articleshow/112231747.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Justice Department sued TikTok on Friday, accusing the company of violating children's online privacy law and running afoul of a settlement it had reached with another federal agency. The complaint, filed together with the Federal Trade Commission in a California federal court, comes as the US and the prominent social media company are embroiled in yet another legal battle that will determine if – or how – TikTok will continue to operate in the country.The latest lawsuit focuses on allegations that TikTok, a trend-setting platform popular among young users, and its China-based parent company ByteDance violated a federal law that requires kid-oriented apps and websites to get parental consent before collecting personal information of children under 13.TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""This action is necessary to prevent the defendants, who are repeat offenders and operate on a massive scale, from collecting and using young children's private information without any parental consent or control,"" Brian M Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division, said in a statement.The US decided to file the lawsuit following an investigation by the FTC that looked into whether the companies were complying with a previous settlement involving TikTok's predecessor, Musical.ly.In 2019, the federal government sued Musical.ly, alleging it violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, by failing to notify parents about its collection and use of personal information for kids under 13.That same year, Musical.ly - acquired by ByteDance in 2017 and merged with TikTok - agreed to pay $5.7 million to resolve those allegations. The two companies were also subject to a court order requiring them to comply with COPPA, which the government says hasn't happened.In the complaint, the Justice Department and the FTC allege TikTok has knowingly allowed children to create accounts and retained their personal information without notifying their parents. This practice extends to accounts created in ""Kids Mode,"" a version of TikTok for children under 13, Justice said in a press release explaining the lawsuit.The two agencies allege the information collected included activities on the app and other identifiers used to build user profiles. They also accuse TikTok of sharing the data with other companies – such as Meta 's Facebook and an analytics company called AppsFlyer – to persuade ""Kids Mode"" users to be on the platform more, a practice TikTok called ""re-targeting less active users"".The complaint says TikTok also allowed children to create accounts without having to provide their age, or obtain parental approval, by using credentials from third-party services. It classified these as ""age unknown"" accounts, which the agencies say have grown into millions.After parents discovered some of their children's accounts and asked for them to be deleted, federal officials said their requests were not honoured. In a press release explaining the lawsuit, Justice said the alleged violations have resulted in millions of children under 13 using the regular TikTok app, allowing them to interact with adults and access adult content.In March, a person with the matter had told the AP the FTC's investigation was also looking into whether TikTok violated a portion of federal law that prohibits ""unfair and deceptive"" business practices by denying that individuals in China had access to US user data.Those allegations were not included in the complaint, which is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief.","TikTok accused of violating children's online privacy law and running afoul of a settlement it had reached with another federal agency.

"Everything, and nothing, is black and white in US elections",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/everything-and-nothing-is-black-and-white-in-us-elections/articleshow/112230264.cms,"WASHINGTON: For most blacks in America, Donald Trump 's claims of bettering their lives is a great white lie. But that hasn't stopped the former President from trying to pry away Black votes from Democrats with the latest tactic of questioning Kamala Harris ' black identity.Trump supporters are now bombarding social media with visuals purporting to show Kamala Harris' Indian heritage, which she has happily owned while embracing a primarily Black identity.Trump's MAGA flock though cannot seem to get their heads around the fact that people can be bi- or multi-racial.Hashtags such as #KamalaisIndian and #FakeBlack trended in the MAGAsphere, while Trump himself led the way on Thursday by posting a photo of Kamala dressed in a sari sitting with her maternal grandfather P.V.Gopalan and her grandmother Rajam, with a cheeky message that read: Thank you Kamala for the nice picture you sent from many years ago! Your warmth, friendship, and love of your Indian heritage are very much appreciated.”Also seen in the photo is Kamala's sister Maya Lakshmi Harris, who is married to Tony West, a former U.S. associate attorney general. Both Tony West, who is Black, and Maya Harris, who has been Kamala's campaign manager in the past, are part of her inner political circle.Since Trump himself said earlier this week that he has known Kamala only indirectly, it is unlikely she sent him the photo. But such claims are par for course considering current political playbook (on both sides) involves fudging, distorting, and conflating issues and data to score political points.So far, there are no indications that Trump has made any dent in the Democratic stranglehold on the Black vote after initial signs of weaning away some when Biden was the Democratic nominee. A CNN poll of 1,631 registered voters, conducted between July 22-23, found Kamala Harris has the support of 78 percent of Black voters, with Trump at 15 percent. A previous poll taken before Biden pulled out the race showed 23 percent ofBlack voters backing Trump.Those numbers seem generous considering Trump received only 8 percent of support from Black voters in 2020, according to Pew Research. One political commentator said the swift shift in support from Trump to Harris among Black voters ""tells you something about how fickle Trump's support was among these voters...Once they had a viable alternative that also happens to share their racial identity , they jumped ship from Trump almost instantly.""While Trump going below the 8 per cent black vote he got in 2020 is hard to imagine, even some of his supporters are aghast that he inadvertently tried it at the trainwreck of an interview earlier this week at a convention of black journalists. In one crash and burn moment during event, Trump said illegal immigrants are taking away ""black jobs,"" leading the host to ask “What’s exactly is a black job, sir?"" Trump: ""A black job is anybody that has a job! That's what it is.”On Friday, the multiple gold medal winning American gymnast Simone Biles appeared to take a swipe at Trump for the stumble, tweeting: ""I love my black job,"" with a photo of her winning a second gold medal at the Paris Olympic Games. Many Black Americans saw that as an insult.Black Americans are now projected to account for 14 per cent of eligible voters in the US, numbering 34.4 million voters, according to Pew Research Center projections. But not all eligible voters are actually registered to vote. In battleground states such as Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, they are expected to play a decisive role if Democrats can ensure a good turnout on Election Day.The MAGA Republican strategy centers on trying to suppress the black vote. According to New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice, lawmakers in 47 states have introduced more than 360 bills this year with provisions that restrict voting access. This includes steps such as curbing early voting and voting hours ( expansion of which will help blue-collar/shift workers, a predominantly Democratic constituency) and drive through voting (which helps special needs and differently-abled voters).",Trump supporters are bombarding social media with visuals purporting to show Kamala Harris' Indian heritage.

Pakistan to launch new messaging app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-launch-new-messaging-app/articleshow/112152439.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has said it would “soon” launch a new messaging application , “Beep Pakistan”, which will initially be used for communication by govt employees and later made available to the general public.The announcement came as Pakistani users have been facing problems with WhatsApp , especially when sending and receiving media files. Digital rights advocates suspect that the country’s testing and deployment of an internet firewall , intended to stifle dissent and crack down on free speech, may be the cause of the disruption.“Beep Pakistan”, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication which says it will be launched “soon” among other government departments.“The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and telecommunication.When the plan was announced last year, the then IT minister, Syed Aminul Haque, described it as Pakistan’s alternative to WhatsApp.Now, govt is distancing itself from that comparison. “Any comparison to WhatsApp is misplaced as there is no intention to compete with any third-party platform,” Khwaja said, adding the purpose of this app is to protect privacy and data.Haque, who currently heads the National Assembly’s standing committee on IT, said govt plans to roll out the application to all its employees within the next 45 days. “Then we will see the situation and launch it for the public too,” he said. Unlike WhatsApp, the former IT minister said, “Beep’s data centre will be in Pakistan, ensuring 100% safety and security. Just as China has WeChat and America has WhatsApp, Pakistan now has its own app.”Pakistani authorities have long been concerned about WhatsApp’s security features, particularly after reports in Dec 2019 that at least two dozen senior officials were targeted by Pegasus, a spyware developed by an Israeli cybersecurity firm. At that time the Pakistan govt instructed all officials to avoid sharing sensitive and confidential documents over WhatsApp.When asked if WhatsApp would be banned in the country following Beep Pakistan’s public launch, Khwaja, the IT minister, denied any plans to block WhatsApp in the country. Haque said he was not in favour of a ban. “But since Beep Pakistan is safe and secure we wish it to be used in Pakistan and those who want to use WhatsApp can continue to use it,” he said.","“Beep Pakistan’, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication. “The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and tele communication.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112152447,imgsize-401505,width-400,resizemode-4/112152447.jpg"

In the southeastern city of Chattogram, about 1,000 protesters held a procession after Friday prayers and set a roadside police guard post on fire, the report said.The student protests against the govt, which show no signs of dying down, started as a peaceful demonstration against a quota system allocating govt jobs but morphed into an unprecedented challenge and rebellion against Hasina.Dramatic videos of deadly clashes between police and protesters have shaken Bangladesh, as has the case of a six-year-old girl who was shot while playing on a rooftop while her father unsuccessfully tried to shield her from the firing.","Over 2,000 protesters gathered in parts of the capital, Dhaka, some shouting ""down with the autocrat"" and demanding justice for victims.

Bangladesh bans Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir under anti-terrorism law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-bans-jamaat-e-islami-and-its-student-wing-islami-chhatra-shibir-under-anti-terrorism-law/articleshow/112199637.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh on Thursday banned the Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir under anti-terrorism law following nationwide unrest over the quota system for government jobs , accusing the fundamentalist party of instigating protests that left at least 150 people dead. A notification issued by the public security division of the ministry of home affairs on Thursday confirmed the ban on the Islamist party, a key ally of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party.The ban on Jamaat, Chhatra Shibir and other associated groups came through an executive order under Section 18(1) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.""They (Jamaat-Shibir and BNP) just used the students as their shield,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on Thursday when Italian Ambassador Antonio Alessandro called on her at her official residence Ganabhaban here.A Home Ministry spokesman said that the government on August 1 banned all political activities of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and its various wings.The Bangladesh government on Tuesday decided to ban the Jamaat-e-Islami following the deadly nationwide students' protests over quotas in government jobs, accusing it of exploiting the movement that left at least 150 people dead.The development comes after a meeting of the ruling Awami League-led 14-party alliance passed a resolution earlier this week that Jamaat must be banned from politics.The decision to ban Jamaat comes over 50 years after its initial prohibition in 1972 for ""misusing religion for political purposes"".The Jamaat opposed Bangladesh's 1971 independence from Pakistan and sided with the Pakistani troops during the Liberation War.The party, founded in 1941 in undivided India, was first banned in 1972, the year Bangladesh framed its Constitution, which disbanded the functioning of any association or union or political party based on religion.But the subsequent military government led by General Ziaur Rahman revoked the ban by issuing a martial law proclamation, which allowed Jamaat to refloat and years later became a crucial partner of the then prime minister Khaleda Zia's 2001-2006 four-party alliance government. Two senior Jamaat leaders were inducted into her cabinet.Top leaders of the ruling Awami League, who have been in power for the past 15 years, have supported the ban on the Jamaat because of its role in the Liberation War.The Jamaat remained active despite losing its registration and being barred from elections due to court rulings.The party was allegedly involved in the recent violence surrounding the protests of the quota reform movement, which the government has cited as a reason for the ban, the report added.Violence gripped Bangladesh for almost the entire of July when the protests that had started in universities and colleges earlier this month, quickly turned into a widespread agitation against Prime Minister Hasina and her government's policies.The government called in the Army to quell protests against job quotas after the unrest left at least 150 dead and several thousand people, including policemen, wounded and major government installations damaged.Law Minister Anisul Huq said on Tuesday the ban is being imposed because of the recent violence associated with the quota reform movement and will be enacted through an executive order.He said the students who waged a movement demanding reforms in quota system said they had no link to the violence while evidence was there that Jamaat, its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir, BNP and a militant part of its students front Chhatra Dal carried out the mayhem.""From now on, the party cannot carry on its politics using its name,"" he told reporters on Thursday.Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said any violent reaction to the decision by the party would be dealt with severely as security agencies were ordered to enforce a stricter vigil.Bangladesh in 2009 initiated a process to try the key collaborators of Pakistani troops in 1971 on charges of crimes against humanity and six top leaders of Jamaat and one of BNP were hanged after their trial in two special war crimes tribunals while the apex Appellate Division of the Supreme Court upheld the judgments.","Bangladesh bans the Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir under anti-terrorism law.
