Kamala Harris: Roy Cooper withdraws from Kamala Harris' vice presidential consideration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/roy-cooper-withdraws-from-kamala-harris-vice-presidential-consideration/articleshow/112121655.cms,"North Carolina governor Roy Cooper has opted not to participate in vice president Kamala Harris ' search for a running mate in the US elections , citing concerns about his Republican lieutenant governor assuming control in his absence, according to sources familiar with the matter.67-year-old Cooper withdrew from the running mate search before vice president Kamala Harris began vetting potential candidates, sources revealed on Monday.The governor expressed that this was not the right time for North Carolina or for him to join a national ticket. ""This just wasn’t the right time for North Carolina and for me to potentially be on a national ticket,” Cooper said in a statement. “Harris has an outstanding list of people from which to choose, and we’ll all work to make sure she wins"", according to AP.Harris' search for a running mate is ongoing, with her team of lawyers and political aides reviewing a narrowing list of candidates. Initially, about a dozen contenders were under consideration, but the focus has now shifted to Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, who are seen as front-runners.Cooper, the former chairman of the Democratic governors association, has a longstanding relationship with Harris dating back to their time as state attorneys general. His potential selection was viewed as advantageous for shifting North Carolina — a critical state for Democrats — into Harris' favour.Under North Carolina's state constitution, lieutenant governor Mark Robinson , a Republican and the GOP nominee to replace the term-limited Cooper, would assume the governor's powers when Cooper travels out of state. Cooper's concerns about Robinson's potential actions in his absence played a significant role in his decision to withdraw. Robinson is known for his ardent social conservative views, including calling abortion ""child sacrifice"" and making derogatory remarks about LGBTQ+ individuals.In the weeks leading up to President Joe Biden 's withdrawal from the race, Cooper appeared alongside Harris at campaign events in Greensboro and Fayetteville. He has remained discreet about the vetting process, recently stating, “I trust her to make the right decision.”The New York Times first reported Cooper's withdrawal, but did not detail the timing or rationale. The Harris campaign has declined to comment on the matter.","67-year-old Cooper withdrew from the running mate search before vice president Kamala Harris began vetting potential candidates.

'White Dudes for Harris': Actor Jeff Bridges channels 'The Dude' from 'Big Lebowski' in Zoom gathering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-dudes-for-harris-actor-jeff-bridges-channels-the-dude-from-big-lebowski-in-zoom-gathering/articleshow/112122367.cms,"Actor Jeff Bridges participated in a virtual fundraising event called ' White Dudes for Harris ,' aimed at white men supporting Kamala Harris in presidential bid.The call, which took place on Monday night, saw over 123,000 participants and raised more than $3.3 million. This event is part of a series of Zoom meetings designed to raise funds and rally support for vice president Harris.President Biden had previously announced he was leaving the presidential race and endorsing Harris.The event featured appearances from actors Mark Ruffalo, Mark Hamill, and Bradley Whitford. Democratic officials such as transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Illinois governor JB Pritzker also participated. The virtual gatherings have been organised by supporters' backgrounds, including Black women, Hispanic women, Black men, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and the LGBTQ+ community.Jeff Bridges praised Harris and humorously channeled his role as 'The Dude' from the 1998 film 'The Big Lebowski,' saying, ""As the Dude might say, 'That's just my opinion, man.'""Organisers noted that the call was another example of how Democrats, including Biden, have historically relied on diverse voter groups to build coalitions of support. Biden's 2020 victory, for example, relied on organised labor and conservative suburban women disillusioned with Donald Trump.'White dudes' Zoom events have become a part of this trend, also featuring comments from participants like Bradley Whitford, who dryly remarked on the event's numerous white male speakers as 'a rainbow of beige.' JB Pritzker joked about his initial hesitation to attend an event called 'White Dudes for' something, while Pete Buttigieg expressed his honor in sharing a virtual platform with Jeff Bridges and emphasised the importance of men's freedom in a country with access to abortion rights.""Men are also more free in a country where we have a president who stands up for things like access to abortion rights.""Gov. Walz pointed out that Trump supporters aren't inherently bad people and urged: ""Don't ever shy away from our progressive values. One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness.""Ross Morales Rocketto, the progressive operative who founded the 'dudes' group, highlighted that not all white men are supporters of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement. ""We know that the silent majority of white men aren't MAGA supporters,"" he said.Although Harris' team has not organised these Zoom calls, they welcome the support and fundraising efforts. ""Winning campaigns are powered by real, organic support,"" said Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler.Harris' calls often feature celebrities who have previously supported Biden's campaign. For example, the political networking group 'Win With Black Women' saw its participants swell to over 44,000 on the same night that Biden dropped out. This event featured celebratory speeches from activists, business leaders, and members of Congress.Following that, a 'Win With Black Men' virtual fundraising event attracted more than 53,000 attendees, including Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida and Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock. A Zoom event for 'White Women for Harris' also drew over 164,000 participants and featured personalities such as singer Pink, soccer star Megan Rapinoe, and actor Connie Britton.The efforts to organize supporters by their distinct backgrounds are not unique to Harris' campaign. Trump's campaign has also organised events aimed at different groups, such as Black voters in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, as well as 'Latino Americans for Trump.'Some Republicans have criticised Harris for her 'diversity, equality and inclusion politics,' arguing that her political career has been aided by Democratic efforts to promote diversity. However, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP leaders have discouraged lines of criticism they consider racist and sexist, urging party members to focus their criticisms on her political record.","The call, which took place on Monday night, saw over 123,000 participants and raised more than $3.3 million.

"Israel-Lebanon tensions high after Golan hit, US urges calm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-lebanon-tensions-high-after-golan-hit-us-urges-calm/articleshow/112122690.cms,"Tensions were running high on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border Monday in anticipation of an escalation in hostilities, after Israel's security cabinet authorised its leaders to decide on the nature and timing of a military response to a deadly rocket attack from Lebanon over the weekend. PM Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Gallant got the authorisation from the cabinet members in a meeting Sunday night.Visiting the scene of the strike Monday, Netanyahu said of the victims: ""These children are our children, the children of all of us.Israel will not and cannot let this pass and carry on as usual. Our response is coming, and it will be severe."" Israeli politicians have been vocal about the need for a significant military blow in retaliation for the rocket strike, which killed 12 children and teenagers Saturday in the Druse Arab village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. The Iran-backed militia group Hezbollah , which has been sending rockets into Israel for months, denied responsibility for the attack, but Israel and the US have blamed the group.Israeli analysts said Hezbollah was most likely aiming at a nearby army base on Mount Hermon and did not intentionally target the village. But the group's use of inaccurate rockets in an area dotted with civilian communities led to the kind of unintended consequence that risks sparking an all-out war, they said.Analysts said they expect a more powerful Israeli retaliation for Saturday's rocket attack on Majdal Shams, but that Netanyahu was likely to calibrate the response so as not to prompt escalation into something closer to all-out war.Since the strike on Majdal Shams on Saturday, there have been continued exchanges across the border, but they have seemed to fall within the bounds of the routine tit-for-tat of the past few months. The Israeli military said overnight that its aerial defense systems successfully intercepted an unmanned aircraft that crossed from Lebanon into northwestern Israel. On Monday morning, a drone strike in southern Lebanon killed two people and injured three others, including a child, Lebanon's state-run news agency said.US secretary of state Antony Blinken, in a call from Tokyo Monday with Israeli Prez Isaac Herzog, ""reaffirmed the US' ironclad commitment to Israel's security against threats from Iranian-backed terrorist organisations, including Hezbollah."" But he also emphasised ""the importance of preventing escalation of the conflict and discussed efforts to reach a diplomatic solution"".","Israel's security cabinet authorised its leaders to decide on the nature and timing of a military response to a deadly rocket attack from Lebanon over the weekend.

How a flaming car led to one of biggest fires in California's history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-a-flaming-car-led-to-one-of-biggest-fires-in-californias-history/articleshow/112122589.cms,"California had all the ingredients for a terrible fire year. All it needed was a spark, or — authorities say — a single burning car.The Park Fire raging out of control in the Sierra Nevada foothills may have started with an act of arson, after a man now in jail allegedly pushed a flaming car into a ravine. But it was able to outrun fire crews and explode in size — becoming California’s sixth-biggest fire on record — due to conditions that had been building for years.And those conditions could bode ill for the coming months.Two wet winters in a row covered the state in newly-grown grass and brush. Then summer arrived with dry air and back-to-back heat waves, turning vegetation to fuel. “That made prime conditions for fire,” said Brent Pascua, a battalion chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. “The fuel is still there, and the weather is too.”Firefighters caught a brief break Monday, with high temperatures near the Park Fire expected in the low 90s. But triple digits are forecast to return by Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. More ominously, much of the US West, including a large part of California's Sierra Nevada mountains, is forecast to be excessively hot from August 6 to August 8, according to the US Climate Prediction Center.The combination of high heat and dry vegetation is not confined to California. Oregon has seen its share of flames, and last week a fast-moving blaze ripped through Jasper, Alberta, in one of Canada’s most pristine national parks, destroying a large part of the town. Smoke from all the fires has risen high into the atmosphere and spread across the continent. Outside Florida and the Gulf of Mexico coast, few spots in the US are smoke-free right now, said Andrew Orrison, a forecaster at the US Weather Prediction Center.As it often does this time of year, high pressure has built up across the West, he said, raising temperatures and drying out the landscape. Although the annual Southwest monsoon has spun up thunderstorms, some have produced little rain, even as lightning strikes the ground — sparking more fires.So far, flames have scorched more than 726,000 acres across California this year, according to Cal Fire, well above the five-year average of 123,388 acres by this point of the summer. In a sense, the state is feeling the backlash from a relatively quiet fire season last year. Record mountain snows blanketed the higher elevations well into the summer of 2023, and relatively mild temperatures slowed the drying of grasses. Much of what grew last year is still there, waiting to burn.“There is all that biomass – fine, dry fuel – just ready to catch fire,” said Denise Knapp, conservation and research director at the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden.The Park Fire began July 24 and has now burned more than 370,000 acres, according to Cal Fire. Authorities arrested Ronnie Dean Stout II, 42, of Chico, California, after witnesses saw a man push a burning car down a 60-foot embankment, with flames spreading into the grass. The area that is now burning, including parts of Lassen National Forest, is full of steep slopes and canyons, allowing the fire to spread quickly. The blaze was only 12% contained Monday.The fire followed weeks of heat that sucked moisture from grasses and shrubs, with little relief even at night. “This 1-2 punch — i.e. the extra fuel for the fire from two years of robust growing conditions immediately followed by one of the hottest (if not the hottest) summer period on record — led to vegetation that approached or even exceeded record dryness levels, especially at lower elevations where the fire started,’’ said Daniel Swain, a climatologist at the University of California Los Angeles, in an email.Decades ago, California’s fire season was thought to be tied to the arrival of Santa Ana and Sundowner winds in late summer or early fall. But in recent years, fires have broken out in months once thought safe, particularly during droughts. Many counties across northern and eastern California have become abnormally dry in recent weeks, a stage just below drought status, according to the US Drought Monitor. As of July 23, a little more than 21% of the state was abnormally dry or in drought. Wildfires will remain a threat until the rains return.“In California it is a fire year,” Pascua said. “We have to come to terms with that.”","Two wet winters in a row covered the state in newly-grown grass and brush.

North Korea seek medicines from abroad for Kim Jong Un's health problems: Seoul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-seeks-medicines-for-kim-jong-uns-health-problems-seoul/articleshow/112117812.cms,"North Korean officials are seeking new medicines from abroad to treat their leader of North Korea Kim Jong Un who has reportedly regained weight and is now facing health issues related to obesity . Kim jong is reportedly suffering with conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, according to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS).At 40 years old, Kim has a family history of heart problems, with both his father and grandfather dying from heart-related issues. Known for his heavy drinking and smoking habits, Kim is approximately 170 centimeters (5 feet, 8 inches) tall and previously weighed 140 kilograms (308 pounds). Despite appearing to have lost a significant amount of weight in 2021, possibly due to dietary changes, recent state media footage suggests he has regained the lost weight, reported AP.Lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun stated that the NIS estimates Kim's current weight to be around 140 kilograms (308 pounds), placing him in a high-risk group for heart disease. ""Kim has shown symptoms of high blood pressure and diabetes since his early 30s,"" Lee said. Lawmaker Park Sunwon added that the NIS believes Kim's obesity is linked to his drinking, smoking, and stress.The NIS also informed lawmakers that North Korean officials have been attempting to procure new medicines from abroad to address Kim's suspected high blood pressure and diabetes.Kim's health is a topic of significant interest beyond North Korea's borders, as he has not formally named a successor, raising concerns about who would take charge of the country's growing nuclear arsenal in the event of his incapacitation.During Monday's briefing, the NIS reiterated its assessment that Kim's preteen daughter, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae, appears to be bolstering her status as her father's heir apparent. However, the NIS noted that it cannot entirely rule out the possibility that one of her siblings could replace her as the successor, given that she has not been officially designated as her father's successor.Speculation about Kim Ju Ae, who is about 10 years old, began to spread when she started accompanying her father to high-profile public events in late 2022. State media have referred to her as Kim Jong Un's ""most beloved"" or ""respected"" child and have released numerous photos and footage showcasing her increasing political prominence and her close relationship with her father. The NIS reported to lawmakers that at least 60% of Kim Ju Ae's public appearances have involved being present at military events with her father.","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly regained weight and is now facing health issues related to obesity.

"‘1984 Sikh genocide’ motion dropped in UK council, fury follows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/1984-sikh-genocide-motion-dropped-in-uk-council-fury-follows/articleshow/112089117.cms,"LONDON: Protests and pandemonium erupted in UK’s Slough borough council last week after a motion saying it “recognises and commemorates the 40th anniversary of the 1984 Sikh genocide and condemns recent killings of Sikh activists in foreign countries” was withdrawn at the last minute.The withdrawal followed a challenge to the motion’s inclusion by the council leader, Dexter Smith of the Conservative party.The motion was proposed by councillor Sabia Akram , who quit PM Keir Starmer’s Labour party this June over issues related to the war in Gaza and now sits as an Independent.The ruckus unfolded after Smith told a council meeting on July 25 that he had received a petition from 57 Sikh residents in Slough saying the motion undermined community cohesion, was divisive, could create ill-feelings towards Sikhs, and they strongly refuted some of its text.The motion called on Smith to request the UK govt to “seek justice for victims of the 1984 Sikh genocide”, to hold accountable those responsible, and condemn all human rights violations and abuses against Sikhs and minorities in India and in J&K.The motion also called on Smith to write to Slough MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi to “convey the demand of Slough Sikhs to support a referendum on independence in Punjab” and write to UK foreign secretary advocating release of imprisoned British Sikh Jagtar Singh Johal. Another key demand in the motion was to write to PM Starmer to convey “deep concerns at UK intelligence reports of Indian govt agencies targeting Sikh activists in Slough”.Smith said he accepted that to some, it sounded like a pro-Sikh motion and to others, as “anti-Sikh, anti-Indian or even anti-Indian govt”. “It offers sympathy to victims of inter-communal violence in India in 1984, but also appears to ascribe motives and blame for actions that followed both,” Smith said.Proposer Akram defended her wording of the motion.“People in this chamber are safe to call the 1984 atrocities an act of genocide. It was also an accepted definition by the Indian PM (Narendra) Modi, no less. The fact that security agencies have contacted members of two families in Slough who are British citizens to say their lives are at risk demonstrates the real threat to our sovereignty as a country,” Akram said.Akram referred to the assassination of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada last year and the death of activist Avtar Singh Khanda in “mysterious circumstances” to contend that the issue of anti-Sikh transnational repression was “very real”.Nineteen councillors voted in favour of the challenge, eight against, two abstained and eight did not vote. This meant the challenge was upheld and the motion was treated as withdrawn.The fury followed soon after in the council’s public gallery and the meeting had to be adjourned whilst it was cleared of angry Sikhs. They shouted “never forget 1984 Sikh genocide”, “Shame on you” and accused the council of being supporters of genocide. Another screamed: “There are Sikhs in Slough under threat by the Indian govt. If they are murdered, you are all at fault.”The Sikh Federation UK said: “We wrote to the council leader in advance of the meeting and said preventing the motion from being debated was a direct attack on democratic British values and it would lead to community disharmony.”",The motion was proposed by councillor Sabia Akram who quit PM Keir Starmer’s Labour party this June over issues related to the war in Gaza.

This career shift brought her significant income and numerous gifts from her fans.Despite her family's concerns about the impact of her profession on her health, Pan continued to push herself to extreme limits. She rented a separate studio for her streaming sessions to ensure a more professional setup. However, her dedication came at a high cost. She often consumed up to 10 kg of food in a single session and spent up to 10 hours a day eating. These extreme eating habits led to multiple hospitalisations, including one due to gastric bleeding.At the time of her death, Pan weighed 300 kg. Although the official cause of death was not disclosed, reports indicate that her stomach was filled with undigested food, and the lower part was deformed. An autopsy confirmed the severe damage caused by her excessive eating.According to Creaders.net, her parents were concerned about her dangerous eating habits, urging her to stop.

Pan, however, reassured them, claiming she could ""bear the risk.""The incident has sparked a wave of health concerns on social media.

North Korea 's Kim Jong Un has regained weight and is suffering from obesity-related health problems including high blood pressure and diabetes, and his officials are looking for new medicines abroad to treat them, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers on Monday. The 40-year-old, known for heavy drinking and smoking, comes from a family with a history of heart problems.Observers said Kim appeared to have lost a large amount of weight in 2021, likely from changing his diet. But recent footage shows he has regained the weight. Kim's health is in focus since he hasn't formally anointed a successor. The National Intelligence Service, in its briefing, maintained its assessment that Kim's preteen daughter , reportedly named Kim Ju Ae, appears to be bolstering her status as her father's likely heir apparent.Polish divers have found a 19th-century shipwreck off the coast of Sweden laden with bottles of champagne, a ""very exclusive"" cargo they say may have been destined for the tsar of Russia before the vessel sank. They discovered the wreck, which also contains porcelain and bottles of mineral water, around 60m below the surface of Baltic Sea, but say they would need permission from Swedish authorities to bring the cargo to shore. If the divers get permission to remove some bottles, they will send them to the manufacturer to ascertain how much they may be worth and whether they are still drinkable.","'Bubbly' cargo found in 19th-century shipwreck off the coast of Sweden.

She was 93. O'Brien died Saturday after a long illness, said her publisher Faber and literary agency PFD.She is survived by her sons, Marcus and Carlos.O'Brien published over 20 books, most novels and story collections, and would know fully what she called the ""extremities of joy and sorrow, love, crossed love and unrequited love, success and failure, fame and slaughter."" Few so concretely and poetically challenged Ireland's religious, sexual and gender boundaries. Few wrote so fiercely, so sensually about loneliness, rebellion, desire and persecution.She befriended movie stars and heads of states while also writing sympathetically about Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and meeting with farm workers in Nigeria who feared abduction by Boko Haram.O'Brien was an unknown about to turn 30, living with her husband and two children outside of London, when 'The Country Girls' made her Ireland's most notorious exile since James Joyce. Written in three weeks and published in 1960 for an advance of roughly $75, 'The Country Girls' follows the lives of two young women: Caithleen (Kate) Brady and Bridget (Baba) Brennan journey from a rural convent to the risks and adventures of Dublin. Admirers were as caught up in their defiance and awakening as would-be censors were enraged by passages as ""He opened his braces and let his trousers slip down around the ankles"" and ""He patted my knees with his other hand. I was excited and warm and violent."" Her novel was praised in London and New York while in Ireland it was labeled ""filth"" and burned publicly. Detractors included O'Brien's parents and husband, author Ernest Gebler, from whom she was already estranged.She continued the stories of Kate and Baba in 'The Lonely Girl' and 'Girls in Their Married Bliss' and by mid- 1960s was single and enjoying the prime of ""Swinging London"": whether socialising with Princess Margaret and Marianne Faithfull, or having a fling with actor Robert Mitchum. Paul McCartney once escorted her home, picked up her son's guitar and improvised a song with lines on O'Brien: ""She'll have you sighing/She'll have you crying/Hey/She'll blow your mind away.""O'Brien is among the most notable authors never to win the Nobel or the Booker Prize.

Pakistan seeks reprofiling of over $27 billion debt with friendly nations: Finance minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-seeks-reprofiling-of-over-27-billion-debt-with-friendly-nations-finance-minister/articleshow/112099105.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF, according to a media report on Monday. The Washington-based International Monetary Fund last month announced that it signed a staff-level agreement with Pakistan to provide a $7 billion loan which would be disbursed for 37 months.However, it attached stringent conditions with it, requiring Pakistan prior action before the fund's board accords final approval for the loan.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb after returning from Beijing told the media on Sunday that talks have been going on with China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE for a re-profiling of $27 billion.Aurangzeb said Pakistan had already asked the friendly bilateral trio of lenders to roll over its more than $12 billion annual debt portfolio by three to five years to secure the IMF board's approval, which is expected next month.This is on top of Islamabad's request to Beijing to convert imported coal-based projects to local coal and re-profile more than $15 billion in energy sector liabilities to create fiscal space amid difficulties in timely repayments.Pakistan has a peculiar financial arrangement with these three countries in the shape of commercial loans and SAFE deposits that are rolled over every year and form a major part of the IMF programme in terms of external financing needs.Pakistan has now requested the maturity period of these loans - $5 billion from China, $4 billion from Saudi Arabia, and $3 billion from the UAE - to be extended to at least three years, offering greater predictability under the IMF programme.Aurangzeb said the Chinese side acknowledged Pakistan's foreign exchange difficulties and wanted to help in new business ventures and the re-profiling of energy sector payments besides playing its role in supporting Pakistan's case at the IMF board as one of the major stakeholders.He said the process of debt and equity rescheduling had been started and would now go to the working groups with relevant financial institutions and sponsors of Chinese projects for which Pakistan hired local Chinese consultants.""Between now and the IMF board meeting (on the 37-month bailout package), we have to ensure confirmation of external financing"" from friendly bilateral partners, the minister said.However, he explained that the Chinese energy sector debt reprofiling had nothing to do with the IMF programme as other prior actions had been completed and structural benchmarks were under implementation.Aurangzeb said he was in contact with the Chinese, Saudi and UAE finance ministers for an extension in debt rollover for three years and they had assured their support that would place Pakistan in a very comfortable position in terms of external financing gap.""I can assure you we are at a very good place on external financing for the next three years, including year one, year two and year three,"" he said.He said the IMF had worked out a financing needs assessment for three years that also included its own $7 billion Extended Fund Facility. After rollovers from friendly countries, the remaining external financing gap would become very manageable, he said.Responding to a question, the minister said Pakistan was not seeking any incremental financing from friendly countries. ""The only incremental thing is an extension in the maturity period for three years instead of yearly rollovers,"" he said.Aurangzeb said that the issue of energy sector repayments was initially taken up by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Beijing and followed it up with formal letters to Prime Minister Li Keqiang.As part of the process, Aurangzeb, along with Power Minister Awais Leghari, held meetings with Chinese finance and energy ministers and the governor of the Chinese central bank to understand the context of Pakistan's ability to pay, economic stability and relief in energy tariffs.He said the two sides discussed conversions of Chinese power projects to local coal and how to take their technical, logistical and financial parameters forward.Secondly, financial re-profiling would also need to be discussed with banks and project sponsors one by one. ""They have recognised this and the process would now move forward on that basis,"" Aurangzeb said.He said the re-profiling of CPEC debt was also discussed with the governor of the Chinese central bank and ""we would need to go project by project given the CPEC structure"".""Very positive discussions have taken place from my perspective,"" he said, adding the debt of Chinese independent power producers (IPPs) was manageable as their legal payments were being made, but the issue pertained to return on equity to project sponsors mainly because of foreign exchange which required to be rescheduled to create fiscal space.The minister, however, clarified that Pakistan was seeking the re-profiling of payments and not ""haircuts"" - debt waiver or interest rate cuts.",Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF.

Reacting to the viral news, Imran Khan's aide Sayed Z Bukhari said the decision has not been taken whether Imran Khan would contest but there are consultations going on.""No decision has been made about Imran Khan running for Chancellor of Oxford University , however we have a series of consultations regarding it today and will be decided in the next 24-48hrs,"" Bukhari posted.According to the UK Telegraph, the elections for the chancellor post will be held online for the first time. Generally, the post goes to graduates of the university, mostly politicians.Imran Khan graduated from Oxford in 1972, studied economics and politics at Keble College and also captained the cricket team of the university. In 2005, Imran Khan became the chancellor of Bradford University and hence if he becomes the Oxford chancellor, it will not be his first such role.Reports said Imran Khan's team cited public demand that he should contest but it will be a tough one as Boris Johnson, Tony Blair -- the former UK PMs -- are also in the race.The news came as Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf faces crisis in the country with the present government planning to ban the party. Information minister Attaullah Tarar recently announced the decision that the government will ban the party after seeing all available evidence in connection with last year's protests.71-year-old Imran Khan has been in the Adiala Jail for almost a year for his conviction in four cases -- two Toshakhana references, the cipher case, and the Iddat case, in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.",Imran Khan is reportedly planning to apply for the position of the chancellor at Oxford University.

Ahmadiyya Persecution Pakistan: UN experts urge halt to violence against Ahmadis in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/un-experts-urge-halt-to-violence-against-ahmadis-in-pakistan/articleshow/112012460.cms,"GENEVA: United Nations experts on Thursday voiced grave concern at reports of surging discrimination and violence against Pakistan's Ahmadi minority community, including extrajudicial killings and attacks on places of worship.The Ahmadiyya sect, considered heretics by fundamentalist groups, has been persecuted for decades in Pakistan but threats and intimidation have risen in recent years.""We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan,"" said the eight independent experts, including the special rapporteurs on extrajudicial executions, on freedom of expression and freedom of religion.""Urgent measures are necessary to respond to these violent attacks and the broader atmosphere of hatred and discrimination which feeds it,"" they said in a statement.The experts, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council but who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations, highlighted a number of specific incidents over recent months.Those included the extrajudicial killing of two Ahmadis in Saad Ullah Pur on July 8 and the killing on March 4 of the president of the Ahmadiyya community in Bahawalpur district.They also noted reports of an alarming number of attacks on Ahmadi places of worshipand cemeteries since the beginning of the year, including some that had led to the serious injury of worshippers.The statement also highlighted a number of alleged arbitrary arrests of Ahmadi worshippers over religious holiday periods ""to obstruct their participation in their religious practices"".Ahmadis consider themselves Muslims, and their faith is identical to mainstream Islam in almost every way.But their belief that the movement's founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was the ""mahdi"" or messiah has marked them as blasphemous unbelievers, particularly in Pakistan. There are around 500,000 Amadis in Pakistan according to their community leadership.The constitution has branded them non-Muslims since 1974, and a 1984 law forbids them from claiming their faith as Islamic or openly practising Islamic rituals.""Ahmadis' right to peacefully manifest their beliefs must be respected,"" the experts insisted, warning that ""judicial harassment serves to normalise violence against Ahmadis by non-State actors"".They welcomed Pakistan National Assembly 's adoption last month of a resolution urging federal and provincial governments to ensure the safety and security of all Pakistani citizens including religious minorities.But, they cautioned, ""such good-faith efforts to counter discriminatory discourse will be ineffective unless they address its structural drivers, (including) blasphemy laws and discriminatory legal provisions "".","The Ahmadiyya sect has been persecuted for decades in Pakistan.
