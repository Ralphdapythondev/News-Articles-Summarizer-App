US presidential debate dispute: Trump vs Harris — Who’s really dodging the stage?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-debate-dispute-trump-vs-harris-whos-really-dodging-the-stage/articleshow/112579782.cms,"The US presidential debate schedule appeared finalized on Thursday. Kamala Harris 's campaign claimed that Donald Trump's team agreed to three debates: two presidential and one vice presidential. “The debate about debates is over,” said Michael Tyler, Harris’s communications director.However, the Trump campaign disputes this. They argue that only one debate between the presidential candidates, scheduled for September 10 on ABC News, is confirmed.Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, countered, “President Trump will participate in debates with Fox News, ABC, and NBC/Telemundo.Senator Vance will debate Tim Walz twice—on September 18 with CNN and October 1 with CBS. If Harris and Walz don't show, it will show their weakness,” reported the News Republic.Trump had previously been uncertain about debating Harris but eventually proposed three debates. Harris accepted the ABC and CBS invitations but declined the Fox News debate.Complicating matters, Vance suggested holding two vice presidential debates, with one overlapping with Trump’s hush-money trial sentencing.The Trump campaign suggests that Democrats are trying to avoid committing to the October debate until they see Harris’s performance in September. Leavitt hinted that Trump might use Harris’s connection to ABC executive Dana Walden as a reason to skip the September debate.With both sides accusing each other of dodging debates, the situation remains uncertain, and the final debate schedule is still up in the air.","Kamala Harris's campaign claimed that Donald Trump's team agreed to three debates: two presidential and one vice presidential.

Mob violence in Bangladesh draws public ire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/mob-violence-in-bangladesh-draws-public-ire/articleshow/112580123.cms,"DHAKA: Incidents of assaulting people physically, stripping people, and widespread obstructions created by the mobs in front of what was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's residence in Dhaka have drawn widespread criticism from the Bangladesh public.A number of videos, including that of a senior citizen being stripped by the mob, were widely circulated online.Sarjis Alam, one of the key organisers of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, said Friday that those who carried out such acts in different parts of Dhaka had violated human rights. ""In the viral video I saw a man of my father's age being held by the ear, a man of my father's age being undressed, many people's phones being checked, a woman of my mother's age being assaulted, and journalists attacked,"" he said, describing those incidents as illegal.One Facebook user, indicating the video of a senior citizen being stripped, wrote, ""I am ashamed to be born in this country.""

The number of reported killings in revenge attacks since that time still remains to be determined.According to available public reports by the media and the protest movement itself, between July 16 and Aug 11 more than 600 people were killed.Of these, nearly 400 deaths were reported from July 16 to Aug 4, the UN rights body said in its report ""Preliminary Analysis of Recent Protests and Unrest in Bangladesh "". A number of deaths were reported between Aug 7 and 11, including those who died while undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in the violence. Those killed include protesters, bystanders, journalists covering the events, and a number of security force personnel.The reported death toll is likely an underestimate as information collection has been hindered by restrictions on movement due to curfews and the internet shutdown. Also, hospitals were reportedly prevented by state authorities from providing details of those killed and injured.","The UN human rights office has said around 250 people were reportedly killed following the new wave of protests.

"'Doomsday fish' found: Rare Oarfish washes ashore in California, sighted only 20 times since 1901",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doomsday-fish-found-rare-oarfish-washes-ashore-in-california-sighted-only-20-times-since-1901/articleshow/112579783.cms,"The discovery of a rare oarfish , also known as 'doomsday fish', off the coast of Southern California has reignited age-old folklore and intrigue among marine scientists . The dead sea serpent was found floating near La Jolla Cove in San Diego by a group of kayakers and snorkelers over the weekend, marking only the 20th sighting of its kind in California in nearly 125 years.According to the Ocean Conservancy, the oarfish is commonly referred to as the ""doomsday fish"" because it is often sighted during times of disaster.The unusual find was reported by Lauren Fimbres Wood, spokesperson for the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, as per reports by the US Today. She detailed how a team of scientists and lifeguards worked to transport the oarfish to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) facility for examination.Ben Frable, an ichthyologist at Scripps, highlighted the rarity of the event. “Finding an oarfish is incredibly rare,” he said, underscoring the significance of the discovery as only 20 oarfish have washed up in the state since 1901. A necropsy was underway on Friday to determine the cause of death of this mysterious deep-sea inhabitant.The oarfish’s appearance has stirred echoes of Japanese folklore, where the fish is believed to be an omen of impending disaster. Known as ""ryugu no tsukai"" or ""messenger from the sea god’s palace,"" these fish were thought to warn of earthquakes. This belief, which dates back to 17th century Japan, has been fueled by sightings of oarfish before major earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku quake and Fukushima disaster.However, Hiroyuki Motomura, a professor of ichthyology at Kagoshima University, casts doubt on a direct connection between the fish’s appearance and seismic activity. “I believe these fish tend to rise to the surface when their physical condition deteriorates,” Motomura explained as reported by the US Today. “The connection might be more about their health and less about impending earthquakes.”Oarfish typically inhabit deep-sea environments, residing between 700 and 3,280 feet below the surface. Their rare appearances near the surface often occur when they are in poor health, making such sightings all the more unusual.The oarfish found in California will be preserved for further study and added to the Scripps Marine Vertebrate Collection, one of the largest collections of deep-sea fish globally. “Each specimen offers a unique chance to learn more about these enigmatic creatures,” said Fimbres Wood.As scientists continue to study the oarfish, the blend of myth and science surrounding its appearance remains a captivating aspect of marine lore and research.","The dead sea serpent was found floating near La Jolla Cove in San Diego by a group of kayakers and snorkelers over the weekend.

Secret Service pulls from Biden's protective team to guard Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secret-service-pulls-from-bidens-protective-team-to-guard-trump/articleshow/112579985.cms,"The Secret Service has bolstered former President Donald Trump 's security in a variety of ways since the assassination attempt on him last month, several people familiar with the matter said Thursday, including by temporarily shifting part of President Joe Biden 's protective team to Trump.The Secret Service has also secured ballistic glass, which is designed to repel bullets, to provide enhanced protection for Trump at future outdoor campaign rallies, those people added, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential methods.The reassignment of members of a president's team to a candidate is unusual, said a Secret Service official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential policy matters. But the increased threat of violence against Trump, combined with Biden's recent reduced travel schedule, made the step both necessary and feasible, the official added.A White House spokesperson had no immediate comment, and a Trump campaign spokesperson declined to comment.The Secret Service has been under a cloud since July 13, when an assailant was able to fire, unimpeded, on Trump at an outdoor campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The attack grazed Trump's ear, killed a spectator and seriously wounded two others. The FBI is investigating, and congressional leaders have also opened inquiries.The Secret Service has taken responsibility for the security lapses that made the shooting possible. Kimberly A. Cheatle resigned as the agency's director and has been replaced. Cheatle, who has received threats since the Butler rally, is now under Secret Service protection herself, according to an agency official, who added that at least two other Secret Service employees have needed official protection as well.But even as it reels from its worst presidential security breach in more than four decades, the agency has had to continue its mission of protecting three dozen current and former officials, and their families, through what is proving to be a challenging and intense presidential campaign year.Secret Service methodology ""is made to be flexible,"" said Donald Mihalek, who worked for the agency for two decades before retiring in 2019, ""and to address known, and unknown, threats. The steps the Secret Service is taking are a natural part of its asymmetrical approach to assure their no-fail mission is fulfilled.""Mihalek, who helped protect several presidents during his years in the service, said that he had occasionally seen members of a president's team reassigned to other jobs for periods of time, especially during United Nations events.The agency's presidential protective division, as the group is known, is used for high-level protective details because of its experience and expertise, he said.The division consists of hundreds of Secret Service employees who fan out across the White House compound to fulfill various security roles and also travel with the president, according to the current service official as well as former agents. Because Biden has traveled relatively little since dropping his reelection bid on July 21, division members who would typically travel and do advance work are now available to work with Trump's team, the official said.It is rare -- though not unheard-of -- to use ballistic glass for those being protected other than the sitting president and vice president, partly because the material is heavy to move, current and former Secret Service officials said. The glass is usually transported by military planes, these people said, easing the logistical burden on the Secret Service.In the case of Trump, whose potential use of ballistic glass for future campaign events was reported earlier by ABC News, the glass will be positioned at various points around the country for ease of use, a service official said.Trump held an outdoor news conference Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, but he has not held an outdoor rally since the one in Butler.He has said he would like to return to the Butler area for a future event.""We're going to go back in October,"" he said in an interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk this week.","The Secret Service has reassigned members of a president's team to a candidate.

Matthew Perry ’s personal assistant, two doctors, and two other people have been indicted for their roles in procuring ketamine that led to his death.According to federal court documents filed in California, Perry’s assistant and an acquaintance collaborated with two doctors and a drug dealer to obtain tens of thousands of dollars worth of ketamine for Perry, who had a long history of substance abuse.The indictment details how Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the ""Ketamine Queen,"" and Dr Salvador Plasencia were involved in obtaining and distributing ketamine. Sangha maintained a ""stash house"" in North Hollywood, reported NYT. Plasencia, a physician at an urgent care center, facilitated the drug distribution despite Perry's known history of drug abuse.Plasencia and Sangha are charged with conspiracy to distribute ketamine, distribution resulting in death, and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Court documents reveal Plasencia's derogatory texts about Perry, including ""I wonder how much this moron will pay"" and ""Let’s find out,"" reported NYT.Ketamine, used increasingly for mental health treatments, was also abused recreationally. Perry had sought treatment for depression and anxiety, leading to addiction to intravenous ketamine. The autopsy report showed that Perry’s ketamine levels were equivalent to those used in general anesthesia.Erik Fleming, an acquaintance of Perry’s, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute ketamine and distribution resulting in death. Dr Mark Chavez admitted to selling ketamine to Plasencia, while Kenneth Iwamasa, Perry’s assistant, injected him with ketamine. Iwamasa faces up to 15 years in prison, while Fleming faces up to 25 years. Chavez will be arraigned on August 30 and faces up to 10 years in prison.The DEA and US Postal Inspection Service are investigating the case. Sangha’s home was raided in March, resulting in the seizure of 79 bottles of ketamine, nearly 2,000 grams of methamphetamine, and other drugs.Plasencia and Sangha were accused of charging exorbitant prices for ketamine. At one point, they charged Perry $2,000 per vial, which cost about $12.Sangha and Plasencia have pleaded not guilty. Sangha is being held without bond, and Plasencia’s bond is set at $100,000. Their trials are scheduled for October.","Matthew Perry’s assistant, two doctors, and two other people have been indicted for their roles in procuring ketamine that led to his death.

Which countries have confirmed mpox virus cases?

WHO warns more mpox to come in Europe after case in Sweden

What is mpox? What are its symptoms?

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has confirmed its first mpox (earlier known as monkeypox ) case of the year after a 34-year-old man who recently returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus, reported ARY News. The individual, a resident of Mardan, arrived in Pakistan on August 3 and began showing symptoms shortly after reaching Peshawar.The diagnosis was confirmed by Khyber Medical University in Peshawar, and the positive result was verified on August 13, marking the first report of monkeypox in Pakistan for 2024.Health officials have begun contact tracing efforts to identify and monitor individuals who were in close contact with the patient, including fellow passengers on his flight from Saudi Arabia.Earlier in 2023, three passengers were diagnosed with monkeypox at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. All three were Pakistani citizens aged between 30 and 45. The passengers were admitted to the infectious disease hospital.China will monitor individuals and goods entering the country for mpox over the next six months, according to a statement from its customs administration issued on Friday.Last year, China announced that mpox would be managed as a Category B infectious disease. This designation allows officials to take emergency measures such as restricting gatherings, suspending work and school, or sealing off areas during an outbreak.Category B infectious diseases in China currently include Covid-19, AIDS, and SARS.The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths from mpox have been recorded in Africa this year, surpassing last year's figures. More than 96% of these cases and deaths have occurred in Congo, where a new, potentially more transmissible variant is causing concern among scientists.Sweden's public health agency announced on Thursday that the new mpox variant has been identified in a person who recently traveled to Africa and sought healthcare upon returning to Stockholm.WHO warned further imported cases of the new, more dangerous mpox strain in Europe were likely, after Sweden announced the first such infection outside Africa in an outbreak that has killed hundreds in the DR Congo.The WHO's European regional office in Copenhagen said it was discussing with Sweden how best to manage the newly detected case. ""The confirmation of mpox Clade 1 in Sweden is a clear reflection of the interconnectedness of our world,"" it said in a statement.""There are likely to be further imported cases of Clade 1 in the European region over the coming days and weeks, and it is imperative that we don't stigmatise travellers or countries/regions. Travel restrictions and border closures don't work and should be avoided,"" it added.Mpox, also known as monkeypox, first identified in 1958 in monkeys, has recently spread to over 70 countries. The virus, which is similar to smallpox but milder, has caused outbreaks globally since it was confirmed to spread via sex in 2022.Initially, mpox was mostly seen in central and West Africa among people in close contact with infected animals. However, the 2022 outbreaks marked a significant shift, making it a global concern.Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox. It causes milder symptoms such as fever, chills, and body aches.

Why Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is worried about assassination,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-is-worried-about-assassination/articleshow/112557445.cms,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly said that he fears being assassinated if he moves ahead with the normalisation agreement with Israel without securing concessions for Palestinians.According to a Politico report published on Wednesday, the crown prince asked what the US had done to protect Egyptian President Anwar Sadat , who was killed by Islamist militants in 1981, after the landmark peace deal and emphasised that the necessity of incorporating a clear path to a Palestinian state in any potential normalisation deal.While talking with the US Congress members, Bin Salman, commonly referred to as MBS, indicated that despite he fears that pursuing a grand bargain with the US and Israel will cost him life still intends to move ahead with forging ties with the Jewish state.The specifics of the largely confidential and evolving agreement have surfaced through various sources, including my own reporting. The United States is making several pledges to Saudi Arabia, such as security assurances through a treaty, assistance with a civilian nuclear program, and investments in sectors like technology.Some reports suggest that in return, Saudi Arabia would restrict its interactions with China. Additionally, the kingdom would establish diplomatic and other relations with Israel, which would be a significant advantage for the Israelis, considering Saudi Arabia's prominence in the Muslim world.However, much to MBS' disappointment, the Israeli government has been reluctant to incorporate a viable pathway to Palestinian statehood within the agreement.""The way he put it was, 'Saudis care very deeply about this, and the street throughout the Middle East cares deeply about this, and my tenure as the keeper of the holy sites of Islam will not be secure if I don't address what is the most pressing issue of justice in our region,'"" said one of the people with knowledge of conversations MBS has had with regional and American leaders.Nevertheless, the report says, MBS “appears intent on striking the mega-deal with the US and Israel,” which he sees “as crucial to his country’s future.”According to a senior foreign affairs correspondent at Politico, Nahal Toosi, the Saudi crown prince has been discussing the possibility of his own assassination. The timing of these conversations remains unclear. However, Toosi suggests that the prince's motive may be to pressure US officials into persuading Israel to agree to a deal that aligns with his interests.Sources within the US Congress have indicated that the likelihood of achieving an Israel-Saudi normalization agreement before the upcoming presidential election in November is extremely low. This is due to the Senate's lack of time to ratify the US-Saudi portion of the deal prior to its recess. The crown prince's discussions about his potential assassination seem to be an attempt to expedite the process and secure a favorable outcome.US President Joe Biden has said Saudi Arabia wants to “fully recognize Israel” in exchange for security guarantees from Washington and the establishment of a civilian nuclear facility.On Monday, the White House confirmed it had resumed offensive weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, lifting a ban enacted in 2021 over human rights concerns. The resumption was seen as part of Washington’s efforts to enlist the help of Riyadh in securing a ceasefire in Gaza and countering a possible Iranian attack on Israel, reported Politico.",Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly said that he fears being assassinated if he moves ahead with the normalisation agreement with Israel. Bin Salman indicated that despite he fears that pursuing a grand bargain with the US and Israel will cost him life still intends to move ahead with forging ties with the Jewish state.

Trump assassination attempt: Secret service enhances former president's security by reallocating Biden’s protective team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-assassination-attempt-secret-service-enhances-former-presidents-security-by-reallocating-bidens-protective-team/articleshow/112579603.cms,"The Secret Service has significantly strengthened former President Donald Trump’s security following the assassination attempt on him last month, sources familiar with the situation revealed on Thursday. This includes temporarily reallocating members of President Joe Biden's protective team to Trump’s detail and securing ballistic glass for use at future outdoor campaign events, reported NYT.The reassignment of presidential protection personnel to a candidate is unusual, according to a Secret Service official who requested anonymity. However, the heightened threat to Trump and Biden’s reduced travel schedule have made this measure both necessary and practical.The Secret Service has faced intense scrutiny since July 13, when an assailant managed to fire at Trump during an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The attack grazed Trump’s ear, killed a spectator, and injured two others. The FBI and congressional leaders are investigating the incident.Following the breach, former Secret Service Director Kimberly A. Cheatle resigned and has since been placed under Secret Service protection due to threats she has received. The agency has also provided protection to at least two other employees.Despite the ongoing challenges and the high-profile nature of the security breach, the Secret Service remains focused on its mission to protect current and former officials amid a demanding presidential campaign season. Donald Mihalek, a former Secret Service agent, described the agency’s response as part of its “asymmetrical approach” to addressing both known and unknown threats.The use of ballistic glass, though rare for non-sitting presidents, is being implemented for Trump’s events. The glass, which is typically transported by military aircraft due to its weight, will be strategically positioned across the country for Trump’s future rallies.Trump, who has not held an outdoor rally since the Butler event, announced plans to return to the area in October. He confirmed his intent in a recent interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.A White House spokesperson had no immediate comment, and Trump’s campaign also declined to provide a statement.","The Secret Service has significantly strengthened former President Donald Trump's security following the assassination attempt on him last month.

US Supreme Court stops Biden administration's LGBT rule from taking effect in schools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-stops-biden-administrations-lgbt-rule-from-taking-effect-in-schools/articleshow/112579395.cms,"The US Supreme Court on Friday declined to allow President Joe Biden 's administration to enforce a significant portion of a new rule aimed at protecting LGBT students from discrimination in schools and colleges based on gender identity . The decision impacts 10 Republican-led states that challenged the rule, marking a setback for the administration's efforts to expand protections under Title IX .The justices denied the administration's request to partially lift lower court injunctions that had blocked the rule, which was set to take effect on August 1. The rule was designed to clarify that discrimination ""on the basis of sex"" under Title IX includes sexual orientation and gender identity. This rule would have extended protections to LGBT students in federally funded education programs.The lawsuits were filed by a coalition of states, including Louisiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky, along with other plaintiffs who argued that the rule would force schools to accommodate transgender students in ways that they claimed could compromise the safety and privacy of other students. The states argued that the rule exceeded federal authority and represented an overreach by the Biden administration.Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill criticized the rule, stating, ""This is all for a political agenda, ignoring significant safety concerns for young women students."" She argued that the rule would compel schools to change their policies regarding restrooms, locker rooms, and pronoun usage, which she deemed ""enormously invasive.""In defense of the rule, US Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine Lhamon said, ""These final regulations clarify Title IX's requirement that schools promptly and effectively address all forms of sex discrimination. We look forward to working with schools, students, and families to prevent and eliminate sex discrimination.""Despite the Supreme Court's refusal to lift the injunctions, the administration maintained that most of the rule's provisions are unrelated to gender identity and should still be allowed to take effect. However, it agreed to keep certain provisions, including those related to restrooms and locker rooms, blocked while the legal battles continue.This legal challenge is part of a broader trend, with similar lawsuits blocking the law in 22 states, mostly governed by Republicans. The court's decision comes ahead of its next term, where it will also hear a case from Tennessee involving a ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors.The Biden administration has argued that the rule aligns with the Supreme Court's 2020 decision, which held that a similar law, Title VII, protects gay and transgender employees from workplace discrimination. However, lower courts in Louisiana and Kentucky concluded that Title IX's reference to sex pertains only to ""biological"" males and females, leading to the current legal impasse.",The US Supreme Court declined to allow the administration to enforce a new rule aimed at protecting LGBT students from discrimination. The rule would have extended protections to LGBT students in federally funded education programs.

"Trump says civilian award ‘better’ than military medal for those ‘dead’ or ‘hit’ by bullets, Vance defends comments as ‘reasonable’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-civilian-award-better-than-military-medal-for-those-dead-or-hit-by-bullets-draws-criticism/articleshow/112579394.cms,"Former President Donald Trump sparked controversy after describing the Presidential Medal of Freedom as ""much better"" than the Medal of Honor , suggesting that the military award often goes to service members who are severely wounded or deceased. The comments, made at a campaign event at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club, add to a series of remarks from Trump that critics say show disdain for military service members who are wounded, captured, or killed.At the event, which was billed as a discussion on fighting antisemitism, Trump recounted awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Miriam Adelson, the widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and a significant donor to Trump’s campaigns.He contrasted the civilian honor with the Medal of Honor, inaccurately referring to it as the ""Congressional Medal of Honor,"" and claimed the two awards were ""rated equal.""""I have to say Miriam, I watched Sheldon sitting so proud in the White House when we gave Miriam the Presidential Medal of Freedom, that's the highest award you can get as a civilian,"" Trump said during a pro-Israel event. ""It's the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but civilian version — it's actually much better because everyone gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, they're soldiers, they are even in very bad shape because they have been hit so many times by bullets or they are dead.""""She gets it and she's a healthy, beautiful, woman,"" Trump said to some applause. ""They are rated equal.""In response to the backlash, Republican vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance defended Trump’s remarks, emphasizing that they were not intended to demean military honors.""I don't think him complementing and saying a nice word about a person who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom is in any way denigrating those who received military honors,"" Vance told reporters during a campaign stop in Milwaukee. ""They are two different awards. And I think the president was saying some nice things about a person he liked, and that is a totally reasonable thing to do.""Vance, who noted that he had not seen the entirety of Trump’s comments, added that the former president ""loves our veterans.""Brian Hughes, a spokesman for Trump’s campaign, later clarified that Trump's comments referred to the emotional difficulty of awarding the Medal of Honor to veterans who have been wounded or killed in action, emphasizing that Trump had done so proudly as commander in chief.However, the remarks were met with swift criticism. Sarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, responded sharply, saying, ""Donald Trump knows nothing about service to anyone or anything but himself,"" and urging voters to prevent Trump from becoming commander in chief again.Trump’s comments also risk undermining Republican efforts to challenge Democratic vice-presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota over his military record, potentially complicating their campaign strategy.The controversy adds to a pattern of remarks by Trump that have been perceived as disrespectful to the military, raising questions about his relationship with service members as he seeks to return to the presidency.","Former President Donald Trump sparked controversy after describing the Presidential Medal of Freedom as ""much better"" than the Medal of Honor.

Harris proposes federal price gouging ban: Will it curb inflation or create new challenges? Plan sparks debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harris-proposes-federal-price-gouging-ban-will-it-curb-inflation-or-create-new-challenges-plan-sparks-debate/articleshow/112579392.cms,"Food prices have surged by over 20% under the Biden-Harris administration , pushing many Americans to stretch their budgets further at the grocery store. In response, Vice President Kamala Harris announced a federal ban on price gouging across the food industry at a campaign event on Friday.“My plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules,” Harris said.However, some economists warn that Harris' proposal could create new challenges. Gavin Roberts, chair of Weber State University’s economics department, studied anti-price gouging laws enacted during the pandemic and observed that such measures often prompted consumers to buy more than they typically would, exacerbating shortages.“When prices are high, the best policy action is often no action at all,” Roberts said reported CNN, explaining that consumers deterred by high prices of items like beef might switch to other proteins, helping maintain stock levels for those willing to pay more.Harris claims her proposal will foster competition within the food industry, but Roberts argues it may instead maintain the status quo by deterring new competition that could lower prices in the long run. Jason Furman, a former top economist in the Obama administration, echoed this concern, labeling the proposal as ""not sensible policy"" with potential downsides for consumers.Despite the critiques, Harris’ campaign fact sheet indicates that the plan also includes increased resources for federal agencies to combat price-fixing and anti-competitive practices in the food industry. Campaign staff declined to comment on the criticisms, referring instead to Harris’ speech and the fact sheet.The debate over the causes of inflation in recent years remains unresolved. While the San Francisco Federal Reserve found no strong link between price gouging and inflation, progressive think tanks argue there may be a direct connection.Lindsay Owens, executive director of the progressive Groundwork Collaborative, supports Harris' proposal, stating that it would empower agencies like the Federal Trade Commission to ""crack down on bad actors"" and ensure fair pricing for consumers. “It’s good to see this aggressive approach,” Owens told CNN.As the discussion around Harris’ proposal continues, the question remains: will this new policy curb rising food prices or create more economic hurdles?","Vice President Kamala Harris announced a federal ban on price gouging at a campaign event on Friday.

From 'perfect candidate' to sudden exit: Inside the fall of Columbia's President Minouche Shafik,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-perfect-candidate-to-sudden-exit-inside-the-fall-of-columbias-president-minouche-shafik/articleshow/112579352.cms,"'Humanity In All Its Differentiated Glory'

Months of Turmoil

London Calling

A Last Surprise

The part-time role in London was unpaid, temporary and only advisory, but to Minouche Shafik , it offered a way out of her beleaguered presidency at Columbia University .She had arrived in New York only last year for one of academia's plum jobs: running an Ivy League university with enormous riches and diversity, extraordinary prestige and a heritage that predated American independence.To the university's leaders, Shafik was a peerless pick, a globally minded economist with a remarkable personal story, and the first woman to lead Columbia.These last 10 months, though, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, had been miserable for Columbia and its president. The university, which Shafik had championed as a haven for the world's best minds who could help solve society's intractable problems, disintegrated into factions. And as Shafik's response proved swerving and uneven, she found herself with few allies and facing a campus where she was perceived as insular and rarely seen.By the time summer break arrived, she had been vilified on campus and in Congress as an ally of antisemites, a turncoat to academic freedom and free speech, and an enfeebled leader who had both allowed pro-Palestinian protests to plunge into lawlessness and been too willing to call in police. Her home seemed as much a fortress as a residence. And even as summer brought a respite from encampments and protests, university officials so feared the possibility of future trouble that they began weighing police powers for campus security officers.People who had spoken to Shafik in recent months came to believe that she was deeply unhappy, and she had told faculty members that she thought there was little trust in her administration.Ultimately, she decided to resign from Columbia, accept the British Foreign Office's offer to chair an outside review on development policy and return to her peerage in the House of Lords. The bruising environs of Westminster and Whitehall would be her safe harbor -- away from the grandstanding and protesting of an American political season wrapped up with a grinding war many of her students reviled.In an open letter released Wednesday night, Shafik, who could not be reached for comment, said ruefully that her 13-month tenure had included ""a period of turmoil where it has been difficult to overcome divergent views across our community."" She cited the ""considerable toll"" on her family and said it had been ""distressing -- for the community, for me as president and on a personal level -- to find myself, colleagues and students the subject of threats and abuse.""Her departure from Columbia was abrupt, just weeks after she published a letter that gave no hint that she was considering a retreat. But her resignation , which Columbia's board co-chairs said trustees accepted ""regretfully,"" would almost certainly not close this contentious era in the university's 270-year history, or in higher education in the United States.A congressional investigation is underway, and the blame game for months of turbulence is only beginning. Columbia has interim leadership, and faculty and administrators are bracing for a fall semester of flare-ups that could turn into fodder for the 2024 presidential campaign.""She started with a lot of hope and optimism, and no one foresaw it ending this way,"" said James H. Applegate, a professor of astronomy and a member of a university senate committee whose authority Shafik ignored when she summoned police to campus in April. ""That is a tremendous disappointment.""But, he added, perhaps her decision should not have been all that much of a surprise: ""At some point you have to say, from Shafik's point of view, 'How much longer do you want to put up with this stuff?' It's a toxic hellhole, and it's directed at her.""It was never going to be all that easy to follow Lee C. Bollinger, the free-speech scholar who led Columbia for 21 years. But in January 2023, Columbia's board announced Shafik's appointment with glassy-eyed fanfare. Jonathan Lavine, then the university board's chair, pronounced her as nothing less than ""the perfect candidate: a brilliant and able global leader, a community builder and a preeminent economist who understands the academy and the world beyond it.""An economist who had fled Egypt with her family during childhood, Shafik had been educated in the American South before earning degrees from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the London School of Economics and Oxford University. She was a young star at the World Bank, took a powerful job in Britain's development agency and went on to senior roles at the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England. In 2020, she became a cross-bencher in the House of Lords -- a bona fide baroness.She was not, however, steeped in the byzantine world of university governance in the United States. At Columbia, as at many other universities, presidents are not autonomous rulers but essential figures in a shared power structure.During her formal inauguration Oct. 4, she framed her address around a question: ""What does the world need from a great university in the 21st century?""In an earlier era, she noted, universities ""were kept separate from the world around them.""""Columbia started as a university for white, Christian men,"" she added. ""For most of its history, it would have been inconceivable for someone who looks like me to be president of this great institution. Today, Columbia includes humanity in all its differentiated glory, and our world is so much richer for it.""Three days later, Hamas fighters burst out of the Gaza Strip into Israel.Two days later, Shafik said she was ""devastated by the horrific attack on Israel"" and called on people to ""reject forces that seek to pull us apart.""On Oct. 12, only eight days after her optimistic oration, Columbia closed its campus as hundreds of protesters amassed. It was a way of separating itself, for the moment, from the world around it.Shutting the gates resolved little. Protests were exploding on campuses across the country, and Columbia was grappling with ones that some students felt had especially menacing airs of antisemitism and intimidation.Shafik moved to tighten rules around demonstrations and, in November, the university was among the first to suspend Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine, a pair of pro-Palestinian groups that Columbia officials insisted had defied the rules for staging protests. Critics suspected speech suppression.Hundreds of students rallied to oppose the suspensions, and a walkout of hundreds of faculty members followed a day later.For a time, though, Shafik was able to pursue order and soothe donors largely in private. And she avoided the spotlight in December, when the presidents of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania testified before Congress. Their lawyerly answers to questions about antisemitism helped unravel their tenures within a month. (Shafik was traveling abroad at the time of the hearing.)But pressure was mounting as protests continued and fears of antisemitism surged.Then, on April 17, Shafik took her turn before Congress. Columbia officials had studied the December showdown that had undone the Harvard and Penn leaders, and they settled on a different approach: Shafik would appear empathetic and conciliatory.""Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Columbia's code of conduct?"" Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., demanded early in the hearing.""Yes, it does,"" Shafik replied, echoing the board co-chairs, Claire Shipman and David J. Greenwald, who had accompanied her to Capitol Hill.Under persistent questioning from Republicans, Shafik went into surprising detail about the disciplining of university employees, which is usually confidential.Congress, for the moment, was at bay. But that morning, students had gone to a grassy quad and pitched tents. They posted a sign: ""Gaza Solidarity Encampment.""Shafik decided to call in police, violating, in the view of many professors, university protocol since members of the university senate had warned her not to.At Columbia, few decisions are as freighted as summoning the New York Police Department. In 1968, police were infamously brought in to quell protests and made more than 700 arrests, a decision that shadowed the university for decades and hamstrung applications and donations alike.Shafik's choice led to more than 100 arrests and propelled Columbia to the center of a national firestorm, turning the campus into a symbol of a springtime protest movement that ultimately led to thousands of arrests across the country.Faculty members began discussing a censure, a humiliating punishment. Shafik, students and professors railed, was stifling speech and threatening the academic freedom that had been sacrosanct for generations.Worse yet for Shafik, the arrests only emboldened many of the demonstrators, who promptly reconstructed their encampment. Rumors swirled that the National Guard would be deployed to the campus, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, with a group of Republican lawmakers, held a news conference at Columbia on the steps of the Low Library. According to Johnson, he stood in Shafik's office and told her to quit.She refused, much like the protesters who were rebuffing demands that they pack up.Then in the early hours of April 30, protesters captured Hamilton Hall, a building that demonstrators had occupied in 1968.Columbia had days earlier said that bringing the NYPD to campus again would be ""counterproductive,"" but Shafik called in police once more. Hundreds of officers marched through the campus that night. The occupation, Shafik said, had left her with ""no choice.""The dozens of arrests satisfied few. Protesters and their allies were furious over the return of the police. Others demanded to know how Shafik had allowed such disorder to reign in the first place.The besieged university, with its gates closed and many students opting for remote classes, staggered to the end of the semester. Columbia canceled its main commencement event, and Shafik stayed away from each of the smaller ceremonies.Summer arrived, dimming the chaos, though Shafik soon found her university putting three deans on leave for text messages that she said ""touched on ancient antisemitic tropes."" (The deans resigned this month. A fourth administrator who was involved in the exchanges to a lesser degree, Josef Sorett, remains at Columbia.)Soon after the ""Textgate"" scandal, as it became known on campus, a resurgent, recalibrated Labour Party in Britain thumped the Conservative Party in a general election. At the Foreign Office, Britain's new top diplomat, David Lammy, ordered a trio of reviews to examine policy.Sometime over the last month or so, the government reached out to Shafik to see whether she would chair an advisory committee on development policy. The role was not conceived as a post-Columbia landing spot for Shafik, according to a British official who, in line with government protocol, spoke on the condition of anonymity.To accept the position, Shafik did not need to step down from Columbia. In fact, the government was recruiting other high-profile outsiders to scrutinize British policy with no expectation that they would vacate other roles.Shafik agreed to the post. And to the surprise of some in London and New York, she decided to quit Columbia, too.Columbia planned to announce Shafik's exit Thursday, but word began to bubble up Wednesday evening. There was little time to warn people of the seismic change, including that the board had selected Dr. Katrina A. Armstrong, the university's executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences, as Columbia's interim leader.A campus consumed by months of tumult found itself stunned anew.""I've had calls since 7 in the morning,"" Costis Maglaras, the dean of the business school, said Thursday. ""I think people are sad to learn that Minouche has stepped down, but people are now facing forward and sort of rallying around Katrina.""But to some on campus, Shafik's eventual collapse had been all but certain since April.Brendan O'Flaherty, a Columbia economics professor, believed that her willingness to discuss disciplining professors by name before Congress ""was her undoing with the faculty.""""For large numbers of faculty, that's a major, major sin, which she did not repent of,"" he said.The university did not say when Columbia would begin a search for a permanent president. And the university senate is planning to have a commission study the events of recent months, much as Columbia did after the 1968 protests.For now, many at Columbia are turning toward the start of classes Sept. 3 and whatever the new semester may bring.Applegate said: ""I won't be surprised if there's an encampment on the first day of classes.""In the meantime, Shafik's critics in Washington, the politicians who insisted that she had caved to chaos, celebrated her exit. So did Students for Justice in Palestine, a group Columbia suspended on her watch.","Minouche Shafik was vilified as an ally of antisemites, a turncoat to academic freedom.

"Dirt track racer Scott Bloomquist, known for winning and swagger, dies in plane crash",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dirt-track-racer-scott-bloomquist-known-for-winning-and-swagger-dies-in-plane-crash/articleshow/112579300.cms,"Scott Bloomquist , a dirt track race car driver who was known for his bravado and for being one of the sport's best, died Friday in a plane crash on his family's farm in Mooresburg, Tennessee, friends and local officials said.Bloomquist, 60, stood out with his long hair and a race car that was emblazoned with the number zero and a skull and crossbones.He was also known for winning.Jerry Caldwell, president and manager of Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, said Friday that Bloomquist was ""arguably the greatest dirt late model racer in the sport's history.""In another tribute, fellow racer Tony Stewart said Bloomquist was ""probably the smartest guy I've ever been around when it comes to dirt racing .""""What he could do behind the wheel of a racecar was matched by the ingenuity he put into building his racecars,"" Stewart wrote on social media. ""He was a force on the track and off, with a personality as big as his list of accomplishments.""The plane that Bloomquist was flying crashed into a barn, and the remains of its sole occupant are believed to be that of Bloomquist, the Hawkins County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. The National Transportation Safety Board said in its own statement that it is coordinating with the Federal Aviation Administration to investigate the crash of the Piper J3C-65.Reid Millard, a fellow race car driver and a funeral home director in Missouri, stated on Facebook that Bloomquist's mother asked him to announce the death. ""Along with Scott's daughter Ariel his parents his sister and along with all of you who knew and loved Scott - you are in our hearts and prayers,"" Millard wrote.In dirt-track racing, drivers have to steer right for the car to go left. Going through turns, the front left tire comes off the track and the left rear tire provides traction.The cars weigh about 2,300 pounds and supply 800-plus horsepower. At Eldora Speedway, the Ohio racetrack owned by Stewart, the cars reach top speeds of about 150 mph.The vehicles have two-speed transmissions and no windshields, only short plastic shields to protect drivers from rocks. It can be a rough, contact sport.""Rubbing is racing,"" said Gerald Newton, president of the National Dirt Late Model Hall of Fame, in a phone interview with The Associated Press. ""It's door to door. You're slinging it sideways and slinging dirt.""Bloomquist was in the 2002 class of the hall of fame. Newton said Bloomquist was like an older brother to him and had known the racer for nearly 40 years. He also designed Bloomquist's official merchandize as senior vice president at Arizona Sport Shirts.Bloomquist was born in Iowa and later lived in California, where his father worked as an airline pilot, Newton said. The family wanted to move east and purchased the farm in Tennessee.Newtown said Bloomquist got into racing through a car that his father bought but soon lost interest in, passing it along to his son.""He would do work for people, make a little bit of money to buy a tire, go win a race,"" Newton said. ""He'd take that money, reinvest in the team. The rest is history.""Besides winning, Bloomquist became known for being cocky and kind of a bad boy, Newton said. His persona was somewhat built around the skull that was painted inside the zero on his race car.In the year 2000, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote Bloomquist ""looks like Tom Cruise, drives like Dale Earnhardt and speaks out like Darrell Waltrip.""Waltrip was a NASCAR driver who aggravated his competitors by beating them on the track and then running his mouth out of the car.""He always told me it's not boasting or bragging if it's fact and you can back it up,"" Newton said of Bloomquist. ""And he did.""Newtown said Bloomquist's accolades ""will never be exceeded.""""The world has lost a great racer, a great friend, a great dad,"" Newton said. ""And heaven has gained a great angel.""Like a lot of drivers in the sport, Bloomquist suffered various injuries over the years. But he was still racing and planned to compete in next month's World 100 at Eldora Speedway.""He still felt like he could win a race,"" Newton said.","Scott Bloomquist, 60, died in a plane crash on his family's farm in Mooresburg, Tennessee.

Israel has characterised its Gaza offensive as targeting Hamas' infrastructure, with the goal of eliminating the entire terror group while minimising civilian casualties.In a joint statement on Monday, US President Joe Biden, along with the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and Italy, called on Iran to cease its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel.According to the White House, the joint statement read, ""We called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place."" The statement also highlighted the urgent need for the delivery and distribution of aid.""We expressed our full support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions and reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.

Additionally, the unfettered delivery and distribution of aid is needed. We expressed our support for the defence of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups,"" it added.After Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran last month, which prompted promises of ""punishment"" from Iran, Israel is preparing for a strong retaliation.While Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh's death, it had previously threatened to execute him and other senior Hamas figures for their involvement in the October 7 terrorist attacks.Tensions in West Asia escalated after the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) announced on July 31 that Ismail Haniyeh had been killed in an attack in Tehran. The IRGC stated that Haniyeh and one of his bodyguards were killed when their residence in Tehran was hit. A projectile struck a house allocated to war veterans in Tehran at 2 a.m. (local time) on Wednesday, according to a Press TV report.The IDF also announced that top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on July 30, which was in retaliation for the rocket attack on the Golan Heights that killed 12 children. Fuad Shukr, described as the ""most senior Hezbollah military commander,"" was killed in the Israeli strike, the IDF stated. Shukr was a member of the Jihad Council, Hezbollah's top military body, and was considered the head of its strategic division.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Israel on Saturday, August 17.

"Harvard resolves lawsuit alleging professor's harassment, intimidation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-resolves-lawsuit-alleging-professors-harassment-intimidation/articleshow/112576458.cms,"BOSTON: Harvard University and three graduate students have settled a federal lawsuit accusing the Ivy League school of ignoring complaints of sexual harassment by a renowned professor and allowing him to intimidate students by threatening to hinder their careers. The suit filed in Boston in 2022 was dismissed without court costs and with prejudice, according to an order by federal Magistrate Judge Judith Dein dated Thursday, meaning the students can't re-litigate the claims.Terms of the settlement were not made public.The students' lawyers praised their clients' courage ""in coming forward, speaking up about their experiences and shedding light on important issues.""""We are glad that our clients will now be able to move on with their lives and careers,"" the statement from Sanford Heisler Sharp said.The lawsuit alleged that one of the students was subjected to repeated forcible kissing and groping as early as 2017 by John Comaroff, a professor of anthropology and African and African American studies. And when the student met with him to discuss her plans to study in an African country, Comaroff repeatedly said she could be subjected to violence in Africa because she was in a same-sex relationship, the lawsuit said.The other two plaintiffs said Comaroff threatened to derail their careers after they reported his behaviour to university administrators. One accused him of giving her unwanted sexual attention when she was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.Comaroff, 79, was not named as a defendant, and his lawyers said at the time that he ""categorically denies ever harassing or retaliating against any student"". He ""consistently made every effort to assist these students and to advance their careers,"" their statement said.As for the discussion about the dangers of possible violence in the African country, he said his advice was appropriate, motivated by concern for her safety if she travelled with a same-sex partner - a warning similar to what's published by the US State Department.Comaroff said in a July statement announcing his retirement from Harvard that the lawsuit ""repeated all of the allegations already found to lack merit"" during a Harvard investigation, but ""in more lurid, hyperbolic terms"" to make him a scapegoat in their fight against the university.""All this extraordinary attention, all the furor, all the nastiness, arose out of two brief office-hour discussions, both academic in intent and content,"" Comaroff wrote. ""An ugly, ferocious campaign had been waged against me at Harvard by a small group of activists, people who have no knowledge of me, of my pedagogy, or of the facts of the case as established by Harvard's thorough, largely exonerating investigation.""At the time the lawsuit was filed in 2022, a Harvard spokesperson shared a letter saying Comaroff was put on administrative leave for the rest of that spring semester after university investigators found his verbal conduct violated the school's sexual, gender-based and professional conduct policies.Before the lawsuit went to mediation in November, lawyers for Harvard had argued for a dismissal, saying the statute of limitations had expired for some claims and that others lacked merit.Emails seeking comment on the settlement from attorneys representing Comaroff and the university were not immediately returned Friday.","The suit filed in 2022 was dismissed without court costs and with prejudice.

Election officials keep Green Party presidential candidate on Wisconsin ballot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/election-officials-keep-green-party-presidential-candidate-on-wisconsin-ballot/articleshow/112576360.cms,"MADISON: Wisconsin elections officials dismissed a Democratic National Committee employee's demands Friday to remove the Green Party's presidential candidate from the ballot in the key swing state.DNC employee David Strange filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission on Wednesday asking the commission to remove Jill Stein from the presidential ballot .The election commission 's attorney, Angela O'Brien Sharpe, wrote to Strange on Friday saying she had dismissed the complaint because it names commissioners as respondents and they can't ethically decide a matter brought against them.Dismissing the complaint clears the way for a potential lawsuit seeking to keep Stein off the ballot. A spokesperson for the DNC had no immediate comment Friday. The Stein campaign didn't immediately respond to a message sent to their media email inbox.The bipartisan elections commission unanimously approved ballot access for Stein in February because the Green Party won more than 1% of the vote in a statewide race in 2022. Sheryl McFarland got nearly 1.6% of the vote while finishing last in a four-way race for secretary of state.Strange argued in his complaint that the Green Party can't nominate presidential electors in Wisconsin because no one in the party is a state officer, defined as legislators, judges and others. Without any presidential electors, the party can't have a presidential candidate on the ballot, Strange contended.Stein's appearance on the ballot could make a difference in battleground Wisconsin, where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by between 5,700 votes and about 23,000 votes.Stein last appeared on the Wisconsin ballot 2016, when she won just over 31,000 votes - more than Donald Trump's winning margin in the state. Some Democrats have blamed her for helping Trump win the state and the presidency that year.The Wisconsin Supreme Court kept Green Party presidential candidate Howie Hawkins off the ballot in 2020 after the elections commission deadlocked on whether he filed proper nominating signatures.The latest Marquette University Law School poll conducted July 24 through Aug. 1 showed the presidential contest in Wisconsin between Democrat Kamala Harris and Trump to be about even among likely voters. Democrats fear third-party candidates could siphon votes from Harris and tilt the race toward Trump.The elections commission plans to meet Aug. 27 to determine whether four independent presidential candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, have met the prerequisites to appear on the ballot.Strange filed a separate complaint last week with the commission seeking to keep West off the ballot, alleging his declaration of candidacy wasn't properly notarized. Cornel's campaign manager countered in a written response any notarization shortcomings shouldn't be enough to keep him off the ballot. That complaint is still pending.Michigan election officials tossed West off that state's ballot Friday over similar notary issues.","DNC employee David Strange filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission on Wednesday asking the commission to remove Jill Stein from the presidential ballot.

""We like to say that the Milwaukee Police Association is the force behind the force, and we use the words honor and service when we talk about our brave men and women of our department.""Alexander highlighted several challenges faced by the police in Milwaukee, including low bail for dangerous criminals, the need for concerted efforts to apprehend offenders with bench warrants, low officer morale, and societal pressures against police forces. He noted that these issues are exacerbated by staffing shortages, leading to situations where entire areas of the city might be left with only one patrol squad due to high-priority calls elsewhere.""The challenges of policing in the city of Milwaukee are many,"" Alexander stated. ""Some areas of the city will at times go with only one squad to patrol the entire area of 44,000 citizens, as squads get pulled to other parts of the city to address high-priority calls, which can often be more violent in nature and require more officers.""The endorsement of Trump and Vance, according to Alexander, is rooted in the belief that addressing these policing challenges is a crucial matter for Milwaukee's safety and wellbeing. ""The Milwaukee Police Association believes that the solution to these challenges can be found right here.

"Kamala Harris: MAGA calls Harris 'Comrade Kamala' after she promises price-control 'like Venezuela, Cuba'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-calls-harris-comrade-kamala-after-she-promises-price-control-like-venezuela-cuba/articleshow/112576071.cms,"'Price grouging is like pornography. You know it when you see it'

Vice President Kamala Harris Friday unveiled her economic plan promising tax cuts for the middle class, expand child tax credit, federal ban of price gouging. The Trump campaign in response called Kamala Harris Comrade Kamala and said price controls exist in Soviet, Venezuela.“Her policies rival some of the most socialist and authoritarian models from world history.Instead of unleashing American energy and reducing the burden on our people, she would impose price controls that are something out of Venezuela or Cuba,” senior Trump campaign adviser Brian Hughes told reporters.Harris’ plan would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. She said she would ban price grouging which is stopping sellers from inflating the prices. Harris promised to work toward construction of three million new homes to “end the housing shortage” within a four-year time frame, offering a first-ever tax incentive to people building starter homes.Columnist Catherine Rampell wrote in Washington Post that -- before the unveiling of the plan -- no one knows what price grouging means. ""That’s the thing about price gouging: As has been said of hardcore pornography, you know it when you see it,"" she wrote.""It’s hard to exaggerate how bad this policy is. It is, in all but name, a sweeping set of government-enforced price controls across every industry, not only food. Supply and demand would no longer determine prices or profit levels. Far-off Washington bureaucrats would. The FTC would be able to tell, say, a Kroger in Ohio the acceptable price it can charge for milk.""Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy (Jr) said Kamala Harris economy plan is partly good but the price control proposal is absurd. ""My take on VP Harris's economic plan: it actually has some good ideas -- help for first-time homebuyers, tax credit for parents of newborns. But the notion that you can control inflation by limiting ""corporate price-gouging"" is absurd. That isn't the cause of inflation. It is the printing of trillions of dollars that go toward military spending and corporate giveaways. When you print money and spend it in ways that don't increase productive capacity for goods and services, you will get inflation. That VP Harris (or her team) does not understand basic economics is troubling,"" Kennedy posted.","Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled her economic plan Friday.

'I want to study'

DADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan , 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.""I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,"" Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.""But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.""Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity .The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.""This has led to a new trend of ' monsoon brides ',"" said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.""Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.""Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.""Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,"" said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.""They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done"".Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.""My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,"" she said.""I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,"" she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.""Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.""Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.""We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,"" said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.""They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,"" she added.""The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.""Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.Unicef has reported ""significant strides"" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.""We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,"" it said in a report after the 2022 floods.Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.""When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities',"" the daily wage labourer told AFP.Mehtab was just 10 years old.""The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep,"" said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.""I have told my father I want to study,"" she said. ""I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself.""","Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years. But after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise.

The first trial was carried out in July, which resulted in the slowing down of social media platforms.PM Shehbaz Sharif’s government had allocated more than 30 billion Pakistani rupees in the development budget for the acquisition and installation of this filtering system.However, the adverse impacts after installing the firewall drew criticism from netizens and digital rights groups, who expressed fear about the future of internet-based businesses in Pakistan.government authorities had so far feigned ignorance over the internet disruptions being linked to firewall installation, and had blamed telecom and internet service providers for connectivity issues.On Thursday, however, IT minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said her ministry was addressing complaints of slow internet speed, even though she did not link the problem with thecybersecurity firewall .“There have been complaints of slow internet and I have asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to provide data of the last two weeks to look at the data traffic to know the speed issue,” she told reporters.Asked about the installation of a firewall, the minister said it was a cybersecurity matter and that countries around the world used the technology. “Previously, government was managing the web system, but with increasing international cybersecurity attacks on the country, there is a growing need for the state to strengthen its ability to prevent these attacks,” Khawaja said.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.The association of internet service providers have blamed the slow internet speed and outages on increased security and surveillance. “It’s a very discouraging situation for our customers. Many are leaving the smaller ISPs because they cannot sustain the poor service quality any more. If this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan,” read a statement issued by service providers.","Pakistan government confirms that it is upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.

Millions of people across Pakistan have been facing trouble accessing internet services for some time now due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions.So far, official stakeholders in Pakistan have either been feigning ignorance in response to public outcry and media queries, or claiming that the problems were because of telecom and internet service providers, or even Meta.While talking to reporters after the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Tele­communi­cation meeting on Thursday, Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said the government had sought a report from Pakistan Telecommunication Authority and other institutions over the internet disruption.""The internet should never be slow. We have even been talking about bringing 5G technology to Pakistan. There is no doubt about that, and conversations about higher internet speed are underway,"" the Dawn newspaper quoted Khawaja as saying.When the minister was asked about the 'firewall' - a blanket term used by the public to describe the causes of internet disruption in the absence of any official explanation - she said the issue had been ""blown out of proportion"".""The government has been operating a web-management system. The system is now being upgraded.""She also called the process ""a routine exercise"" across the globe to enhance internet security, without giving any detail to substantiate her claims about which other countries have deployed this system.""It is the right of the government to take measures to protect its interests given the cyber security attacks that Pakistan is facing.""This was the first time an acknowledged the government's actions, which have been blamed for everything from slow browsing speeds, the arbitrary blocking of social media platforms and WhatsApp connectivity issues on mobile data, the paper said.Meanwhile, on Thursday, users continued experiencing pro­blems in accessing social media platforms, including WhatsApp.Downdetector, a website that provides real-time information about internet outages, received an unusually high number of complaints about disruptions in WhatsApp, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram between 12 noon and 1 pm.Meanwhile, a petition was filed in the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday against a ""nationwide internet shutdown"", seeking immediate restoration of internet access.",Pakistan government confirms it is upgrading its web management system to cope with cyber security threats.

Pakistani minister says more arrests expected in retired ISI chief's court-martial case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-minister-says-more-arrests-expected-in-retired-isi-chiefs-court-martial-case/articleshow/112564172.cms,"LAHORE: More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed in a housing scam, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Friday, a day after three more retired military officers were arrested in the case. Hameed, who served as director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, was arrested following action in the complaint of a private property developer over alleged misuse of official authority.""Investigations are underway in the Faiz case. More arrests are likely in the army and elsewhere,"" Dawn News quoted the minister as saying here.""It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country's security… all those will come in its grasp,"" Tarar said.The minister's remarks came hours after the ISPR, the military's public affairs division, in a statement on Thursday said: ""In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.""The ISPR said more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests.The ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested and did not indicate when the arrests had been made, but media reports claimed they were identified as Brigadier (Retd) Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; Brig (Retd) Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and Colonel (Retd) Asim.Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the case, Tarar said the institution of the army had prioritised self-accountability.""We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.""Tarar said when a no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. ""[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,"" he alleged.Taking note of the ISPR statement, Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread. Attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were security attacks.""I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,"" he said, adding that jailed former premier Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but ""won't be able to save his neck"".The ISPR announcement follows speculation that numerous retired officers had been detained about Gen Hameed's trial for his post-retirement actions that violated the Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court.Hameed was arrested on August 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday.His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of the Pakistan Army.The unprecedented arrest of the top-ranking officer, who led the premier intelligence agency, broke the myth in the country that such powerful officers were beyond the reach of law.Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that Khan was not happy with Munir.Later, the army decided to replace Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Khan. It is believed that it was the beginning of the souring of his ties with the powerful military.Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has wielded considerable power in security and foreign policy matters.","More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed.

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.

Hameed has also been accused of multiple violations of the Pakistan Army Act after retirement.“Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City (housing society) case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” the military said in a statement.The management of Top City had accused the former ISI chief of orchestrating a raid on its offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.

How case unfolded

Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal and the process for his court martial was initiated, the army said on Monday.It is for the first time in the country's history that court martial has been initiated against a former intelligence chief, according to Dawn .“Complying with the orders of Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry, was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” a press statement by Pakistan army said further adding that ""the process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody.”“Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), under provisions of Pakistan Army Act,” the release further said.Hameed was regarded as close aide to Imran Khan, who appointed him to lead the ISI during his tenure as prime minister. Khan was removed from office in 2022 through a vote of no-confidence, which he claims was orchestrated by the military, though the military denies this allegation.In 2022, Hameed was one of the six senior-most generals whose names were forwarded by general headquarters to Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif for consideration for the two top military positions. He, however, chose to seek early retirement and submitted his resignation to the high command, as per sources.The Supreme Court, in its order dated November 14 last year, had said that the allegations against Hameed were of ""extremely serious nature"" and ""would undermine the reputation of the federal government, the armed forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.”This came after the management of Top City, a private housing scheme, made allegations against the former spy-master, accusing him of orchestrating a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.The petition was filed on May 12, 2017, and it said that Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials conducted a raid on Top City's office and Moeez’s residence, seizing valuables such as gold and diamond jewelry and money in connection with an alleged terrorism case, Dawn reported.It also alleged the involvement of former ISI officials Irtaza Haroon, Sardar Najaf, Wasim Tabish, Zahid Mehmood Malik, and Mohammad Munir ""in the illegal takeover of the housing society”.In March, a court placed retired naib tehsildar Najaf Hameed, Hameed's brother, under a 14-day judicial remand.Najaf and other co-accused had sought pre-arrest bail in an FIR filed with the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) in Rawalpindi.The FIR alleged that former minister for mineral resources Hafiz Ammar Yasir had acquired properties worth billions of rupees through intermediaries.In April, the military had reportedly established an inquiry committee to investigate allegations of authority misuse involving the former ISI head.","Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal.
