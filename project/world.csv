What caused Utah's iconic 'Double Arch' collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-caused-utahs-iconic-double-arch-collapse/articleshow/112437254.cms,"A prominent geological structure located in southern Utah , known by various names such as the "" Double Arch ,"" the "" Hole in the Roof ,"" and occasionally the "" Toilet Bowl ,"" has collapsed, according to a statement released by National Park Service officials on Friday. No one was harmed during the incident.Park rangers believe that the collapse of the well-known arch, situated within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, may have been caused by fluctuating water levels and erosion resulting from waves in Lake Powell .In her statement, Michelle Kerns, the superintendent of the recreation area that extends across the Utah-Arizona border, emphasised that the collapse serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving the mineral resources surrounding the lake.The arch, composed of Navajo sandstone dating back approximately 190 million years to the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods, has been shaped by the forces of nature, including weather, wind, and rain, as mentioned in the statement.Spanning nearly 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers), the recreation area is a popular destination for boating and hiking enthusiasts.","The well-known geological structure located in southern Utah has collapsed.

"‘Really, that song?’: Celine Dion criticizes Donald Trump for unauthorized use of her Titanic song 'My heart will go on' at rally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/celine-dion-criticizes-donald-trump-for-unauthorized-use-of-her-titanic-song-my-heart-will-go-on/articleshow/112437009.cms,"Celine Dion has responded sharply to Donald Trump ’s use of her iconic song “My Heart Will Go On” at a recent election rally . The track, which Dion wrote and performed for the 1997 film Titanic , was played at a rally in Montana on Friday, accompanied by a video of the singer on a large screen.Dion’s management team and Sony Music Entertainment Canada issued a statement on X, clarifying that the use of the song and video was “in no way” authorized.The statement continued, “Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use… And really, THAT song?”The choice of “My Heart Will Go On” has sparked a flurry of social media activity, with users drawing parallels between Trump’s campaign and the sinking ship central to the Titanic film. The playful yet critical comparisons highlight the turbulent state of Trump’s campaign, which has faced increasing challenges since Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate.Trump’s campaign, which was previously seen as a strong contender for the White House, has been under pressure following Biden’s withdrawal from the race on July 21. Harris, who has gained momentum since Biden’s departure, announced Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate, further strengthening her bid.Released on Dion’s album Let’s Talk About Love and the Titanic soundtrack, “My Heart Will Go On” became a global phenomenon, selling 18 million copies and earning Dion an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and several Grammys. Despite recent health issues that led her to cancel tour dates for 2023 and 2024 due to an autoimmune disorder, Dion made headlines last month by performing from the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Olympics opening.The controversy over the song underscores the ongoing challenges and scrutiny facing both Trump and Harris as the 2024 presidential race heats up.","Dion’s management team and Sony Music Entertainment Canada issued a statement on X, clarifying that the use of the song and video was “in no way’ authorized. “Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use… And really, THAT song?” the statement continued.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112437220,imgsize-1971830,width-400,resizemode-4/112437220.jpg"
GPS spoofing incidents spike 400%: Does it make a plane crash? What should we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/gps-spoofing-incidents-spike-400-does-it-make-a-plane-crash-what-should-we-know/articleshow/112436896.cms,"A significant increase in GPS ""spoofing"" incidents has been witnessed that target commercial airliners , according to cybersecurity researchers . This form of digital attack can send planes off course and has now evolved to include the ability to manipulate time.OPSGROUP, an aviation advisory body, reports a 400% rise in GPS spoofing incidents affecting commercial airliners, particularly near conflict zones.These incidents often involve unauthorised ground-based GPS systems that broadcast false positions to the surrounding airspace, aiming to disorient incoming drones or missiles.Ken Munro, founder of Pen Test Partners, a British cybersecurity firm, emphasised during a presentation at the DEF CON hacking convention in Las Vegas that ""We think too much about GPS being a source of position, but it's actually a source of time."" He added, ""We're starting to see reports of the clocks on board airplanes during spoofing events start to do weird things.""Munro shared an incident with Reuters in which a major Western airline's aircraft had its onboard clocks abruptly advanced by years, causing the plane to lose access to its digitally encrypted communication systems.The aircraft was grounded for weeks while engineers manually reset its onboard systems. Munro withheld the identity of the airline and aircraft involved.In April, Finnair briefly suspended flights to Tartu, Estonia, due to GPS spoofing, which Tallin attributed to neighbouring Russia.GPS has largely replaced expensive ground devices that transmit radio beams to guide planes towards landing. However, GPS signals can be easily blocked or distorted using relatively inexpensive and readily available components, with minimal technological expertise.Munro told Reuters, ""Is it going to make a plane crash? No, it's not."" He explained that the confusion caused by GPS spoofing could potentially trigger a series of minor events that may eventually lead to a serious incident.","GPS ""spoofing"" incidents have increased by 400% in recent years, according to cybersecurity researchers.

He contrasted Trump's tenure, highlighting achievements like rising wages and a secure border, with what he described as Harris's record of an open border and declining wages amid rising inflation and costs of living.Trump had previously voiced similar opinions during a Q&A session with Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner at the National Association of Black Journalists event in Chicago on July 31. When questioned about Vance’s readiness to assume the presidency, Trump remarked, ""Historically the choice of a vice president makes no difference.""Vance reaffirmed this view, stating that voters primarily focus on the presidential nominee when casting their ballots.

"US elections: New poll shows Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-new-poll-shows-kamala-harris-leading-donald-trump-in-michigan-pennsylvania-and-wisconsin/articleshow/112436790.cms,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has gained a significant edge over Republican rival Donald Trump in three critical battleground states , according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll released on Saturday. The survey indicates that Harris commands 50 percent support among voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, compared to Trump's 46 percent in each state.This boost for Harris comes on the heels of her campaign launch, following President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race last month due to concerns about his age and ability to serve another term.Since officially entering the race, Harris has secured strong backing from key Democratic voter segments, including young people and people of color, as well as significant support from donors and top party lawmakers.Harris's recent selection of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate has further energized the Democratic ticket. However, Harris's stance on the Gaza conflict has sparked controversy. During a rally in Detroit this week, she faced protests demanding an end to the war. In response, Harris told demonstrators, ""You know what, if you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking,” which drew criticism from Palestinian rights advocates.At a subsequent rally in Arizona, Harris adopted a more conciliatory tone amid protests over Gaza. “The president and I are working around the clock every day to get that ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home. I respect your voices, but we are here to now talk about the race in 2024,” she stated.Advocates have urged Harris to distance herself from Biden’s strong support for Israel and end arms shipments to the ally amid ongoing conflict.On the Republican side, Trump has continued to criticize Harris and Walz. In a lengthy press conference on Thursday, Trump dismissed them as weak candidates and claimed they were already falling in the polls. He expressed regret over not facing Biden in the election, suggesting Biden was unjustly removed from the Democratic ticket. Trump’s campaign has labeled the Harris-Walz ticket as ""every American’s nightmare,"" with Trump personally attacking Harris's intelligence and background. “She’s not doing any news conferences,” Trump said. “She doesn’t know how to do a news conference. She’s not smart enough to do a news conference.”As the 2024 election approaches, the dynamics in these key battleground states will likely play a crucial role in shaping the outcome.","Harris commands 50 percent support among voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, compared to Trump's 46 percent in each state.

US election: Improving her odds of winning? Kamala Harris aims to solidify Nevada as key Democratic stronghold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-improving-her-odds-of-winning-kamala-harris-aims-to-solidify-nevada-as-key-democratic-stronghold/articleshow/112436799.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris is working to secure Nevada as a critical battleground state for the upcoming November election. On Saturday, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, wrapped up a tour through key swing states with a focus on energizing voters in Nevada following President Joe Biden’s exit from the race and Harris's ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket.During the visit, Harris sought to bolster support among Latino voters , a key demographic in the state.Nevada was narrowly won by Biden in 2020 by 2.4 percentage points over Donald Trump, reported AP. This year, Trump is aiming to gain ground with promises to make workers' tips tax-free, a move targeting the state’s significant hotel, restaurant, and entertainment industries.The Culinary Workers Union , representing 60,000 workers in the hospitality sector, endorsed Harris on Friday. The union's endorsement is significant given that 54% of its members are Latino, 55% are women, and 60% are immigrants. “The path to victory runs through Nevada,” the union declared, vowing to support Harris and Walz in November.Additionally, the Adelante PAC , the political arm of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), endorsed Harris, marking a first for the 95-year-old organization. CEO Juan Proaño expressed concern about Trump’s potential return and its impact on the Latino community, emphasizing the necessity of supporting Harris.The visit also resonated with younger voters. Imer Cespedes-Alvarado, a political science major at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, noted the excitement and energy among students for Harris and Walz. “There’s an incredible energy here among the college students and community members,” he said.Harris is aiming to differentiate herself from Trump by focusing on issues like access to abortion and immigration reforms. She has criticized Trump’s handling of border security and his role in blocking a bipartisan deal on immigration, which Democrats argue was intended to boost his political standing.Trump has labeled Harris as the “worst border czar in history,” and his campaign has proposed mass deportations if he returns to the White House. However, AP VoteCast from 2020 revealed that nearly 70% of Nevada voters supported offering legal status to immigrants living in the US illegally.Support for Harris is visible across various voter groups. Krista Hall and Thaddeus Hager, attendees of the Las Vegas rally, expressed high enthusiasm for the campaign, comparing the excitement to that of Obama’s 2008 campaign. Meanwhile, in rural Douglas County, Gail Scott noted the increasing enthusiasm among younger voters, which could be pivotal in November.On the Republican side, Brian Shaw from northern Nevada noted that Harris’s candidacy could challenge Trump more than Biden’s did. He found Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance to be likable but not yet fully tested in the campaign.The Democratic ticket has been active in other critical states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, and previously planned visits to North Carolina and Georgia, which were postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby. Nevada’s role in the electoral landscape remains crucial as Harris and Walz continue their push for voter support in key states.","Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, wrapped up a tour through key swing states on Saturday.

'I don't want to die': Fourth-grader’s chilling 911 call from Uvalde school during mass shooting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-dont-want-to-die-fourth-graders-chilling-911-call-from-uvalde-school-during-mass-shooting-in-us/articleshow/112436717.cms,"Khloie Torres, a fourth-grade student at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, made a series of heart-wrenching 911 calls from inside her classroom during the shooting on May 24, 2022.“Please, I don’t want to die. My teacher is dead. Oh, my God”, Khloie could be heard saying on the call.When asked by the dispatcher if there were many people in the room with her, Khloie responded, ""No, it's just me and a couple of friends.A lot of people are,"" she says, pausing briefly, ""gone.""The release of the 911 calls, along with body camera footage and surveillance videos, came after a legal battle between Uvalde city officials and news organizations.The massacre , which claimed the lives of 19 students and two teachers at Robb elementary school, is considered one of the worst school shootings in US history. The delayed response from law enforcement , with nearly 400 officers waiting over 70 minutes before confronting the gunman, has been widely criticized as a massive failure.Families of the victims, such as Brett Cross, whose 10-year-old nephew Uziyah Garcia was killed, and Jesse Rizo, whose 9-year-old niece Jacklyn Cazares lost her life, expressed anger and frustration at the delayed release of information and the lack of accountability and transparency from authorities. They believed that a quicker response from law enforcement could have saved lives.The police response involved a significant number of officers from various agencies, including the US Border Patrol, state police, and school and city police. Despite the presence of officers in the hallway, they struggled to establish a command post and coordinate their actions, as evidenced by the radio traffic focused on setting up a perimeter and controlling traffic. It wasn't until 12:50 pm that a tactical team entered one of the classrooms and fatally shot the gunman, Salvador Ramos.Investigations by the US justice department and other agencies have revealed numerous problems in law enforcement's response, including a lack of urgency in establishing a command center, inadequate training, communication issues, and questionable prioritization of officers' lives over those of the children and teachers.Two responding officers, former Uvalde school Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school officer Adrian Gonzales, now face criminal charges of child abandonment and endangerment, to which they have pleaded not guilty.The tragedy led to families seeking accountability through lawsuits against law enforcement, social media, online gaming companies, and the gun manufacturer responsible for the rifle used by the gunman.","Khloie Torres, a fourth-grade student at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, made a series of heart-wrenching 911 calls from inside her classroom during the shooting on May 24, 2022. “Please, I don’t want to die.

Often called ""tidal waves,"" tsunamis are among the most powerful natural disasters in recorded human history. In contrast to ordinary ocean waves, tsunamis are caused by abrupt, large-scale events in or close to a body of water, such landslides, undersea earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions. These disturbances produce waves that move across oceans with enormous force and speed, becoming taller as they get closer to shallow coastal regions.The sheer force of tsunamis has the potential to completely destroy infrastructure, wreak havoc on coastal populations, and result in a high death toll. Because of their unparalleled devastation, several tsunamis have left enduring impressions on history over the ages. Here are the top 10 deadliest tsunamis ever recorded in human history.The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, hit Japan with a magnitude of 9.0. This tsunami caused catastrophic damage to Japan's northeastern coast and led to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The tsunami caused extensive economic damage and nuclear fallout.On December 26, 2004, one of the deadliest tsunamis in recorded history struck the Indian Ocean. Triggered by a massive undersea earthquake with a magnitude of 9.1-9.3, it affected countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, and several others. The tsunami resulted in entire communities being washed away.On December 26, 2003, a tsunami struck the coast of Iran following a magnitude 6.6 earthquake near Bam. The tsunami, combined with the earthquake's impact, led to the destruction of Bam and surrounding areas.The Valdivia earthquake, also known as the Great Chilean Earthquake, occurred on May 22, 1960, with a magnitude of 9.5, the strongest ever recorded. The tsunami affected Chile and spread across the Pacific Ocean, causing deaths in places as far away as Hawaii and Japan.On November 4, 1952, an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 struck the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. The resulting tsunami affected the Pacific Ocean, reaching as far as Hawaii and causing significant damage in the region.On December 28, 1908, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 struck the Strait of Messina between Sicily and mainland Italy. The resulting tsunami caused massive destruction in Messina and Reggio Calabria, killing an estimated 123,000 people. This event remains one of the deadliest tsunamis in European history.A magnitude 8.5 earthquake struck off the coast of Japan’s Sanriku region on June 15, 1896, triggering a massive tsunami. The waves hit the Japanese coast with enormous force, causing widespread destruction and killing many people. This event is often remembered for its sheer scale and impact on the local population.On August 13, 1868, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 8.5 struck off the coast of Peru. The resulting tsunami devastated coastal towns in Peru and Chile, particularly Arica (now in Chile). The waves were reported to have reached as far away as Hawaii.Following the earthquake of March 5, 1783, in Southern Italy, a tsunami struck the coast of Calabria. The earthquake, with a magnitude of around 7.9, triggered a tsunami that resulted in significant destruction and loss of life, with estimates of up to 50,000 deaths in the affected regions.Following the Lisbon earthquake on November 1, 1755, a devastating tsunami hit Portugal and its colonies. With an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, the tsunami ravaged Lisbon and other Portuguese coastal cities, resulting in approximately 10,000-100,000 deaths","Tsunamis are among the most powerful natural disasters in recorded human history.

Joy had earlier said he had no intention of joining politics.Talking to TOI over phone from his residence in Washington , DC on Thursday, Joy said, “I will do whatever it takes to save the party and its workers.If there is a need for me to join politics, I will not refrain from that. My mother would have retired from politics after the current term. I never had any political ambition and was settled in the US. But the developments in Bangladesh in the past few days show that there is a leadership vacuum. I had to get active for the sake of the party and I am at the forefront now.”His statements came after Khaleda Zia was released from house arrest and her son Tarique Rahman, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s acting chairman, is returning to Dhaka.Speaking on the day that an interim govt led by Nobel Prize winner Md Yunus took charge of Bangladesh, Joy said, “I am sure the Awami League will take part in the election and we might even win. We have the largest supporter base in Bangladesh.” Claiming his mother has no plan of seeking asylum in any country, he said, “For the time being, she is in India. She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim govt decides to hold an election in the country. I am thankful to PM Narendra Modi for saving my mother’s life at such short notice.”On Thursday, Joy’s sister Saima Wazed also made it clear she will continue in her role as the WHO regional director. “Heartbroken with the loss of life in my country Bangladesh that I love. So heartbroken that I cannot see and hug my mother during this difficult time. I remain committed to my role as RD WHO,” she wrote on X. In a later post, she wrote, “To everyone who has shown concern: as much as I would love to see Ma, I don’t want to compromise her whereabouts in any way.”Joy stressed there was a need for “introspection”. “There definitely were mistakes. When you run a country, a lot of decisions are made every day. Awami League believes in introspection and we were ready for that. But we did not get a chance to do that this time. We never realized the situation would escalate so fast even after accepting their demands,” Joy said.He also said an alliance of BNP and Jammat will not be able to save the minorities. “If the Awami League is not in power, the eastern border of India will not be secure. If there is an alliance of BNP and Jamaat, that may not be good for India as Jamaat will not refrain from militancy,” Joy said, requesting India to mount pressure on Bangladesh to hold elections soon.","Sajeeb Wazed Joy, son of former PM Sheikh Hasina, said he is ready to enter politics.

That was absolutely nothing personal,” she added. Although Mannevy was not present during the occurrence, she received information from a coworker who was on duty that evening.In a statement to The New York Post, The Peninsula Paris said: “In response to Ms Williams’ tweet, for whom we have the utmost admiration and respect, as we do for all our esteemed guests, we reiterate our deepest apologies that we were not able to offer her a table at our rooftop bar when she arrived with her family and without a reservation.”“We do always try to make space for walk-in guests but sometimes this is not possible,” they added.“On August 5th, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked, and the only unoccupied tables at that time belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L’Oiseau Blanc, which was also fully reserved.

The couple's joint appearance, their first since the explosive Oprah Winfrey interview, has been branded a ""car crash"" amid allegations of behind-the-scenes tension and anger, as reported by The Mirror.During a recent appearance on GB News, Royal author Angela Levin shared her take on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's latest interview, claiming that the Duchess of Sussex was ""screaming"" and ""very annoyed"" after the cameras stopped rolling, the Mirror reported.During the CBS Sunday Morning interview, the couple intended to discuss online harm and their philanthropic endeavors. However, the conversation took an unexpected turn when Meghan was questioned about her previously disclosed suicidal thoughts, which she reportedly did not expect. Royal author Angela Levin claims that Markle was visibly upset by the line of questioning, revealing a tense atmosphere that persisted off-camera.""After the interview was over, she was apparently screaming at the producers, very, very annoyed at what they had asked her,"" Levin said on Dan Wootton's show. ""You mustn't do that with Meghan because she's in control.

Harry appeared either bored or distracted, and Meghan’s icy stares seemed to convey dissatisfaction whenever he spoke. Broadcaster Dan Wootton remarked, “It certainly wasn’t a good 43rd birthday for the Duchess of Sussex, was it?”Levin further emphasized the strain in their dynamic, saying, ""Just the same as in and out of the interview, she couldn't stand Harry speaking. She would look at him with such harsh eyes and such a terrible expression on her face because she didn't want him to talk, I imagine. He is really lost at the moment... I think that he's in a very, very bad way.""The interview, which was meant to mark a fresh start in their public engagement, has instead raised questions about the couple’s relationship dynamics and their handling of media scrutiny. Branding it a “car crash,” Wootton commented on the failed attempt at damage control, noting the couple's awkward chemistry despite their united front.","Royal author Angela Levin claims that Meghan Markle was ""screaming"" and ""very annoyed"" after the CBS Sunday Morning interview.

US elections: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to face off in prime-time debate on September 10,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-to-face-off-in-prime-time-debate-on-september-10/articleshow/112389058.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to meet in a highly anticipated prime-time debate on September 10, as announced by ABC News on Thursday. This 90-minute showdown, expected to be held in Philadelphia, marks a pivotal moment in an unpredictable presidential campaign that has already seen significant twists and turns.The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Although the exact format and ground rules are still being finalized, it is likely that the event will proceed without a live audience, according to sources familiar with the plans.Notably, Trump had proposed three debates with major networks - September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with NBC, and September 25 with ABC. However, Harris has agreed to participate only in the September 10 debate with NBC. Harris has not yet provided reasons for declining the other proposed dates.This announcement follows Trump's initial agreement to debate President Joe Biden on the same date, an arrangement made months ago. However, after Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Trump questioned the validity of that commitment with Harris, leading to uncertainty over whether the debate would take place.Recent events, including Biden's exit and an assassination attempt on Trump, have drawn renewed attention to the presidential race, which had initially been shaping up as a repeat of the 2020 election. The upcoming ABC debate is expected to serve as a critical moment in the campaign's final stretch leading up to the election.Trump has also indicated his willingness to engage in additional debates with Harris, proposing events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. However, the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these additional debates. NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate on September 25, but Harris has not committed to participating. Similarly, no agreement has been reached for a debate hosted by Fox News.","The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis.

US election: Did Trump freeze for over 21-second at Montana rally? Speech video sparks debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-did-trump-freeze-for-over-21-second-at-montana-rally-speech-video-sparks-debate/articleshow/112436472.cms,"Viral video and social media reactions

Supporters offer alternative explanation

Campaign disruptions

A video from former President Donald Trump’s rally in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday has gone viral, with social media users debating whether Trump experienced a 21-second freeze during his speech. The Trump-Vance campaign has yet to comment on the incident.The video, posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) shortly after the rally, shows Trump pausing for an extended period while speaking.The moment has sparked speculation online, with some viewers suggesting it might indicate a “glitch” or “brain freeze.”One user tweeted, “I feel like everyone needs to see Trump glitching for a full 21 seconds at his Bozeman rally last night. Nobody even tried to check on him. This is elder abuse. He’s way too old to be up that late.”Another critic added, “Trump had a brain freeze for 21 sec and the press are not screaming for him to step down. This tells you all you need to know on how corrupt our US press are right now.”In response, some of Trump’s supporters defended him, suggesting that the pause was due to a medical emergency involving someone in the audience rather than any personal issue.One supporter argued, “Trump did not 'freeze' or 'glitch' in Montana last night. Someone had a medical emergency and Trump waited for them to be taken off. The lies are just never ending.”While another said, ""There was a medical emergency in the crowd and Trump was pausing while the lady was taken care of.""The controversy over the video follows other disruptions related to Trump’s campaign. Earlier on the day of the rally, Trump’s plane had to be diverted to Billings due to a mechanical issue, which caused a delay in his schedule.During the Bozeman rally, Trump focused on targeting three-term Senator Jon Tester, whom he failed to unseat in the 2018 election. The Trump campaign has not yet addressed the video or the surrounding controversy.As the discussion continues, the campaign’s response and any potential clarification on the incident remain awaited.","A video from former President Donald Trump's rally in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday has gone viral.

Broader context and historical parallels

Former President Donald Trump’s campaign accused Iran of orchestrating a hack and leak operation on Saturday, following the release of a 270-page dossier detailing the vulnerabilities of Ohio Senator JD Vance. The document, along with another concerning Florida Senator Marco Rubio, was sent to Politico from an AOL.com email address, the American digital newspaper said.The campaign has confirmed that some of its internal communications were hacked, marking a significant security breach ahead of the 2024 presidential election.Hours after Politico disclosed receiving the materials, the Trump campaign responded by alleging a cyber attack and pointing fingers at Iran. “The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House. Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung told NBC News.Politico reported that the AOL email, using the alias “Robert,” began sending internal Trump campaign communications on July 22.Among the leaked documents was a 271-page report titled “POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES,” detailing perceived weaknesses of JD Vance.The anonymous source claimed to possess a variety of documents from Trump’s legal and campaign discussions. When questioned about the source of the documents, “Robert” advised Politico not to inquire further, citing legal and personal risks.The scope of the breach remains unclear, but it is a significant security lapse for Trump’s campaign.This incident adds to the list of cybersecurity challenges faced by Trump.It brings to mind the 2016 hacking of top Democratic Party officials ahead of the presidential election, which led to the release of damaging emails and was later attributed to Russian interference. That breach and the subsequent investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, while not resulting in criminal charges against Trump, revealed a campaign willing to exploit such materials.In 2020, Trump's X account was compromised after a hacker guessed his password, ‘maga2020!’. More recently, the Department of Justice charged a Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, with ties to Iran, in connection with an alleged assassination plot targeting Trump.Iranian officials have yet to comment on the allegations, and the US intelligence community has not publicly confirmed the identity of the hackers responsible for the breach.The Biden administration has not yet commented on the alleged hack.As the 2024 election approaches, this hacking incident adds to the growing concerns over cybersecurity and foreign interference in the US democratic process.","The Trump campaign has accused Iran of orchestrating a hack and leak operation.

"Uvalde school shooting: 911 call from shooter's uncle shows missed opportunity to stop tragedy, timeline unveiled",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uvalde-school-shooting-911-call-from-shooters-uncle-highlights-missed-opportunity-to-stop-tragedy-timeline-unveiled/articleshow/112436417.cms,"A scathing Justice Department report has shed new light on the law enforcement response during the tragic Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde , Texas, last year. Released earlier this year, the report includes a minute-by-minute account of the police's missteps during the horrific incident that claimed the lives of 19 students and two teachers.Audio recordings released by Uvalde city officials on Saturday include a 911 call from the shooter's uncle, Armando Ramos, who begged authorities to let him talk to his nephew, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, in hopes of de-escalating the situation.“Maybe he could listen to me because he does listen to me, everything I tell him he does listen to me,” Ramos pleaded, his voice cracking with emotion. Despite his desperate offer, the attempt came too late. Salvador Ramos was fatally shot by officers at 12:50 pm, nearly 77 minutes after entering the school.The records, which include a massive collection of audio and video recordings, were released after a prolonged legal battle. The Associated Press and other news organizations sued for access to the information after Uvalde officials initially refused to make the records public.The delayed law enforcement response has drawn widespread condemnation. Nearly 400 officers, including 150 US Border Patrol agents and 91 state police officials, waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the gunman, who had barricaded himself in a classroom filled with children and teachers. During this time, terrified students made desperate 911 calls from inside the classroom, and frantic parents outside the building pleaded with officers to take action.The Justice Department report and previous investigations by Texas lawmakers have exposed a series of failures in training, communication, leadership, and technology among the responding officers. Families of the victims have long demanded accountability for the slow police response, which is now regarded as a massive failure.The report also includes a reconstruction of the events on May 24, 2022:11:21 am — The gunman, Salvador Ramos, shoots and wounds his grandmother at their home before sending a message to an acquaintance about his plans to “shoot up an elementary school.”11:28 am — Ramos crashes a vehicle into a ditch near Robb Elementary School.11:33 am — He enters the school through an unlocked door and begins shooting inside two connected fourth-grade classrooms.11:36 am — The first responding officers enter the school but retreat after being hit by shrapnel.11:39 am — A city police officer requests shields, and officers begin treating the situation as a barricaded subject rather than an active shooter.12:21 pm — Ramos fires additional shots inside the classrooms. Officers move into formation but do not enter the room.12:50 pm — Officers finally engage and fatally shoot Ramos after he emerges from a closet while firing at them.The aftermath of the shooting has led to criminal charges against two responding officers. Former Uvalde school Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school officer Adrian Gonzales have pleaded not guilty to charges of child abandonment and endangerment. Meanwhile, families of the victims continue to seek justice and accountability, with some filing lawsuits against law enforcement, social media companies, online gaming companies, and the gun manufacturer.Brett Cross, who lost his 10-year-old nephew Uziyah Garcia in the shooting, expressed frustration with the slow release of information and the lack of transparency. ""If we thought we could get anything we wanted, we’d ask for a time machine to go back in time and save our children, but we can’t, so all we are asking for is for justice, accountability, and transparency, and they refuse to give this to us,"" Cross said.The Uvalde massacre remains one of the deadliest school shootings in US history, and the revelations from the Justice Department report have only intensified the calls for systemic change in how such crises are handled.","A scathing Justice Department report has shed new light on the law enforcement response during the tragic Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last year.

Asif Merchant: Who is Asif Merchant? Pakistani man with ties to Iran charged in assassination plots in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/who-is-asif-merchant-pakistani-man-with-ties-to-iran-charged-in-assassination-plots-in-us/articleshow/112328015.cms,"Who is Asif Merchant?

Asif Raza Merchant was charged in a complaint unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn with murder-for-hire as part of a scheme to assassinate a politician or US government officials on its soil. Law enforcement said they foiled the charged plot before any attack could be carried out. Merchant, who has stated that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan, is in federal custody in New York. US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said that working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of US government officials on American soil. According to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. FBI director Christopher Wray said the ""dangerous murder-for-hire"" plot allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook. In April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source. In early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a ""finger gun"" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant stated that the intended victims would be ""targeted here"", meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official. Merchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.

The plot by Asif Merchant

A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant , has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil. Prosecutors in Brooklyn announced criminal charges against Asif Merchant, accusing him of travelling to New York for the purposes of trying to hire a hitman for the assassinations. The plot was disrupted before it could be carried out.The document did not name any potential target but CNN reported that former president Donald Trump and other current and former US government officials might be the targets of the plot.Trump was shot at by Thomas Crooks at a Pennsylvania rally last month in which the shooter was killed. This attempt was unrelated to the life threat that Trump had from Iran. US officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump.Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement: ""The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.""Merchant said, as revealed by the document, that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified ""party"" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to ""finalize"" the plan and leave the United States.In mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a ""political person"".Merchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.On June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance. Merchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12 when law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country.(With agency inputs)","A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil.

Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy. For a nation largely comprising very young people, this would be an unmitigated disaster as it could have repercussions that may spill over generations. Already struggling to compete, the Pakistpeople will end up being deprived of even more chances to realise their potential and contribute positively on a global scale,"" the editorial said.According to the website DataReportal, there were 71.70 million active social media user identities in Pakistan in January 2024. YouTube is Pakistan's most-used social media platform in 2024 with a potential ad audience of 71.70 million. Data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 54.38 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Pakistan at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 38.9 per cent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.Meanwhile, according to Samaa TV, the Pakistan government has made previous attempts to regulate VPN usage by requiring registration, but these efforts have not resulted in significant action. In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions. The PTA also passed VPN regulations in 2010, but enforcement has been inconsistent.","Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others.

He said that the party's forthcoming power show in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swabi was aimed at raising a ""strong voice"" for the release of the PTI founder and other detained leaders.""This country will only be governed in accordance with the law and the Constitution,"" Qaiser emphasised.During his address, Qaiser also rebuked the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government over skyrocketing power bills. He said the bloated electricity bills were ""unacceptable"" for the inflation-hit masses.The PTI leader also said that they support Jamaat-e-Islami's (JI) sit-in - underway on Rawalpindi's Murree Road since July 26 - against the massive hike in power bills.However, JI Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman has said that his party would not become part of the PTI proposed grand alliance as history suggests that the opposition parties use such platforms for self-interest.""We will have the same stance as the opposition parties on some issues and hold meetings with them, but we will not become part of any alliance,"" Naeem said on Thursday.Ayub, while addressing the same press conference, appealed to the masses to attend the public gathering in Swabi on August 5 in large numbers from across the country to show solidarity with the former premier.Responding to criticism against the PTI founder for demanding negotiations with the Pakistan Army, Ayub said that they did not hold any discussion regarding the dialogue, however, he added that Khan made it clear that the military belongs to the nation and vice versa.He further said that the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were trying to drive a wedge between the military and the nation.Commenting on the cases against the jailed ex-prime minister, the opposition leader said that they were fighting a legal battle for Khan's release. Ayub blamed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for stopping the release of former first lady Bushra Bibi despite having no connections with the Toshakhana corruption case.The PTI secretary general demanded Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq to recuse themselves from hearing the PTI founder's cases, Geo News reported.The PTI believes he is being arrested in more cases at the behest of the powerful military establishment to make sure that he does not come out of jail.Khan was first arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a 190-million-pound corruption case. He faces over 200 cases and has been in jail since August last year.","Imran Khan has approved the formation of a ""grand opposition alliance"" by expanding the existing platform.

Baloch National Movement: UK Baloch National Movement plans protest against Pakistan atrocities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/uk-baloch-national-movement-plans-protest-against-pakistan-atrocities/articleshow/112220555.cms,"QUETTA: The United Kingdom chapter of the Baloch National Movement (BNM) announced on Friday that it would hold a protest in London's Trafalgar Square on August 5 over atrocities committed by Pakistan against the peaceful people of Balochistan .In a post on X, BNM stated, ""The BNM UK chapter has announced a protest against the violent actions of the state of Pakistan aimed at stopping the peaceful Baloch Raaji Muchi.This protest is part of a series of demonstrations called on by Baloch National Movement Chairman Dr Naseem Baluch with participation from all BNM chapters"" with participation from all BNM chapters.The human rights abuses in Balochistan continue to rise each day as Pakistani security forces inflict brutalities on Baloch protesters intending to participate in the Baloch National Gathering (Baloch Raaji Muchi).Reports have suggested that authorities have employed excessive force, deliberately targeting the protesters of the BRM. This act is seen as a severe violation of the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression protected under international law.Notably, this critical situation in Balochistan has garnered international attention from global human rights organizations , lawmakers, and activists.Previously, UK lawmaker John McDonnell introduced a resolution in the UK Parliament condemning the heinous actions of Pakistani security forces against peaceful protests in Balochistan.Similarly, PAANK social media coordinator and Baloch rights activist Jamal Baloch also organized a protest in front of the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands this week.During the protest, Jamal urged the international community to work together to stop the ongoing violence in Balochistan. Over the past five days, a large number of people have been killed and injured by Pakistani forces due to open fire incidents across Balochistan.Meanwhile, protesters alleged that Pakistani defence forces are trying to prevent them from participating in nationwide gatherings that hold the government and defence forces accountable for their ""brutality"" against the Baloch community.Previously, the international human rights watchdog Human Rights Watch released a statement urging Pakistani authorities to show restraint, release all those detained for peaceful protest, and restore internet access.In the same statement, Patricia Gossman , Associate Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, emphasised the need for Pakistani authorities to respect the right to peaceful protest and use only ""necessary force when nonviolent means fail.""",The United Kingdom chapter of the Baloch National Movement (BNM) announced on Friday that it would hold a protest in London's Trafalgar Square on August 5.

Bangladesh’s beautiful terracotta temples find unlikely saviours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshs-beautiful-terracotta-temples-find-unlikely-saviours/articleshow/112436225.cms,"On the evening of Aug 5, Dhaka bookshop owner Shahadat Zaman put out a Facebook post saying he would be at the Rajarbag Kali temple for a nightlong vigil. Soon, some 25 locals cutting across religious groups offered to join him. Hours earlier, Sheikh Hasina had resigned as Bangladesh PM and fled the country, even as targeted attacks by miscreants on temples and religious monuments of other minorities intensified.The motley crowd of volunteers divided themselves into two groups — one for the Kali temple and the other for the Dharmarajika Bauddha Vihara, the first Buddhist monastery of Dhaka. They stayed up all night guarding these two places of worship.While there have been targeted attacks on Hindus and their places of worship, some Bangladeshis want to preserve the shared heritage the temples represent. “Some people have used social media to form committees and protect temples, houses and businesses of minorities, even calling for help if there are robberies. Students have volunteered to clean up vandalised temples,” says Zaman.Shared roots in temple roofs Pratyya Ghosh, a mathematics student at Dhaka University, says govt records put the temples of Bangladesh at more than 40,000, excluding family shrines. Many of them came up during the Bhakti movement.These temples, some of them beautiful terracotta structures, have endured natural disasters, political upheavals and religious conflicts . “Growing up in Dhaka, I visited temples within the city such as the Dhakeshwari Temple, Ramna Kali Temple and Ramkrishna Mission,” he says.A native of Bogura district, Muslim YouTuber Salahuddin Sumon is known for his videos on Hindu temples and heritage sites in Bangladesh and a few Indian states. “I had always been interested in history and, while roaming the villages of Bangladesh, I was moved by its abandoned raj baris, temples and zamindar houses in ruins. People would pose in front of them for selfies but no one really knew their back stories. So, I decided to document them,” says Sumon, who intends to keep recording Hindu temples and houses.“In fact, I will do a better job of it because the dictator has left. The perception that Hindus are unsafe without the Awami League is exactly what a new Bangladesh wants to come out of. The country now belongs to everyone,” he says.Rumours rife with rising strife According to some reports, around a dozen Hindu temples were attacked last week but there were also a few false claims. “A lot of it is rumour mongering,” claims Aal Maruf Russell, a Bangladeshi archaeologist. Russell has partnered with Kolkata-based Immersive Trails to conduct a ‘backpacker’s tour’ of Rajshahi, one of the oldest cities in the country. His curated tour itinerary for Indian and Bangladesh travellers includes the temple town of Puthia.“There were hardly any heritage walks in Bangladesh till now but history buffs from both the nations want to know more. In Puthia, you will find 13-14 temples in every 2 to 3 sq kms. It has a blend of colonial and Mughal architecture. So far, no temples there have been harmed in the ongoing turmoil,” he says, hopeful that an October trip will be on schedule as the interim govt takes charge. Puthia was also one of the oldest zamindar estates in undivided Bengal from the early 17th century.Zamindars had money, so they built temples. Kolkata-based travel writer and photographer Rangan Datta writes that the town is home to the Boro Shiv Mandir (built in 1823 with a complex pinnacle design) and Rath Mandir (dedicated to Lord Jagannath), both constructed under the patronage of the Puthia royalty. Other notable structures include the Dol Mandir, Puthia Rajbari, Boro Gobinda Mandir, Choto Shiv Mandir (a tiny char chala temple with fine terracotta ornamentation on its façade), and the ruins of Char Ani Rajbari.“The 18th century Kantajew Hindu temple in Dinajpur district is my favourite. It had the finest terracotta work in the whole of undivided Bengal,” says Datta.The temple panels illustrate stories from the Mahabharata and Ramayana. It has braved several natural calamities, including an earthquake in 1897, and has been meticulously restored. Datta also speaks of the Dhakeshwari temple that hosts the annual Durga Puja in Dhaka.It’s the largest Hindu temple in Bangladesh and one of the 51 Shakti Peeths. Built in the 12th century, the temple underwent several renovations before being declared the National Temple in 1996. Koushik Banerjee, founder of Kolkata-based Supreme Tours and Travels, has been conducting customised Shakti Peeth tours in Bangladesh for a decade now as seven of the sites fall in the country. But he has been forced to cancel all bookings now. “Things have changed dramatically. It will be harder for us to pitch Bangladesh as a safe destination for religious tourists now,” he says.","Some Bangladeshis want to preserve the shared heritage the temples represent.

"Amid attacks, Bangladeshi Hindus stage biggest street protest yet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/amid-attacks-bangladeshi-hindus-stage-biggest-street-protest-yet/articleshow/112436160.cms,"Large Crowd Forms at India-Bangladesh Border Amid Political Crisis and Escalating Tensions

DHAKA : The head of Bangladesh’s interim govt , “chief adviser” Prof Muhammad Yunus , condemned on Saturday the attacks on minority communities , calling them “heinous”. “Are they not people of this country? You have been able to save the country, can’t you save some families,” he asked as the Hindu community held its biggest street demonstration yet, seeking safety and security and calling for justice.“You must say—no one can harm them. They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together,” Prof Yunus said during a session with students at Begum Rokeya University. He urged students to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.Thousands of protesters demonstrated in major cities like Dhaka, Chattogram, Barisal, Tangail and Kurigram saying that Hindus have a right to live in Bangladesh.They blocked the Shahbagh intersection in Dhaka for the second consecutive day on Saturday to protest against attacks on homes, shops, and temples in various parts of the country following the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt.“August 2024: Save Bangladeshi Hindus. We Want Justice and Safety,” read a placard held by a young woman. Others chanted slogans like “Save the Hindus”, “Why are my temples and homes being looted? We want answers”, “Hindu persecution in independent Bangladesh, it will not continue”, “Religion is for individuals, the state is for everyone”, and “Ensure the safety of Hindus”.The Hindu minorities demonstrating in Shahbag demanded security for the Hindus and their homes, temples and businesses, the arrest of those who perpetrated violence against them, and compensation for vandalism, loot and torture.Members of minority communities in Bangladesh faced at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts since the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt on Aug 5, according to two Hindu organisations — Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad — in the country. Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have been trying to flee to neighbouring India to escape the violence.","Thousands of protesters demonstrated in major cities like Dhaka, Chattogram, Barisal, Tangail and Kurigram.
