Why were the students protesting, and what are their demands?

What has been the reaction from authorities and the public?

In a significant escalation of campus tensions, New York City police officers entered Columbia University late Tuesday and arrested pro-Palestinian protesters. The law enforcement action came in response to a prolonged occupation by students who had taken over Hamilton Hall and maintained a tent encampment for nearly two weeks. This police intervention follows a direct call from Mayor Eric Adams earlier in the day, declaring that the ongoing protest ""must end now.""Live television footage captured the dramatic scene as helmeted officers in tactical gear stormed the prestigious Ivy League campus in upper Manhattan.Officers were seen entering Hamilton Hall, where protesters had barricaded themselves, using ladders to access upper floors while others dismantled the nearby encampment amid jeers and chants of ""Shame, shame!"" from onlooking students.Here is all you need to know about these protests:The NYPD intervened at Columbia University after protesters occupied Hamilton Hall and set up a tent encampment on the campus. The university administration had authorized police action following an escalation in protest activities, including breaking windows and seizing control of the building, which had been renamed ""Hind's Hall"" by demonstrators in memory of a Palestinian child killed in Gaza.The protests occurred at Columbia University in upper Manhattan, New York. However, similar demonstrations have spread across various US universities from California to Massachusetts, indicating a nationwide movement among students opposing Israel's actions in Gaza and demanding university divestments from companies they claim are profiting from the conflict.The student protesters are calling for Columbia University and other institutions to divest from companies involved in the Israeli military operations in Gaza. Their occupation and demonstrations are part of a broader push to protest what they see as injustices in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, aligning with wider protests across the country following Israel’s offensive in Gaza triggered by a Hamas attack on southern Israel.Authorities, including the NYPD and university administration, have expressed concerns about safety and disruptions caused by the protests, leading to the forceful intervention to clear the protesters. Public reactions have been mixed, with some criticizing the protests as anti-Semitic while others support the students' right to advocate for Palestinian rights.

Most airports have such equipment installed.The Finnish airline said it did not know where the interference originated but that there had been an increase in incidents since 2022. The carrier has reported similar problems near Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave and Finland’s eastern border with Russia.“GPS interference in Estonian airspace by RF (Russian Federation) has affected civil aviation in our region. In doing so Russia violates international regulations,” Estonia’s minister of foreign affairs Margus Tsahkna said on X late on Monday. He did not provide evidence to support the claim.Neither the Kremlin nor Russia’s defence ministry immediately replied to requests for comment.GPS interference is now taking place at lower altitudes and in a wider area than six months ago, the head of the Finnish Pilots’ Association’s safety and security committee said. “It has begun to come to the north side of the Gulf of Finland as well. And the same has happened in Sweden, where it has reached the Swedish airspace,” said Lauri Soini, himself a Finnair pilot.The EU Aviation Safety Agency’s is not monitoring interferences in real time but open-source information showed high interference in the area on the day the two planes were diverted, a spokesperson said.Rerouting to alternate airports with better landing aids is however not seen as a safety issue but rather an operational one, the spokesperson said in a written comment.Tsahkna said Estonia would address the issue with other Nato and EU countries and that he had discussed it with his Latvian, Lithuanian, Finnish and Swedish counterparts.Germany this month said Russia was very likely behind a series of disturbances affecting navigation in the Baltic region.

Report: US drug regulator to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/report-us-drug-regulator-to-reclassify-marijuana-as-a-less-dangerous-drug/articleshow/109742691.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US drug enforcement administration will move to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, AP has learned, a historic shift to generations of American drug policy that could have wide ripple-effects across the country. The DEA ’s proposal, which still must be reviewed by the White House office of management and budget, would recognise the medical uses of cannabis and acknowledge it has less potential for abuse than some of the nation’s most dangerous drugs.However, it would not legalise marijuana outright for recreational use.The agency’s move, confirmed to the AP on Tuesday by five people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity, clears the last significant regulatory hurdle before the agency’s biggest policy change in over 50 years can take effect.Once OMB signs off, the DEA will take public comment on the plan to move marijuana from its current classification as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin and LSD. It moves pot to Schedule III , alongside ketamine and some anabolic steroids, following a recommendation from the federal health and human services department. After the public-comment period the agency would publish the final rule.It comes after Prez Biden called for a review of federal marijuana law in Oct 2022, and has moved to pardon thousands of Americans convicted federally of simple possession of the drug. He has also called on governors and local leaders to take similar steps to erase marijuana convictions. “Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It’s time that we right these wrongs,” Biden said in Dec. The election year announcement could help Biden, a Democrat, boost flagging support, particularly among younger voters.Schedule III drugs are still controlled substances and subject to rules and regulations, and people who traffic in them without permission could still face federal criminal prosecution. Some critics argue the DEA shouldn’t change course on marijuana, saying rescheduling isn’t necessary and could lead to harmful side effects.","US drug enforcement administration will move to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, AP has learned.

NEW YORK: Dozens of protesters took over a building at Columbia University in New York early Tuesday, barricading entrances and unfurling a Palestinian flag from a window in the latest escalation of demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war on college campuses across the US. The school promised they would face expulsion .The occupation at Columbia — where protesters shrugged off an ultimatum to abandon a tent encampment Monday or be suspended — unfolded as other universities stepped up efforts to clear out encampments.Police swept through some campuses, spurring confrontations with protesters and plenty of arrests. In rarer instances, university officials and protest leaders have struck agreements to restrict the disruption to campus life.Protesters on Columbia’s campus locked arms in front of Hamilton Hall early Tuesday and carried furniture and metal barricades to the building, video footage showed. Posts on an Instagram page for protest organisers shortly after midnight urged people to protect the encampment and join them. A “Free Palestine” banner hung from a window. Hamilton Hall is an academic building that opened in 1907 and is named after Alexander Hamilton, who attended King’s College, Columbia’s original name.The takeover occurred nearly 12 hours after Monday’s 2pm EST deadline for the protesters to leave an encampment of around 120 tents or face suspension. On Tuesday, Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said, “Students occupying the building face expulsion.” He said those who didn’t agree to the terms from Monday were being suspended. “Protesters have chosen to escalate to an untenable situation — vandalising property”. Columbia administrators closed the Manhattan campus Tuesday to everyone but students who live in dorms there and employees who provide essential services. There was just one access point into and out of campus. New York police department chief Jeffrey Maddrey, speaking at a news conference, said police won’t enter Columbia’s campus without a request from the college administration or an imminent emergency. Protesters insisted they will remain at the hall until the university agrees to three demands: divestment, financial transparency and amnesty.At many campuses, including Columbia, the conflict over protests appeared to be coming to a head. The standoffs have drawn concern from the White House. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Prez Biden believes students occupying an academic building is “absolutely the wrong approach,” and “not an example of peaceful protest”.Police had begun arresting demonstrators at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where they had occupied a building for more than a week. At Portland State University in Oregon, students have taken over a library. Yale authorities cleared a protesters’ encampment after students heeded final warnings. Demonstrators said they were moving their gathering to a sidewalk area. The encampment was set up Sunday, six days after police arrested 44 students.Dozens of people were arrested Monday during protests at universities in Texas, Utah, Virginia and New Jersey. At the University of Texas, 79 involved in the Monday protest were jailed. In a rare case, Northwestern University reached a deal with student protesters on its campus near Chicago. It allows peaceful protests through the end of spring classes in exchange for some concessions.Hamilton Hall has been occupied several times by student activists over the past half-century. Some of the notable moments of student protest at the building.Hundreds of students held a demonstration to protest the Vietnam War as well as plans to build a gymnasium in nearby Harlem that activists claimed would effectively be segregated.Students also locked themselves in Hamilton Hall during more anti-war protests.About 150 students blockaded the building for nearly three weeks, demanding that Columbia end indirect investments in South Africa because of the nation’s racist apartheid policy.Students occupied it in protest of Columbia’s plans to turn the Audubon Theater and Ballroom, where Malcolm X had been assassinated in 1965, into a biomedical research complex. Blockade lasted less than a day.",Dozens of protesters took over a building at Columbia University in New York early Tuesday.

IMF approves last tranche of $3-billion loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-approves-last-tranche-of-3-billion-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/109738150.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Pakistan

PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism Tuesday regarding release of

’s final $1.1 billion

tranche

of a $3 billion

bailout

to the country, saying it would bolster

economic stability

.

Pakistan is now eyeing a new, longer and larger economic bailout package, but economists cautioned against the country’s continued reliance on overseas financial assistance, warning of potential dire consequences.

IMF approved the immediate release of the tranche following a key meeting of the global lender’s executive board in Washington late Monday night. All board members favoured releasing the funds, except India, which abstained.

Pakistan has been reeling from a severe economic crisis for more than two years, with its inflation at one point shooting up to nearly 38% and its foreign currency reserves depleted to $3bn in Feb 2023, enough to cover less than five weeks of imports.

Last year, the global lender had approved a nine-month standby arrangement with Pakistan “to support its economic stabilisation programme”. The approval had allowed for an immediate disbursement of $1.2bn, with the rest phased over the programme’s duration — subject to two quarterly reviews.

The IMF bailout proved important to save the country from default, the state broadcaster quoted PM Sharif as saying.

Leading economist Qaiser Bengali expressed scepticism about the perceived stability, highlighting the temporary nature of the current situation and underscoring the necessity of meaningful reforms to address long-term economic challenges.

“If the so-called stability was due to a rise in exports or better inflow of dollars, that would have been meaningful, but that is not happening,” Bengali said, adding that the economy cannot run on a policy of getting new loans to pay past loans.

Pakistan’s external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.","PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism regarding release of final $1.1 billion tranche.

Merchan had imposed the gag order to prevent Trump from criticising witnesses and others involved in the case.The judge fined Trump $1,000 for each of nine online statements that he said violated his order not to criticise witnesses or other participants in the trial. Prosecutors had flagged 10 posts as possible violations. The posts, made between April 10 and April 17, included an article calling his former lawyer Michael Cohen a “serial liar”. Cohen is expected to be a key witness in the trial. Another post quoted a Fox News pundit who claimed “undercover liberal activists” were trying to sneak onto the jury.Merchan rejected Trump’s argument that he could not be held liable for “reposts” of material he did not write himself. Merchan will consider whether to impose further penalties for other statements at a hearing Thursday. The judge also ordered Trump to remove the statements from his Truth Social account and his campaign website by 2.15pm EDT.Trump has argued that the gag order violates his free speech rights, and his lawyer Todd Blanche told Merchan last week that the statements at issue were responses to political attacks. Merchan noted that Blanche was unable to provide any evidence that the expected witnesses had attacked Trump before he insulted them.The $9,000 fine, due by Friday, is a relatively small penalty for Trump, who has already posted $266.6 million in bonds as he appeals civil judgments in two other cases. Imprisonment, however, would be an unprecedented twist in the firstcriminal trial of a former US prez. It is unclear whether Trump would be sent to New York City’s jail on Rikers Island, or whether security concerns would require more lenient treatment, such as home confinement in his Trump Tower.Judge’s order came as the trial resumed with testimony from banker Banker Garry Farro who said Cohen used a shell company to wire $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels ’ lawyer in exchange for her silence about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump in 2006.","Donald Trump fined $1,000 for each of nine online statements that he said violated his order not to criticise witnesses or other participants in the trial.

Prosecutors had flagged 10 posts as possible violations.The posts, made between April 10 and April 17, included an article calling his former lawyer Michael Cohen a ""serial liar."" Cohen is expected to be a prominent witness in the trial.Another post quoted a Fox News pundit who claimed ""undercover liberal activists"" were trying to sneak onto the jury. Merchan rejected Trump's argument that he could not be held liable for ""reposts"" of material he did not write himself.Merchan will consider whether to impose further penalties for other statements at a hearing on Thursday. The judge also ordered Trump to remove the statements from his Truth Social account and his campaign website on Tuesday.Trump said Merchan had taken away his free speech rights. ""I am the only Presidential Candidate in History to be GAGGED. This whole 'Trial' is RIGGED,"" he wrote on Truth Social.Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche has argued that the statements at issue were responses to political attacks, but Merchan noted that Blanche was unable to provide any evidence that the expected witnesses had attacked Trump before he insulted them.The $9,000 fine, due by Friday, is a relatively small penalty for Trump, who has already posted $266.6 million in bonds as he appeals civil judgments in two other cases.Imprisonment, however, would be an unprecedented twist in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president.If that happened, it is unclear whether Trump would be sent to New York City's jail on Rikers Island or whether security concerns would require more lenient treatment, such as home confinement in his Trump Tower triplex. As a former president, he remains under Secret Service protection.Trump, the Republican candidate in the 2024 presidential election is charged with falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump in 2006.Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied having sex with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.Lawyer Keith Davidson, who worked with Daniels to sell her story, said interest picked up in 2016 after audio from the ""Access Hollywood"" TV show was released that portrayed Trump making crude remarks about women.Davidson had previously sold the story of another woman who claimed to have had an affair with Trump, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to the National Enquirer tabloid.He said he leveraged an offer from the ABC television network, which he said promised efforts to feature her as a contestant on the ""Dancing With the Stars"" show.The Enquirer never ran McDougal's story, in a practice known as ""catch and kill"" that Davidson said was meant to protect Trump.The Enquirer's former publisher, David Pecker, testified last week that he used the Enquirer to suppress negative stories about Trump ahead of the 2016 election.Trump has denied having an affair with McDougal.Trump is required to attend the trial and has said he could instead be campaigning ahead of his rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.The criminal case is one of four pending against Trump, but could be the only one to go to trial and result in a verdict before the election.","Donald Trump fined $1,000 for each of nine online statements that he said violated his order not to criticize witnesses or other participants in the trial.

He also tripped over his words at least 118 times during statements, speeches, or comments. White House staff have had to make corrections to official transcripts in order to align the president's words with public policy stances or to change the meaning of his statements entirely, according to a report from AFP.In some cases, Biden has misidentified leaders of other countries, such as France, Egypt, and Mexico, or has given the wrong names or titles for people, places, or groups at least 20 times during his remarks.Notably, during a recent speech at the North America’s building trades unions national legislative conference, Biden , reading from a teleprompter, omitted a scripted “pause” which was later rectified.The White House staff have also edited in words to appease their coalition or to reflect Biden's stated reasoning for decisions, such as his Supreme Court nominations and his choice of Vice President Kamala Harris.The president has also struggled with numbers, falsely inflating spending by the executive branch or efforts to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19.Errors in his State of the Union Address, where he mistakenly claimed “every American voted against” his 2021 American Rescue Plan, have also been rectified.Biden made several notable flubs, including accidentally stating support for ""threats to democracy"" and mispronouncing the name of a Georgia nursing student who was killed by an illegal migrant.The White House transcript included 13 emendations to Biden's speech, while none were made to former President Donald Trump 's last address to Congress in February 2020.The mixups amended by Biden's staff do not include dubious suggestions about his personal history or career in public service, such as his recent claim that cannibals ate his uncle during World War II.While Trump also made some verbal missteps during his presidency, the analysis found that he stumbled over less significant words and did so less frequently compared to Biden.","Biden has misidentified leaders of other countries, such as France, Egypt, and Mexico, or has given the wrong names or titles for people, places, or groups at least 20 times during his remarks.

""Congress must act to crack down on it because these universities and college presidents and administrators are failing in their responsibility to keep these students safe, and to ensure that there is a free exchange of ideas, but based in truth and reality, and not antisemitic rhetoric, designed to threaten and target Jewish students,"" he said.The debate on these campuses has escalated into a broader conversation about the role of federal funding in higher education, especially regarding how universities address hate speech and maintain a safe environment for all students. Trey Gowdy highlighted the issue of ""tax dollars or public moneys"" being used to fund institutions that fail to condemn or effectively manage racist and antisemitic activities.In response to what he perceives as a widespread administrative failure, Lawler has introduced the Stop Antisemitism on College Campuses Act. This legislation proposes stripping federal funding, including student aid, from colleges that do not enforce antisemitism definitions and sanctions effectively. ""Bottom line to me is, you need to be able to define what antisemitism is, enforce it and if schools are failing in the enforcement, then they need to be stripped of federal dollars, including student aid,"" Lawler explained.Moreover, Lawler insinuated that the response to these protests would be more stringent and immediate if the demonstrations targeted other minority communities, such as Blacks, Hispanics, or members of the LGBTQ+ community.

McDougal became increasingly disillusioned when Enquirer publisher David Pecker failed to print her articles.""Pecker, a long-time friend of Trump and former chairman, president, and CEO of American Media Inc.

They had done it all to silence her.""The legal entanglements increased when McDougal sued AMI for breach of contract, leading to public disclosures of the payments. This lawsuit brought the arrangements into the public eye and tied them to broader legal implications regarding campaign finance laws. Rubin elaborated, ""He knew that paying her off to suppress her story with the goal of promoting Trump's election was unlawful.""Trump, who is currently the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, faces legal scrutiny in a historic trial. He has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records related to these payments.

The pre-action letter sent on Monday outlines his civil claim for damages for harassment abroad, physical injury, trespass to the person, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.“While in office, Shahzad highlighted army and ISI interference with his accountability and anti-corruption objectives. Believing that he could not fix the rampant corruption in Pakistan, he resigned from Khan’s government in Jan 2022,” a spokesperson for UK law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Akbar, said. On April 17, 2022, he fled to London.“He continues to campaign against corruption in Pakistan and remains highly critical of the military establishment and govt officials,” the spokesperson added.Akbar said: “Compared to what was done to me, I believe a lot worse is being inflicted on dissidents in Pakistan by the current regime. They are targeting political workers, lawyers, judges andjournalists. However, what should be most alarming is that Pakistan is able to target its dissidents on British soil without any accountability.”A spokesperson for Hertfordshire constabulary confirmed to TOI it was investigating the acid attack and was appealing for witnesses and to trace the motorbike the suspects rode. No arrests have been made.The Pakistan high commission in London said: “The govt rejects all such attempts to malign the reputation of its institutions for motivated agendas.”A spokesperson for the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said last Dec, when asked about the attack: “We reject any insinuations of Pakistan's involvement and that of Pakistani agencies in such a heinous attack. It is not our policy to target our own nationals abroad. We hope that culprits in this case will be identified and treated as per UK law.”","Shahzad Akbar (46), a Pakistani citizen who fled to Britain after Khan was ousted, was nearly blinded in the attack in front of his young child at their home in Royston, Hertfordshire.

At the age of 73, Dar, a chartered accountant and experienced politician from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, was named deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday, with the appointment taking immediate effect and until further notice.Shehbaz Sharif and Dar are currently in Saudi Arabia for the World Economic Forum's (WEF) special meeting.According to the Dawn newspaper, Dar's new appointment ""took many by surprise, but drew hardly any criticism from its allies'.Dar being ""awarded' the ""rarely filled' slot of deputy prime minister has raised many questions, the report said.The main talking point is that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif wants to have his ""confidant' in a key position in the federal cabinet to ""compensate him for the loss of the finance portfolio', it said.The report mentioned that the action was also viewed in connection with Nawaz Sharif assuming leadership of the ruling PML-N party as its president, a position he had been deprived of after being convicted in the Panama Papers case.Dar is seen as having a close relationship with Nawaz Sharif because of the family connection through marriage, as his son is married to the elder Sharif's daughter.An insider claimed that the move to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister was ""pre-planned', the report said. During the formation of the coalition government, it was agreed that Dar would serve as the Deputy Prime Minister.However, based on a report from Geo News, the decision to appoint a four-time finance minister as the foreign minister indicates an increased focus on economics in the country's diplomacy as the financially struggling nation aims to obtain another deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and strengthen external financing from foreign capitals.Dar was the finance minister from 1998 to 1999 and then again from March to May 2008. He once more headed the finance ministry from 2013 to 2017 and later from 2022 to 2023. He additionally worked as the minister for industry and investment from February 1997 to July 1997, and also in commerce from December 1997 to October 1999.According to the report from Dawn, during Nawaz Sharif's tenure as the prime minister, Dar served as the de facto deputy prime minister, leading numerous government and parliamentary committees in the capacity of chairperson. Even though the Constitution does not include a provision for a deputy prime minister, Dar is the second legislator to assume this role.Chaudhry Parvez Elahi served as Deputy Prime Minister when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was in power from June 25, 2012, to June 29, 2013. During that period, his responsibilities were largely symbolic, and he was given recognition by then-President Asif Ali Zardari for his support of the government led by the PPP.Elahi is currently serving as the president of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party led by the jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, and he is in prison due to corruption allegations.Interestingly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the main ally of the PML-N-led government, did not raise any objection to Dar's new appointment. The PPP Information Secretary, Faisal Karim Kundi, stated that his party had no objections to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister. ""It is the PM's prerogative to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister,"" he said, adding that the move was not meant as a ""message' to anyone.Meanwhile, Khan's PTI on Monday reacted strongly to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister, saying ""Sharifs are distributing key national posts within the family'.""The Sharif family is distributing important national posts among themselves,"" Special Assistant to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister For Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said.The PTI leader criticized the federal government for appointing individuals to high-ranking positions instead of addressing the problems faced by the people as the Constitution does not provide for the position of deputy PM.Reacting to Dar's appointment, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob termed the PM Shehbaz Sharif-led government's move ""an extra-constitutional step that carries no substantial value'.""This just indicates intra-party tensions and competition for influence.

The decision was taken to support the Special Investment Facilitation Council ( SIFC ), the top civil-military body created last year to bring investment into the country.According to The Express Tribune, the Cabinet relaxed the public procurement legal framework to hire foreign consultancy firms to strengthen the SIFC to prepare various projects before offering them to foreign investors.""The foreign consultancy firms will be hired for five years as a replacement for Pakistani bureaucrats who are found lacking in project planning and execution, according to government sources,"" the paper reported.However, the decision will reflect poorly on the working of the bureaucracy, which could not provide quality assistance to the SIFC.The Cabinet has approved a summary through circulation on the advice of the SIFC, which recommended granting exemption due to the poor capacity of Pakistan's federal bureaucracy, confirmed a senior government official on Saturday.In case of circulation, the summary is approved without discussion in the regular cabinet meeting.The sources said that due to an incapacitated bureaucracy, Pakistan was struggling to prepare projects for investment by Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Kuwait.The development came a week after Pakistan offered highly lucrative returns to Saudi Arabia for getting a USD 5 billion investment.The government was jubilant over its presentation to the Saudi delegation, which appreciated Islamabad's preparedness compared to the past.However, the bureaucracy is not trained in certain skills and compared to the Pakistani delegation the Saudi Arabian delegation was far better prepared.One of the reasons for the lack of effective and efficient bureaucracy is that generalists are appointed as the secretaries of the economic ministries.These bureaucrats, mostly Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) officers, get expertise on the job and then they are moved to any other ministry.A federal secretary can at any time be appointed as secretary of finance, secretary of power, secretary of planning, secretary of the board of investment and secretary of petroleum without a requisite set of expertise.","The decision was taken to support the Special Investment Facilitation Council ( SIFC ), the top civil-military body created last year to bring investment into the country.

Explosion in Cambodia that killed 20 at an army base was likely caused by mishandling of ammunition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/explosion-in-cambodia-that-killed-20-at-an-army-base-was-likely-caused-by-mishandling-of-ammunition/articleshow/109724952.cms,"PHNOM PENH: A huge explosion in southwestern Cambodia over the weekend that killed 20 soldiers at an army base appears to have been an accident caused by mishandling of ammunition by troops, a senior military official said Tuesday.The Saturday afternoon blast in Kampong Speu province also destroyed military vehicles and four buildings at the base, and damaged homes in a nearby village.Army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Mao Phalla said the soldiers were transferring ammunition from trucks into a storage facility when the blast occurred, killing them instantly. He said another 11 people, including soldiers and nearby villagers, were slightly injured, mostly from debris from the damaged buildings, not shrapnel.Cambodia held a mass funeral on Sunday for those killed in the explosion.The initial but still not official theory was that the soldiers were unloading ammunition from a truck and stacking it on the ground before moving it into the storage facility, causing one item to explode, he said. That set off a chain reaction, added Mao Phalla.However, he said it will be difficult to determine the exact chain of events as all those involved in the unloading were killed.Mao Phalla said the site has been sealed off and that deminers from theCambodian Mines Action Center were clearing the area any unexploded ordnance.In March 2005, a nighttime blast at an arms depot in the northwestern provincial town of Battambang triggered an hourslong spray of shells and bullets that killed at least six people and caused panic.A 2014 report by the Swiss-based group Small Arms Survey highlighted the dangers of poorly stored or mishandled munitions, calling it a ""global problem."" It noted that from 1979 through 2013 there were more than 500 incidents involving unplanned explosions at munitions sites.","The Saturday afternoon blast in Kampong Speu province also destroyed military vehicles and four buildings at the base.

From spring offensive to charm offensive: The Taliban are working to woo tourists to Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-spring-offensive-to-charm-offensive-the-taliban-are-working-to-woo-tourists-to-afghanistan/articleshow/109713887.cms,"KABUL: Around 30 men are crammed into a Kabul classroom, part of the debut student cohort at a Taliban-run institute training tourism and hospitality professionals.It's a motley crew. One student is a model. Another is 17 and has no job history.The students vary in age, education level and professional experience. They're all men - Afghan women are banned from studying beyond sixth grade - and they don't know anything about tourism or hospitality.But they are all eager to promote a different side of Afghanistan . And the Taliban are happy to help.Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife.And yet, foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence, increased flight connections with hubs like Dubai, and the bragging rights that come with vacationing in an unusual destination. The numbers aren't huge - they never were - but there's a buzz around Afghan tourism.In 2021, there were 691 foreign tourists . In 2022, that figure rose to 2,300. Last year, there were 7,000.Mohammad Saeed, the head of the Tourism Directorate in Kabul, said the biggest foreign visitor market is China because of its proximity and large population. Afghanistan also has advantages over some of its neighbors.""They've told me they don't want to go to Pakistan because it's dangerous and they get attacked. The Japanese have said this to me also,"" Saeed said. ""This is good for us.""But there are disadvantages, too.Visas are difficult and expensive to access. Many countries severed ties with Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power, and no country recognizes them as the legitimate rulers of the country.Afghan embassies either closed or suspended their operations. There's an ongoing power struggle between Afghanistan's embassies and consulates staffed by people from the former Western-backed administration, and those under the Taliban administration's full control.Saeed concedes there are obstacles for Afghan tourism to develop but said he was working with ministries to overcome them.His ultimate aim is to have a visa on arrival for tourists, but that could be years away. There are problems with the road network, which is half-paved or non-existent in some parts of the country, and airlines largely avoid Afghan airspace.The capital Kabul has the most international flights, but no Afghan airport has direct routes with major tourist markets like China, Europe, or India.Despite the challenges, Saeed wants Afghanistan to become a tourism powerhouse, an ambition that appears to be backed by the Taliban's top leaders.""I have been sent to this department on the instructions of the elders (ministers). They must trust me because they've sent me to this important place.""The students also have aspirations. The model, Ahmed Massoud Talash, wants to learn about Afghanistan's picturesque spots for Instagram posts and its history for media appearances.Business school graduate Samir Ahmadzai wants to open a hotel but thinks he should know more about tourism and hospitality first.""They hear that Afghanistan is backwards, poverty and all about war,"" said Ahmadzai. ""We have 5,000 years of history. There should be a new page of Afghanistan.""Classes include Afghan handicrafts and anthropology basics.An unofficial subject is how to interact with foreign women and how their behavior or habits could clash with local customs and edicts. Examples might be women smoking or eating in public, to mixing freely with men who are not related to them by blood or marriage.The Taliban have imposed a dress code for women and requirements for them to have a male guardian, or mahram, when they travel. Dining alone, traveling alone, and socializing with other women in public have become harder. With gyms closed to women and beauty salons banned, there are fewer places where they can meet outside the home.In a sign that the country is preparing for more overseas visitors, the country's only five-star hotel, the Serena, has reopened its women's spa and salon for foreign females after a monthslong closure.Foreigners must show their passport to access services. Women with ""born in Afghanistan"" on their ID are barred.The restrictions on Afghan women and girls weigh on overseas travel companies, who say they try to focus on the positive aspect of cultural interactions by making donations, supporting local projects or only visiting family-run businesses.Shane Horan, the founder of Rocky Road Travel, said visiting Afghanistan should not be seen as an endorsement of any particular government or political regime.""Ultimately, the goal should be to support responsible tourism practices that contribute positively to the local economy and foster mutual respect and understanding, while also remaining cognizant of the broader political context in Afghanistan.""He said there was no input from authorities about what tour groups saw or did, and that the company worked closely with a women's rights organization in Afghanistan. A percentage of the tour cost went into supporting this organization's programs, Horan added.There are no women at the Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. The students don't mention it. But an official at the Tourism Directorate does.""It's a heartbreaking situation,"" said the official, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""Even female family members ask if they can study here. But there was a change in policy with the change in government. The women who were studying before (the takeover) never came back. They never graduated.""","Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife. But foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109714068,imgsize-1602274,width-400,resizemode-4/109714068.jpg"
