105-year-old woman graduates from Stanford University after 83-year hiatus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/105-year-old-woman-graduates-from-stanford-university-after-83-year-hiatus/articleshow/111548001.cms,"Virginia Hislop, a 105-year-old woman , recently returned to Stanford University after an 83-year hiatus to receive her master's degree in education . She first enrolled at Stanford in 1936 as an undergraduate student. Hislop continued her studies at Stanford to pursue a graduate degree while teaching, but her plans were interrupted when her future husband was called to serve during World War II in 1941, Fox news reported.She left campus before graduating to get married and moved around the country as an Army wife before settling in Yakima, Washington, with her family.Although Hislop did not return to teaching, she utilized her teaching certificate to serve on committees and boards, striving to enhance educational opportunities whenever possible. She became a member of the local school board when she was dissatisfied with the suggestion of a home economics course for her daughter Anne instead of advanced English.Hislop went on to serve as a founding board member for Yakima Valley Community College and helped raise funds for Heritage University in Toppenish, Washington. In 2017, she even established the Virginia Hislop Emergency Fund scholarship at Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences.During the recent graduation ceremony, Daniel Schwartz, dean of Stanford's Graduate School of Education, praised Hislop as a ""fierce advocate for equality"" and expressed his pride in conferring her Master of Arts in education degree. Schwartz revealed that Hislop's participation in the ceremony might not have been possible without her son-in-law's inquiry about bestowing her with an honorary degree. Upon discovering Hislop's original transcripts from 1941, Schwartz realized that her completed coursework satisfied the current requirements for a master's degree, making an honorary degree unnecessary.The moment Hislop received her degree was cherished by her, her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, as she remarked, ""I've waited a long time for this.""Since her graduation, people online have been expressing their admiration for her achievements, praising her sharp mind at her age and offering congratulations and blessings for many more years to come.","Virginia Hislop, a 105-year-old woman, recently returned to Stanford University after an 83-year hiatus to receive her master's degree in education.

Defence plans

BRUSSELS: Spurred on by Russia's war in Ukraine and the spectre of Donald Trump's potential return to the White House, more of Nato 's European members are finally hitting the alliance's defence spending target.But as leaders gear up to celebrate at a Nato summit in Washington there is a clear feeling that will not be sufficient to tackle the challenges it faces.""Even in countries historically reluctant to spend more on defence, there is now a growing sense of the importance of greatly increased defence spending,"" said Ian Lesser, from the German Marshall Fund of the United States think tank.""I think, broadly speaking, in the next years we're looking at levels of defence spending that will begin to approach those of the Cold War.""A decade after setting a spending goal at two percent of gross domestic product, just over two-thirds of Nato's 32 countries are now expected to reach or top that threshold this year.That is up from only three allies in 2014.The increase in spending, which includes European heavyweights Germany and France, will be heavily showcased in Washington as Nato stages its show of unity.That is designed to send a message to Russia's President Vladimir Putin as he wages his war in Ukraine and menaces Nato from the east.But it is also a message for former US leader Donald Trump as he seeks to reclaim the Oval Office from incumbent Joe Biden at elections in November.Like other US leaders, upset that Washington shoulders too much of the burden with its vast defence budget, Trump spent his time in office demanding European countries do more.On the campaign trail in February he unleashed a firestorm by saying he would encourage Russia to ""do whatever the hell"" it wants to Nato allies not coughing up enough.A year after turning the two-percent benchmark from a target to a floor for spending at a summit in Vilnius, a growing number of Nato allies are already pushing to go further.Chief among them are the Baltic States and Poland -- with all comfortably spending more, and Warsaw even reaching over four percent.""In 1988 all of the allies were spending more than two percent, actually some even six percent on defence because the threat was real -- there was a Cold War going on,"" Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said.""Now we have a hot war in Europe and we are not spending enough,"" said Kallas, who was nominated last month as the European Union's next foreign policy chief.But the Washington summit still looks too early to set a more ambitious target.""I think we're keen to celebrate the progress,"" a US defence official said. ""There's not an appetite this year to change that benchmark to three percent.""A major motivation for ramping up spending is making sure Nato countries can actually fulfil ambitious new defence plans agreed last year to ward off any potential attack from Russia.After years of slashing budgets as fears of conflict eased in the wake of the Cold War, numerous allies have major gaps in their arsenals -- including key requirements such as air defences.As part of its planning, Nato commanders are telling capitals what they need to spend on.""We have specific capabilities targets for each and every ally,"" said alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg.""For many allies, this will mean three percent, and at least something more than two percent.""Diverting money away from issues like welfare, education and health is never an easy sell for governments.The likes of Canada, Italy and Spain still lag behind the Nato target and are reluctant to commit to going further.But diplomats at Nato said the direction of travel is clear -- spending targets will need to be hiked.""Some countries are still sticking their heads in the sand,"" said one diplomat. ""But it will happen eventually.""Another diplomat agreed -- adding that if Trump starts breathing down the necks of European allies again that could speed things up.""This is where we are heading towards -- in order to fill the new plans it is clear that two percent won't be enough,"" the diplomat said.""I think we're going to move to something beyond that, regardless of who wins the next US elections -- but if Trump wins it could come sooner.""","Just over two-thirds of Nato's 32 countries are now expected to reach or top that threshold this year. That is up from only three allies in 2014.

Speaking on Geo News' 'Naya Pakistan' program, Sanaullah asserted that Imran Khan had been prohibited by the court from holding political meetings within the jail premises.""The PTI founder is not authorised to orchestrate plans for chaos while incarcerated,"" Sanaullah emphasised, pointing to unspecified evidence in possession of authorities that supposedly substantiates these claims.""We don't have audio or video evidence ourselves, but those responsible for security inside the jail do,"" Sanaullah clarified when asked about the proof of Imran Khan's alleged activities.Sanaullah's remarks followed complaints from leaders of the former ruling party, who asserted they were denied access to Imran Khan at Adiala Jail despite waiting for several hours. The adviser to the Prime Minister also criticised PTI's decision to stage a rally in Islamabad during the holy month of Muharram, suggesting it was aimed at sowing political turmoil, as reported by Geo News.""The PTI's desire to hold a public rally in Muharram is inappropriate and can lead to political chaos,"" Sanaullah remarked, while distancing the government from the decision to deny PTI permission for the Islamabad rally, according to Geo News.Earlier today, PTI cancelled its Islamabad rally after the federal capital's chief commissioner withdrew the No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the event in Tarnol. PTI leaders subsequently approached the Islamabad High Court seeking contempt of court proceedings against the administration for revoking the rally's permission.Expanding on his allegations, Sanaullah suggested that foreign elements supported PTI during the riots on May 9, 2023, following Imran Khan's arrest, with the intent to destabilise Pakistan.""Enemy countries aim to sow anarchy in Pakistan through PTI,"" he added, referencing the protests that targeted both civilian and military installations including Jinnah House and the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, dubbed as the ""Black Day"" by the military, leading to arrests under the Army Act.Regarding foreign aid allegedly received by PTI, Sanaullah indicated a willingness to disclose evidence if the federal cabinet decided to make such information public, Geo News reported.","Rana Sanaullah, Prime Minister's Adviser on Political and Public Affairs, made the claims on Geo News' 'Naya Pakistan' program.

""Should that happen, it'll most likely be a Category 1 hurricane.""The earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean islands earlier in the week. It then battered Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane, toppling trees but causing no injuries or deaths before weakening to a tropical storm as it moved across the Yucatan Peninsula.Texas officials warned people along the entire coastline to prepare for possible flooding, heavy rain and wind as the storm nears.Dan Patrick, lieutenant governor, who is acting governor while Governor Greg Abbott is travelling in Taiwan, issued a pre-emptive disaster declaration for 121 counties.""Beryl is a determined storm, and incoming winds and potential flooding will pose a serious threat to Texans who are in Beryl's path at landfall and as it makes its way across the state for the following 24 hours,"" Patrick said in a statement Saturday,Some Texas coastal cities called for voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas prone to flooding, banned beach camping and urged tourists travelling on the July 4 holiday weekend to move recreational vehicles from coastal parks.Mitch Thames, a spokesman for Matagorda County, said Saturday that officials issued a voluntary evacuation request for the coastal areas of the county about 100 miles (160 kilometres) southwest of Houston to inform a large number of visitors in the area for the holiday weekend.""I certainly don't want to ruin the holiday weekend for our visitors. But at the same time, our No. 1 goal is the health and safety of all our visitors and of course our residents. I'm not so much worried about our residents. Those folks that live down there, they're used to this, they get it,"" Thames said.In Corpus Christi, officials asked visitors to cut their trips short and return home early if possible. Officials asked residents to secure their homes by boarding up windows if necessary and using sandbags to guard against possible flooding.""We're taking the storm very seriously and we're asking the community to take the storm very serious as well,"" Corpus Christi Fire Chief Brandon Wade said during a Friday evening news conference.Traffic has been nonstop for the past three days at Ace Hardware in Corpus Christi as customers buy up tarps, rope, duct tape, sandbags and generators, employee Elizabeth Landry said Saturday.""They're just worried about the wind, the rain,"" she said. ""They're wanting to prepare just in case.""Ben Koutsoumbaris, general manager of Island Market on Corpus Christi's Padre Island, said there's ""definitely a lot of buzz about the incoming storm,"" with customers stocking up on food and drinks - particularly meat and beer.""I heard there's been some talk about people having like hurricane parties,"" he said by telephone Saturday.In Refugio County, north of Corpus Christi along Texas' Gulf Coast, officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for its 6,700 residents Saturday.Refugio County Judge Jhiela ""Gigi"" Poynter, the county's top elected official, said that based on the growing confidence in Beryl's track and the uncertainty regarding the storm's intensity and holiday weekend traffic that is already backing up roads, she decided to call for the mandatory evacuation.""I would rather be cautious and let Tropical Storm Beryl come crawling in with a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind to an empty Refugio County than the alternative if it were to strengthen more than the predictions, which we know has happened with several storms in the past,"" Poynter said in a video posted on Facebook.As of Saturday night, Beryl was about 330 miles (535 kilometres) southeast of Corpus Christi and had top sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center. It was moving northwest at 13 mph (20 kph).Before hitting Mexico and moving into the Gulf, Beryl had already spread destruction in Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados this week. Three people have been reported dead in Grenada, three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in Venezuela and two in Jamaica, officials said.Mexican authorities had moved some tourists and residents out of low-lying areas around the Yucatan Peninsula before landfall, but tens of thousands remained to tough out the strong winds and storm surge. Much of the area around Tulum is just a few yards (meters) above sea level.The city was plunged into darkness when the storm knocked out power as it came ashore. Screeching winds set off car alarms across the town. Wind and rain continued to whip the seaside city and surrounding areas Friday morning. Army brigades roved the streets of the tourist city, clearing fallen trees and power lines. No deaths or injuries have been reported.","Hurricane warning declared for stretch of Texas coast from Baffin Bay to Sargent. Storm surge warnings were also in effect.

2024 United Kingdom elections: Who is Keir Starmer? Britain's next prime minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/2024-united-kingdom-elections-who-is-keir-starmer-poised-to-become-uks-next-pm/articleshow/111496432.cms,"All you need to know about Keir Starmer

Keir Starmer was born in London in 1962 and grew up in the town of Oxted, Surrey, where he was raised by his toolmaker father and NHS nurse mother.[3]

He was politically active from a young age, joining the Labour Party Young Socialists at 16.

Starmer has a strong academic background, holding a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Leeds and a postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law degree from the University of Oxford.

Prior to entering politics, Starmer had a successful career as a human rights barrister, serving as a human rights adviser to the Northern Ireland Policing Board and being appointed Queen's Counsel in 2002.

Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions from 2008 to 2013, where he dealt with high-profile cases like the Stephen Lawrence murder.

He was elected to the House of Commons in 2015 as the MP for Holborn and St Pancras, a safe Labour seat.

Starmer supported the unsuccessful Britain Stronger in Europe campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum, but later advocated for a second referendum under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.

After Corbyn's resignation, Starmer won the 2020 Labour leadership election on a left-wing platform, positioning himself as a more centrist, pragmatic leader.[3]

As Labour leader, Starmer has sought to distance the party from the Corbyn era, emphasizing a more professional and electorally viable approach.[1][4]

Starmer is known for his vegetarianism, self-professed socialism, and a reputation that divides opinions, with some viewing him as moving towards the right in his pursuit of power.

Here are Keir Starmer's key policies as the likely next UK PM:

Economic stability: Starmer has pledged to ""deliver economic stability "" by sticking to ""tough spending rules"" and focusing on growing the economy. He has avoided making big-spending promises, instead emphasizing fiscal responsibility.

"" by sticking to ""tough spending rules"" and focusing on growing the economy. He has avoided making big-spending promises, instead emphasizing fiscal responsibility. NHS improvements : Starmer plans to ""cut NHS waiting times"" by providing 40,000 more evening and weekend appointments each week. This is aimed at addressing the NHS's staffing and backlog issues.

Border security: Starmer wants to ""launch a new Border Security Command"" to crack down on illegal migration and people-smuggling gangs. He has indicated a willingness to do a deal with the EU on migrant quotas.

Energy nationalisation: Starmer has promised to ""set up Great British Energy"", a new publicly owned clean power company, as part of Labour's plans for green energy transition.

Tackling anti-social behaviour: Starmer has pledged to ""crack down on anti-social behaviour"" as part of his law and order agenda.

Education funding: Starmer has committed to ""recruit 6,500 new teachers"" in key subjects to address staffing shortages in the education system.

Foreign policy: Starmer has promised a ""new strategic partnership"" with India, including pursuing a free trade agreement. He also plans to stop arms sales to Israel and progress towards recognizing a Palestinian state.

Keir Starmer is set to become the next prime minister of Britain, as his centre-left Labour Party is projected to secure a substantial majority in the parliamentary election.This victory will put an end to the 14-year reign of the Conservative government, which has been marked by frequent upheavals. Rishi Sunak's party suffered a resounding defeat in the polls.Labour has already secured more than 326 out of the 650 seats in parliament, and an exit poll indicates that the party is likely to win around 410 seats in total.After retaining his seat in north London, the 61-year-old Starmer addressed his constituents, saying, ""The change begins right here because this is your democracy, your community and your future. You have voted and now it is time for us to deliver.""Despite Starmer's decisive win, polls suggest that there is a lack of enthusiasm among the public for both him and his party. As he assumes power, he faces a multitude of formidable challenges that the country is currently grappling with.","Keir Starmer was born in London in 1962 and grew up in Oxted, Surrey.

He secured the win by pledging to engage with the West and relax the enforcement of the country's compulsory headscarf law , following a period of sanctions and protests that have strained the Islamic Republic. Pezeshkian's opponent, hard-liner Saeed Jalili , was defeated in the electoral contest.Pezeshkian secured over 17 million votes, while Jalili obtained more than 13 million votes in an election where approximately 30 million votes were cast, according to Iran's election authority. The voter turnout for this election, which was at historic low level, stood at 49.8 percent.Throughout his campaign, Pezeshkian refrained from promising any drastic changes to Iran's Shiite theocracy. He has consistently recognized Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the ultimate authority in all matters concerning the state.However, Pezeshkian's modest objectives are likely to face challenges from an Iranian government that remains largely controlled by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip, and Western concerns about Tehran's enrichment of uranium to near-weapons-grade levels.In the early hours of the day, Pezeshkian's supporters, took to the streets in Tehran and other urban areas as his advantage over Jalili, a conservative former nuclear negotiator, continued to grow.The initial round of polling on June 28 experienced the poorest participation since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in the history of the Islamic Republic. The leadership in Iran has consistently stressed that the voter turnout is an indication of backing for the nation's Shiite theocracy, which has been under pressure following years of economic sanctions, widespread protests, and severe repression of all dissent.According to the vote count provided by the authorities, Pezeshkian secured 16.3 million votes, while Jalili received 13.5 million votes in Friday's election.The elections came after President Ebrahim Raisi, who was widely regarded as a close confidant and mentee of Khamenei, died in a helicopter accident in May. Many believed that Raisi was being groomed as a possible successor to the supreme leader position.Raisi's legacy was however, marred by his participation in the 1988 mass executions in Iran. Furthermore, he played a significant role in the violent suppression of protests that erupted following the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022 who had been arrested by the authorities for allegedly wearing her mandatory hijab improperly.","Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist candidate and heart surgeon, emerged victorious in Iran's runoff presidential election on Saturday.

Last year, she managed a winning 39-and-a-half hot dogs in 10 minutes.Sudo’s previous personal best came in 2020 when she chowed down on a whopping 48.5 dogs in the beef-eating competition.With the event's biggest star —- Joey “Jaws” Chestnut — out of the contest this year, Sudo’s result set up a possible scenario in which the women’s champ out-eats the men’s winner. Geoffrey Esper, who came second last year, also has a personal best of 51, but only ate 49 last year.Chestnut, who won 16 out of the previous 17 contests, isn't attending the competition over a sponsorship tiff.

The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.“I'm going to be pushing myself,” Sudo said Wednesday. Her rival Mayoi Ebihara, from Japan, said through a translator that she would eat until she passes out, with a goal of downing 50 hot dogs.Chestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes.Major League Eating, which organizes the Nathan’s Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.Chestnut said he wouldn’t return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.(With agency inputs)","Miki Sudo, a Florida native, beat her beef-eating competitors by a mile at the July 4 tradition.

Axelrod argued that Biden should prioritize the country's needs over his re-election bid, suggesting that continuing his campaign could negatively impact his legacy.This call comes amid increasing pressure within the White House following Biden's unimpressive performance in a recent CNN presidential debate .Axelrod's remarks intensify existing doubts about Biden's campaign, which were not alleviated by a recent interview with ABC News. Axelrod described Biden's demeanor in the interview as exhibiting ""defiant delusion,"" indicating a gap between Biden's self-view and public perception.Concerns about Biden's viability as a candidate have grown, particularly after a widely criticized performance in Atlanta. In response, Biden has attempted to shift focus to contrasting his policies with those of former President Donald Trump. Biden criticized Trump's alleged involvement with ""Project 2025,"" a platform reportedly aiming to restructure the federal government along conservative lines. Biden's campaign warned that Project 2025 poses a threat to democratic principles such as reproductive rights and governmental checks and balances.Trump, distancing himself from Project 2025, claimed he was unaware of its specifics and stated that it does not represent his official policy. His campaign clarified that Project 2025 is not endorsed or aligned with Trump's platform.Amid these developments, Biden met with his campaign co-chairs to discuss his re-election strategy. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a campaign co-chair, described the meeting as open and focused on honest feedback. Coons emphasized Biden's determination to address doubts about his candidacy, especially among Democrats questioning his suitability as the party's nominee.Biden's aides are hopeful that recent positive feedback from a Wisconsin rally and his ABC News interview will enhance his image. They plan to increase direct voter engagement through town halls and press conferences to boost Biden’s public perception.Looking forward, Biden is set to hold his first formal press conference since the debate, coinciding with the end of the Nato summit. This event is seen as a crucial opportunity for Biden to address key issues and reaffirm his leadership amid ongoing political challenges.( with input from agencies)",Former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod has publicly urged President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 presidential race.

While this has created a flutter, Melania's close associates said Melania was never a full-time first lady in the first place. Former White House press secretary and chief-of -staff Stephanie Grisham said in March that Melania once said that she doesn't need to stand by Donald Trump like Jill Biden.""It's like she's holding Joe Biden up,"" Grisham said.Melania, according to Trump biographer Michael Wolff, never wanted to Donald Trump to run and she became the most demi-detached First Lady in US history. In 2016 when Trump moved into the White House, Melania initially stayed behind in their New York Trump Tower apartments, before finally heading to Washington in the summer of 2017. At that time, her excuse was Barron was in school and needed her to stay nearby.This time too, Melania wants to stay with Barron Trump who is likely to join New York University and according to reports, Melania has already made a deal with Trump that she will only be at the White House on special occasions.After the first presidential debate on CNN, Melania's absence was pointed out as Jill Biden led Joe Biden off the stage and Trump left the stage alone. But Grisham said Melania was never a 'stand-by-your-man' spouse. Trump camp insiders, however, insist that Donald Trump relies of Melania's opinion far more than it might appear.Melania was not present during Trump's hush-money trial, at Trump's 78th birthday party or at any prominent fundraiser. Grisham believes that this absence was because of optics and Melania cares intently about her public image. In fact, Melania is increasingly thinking about what's good for her rather than for her husband.First Lady expert Kate Anderson Bower told Axios she believes Melania is distancing herself even more her husband and from the Washington social political scene. Mary Jordan, author of Melania biography said her absence makes her stand out in history from any other First Lady. Melania is not looking for any way out for her political responsibilities in case Trump is back at the White House because she is seriously concerned about Barron's college life. Barron never lived by himself and that's why Melania wants to devote more time in New York.","Melania was not present during Trump's hush-money trial, at Trump's 78th birthday party or at any prominent fundraiser.

Some Biden aides view the family's actions as an attempt to address longstanding grievances, while the family believes the debate was mishandled by the staff, who failed to properly highlight Biden’s strengths.This internal conflict has frustrated Biden’s staff, who believe the family’s emotional involvement is hindering their efforts to manage the crisis.

Pezeshkian's moderate stance and advocacy for limited reforms may lead to some changes in Iran's domestic policies, such as relaxing enforcement of the compulsory headscarf law.However, his ability to enact major shifts in Iran's foreign policy is constrained by the fact that the government remains largely controlled by hard-liners.","The US says it will continue to use diplomacy with Tehran ""when it advances American interests"" The State Department says it has no expectation the elections will lead to fundamental change in Iran's direction.

Canada Police believes that the gold stolen last year in Canada's biggest-ever gold heist must have gone to India and Dubai gold markets. Over 6,500 gold bars disappeared overseas after being stolen from an airport, the department believes.

Mike Mavity said.""That would be Dubai, or India, where you can take gold with serial numbers on it, and they will still honor it and melt it down,"" the investigator said.Nine individuals were arrested in connection with the meticulously planned heist including a former Air Canada manager and a jewelry store owner. The suspects used a completed bill for a seafood pick-up to forge paperwork that was given to a warehouse attendant. A small amount of precious metal was probably melted down in the basement of a Mississauga jewelry store immediately after the heist. Only 90,000 Canadian dollars were recovered from the heist.Canada cops described the heist as Netflix material as a lot of daring planning went behind it.

He emphasised the concerns expressed by his legal team about the CJ’s infrequent attendance, reflecting a growing sentiment in his camp that justice might not be administered fairly in these circumstances.Imran also expressed disappointment over a cancelled meeting with his legal and political teams. The superintendent, allegedly at the request of a jailed colonel, denied Khan’s team access, citing operational reasons.“They (Pakistan’s powerful military authorities) are mistaken; they think my party will weaken. They don't realize that the party with the strongest voter base remains strong,” Imran said while asserting his party’s resilience.He emphasised that the IMF cannot solve the country’s issues and that the solution lies in fair and transparent elections. “The entire nation states that the biggest fraud (Feb 2024 national and provincial polls) occurred, yet the chief justice is defending the election commission. The electoral watchdog has committed the greatest fraud in the country. We are seeking justice. If investigations proceed, the chief election commissioner will face Article 6 (guilty of high treason).”“I will never succumb to the tyranny of time; I am prepared to die in jail. As long as I live, I will wage this battle,” Imran remarked.About national security, he highlighted the necessity of a strong relationship with Afghanistan. “Why did Bilawal Bhutto and our foreign minister not visit Afghanistan? Without support from the Afghan govt, we cannot win this war (against TTP) across a 2,500-km-long border,” he added.","Imran cites ongoing concerns over Justice Isa’s involvement in benches handling PTI cases and his personal cases.

"Pakistan imposed a milk tax, now dairy staple costs more in Karachi than Paris",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-imposed-a-milk-tax-now-dairy-staple-costs-more-in-karachi-than-paris/articleshow/111485554.cms,"Milk prices in Pakistan surged by more than a fifth after a new tax was applied, making the dairy staple more expensive than in France, Australia and some other developed nations.Ultra-high temperature, or UHT, milk now costs 370 rupees ($1.33) a liter in supermarkets in Karachi. That compares with $1.29 in Amsterdam, $1.23 in Paris, and $1.08 in Melbourne, according to data collected by Bloomberg.An 18% tax was applied to packaged milk as part of taxation changes approved in the national budget last week. Previously, it was tax-exempt.Before the impost, which resulted in retail prices increasing by as much as 25%, milk costs were comparable with developing countries such as Vietnam and Nigeria, said Muhammad Nasir, a spokesman for the local unit of Dutch dairy producer Royal FrieslandCampina NV.Costlier milk will add to rising inflation in the South Asian country, where wages have stagnated, eroding spending power. The increase may also worsen child health. About 40% of the nation lives in poverty.“It will deny nutrition from a population that is already suffering from malnutrition,” Nasir said in a text message. About 60% of Pakistani children under 5 years suffer anemia and 40% suffer from stunting.Pakistan raised taxes by 40%, the highest on record, in last week’s budget aimed at meeting conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for a new bailout.","Ultra-high temperature, or UHT, milk now costs 370 rupees ($1.33) a liter in supermarkets in Karachi.

Ra'Ad: Pakistan Arms JF-17 Jets with Ra'ad-I Nuclear Missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-arming-jf-17-jets-with-raad-nuke-missiles/articleshow/111454243.cms,"A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft. The photograph depicts a JF-17 carrying what appears to be a Ra'ad air-launched cruise missile (ALCM), marking the first public observation of this configuration.Analyzing images of a JF-17 Thunder Block II from the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade rehearsals, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) confirmed that the fighter jet was equipped with a Ra'ad-I nuclear missile.""Notably, this was the first time such a configuration had been observed in public,"" the FAS said in its report.To determine the specific type of Ra'ad missile in the image, comparisons were made with Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II missiles displayed in previous Pakistan Day Parades. While the Ra'ad-II, first unveiled in 2017, was presented as having nearly double the range capability of the Ra'ad-I, external features did not clearly distinguish the two versions until 2022. The latest Ra'ad-II, displayed in 2022 and 2024, features a distinct 'x-shaped' tail fin configuration, while the missile photographed on the JF-17 more closely resembles the 'twin-tail' configuration of the Ra'ad-I, the FAS report said.Using Photoshop's Vanishing Point feature and reference measurements from the vehicles carrying the missiles, the lengths of the Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II were estimated to be around 4.9 meters each. The missile on the JF-17 was also measured using the aircraft's length as a reference, resulting in a similar 4.9-meter estimate. These measurements, along with the tail fin configuration, suggest that the missile observed on the JF-17 is likely the Ra'ad-I ALCM rather than the newer Ra'ad-II or the conventional anti-ship variant, Taimoor, the FAS report by Eliana Johns said.The image provides evidence that Pakistan has made significant progress in equipping its JF-17s with the capability to supplement or replace the nuclear strike role of the ageing Mirage III/Vs. However, questions remain about the deployment status of the Ra'ad systems and whether Pakistan will continue to retain a nuclear gravity bomb capability or transition to stand-off cruise missiles exclusively.These developments occur amidst an ongoing nuclear arms competition in the region, with Pakistan, India, and China pursuing advanced technologies such as multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). The heightened tensions and the development of short-range, lower-yield nuclear-capable systems by Pakistan have raised concerns about accelerated arms racing and escalation risks in a potential conflict between India and Pakistan.",A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft.
