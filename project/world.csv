A 33-year-old Venezuelan, made the difficult decision to leave her homeland due to the dire economic situation, with 80% of the population living in poverty, and being unable to provide a specialist for her 9-year-old son who has a mental health disability.Yenny Morales said: ""I had to flee, because my son couldn't see a neurologist. The health of my kids comes first.""

However, the opposition claims that based on their count of roughly 90% of the ballots, their candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, garnered more than twice the votes that Maduro did.The government maintained that it had not generated detailed vote counts at the polling station level due to a system hack originating in North Macedonia, causing the prolonged delay. They provided no evidence to support this claim.Morales' concerns have shifted to her loved ones back home. She said: ""This is fraud,"" referring to the widely criticized results, ""and now that's what our families are fighting against,"" she added. She has not been in contact with her family since Tuesday morning.Morales, a resident of a temporary makeshift camp in Mexico City's center, belongs to the growing number of Venezuelan migrants who are increasingly worried about their loved ones back in their homeland. Having journeyed through Central America in pursuit of a better future, they are now closely monitoring the demonstrations that have erupted in response to the announcement of Maduro's third six-year term.The was among the most tranquil in Venezuela's recent history, indicating a widespread desire for the country to steer clear of violence and put an end to a end 25 years of single-party rule.""I'm very disappointed with what I'm seeing,"" said Gerardo Uzcategui, 56, who spent four years in Cali, Colombia before beginning his journey to the US Uzcategui's sentiment echoes the frustration felt by many Venezuelan migrants who had hoped for a peaceful resolution to their country's political turmoil.The former police officer in charge of security for a government minister revealed that his entire family has now fled.

It's really, really hard on us.""The sharp decline in oil prices, scarcity of essential goods, and an inflation rate surpassing 130,000%, has triggered widespread social unrest and a massive exodus of over 7.7 million Venezuelans in the past ten years.According to Foro Penal, a Venezuela-based human rights organization, 11 people, including two minors, lost their lives in the unrest that followed the election.Herberto Lugo, 48, expressed relief that his family in the coastal city of Maracaibo has been spared from the violent protests, but his opinion of Maduro's tight control over Venezuela remains unchanged. ""We're uncomfortable, and we won't conform to what is happening in our country,"" said Lugo, who thinks opposition leader and former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez was the clear winner of the election.""People in Venezuela are fighting, and we hope he leaves this week,"" he said, referring to Maduro.

Did Elon Musk threaten to punish X users for calling Trump supporters 'weird'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-elon-musk-threaten-to-punish-x-users-for-calling-trump-supporters-weird/articleshow/112182027.cms,"A post has ignited a firestorm on the social media platform X , formerly known as Twitter, after a screenshot emerged that seemingly showed the platform’s owner, Elon Musk , taking a stand against the use of the word “weird” to describe Trump supporters .The alleged message, which was shared by a user and rapidly went viral, has sparked debate over free speech , political bias, and the role of social media in moderating content.The screenshot, which quickly amassed thousands of reposts, purportedly depicted Musk stating:""‘ Weird ’ is a slur being used against Trump supporters, and it will not be tolerated on this platform. Trump supporters should not have to face ridicule for their beliefs. Any harassment of Trump supporters using the term ‘weird’ will be punished.""The message, if authentic, would mark a significant moment in Musk’s controversial tenure as the head of X, highlighting the ongoing tension between fostering open discourse and protecting users from targeted harassment. Many users reacted strongly, with some praising Musk for defending a group often subjected to mockery, while others criticized what they saw as a dangerous precedent for stifling free expression on the platform.However, as the post continued to gain traction, questions arose about its authenticity.A detailed investigation found no record of the message on Musk’s official X account, nor in any of his deleted posts cataloged by PolitiTweet, a service that tracks deleted tweets from public figures.The absence of such a high-profile post in both current and archived content led many to conclude that the screenshot was likely fabricated.The timing of this controversy is particularly significant, given the context of the 2024 US presidential campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris, a key figure in the race, has frequently used the term ""weird"" to describe former President Donald Trump and his running mate, adding fuel to the ongoing political rhetoric.This incident is not the first time that @theliamnisson has been involved in the spread of misleading content. The account, which bills itself as a parody, has a history of sharing satirical and fake posts, including a previous viral screenshot falsely claiming that Trump referred to US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as a ""sasquatch.""The widespread circulation of the Musk screenshot, despite its dubious authenticity, underscores the challenges faced by social media platforms in balancing free speech with the need to curb misinformation.","A post on the social media platform X has ignited a firestorm after a screenshot emerged that seemingly showed the platform’s owner, Elon Musk.

Top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh is dead. Now what?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/top-hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-is-dead-now-what/articleshow/112181241.cms,"The assassination of Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran has sent shockwaves through the region, potentially setting the stage for increased tensions and retaliatory actions against Israel. The strike, which Hamas has blamed on Israel , has left the Islamist movement scrambling to find a new leader while raising concerns about the direction the group will take amid ongoing conflict .Haniyeh's death comes almost ten months into the latest Gaza war, a conflict that shows no signs of a ceasefire. With his deputy, Saleh al-Aruri, also killed earlier this year in a strike in Lebanon, two names have emerged as possible successors: Musa Abu Marzuk and Khalil al-Haya.Musa Abu Marzuk, a member of Hamas's political bureau, is seen as a more moderate figure within the movement. He has a history of advocating for a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders and has participated in indirect talks with Israel. However, his moderate stance may clash with the armed wing of Hamas, which is less inclined towards diplomatic solutions.Khalil al-Haya, on the other hand, is closely aligned with the armed wing's chief, Yahya Sinwar. Known for his staunch support of armed resistance against Israel, Haya's rise to leadership could signal a shift towards more aggressive tactics. His personal history of loss to Israeli airstrikes and his leadership during Hamas’s 2006 electoral victory position him as a strong contender, especially among hardliners within the movement.There is also speculation that Khaled Meshaal, who previously led Hamas, could make a return to leadership. Meshaal's experience and previous tenure might offer stability during this tumultuous time.Analysts are divided on the impact of Haniyeh's assassination. Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group believes that while the loss is significant, Hamas has ""plenty of leadership material"" to continue its operations. However, Hugh Lovatt of the European Council on Foreign Relations warns that the assassination could embolden hardliners within Hamas, leading to a more radicalized and potentially more violent phase in the conflict.The ongoing war, which erupted after Hamas's attacks on Israel on October 7, has claimed thousands of lives on both sides, with heavy casualties reported in Gaza. The killing of Haniyeh could also derail any progress in ceasefire negotiations, particularly as Haniyeh's political leadership, based in Doha, had been pushing for a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.The strike in Tehran is not an isolated incident. It follows Israel’s reported assassination of a Hezbollah commander in Beirut, an event linked to recent rocket attacks on the Golan Heights. The situation has led to fears of wider regional escalation, with Hamas's armed wing warning of ""enormous consequences"" for the region following Haniyeh's death.Regional analysts caution that while the situation is volatile, it is unlikely that Iran, a key backer of Hamas, will engage in full-scale war with Israel unless its vital interests are directly threatened. However, the risk of spiraling violence remains, especially with various Iran-backed groups involved in the conflict.","Ismail Haniyeh's death has left Hamas scrambling to find a new leader.

Illinois woman Sonya Massey fatally shot by Sheriff’s deputy had called 911 for help multiple times before her death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/illinois-woman-sonya-massey-fatally-shot-by-sheriffs-deputy-had-called-911-for-help-multiple-times-before-her-death/articleshow/112181031.cms,"Sonya Massey , a Black woman who was fatally shot in the face by an Illinois sheriff's deputy after she called 911 for assistance, had reached out to emergency services at least twice in the days leading up to her death on July 6, according to newly released records.One of the calls came from her mother, Donna Massey, who expressed concern to the dispatcher, saying, “I don't want you guys to hurt her,” and explained that her daughter feared the police.She specifically requested that no officer who might be ""prejudiced"" be sent, reported AP.The Sangamon County Sheriff’s Department is currently investigating whether the deputies who responded to the call about a suspected prowler at Massey’s home were aware of her mental health history. Body-worn camera footage released last week suggests that this information was not communicated to the officers. In the video, former sheriff’s deputy Sean Grayson, who shot Massey, is heard asking dispatch two minutes after the shooting if there was any record of previous calls indicating she had mental health issues.Jeff Wilhite, spokesperson for Sheriff Jack Campbell, mentioned that while such information is passed along if known, there is no automatic mechanism to ensure it is relayed. “The dispatcher would have to know 'yes, it's the same person' and 'yes, it's the same address,'"" Wilhite explained.Another 911 call from July 4, released in response to public records requests, involved an unnamed caller reporting that someone was trying to harm them, only to disconnect after stating, “This must not be the right number.” Officials are unsure if Massey made this call.Grayson, 30, has been charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and official misconduct for the shooting death of 36-year-old Massey. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bond.The body-cam footage reveals that after Grayson and another deputy arrived at Massey’s home just before 1 a.m. on July 6, she appeared confused, repeatedly asking, “Please God” and “Don’t hurt me.” Inside her home, she struggled to find her ID and asked for her Bible. When she suddenly said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” while holding a pot of water, Grayson drew his gun and fired three shots, one of which struck her below the left eye.Massey’s family has stated that she had a history of mental health struggles and had recently sought treatment. Her 17-year-old son, Malachi Hill Massey, shared that his mother had checked into a 30-day inpatient treatment program in the St. Louis area at the start of July, only to return two days later.On July 4, at 9:27 p.m., a 911 caller from Massey's address reported that ""somebody's trying to hurt me."" When pressed for more information, the caller said, ""Never mind,"" and disconnected. Later that morning, Donna Massey called 911, describing her daughter's paranoid behavior and emphasizing that she was not dangerous but had become increasingly fearful and distressed.Springfield police responded to the call and found that Massey did not want to speak to medical professionals but was checked by emergency medical technicians. Massey herself later called to report a neighbor hitting her with a brick, leading a sheriff's deputy to meet her at a hospital. The deputy noted that she appeared to be experiencing mental health issues and was seeking treatment for minor injuries. Massey mentioned she had recently been released from a mental health facility and claimed police had tried to run her off the road earlier that day.Twelve hours after this incident, Grayson and another deputy responded to the July 6 call, where body-cam footage shows them noticing the broken windows on Massey’s SUV. Grayson questioned her about the vehicle, and when she denied owning it, he asked if she was “doing all right mentally,” to which she replied, “Yes, I took my medicine.”Minutes later, after the shooting, Grayson radioed in to ask if there was any call history indicating Massey had mental health issues. The response is not heard, but Grayson is later heard saying, “That would explain a lot.”","Sonya Massey, 36, was fatally shot in the face by an Illinois sheriff's deputy after she called 911 for assistance.

Khaled Meshaal poised to lead Hamas after assassination of Ismail Haniyeh: What does his return mean?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/khaled-meshaal-poised-to-lead-hamas-after-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-what-does-his-return-mean/articleshow/112181240.cms,"Khaled Meshaal , a figure with a storied history in the Palestinian militant group Hamas, is being considered to take over leadership following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. Meshaal, who survived an Israeli assassination attempt in 1997, has been a prominent leader within Hamas for decades, navigating the group through periods of intense conflict and diplomatic challenges.In 1997, Meshaal became internationally known when Israeli agents, under the orders of then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attempted to assassinate him by injecting poison into his ear on the streets of Amman, Jordan. The botched operation led to a diplomatic crisis, with Jordan's King Hussein threatening to nullify the peace treaty with Israel unless an antidote was provided. Israel complied, and the incident not only saved Meshaal's life but also elevated his status within the Palestinian resistance.Meshaal, 68, led Hamas from exile for many years, representing the group in international diplomatic circles, a role that allowed him to avoid the travel restrictions that confined many other Hamas officials. His leadership was marked by his ability to navigate the complexities of regional politics, including strained relations with Iran following his support for the Sunni Muslim-led uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.The recent assassination of Haniyeh, which Hamas and Tehran have blamed on Israel, has brought Meshaal back into the spotlight as the likely candidate to assume leadership. His potential return comes at a critical juncture, as Hamas faces both internal and external pressures amid an ongoing and brutal conflict with Israel.Since its founding during the first Palestinian uprising in 1987, Hamas has been targeted by Israel, which has assassinated or attempted to assassinate several of its leaders. Meshaal's survival of the 1997 assassination attempt was a turning point that solidified his position within the group. After the deaths of Hamas founders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel-Aziz Al-Rantissi in 2004, Meshaal assumed the overall leadership of Hamas.While Meshaal has maintained a hardline stance against Israel, rejecting the idea of a permanent peace deal, he has also signaled a willingness to accept a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders as a temporary solution, coupled with a long-term ceasefire. This nuanced position has sometimes put him at odds with other Hamas leaders, particularly those based in Gaza who favor more militant approaches.The October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas militants on Israel, which resulted in significant casualties and the kidnapping of over 250 people, underscored the group's continued commitment to armed resistance. Israel's subsequent retaliation has devastated Gaza, killing tens of thousands and leaving much of the territory in ruins. Amid this chaos, Meshaal has called for broader Arab and Muslim participation in the conflict against Israel, asserting that Palestinians will decide Gaza's future governance without external influence.Meshaal's early involvement with Hamas began after he joined the Muslim Brotherhood at the age of 15 while living in Kuwait. Over the years, he transitioned from a schoolteacher to a key fundraiser and eventually a leading political figure within Hamas, operating from various Middle Eastern capitals including Doha, Cairo, and previously Damascus.Despite his past, Meshaal's potential return to leadership reflects the ongoing influence of long-time Hamas figures in shaping the group's future direction. As Hamas navigates its current leadership crisis, Meshaal's experience and historical significance within the movement could guide the group through the next phase of its struggle. Whether his leadership will bring a shift in strategy or reinforce Hamas's existing policies remains to be seen.","Khaled Meshaal survived an Israeli assassination attempt in 1997.

'See my assessment below on the 13 Keys Tracker on where The Keys stand NOW.'Harris filed her nomination on July 27 officially and declared her candidature for President race.Harris has an upper hand in this election because of the several key factors like she faced no primary challenger, there has been minimal threat from third-party candidates, and the economy remains strong both in the short and long term.With the transition from Biden to Harris, the White House has avoided major policy changes, and Harris is not contending with any scandals or significant social unrest.Lichtman observed that with Biden’s shift to Harris as the presumptive nominee, the Democrats have lost the incumbency advantage. As Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump prepare to face off, Lichtman considers the race essentially open, reported The Daily Mail.However, Lichtman also pointed out that the Democrats have managed to mitigate potential fallout from this transition. The party has rallied behind Harris without triggering a chaotic open primary or attracting other presidential contenders at this late stage.""I have not made a final prediction.

"Wildfires: Colorado wildfires: 1 dead, homes destroyed and evacuations ordered",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/colorado-wildfires-1-dead-homes-destroyed-and-evacuations-ordered/articleshow/112182184.cms,"A person died and several homes were destroyed as wildfires raged through heavily populated areas of the Colorado foothills, authorities reported on Wednesday. According to AP, nearly 100 large blazes were burning across the western US, with firefighters battling the flames under extreme conditions.The fatality occurred in a fire near Lyons, Colorado, which had scorched more than two square miles (six square kilometres) by Wednesday afternoon.The deceased was found in one of five homes that had burned, according to Boulder County Sheriff Curtis Johnson. The fire, known as the Stone Canyon Fire, remained zero percent contained but did not grow significantly as 150 firefighters worked to control it.A separate fire near the Denver metro area, west of Conifer, led to evacuation orders for around 575 houses from various subdivisions. This fire, though currently less than one square mile (2.5 square kilometres), was expected to expand as temperatures reached nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). Efforts to combat this blaze included a plane dropping fire retardant and four helicopters using water from a nearby reservoir. Mark Techmeyer of the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office described the challenge: ""This fire is not an easy fight. The terrain is treacherous"", as per AP.Another significant fire burned more than 10 square miles (27 square kilometres) west of Loveland, prompting evacuation orders for 4,000 residents. Loveland resident Becca Walter shared her concerns after her parents moved their horses and evacuated to her home. ""You can rebuild a house, and you can rebuild a barn, but there are lots of memories in them that you can’t rebuild,"" she said, according to AP.A new fire that ignited southwest of Boulder near Gross Reservoir prompted additional evacuation orders. The fire, which had already destroyed at least two structures, was believed to have been caused by human activity. Authorities were questioning two individuals potentially involved, though it did not appear to be intentional. The fire was contained to about five acres (two hectares) by Wednesday evening.Hot and dry weather, along with wind gusts up to 30 mph (50 kph), was expected to continue across the Front Range, exacerbating fire dangers. Forecasters anticipated high temperatures would persist into early next week, though lighter winds in the coming days might aid in controlling the fires.Governor Jared Polis announced the activation of Colorado National Guard units to assist with firefighting efforts, marking the first deployment of the guard since the December 2021 fire that resulted in two deaths and the destruction of nearly 1,100 homes. Polis warned of worsening air quality due to wildfire smoke and urged residents to heed evacuation orders to ensure their safety.In an unfortunate incident, a plane inadvertently dropped fire retardant containing phosphorous and ammonia into a canal leading to Boulder Reservoir. Although the reservoir was not used for drinking water, officials advised against fishing and keeping pets away from the area.Nationwide, nearly 28,000 firefighters were tackling 95 large fires, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. This year saw nearly 7,000 square miles (18,000 square kilometres) burned, a significantly higher area than the 10-year average for this time of year.Fires also caused evacuations in southeastern Wyoming, with around 65 people displaced from Hartville and Pleasant Valley. The Park Fire in Northern California had scorched 609 square miles (1,577 square kilometres), destroying 361 structures and threatening thousands more.As the fire season intensified, firefighters in California focused on containment efforts in the Sequoia National Forest and other areas, while large fires continued to burn across Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and Montana.","A person died and several homes were destroyed as wildfires raged through heavily populated areas of the Colorado foothills.

"Death by firing squad is a legal punishment, South Carolina’s top court rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/death-by-firing-squad-is-a-legal-punishment-south-carolinas-top-court-rules/articleshow/112181242.cms,"The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that death by electrocution , firing squad or lethal injection are all legal forms of execution in the state, finding that none could be considered a cruel or unusual punishment because inmates can choose the option they consider the least painful.The decision came after the state passed a law in 2021 that made death by electric chair or by firing squad legal options for people on death row.The bill, which made electrocution the default method of execution, was proposed because South Carolina could not procure drugs for lethal injection, which remains the most widely used method in other states.Inmates sued, arguing that electrocutions and firing squads could cause extreme pain, and were cruel, corporal or unusual punishments prohibited by the South Carolina Constitution.But their arguments were largely rejected by the court’s five justices, a majority of whom are conservatives. The ruling is expected to allow executions to restart, with all three methods available. There are 32 inmates on death row in South Carolina.Associate Justice John Cannon Few wrote in the majority opinion that the methods “cannot be considered cruel because the condemned inmate may elect to have the state employ the method he and his lawyers believe will cause him the least pain.”The law passed by the Republican-controlled state Legislature, Few wrote, was not “an effort to inflict pain” but rather a “sincere effort to make the death penalty less inhumane while enabling the state to carry out its laws.”He added that “the inescapable reality that an execution by any method may not go as planned — that it will be ‘botched’ — does not render the method ‘cruel’ under the constitution.”“The main effect that this will have is that regardless of whether lethal injection is available, or whether the state can get its hands on lethal injection drugs, executions will resume,” said Madalyn K. Wasilczuk, a professor of law at the University of South Carolina. There are four prisoners on death row who have run out of appeals and are eligible for execution.Opponents of the death penalty condemned the ruling. Jace Woodrum, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina, said that resuming executions “not only fails to make us safer but raises the possibility of the state killing innocent people in our name.”","The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that death by electrocution, firing squad or lethal injection are all legal forms of execution in the state.

Is Democratic strategy of labeling Trump and Vance as 'Weird' a game-changer?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-is-democratic-kamala-harris-strategy-of-labeling-trump-and-vance-as-weird-a-game-changer/articleshow/112181127.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and her Democratic allies have embraced a new label to describe their Republican opponents : “weird.” This unconventional branding has sparked a flurry of responses, as the Democrats seek to turn the tables on Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen JD Vance.The label, which surfaced in interviews and online exchanges, has quickly become a central theme of Harris’ campaign.The strategy targets not just the policies but also the personas of Trump and Vance, with a particular focus on their controversial comments. Vance's previous suggestion that childless leaders ""don’t really have a direct stake"" in the country, and Trump's odd references to the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter during speeches, have both been used to underscore the “weird” narrative.David Karpf, a strategic communication professor at George Washington University, praised the tactic as a concise and resonant message. “It’s a clever way to encapsulate what many feel about Trump and Vance’s rhetoric,” Karpf said. “It forces their campaign to respond in a way that only amplifies the critique.”The effectiveness of this approach is evident in the scramble it has caused within the Trump-Vance camp. So far, their attempts to counter the narrative have struggled to gain traction. Republicans have attempted to deflect by highlighting what they consider "" weird "" aspects of Harris’ persona and policy ideas, but the Democratic campaign has managed to keep the focus on their opponents.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat and Harris ally, has been one of the most vocal proponents of this new messaging. His repeated characterizations of Trump and Vance as ""just weird"" have gained significant media attention and online traction. The Democratic Governors Association, which Walz chairs, has seized on the phrase, amplifying it across platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter).Even in official communications, the Harris campaign is leaning into the label. In a recent news release following Trump's appearance on Fox News, the campaign included a pointed line in its summary: “Trump is old and quite weird?” This framing, subtle yet biting, encapsulates the Democrats’ approach of turning Republicans’ own tactics against them.Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Chris Murphy of Connecticut have also joined in, sharing a video on X where they critique Vance’s past comments on childless Americans as ""a super weird idea."" This online reinforcement has helped solidify the label in the public consciousness.Harris herself has embraced the term during public appearances, directly calling out Trump’s “wild lies” and some of the remarks made by Vance. ""It’s just plain weird,"" she remarked at a recent fundraiser, a line that has since been echoed by her supporters.The “weird” narrative appears to draw from a broader strategy of flipping the script on Republican rhetoric. For years, Republicans have tried to paint Harris and other Democrats as out-of-touch or awkward. Now, Democrats are turning that same critique on its head, using the label to question the judgment and relatability of their opponents.Political analysts suggest that this approach may serve a dual purpose: it not only puts Trump and Vance on the defensive but also works to insulate Harris from similar attacks. Jacob Neiheisel, a political communication professor at the University at Buffalo, likened it to past efforts by candidates to undermine their opponents’ credibility by casting them as unserious or out of step with voters.As the campaign progresses, it remains to be seen whether this strategy will have lasting effects. For now, however, the Democrats' decision to label their opponents as ""weird"" has injected a new dynamic into the race, one that has the potential to reshape the narrative as the election season heats up.","Kamala Harris and her Democratic allies have embraced a new label to describe their Republican opponents : “weird.” This unconventional branding has sparked a flurry of responses, as the Democrats seek to turn the tables on Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen JD Vance.

Trump's disputed claims about immigration and the economy

Response to Trump's remarks

In a recent appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in Chicago, former President Donald Trump made misleading remarks about Vice President Kamala Harris , questioning her racial identity and heritage . Trump claimed that Harris had only recently started identifying as Black, suggesting that she previously promoted only her Indian heritage.These statements are factually incorrect and ignore well-documented aspects of Harris's background and public life.Kamala Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom were immigrants to the United States. Throughout her political career, Harris has openly embraced both aspects of her heritage. As an undergraduate, she attended Howard University, a historically Black college, and was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority. Her political career also includes active participation in the Congressional Black Caucus, and she has consistently supported legislation benefiting the Black community.This incident is not the first time Trump has questioned the identity or qualifications of a political opponent who is a person of color. His comments at the NABJ event follow a history of racially charged attacks, including the promotion of the ""birther"" conspiracy against President Barack Obama and derogatory remarks about various women of color, including former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.During the event, Trump also repeated his unfounded assertion that immigrants in the country illegally are taking jobs from Black Americans, a claim that has been widely debunked by economists and fact-checkers. He further drew controversial comparisons between the January 6th Capitol riot and other protests, which sparked criticism from the audience and journalists alike.The event was marked by tension, with Trump's interview turning hostile as he accused ABC News journalist Rachel Scott of being ""nasty"" and criticized the network for its coverage. Michael Tyler, communications director for Harris's campaign, condemned Trump's comments as divisive and out of touch with the realities of Black Americans.","Kamala Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom were immigrants to the United States.

In a statement following its two-day meeting, the Fed noted that ""job gains have moderated"" and acknowledged a rise in the unemployment rate . The central bank, which is mandated by Congress to ensure stable prices and maximum employment, emphasised it is now ""attentive to the risks"" to both goals, marking a shift from its recent focus solely on controlling inflation.The Fed's policymakers unanimously decided to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%, according to the statement.This decision reflects ""some further progress"" in combating inflation.Despite pressure from many Democratic officials and some economists to lower rates and support the economy , Fed policymakers opted to maintain their key rate at a 23-year high of 5.3%. Some Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have argued that a rate cut before the upcoming election could appear politically motivated.Ahead of the Fed's announcement, financial markets had fully anticipated a rate cut at its next meeting on September 17-18, according to futures markets. The Fed generally aims to avoid surprising investors with its rate decisions.The Fed is attempting to balance keeping rates high enough to reduce inflation, which has decreased to 2.5% from a peak of 7.1% two years ago, while avoiding rates so high they could trigger a recession. So far, it appears on track for a ""soft landing,"" where inflation reaches 2% without causing a recession.However, with the unemployment rate rising for three consecutive months, some economists argue that the Fed should have cut rates sooner or should do so more aggressively later this year. Bharat Ramamurti, an advisor at the American Economic Liberties Project and former Biden White House economist, expressed concern, stating, ""The finish line is in sight, and it would be tragic for the Fed to stumble and fall, with one-tenth of a mile left in the marathon.""Additionally, three Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, urged Chair Jerome Powell in a letter to cut rates, warning that failing to do so soon could appear as if the Fed is yielding to external pressures, which they argue would also be a political move.Recent data has provided some positive news on inflation, with the government reporting last Friday that annual inflation fell to 2.5% in July, down from 2.6% in the previous month and marking the lowest rate since February 2021. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has increased nearly half a percentage point this year to 4.1%, and hiring has slowed. Powell and other Fed officials have increasingly highlighted concerns about the job market , reinforcing market expectations for rate cuts soon.The government is set to release the latest employment figures this Friday, with economists predicting the addition of 175,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.1%.","The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate at a 23-year high of 5.3%. The decision reflects ""some further progress"" in combating inflation, the Fed said. The Fed is attempting to balance keeping rates high enough to reduce inflation, while avoiding rates so high they could trigger a recession.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112176522,imgsize-1148384,width-400,resizemode-4/112176522.jpg"

'Barron never ate lunch'

Donald Trump's youngest son Barron Trump who turned 18 this year and is all set to join a college did not have a normal childhood -- he studied in the school under a fake name, was escorted by guards even when he had to go to the bathroom, Daily Mail reported citing an ""exclusive reveal"". Students and teachers knew it was Donald Trump's son but his official name was Jack so that there was no attempt to hack his data or grades.Everyone knew that he was Barron but during the attendance some substitute teachers called out Jack's name, a former mate said.Many of his former classmates remember Barron Trump as a charming, well-behaved student who was interested in soccer and video game Clash of Clans. But above everything, Barron was an enigma as he never took part in any activity -- not in sports, never attended parties or ate meals with his friends.It was Melania's request that Barron Trump's name should not appear on any social media post regarding the school and he was the only student who was never mentioned in the yearbook.'Barron was very funny and sociable. He would start the most random conversations and could be very entertaining,' a friend told DailyMail.com.‘He was also very mysterious. He never attended football games or dances. I don’t think he met up with anyone outside of school or went on dates.His friends said he might have but nobody was aware of it.From 2021 to 2024, Barron attended Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida, which is known as an elite private school where many Republican-backing wealthy families send their kids. It costs over $41,000 a year. The school had to sign an agreement with the Trumps regarding his privacy.A friend said Barron completed half of his work online. ‘He had multiple agents who would rotate throughout the day and there was always one with him wherever he needed to go,’ a friend said.Other parents were concerned when they learnt that Donald Trump's son was coming to their school fearing that the school would become a target. ""It was a really big deal when he arrived and everyone wanted to get to know him. But after a while it became normalized. The kids barely took any notice of the Secret Service,"" a friend said.Barron went to the school cafeteria with his pals and used to sit with them but he never ate any lunch. He used to say that he would go home and eat. He had no social life involving the school.Before Oxbridge, Barron attended Sr Andrew Episcopal School in Maryland and Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School.",Students and teachers knew it was Donald Trump's son but his official name was Jack so that there was no attempt to hack his data or grades.

Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro is a popular politician and has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022. As a candidate for attorney general, he was one of few Democrats to win statewide in 2016, and he got more votes than President Joe Biden in 2020. He would be the first Jewish vice-president it he is chosen and if the Democratic ticket proves victorious. On Israel war, he has taken a strong stand and criticized the students protests on campuses in his state, Josh Shapiro's wife Lori was his high school sweetheart. Lori previously worked in the White House during the Clinton administration as an analyst in the Office of Science and Technology Policy. They are parents to four kids. Josh Shapiro can make Democrats win Pennsylvania that they badly want to win -- because of his popularity. Republicans reportedly see Shapiro as a threat.

51-year-old Josh Shapiro is leading the race to be Kamala Harris' VP pick -- the name will be announced soon. It has been reported that Harris will hold her first rally with her VP pick in Philadelphia. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg are also in the race. Harris reportedly is interviewing potential VP candidates.But Shapiro said he had snot spoken to Harris since July 21.More than two dozen public education advocacy groups wrote a letter asking Harris not to select Shapiro over his support for private school vouchers. School vouchers, which provide parents with state funding to send children to private schools, are an issue on which Shapiro has agreed to compromise with Republicans since becoming governor.A recent video of a strong and confident Josh Shapiro asking Donald Trump to stop sh** talking about America has gone viral. ""You ever see this guy? He kind of meanders over, can't really walk well, and he goes over to the flag and hugs the flag. I love the flag, but it’s a weird thing he does. While he’s hugging the flag, he’s ripping away our freedoms.""",51-year-old Josh Shapiro is leading the race to be Kamala Harris' VP pick.

Pakistan to launch new messaging app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-launch-new-messaging-app/articleshow/112152439.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has said it would “soon” launch a new messaging application , “Beep Pakistan”, which will initially be used for communication by govt employees and later made available to the general public.The announcement came as Pakistani users have been facing problems with WhatsApp , especially when sending and receiving media files. Digital rights advocates suspect that the country’s testing and deployment of an internet firewall , intended to stifle dissent and crack down on free speech, may be the cause of the disruption.“Beep Pakistan”, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication which says it will be launched “soon” among other government departments.“The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and telecommunication.When the plan was announced last year, the then IT minister, Syed Aminul Haque, described it as Pakistan’s alternative to WhatsApp.Now, govt is distancing itself from that comparison. “Any comparison to WhatsApp is misplaced as there is no intention to compete with any third-party platform,” Khwaja said, adding the purpose of this app is to protect privacy and data.Haque, who currently heads the National Assembly’s standing committee on IT, said govt plans to roll out the application to all its employees within the next 45 days. “Then we will see the situation and launch it for the public too,” he said. Unlike WhatsApp, the former IT minister said, “Beep’s data centre will be in Pakistan, ensuring 100% safety and security. Just as China has WeChat and America has WhatsApp, Pakistan now has its own app.”Pakistani authorities have long been concerned about WhatsApp’s security features, particularly after reports in Dec 2019 that at least two dozen senior officials were targeted by Pegasus, a spyware developed by an Israeli cybersecurity firm. At that time the Pakistan govt instructed all officials to avoid sharing sensitive and confidential documents over WhatsApp.When asked if WhatsApp would be banned in the country following Beep Pakistan’s public launch, Khwaja, the IT minister, denied any plans to block WhatsApp in the country. Haque said he was not in favour of a ban. “But since Beep Pakistan is safe and secure we wish it to be used in Pakistan and those who want to use WhatsApp can continue to use it,” he said.","“Beep Pakistan’, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication. “The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and tele communication.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112152447,imgsize-401505,width-400,resizemode-4/112152447.jpg"

Pakistan seeks reprofiling of over $27 billion debt with friendly nations: Finance minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-seeks-reprofiling-of-over-27-billion-debt-with-friendly-nations-finance-minister/articleshow/112099105.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF, according to a media report on Monday. The Washington-based International Monetary Fund last month announced that it signed a staff-level agreement with Pakistan to provide a $7 billion loan which would be disbursed for 37 months.However, it attached stringent conditions with it, requiring Pakistan prior action before the fund's board accords final approval for the loan.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb after returning from Beijing told the media on Sunday that talks have been going on with China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE for a re-profiling of $27 billion.Aurangzeb said Pakistan had already asked the friendly bilateral trio of lenders to roll over its more than $12 billion annual debt portfolio by three to five years to secure the IMF board's approval, which is expected next month.This is on top of Islamabad's request to Beijing to convert imported coal-based projects to local coal and re-profile more than $15 billion in energy sector liabilities to create fiscal space amid difficulties in timely repayments.Pakistan has a peculiar financial arrangement with these three countries in the shape of commercial loans and SAFE deposits that are rolled over every year and form a major part of the IMF programme in terms of external financing needs.Pakistan has now requested the maturity period of these loans - $5 billion from China, $4 billion from Saudi Arabia, and $3 billion from the UAE - to be extended to at least three years, offering greater predictability under the IMF programme.Aurangzeb said the Chinese side acknowledged Pakistan's foreign exchange difficulties and wanted to help in new business ventures and the re-profiling of energy sector payments besides playing its role in supporting Pakistan's case at the IMF board as one of the major stakeholders.He said the process of debt and equity rescheduling had been started and would now go to the working groups with relevant financial institutions and sponsors of Chinese projects for which Pakistan hired local Chinese consultants.""Between now and the IMF board meeting (on the 37-month bailout package), we have to ensure confirmation of external financing"" from friendly bilateral partners, the minister said.However, he explained that the Chinese energy sector debt reprofiling had nothing to do with the IMF programme as other prior actions had been completed and structural benchmarks were under implementation.Aurangzeb said he was in contact with the Chinese, Saudi and UAE finance ministers for an extension in debt rollover for three years and they had assured their support that would place Pakistan in a very comfortable position in terms of external financing gap.""I can assure you we are at a very good place on external financing for the next three years, including year one, year two and year three,"" he said.He said the IMF had worked out a financing needs assessment for three years that also included its own $7 billion Extended Fund Facility. After rollovers from friendly countries, the remaining external financing gap would become very manageable, he said.Responding to a question, the minister said Pakistan was not seeking any incremental financing from friendly countries. ""The only incremental thing is an extension in the maturity period for three years instead of yearly rollovers,"" he said.Aurangzeb said that the issue of energy sector repayments was initially taken up by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Beijing and followed it up with formal letters to Prime Minister Li Keqiang.As part of the process, Aurangzeb, along with Power Minister Awais Leghari, held meetings with Chinese finance and energy ministers and the governor of the Chinese central bank to understand the context of Pakistan's ability to pay, economic stability and relief in energy tariffs.He said the two sides discussed conversions of Chinese power projects to local coal and how to take their technical, logistical and financial parameters forward.Secondly, financial re-profiling would also need to be discussed with banks and project sponsors one by one. ""They have recognised this and the process would now move forward on that basis,"" Aurangzeb said.He said the re-profiling of CPEC debt was also discussed with the governor of the Chinese central bank and ""we would need to go project by project given the CPEC structure"".""Very positive discussions have taken place from my perspective,"" he said, adding the debt of Chinese independent power producers (IPPs) was manageable as their legal payments were being made, but the issue pertained to return on equity to project sponsors mainly because of foreign exchange which required to be rescheduled to create fiscal space.The minister, however, clarified that Pakistan was seeking the re-profiling of payments and not ""haircuts"" - debt waiver or interest rate cuts.",Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF.

Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's party says ready to talk with Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/bilawal-bhutto-zardaris-party-says-ready-to-talk-with-imran-khan/articleshow/112084489.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples Party-led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that it is ready to talk with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan if the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder is willing to engage, amidst heightened political instability in the cash-strapped country. ""It is being said that the PTI founder is ready to talk. If Imran Khan is ready to talk then that's a positive thing,"" Senior PPP leader Khurshid Shah said while speaking to the media in Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan.Shah welcomed the possibility of talks as a positive development.""President Asif Ali Zardari has always tried to solve problems through negotiations, and the PPP would play its role if needed,"" Shah was quoted as saying by the Express Tribune newspaper.The PPP's willingness to engage with Khan's party comes amidst heightened political instability, following the PTI's hard-line stance against the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led government.The PPP, along with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and other allies, supports the PML-N of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The two former rivals recently witnessed a war of words. The ruling PML-N accepted all the demands of PPP over the federal budget and allocation of development funds.Since Khan's ouster through a vote of no confidence in 2022, the PTI has maintained a strong opposition to the PPP-PML-N alliance.Political tensions increased after the February 8 elections, which saw the two parties forming a coalition government in the Centre.Calls for reconciliation have been growing from various societal and political quarters, urging the PTI to negotiate with the government.Khan's party had previously rejected talks with what it termed the ""Form-47 government,"" instead showing a preference for dialogue with the military establishment.In April, PTI's Shehryar Afridi indicated a preference for negotiations with Army chief Gen Asim Munir and the Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI).Subsequently, PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub mentioned that Imran Khan had assigned significant responsibility to former President Dr Arif Alvi.Last month, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar confirmed that Khan had approved discussions with the government.Similarly, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Khan's sister Aleema Khan called for state institutions to remain neutral for the country's progress.Meanwhile, the government too has called on the Khan-founded party to come to the table and hold talks.""If you want to remove us then do it. You don't want to resolve issues but to further complicate them. You should do talks instead of destroying everything,"" Federal Minister for Petroleum Dr Musadik Malik said last week.",The Pakistan Peoples Party-led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that it is ready to talk with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan.
