NY court junks HW's conviction in case that sparked #MeToo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ny-court-junks-hws-conviction-in-case-that-sparked-metoo/articleshow/109603570.cms,"NEW YORK: New York 's highest court on Thursday overturned the 2020 sex crimes conviction of former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein , in the case that helped to create the #MeToo movement .In a 4-3 decision, the state Court of Appeals said the trial judge made a critical mistake by letting prosecutors introduce testimony from women who claimed that Weinstein assaulted them, even though they were not part of the charges he faced.The court also said the trial judge compounded the error by letting Weinstein be cross-examined in a way that portrayed him in a ""highly prejudicial"" light. ""It is an abuse of judicial discretion to permit untested allegations of nothing more than bad behavior that destroys a defendant's character but sheds no light on their credibility as related to the criminal charges,"" Judge Jenny Rivera said. ""The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial,"" she added.Weinstein, 72, has been serving a 23-year prison sentence, after being convicted in Feb 2020 of sexually assaulting a former production assistant in 2006, and raping an aspiring actress in 2013.

US SC seems ready to limit election case against Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-sc-seems-ready-to-limit-election-case-against-trump/articleshow/109603631.cms,"The US Supreme Court 's conservative majority seemed poised on Thursday to narrow the scope of the criminal case against former Prez Donald Trump on charges that he plotted to subvert the 2020 election. Such a ruling, endorsing at least part of Trump's argument that he is immune from prosecution, would most likely send the case back to the trial court to draw distinctions between official and private conduct.Those proceedings could make it hard to conduct the trial before the 2024 election.D John Sauer, Trump's lawyer, pressed an extreme version of the former prez's argument. In answer to hypothetical questions, he said that presidential orders to murder political rivals or stage a coup could well be subject to immunity.But several of the conservative justices seemed disinclined to consider those questions or the details of the accusations against Trump. Instead, they said the court should issue a ruling that applies to presidential power generally. ""We're writing a rule for the ages,"" Justice Neil Gorsuch said. Justice Brett Kavanaugh also said the court should think about the huge implications ""for the presidency, for the future of the presidency, for the future of the country.""Justice Samuel Alito Jr said that a ruling for Trump could enhance democratic values. ""A stable, democratic society requires that a candidate who loses an election, even a close one, even a hotly contested one, leave office peacefully,"" he said, adding that the prospect of criminal prosecution would make that less likely. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said she had a different understanding. ""A stable democratic society,"" she said, ""needs the good faith of its public officials.""The SC's ruling on whether Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution will be a major statement on the scope of presidential power.

US Supreme Court begins hearing Trump's bid for immunity from prosecution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-begins-hearing-trumps-bid-for-immunity-from-prosecution/articleshow/109599293.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Thursday confronted a major test of the power of the presidency as the justices began hearing arguments over Donald Trump 's bid for immunity from prosecution for his efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat.Trump appealed after lower courts rejected his request to be shielded from four election-related criminal charges on the grounds that he was serving as president when he took the actions that led to the indictment obtained by Special Counsel Jack Smith.Trump, the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election, is the first former US president to be criminally prosecuted.Trump has pleaded not guilty in this case and in three other criminal cases he faces, including an ongoing trial on New York state charges related to hush money paid to a porn star shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House. Trump did not attend the Supreme Court arguments because he was in a Manhattan courtroom in that case.On his way into court in New York, Trump told reporters, ""A president has to have immunity. .... If you don't have immunity, you're not going to do anything. You're just going to become a ceremonial president.""The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices who Trump appointed: Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.The court already this year has handed Trump one major victory as he runs to regain the presidency. On March 4, it overturned a judicial decision that had excluded him from Colorado's ballot under a constitutional provision involving insurrection for inciting and supporting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.Not since its landmark Bush v. Gore decision, which handed the disputed 2000 US election to Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore, has the court played such an integral role in a presidential race.Outside the white marble court building ahead of the arguments on a partly cloudy spring day in the US capital, a small number of demonstrators displayed anti-Trump signs including one that read, ""LOSER.""Trump took numerous steps to try to reverse his 2020 loss to Biden. His false claims of widespread voting fraud helped inspire the rampage at the Capitol on the day Congress met to certify Biden's victory, with his supporters attacking police and storming the building, sending lawmakers and others fleeing. Trump and his allies also devised a plan to use false electors from key states to thwart certification.The August 2023 indictment described Trump as ""determined to remain in power"" despite his election loss. Trump was charged with conspiring to defraud the United States, corruptly obstructing an official proceeding and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against the right of Americans to vote.'ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY'Trump's lawyers told the justices in a filing that a former president has ""absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for his official acts."" Without such immunity, they said, ""the threat of future prosecution and imprisonment would become a political cudgel to influence the most sensitive and controversial presidential decisions.""Smith in a filing urged the justices to reject Trump's bid for immunity from prosecution on the principle that ""no person is above the law.""Trump in October 2023 sought to have the charges dismissed based on his claim of immunity. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected that claim in December. Smith then asked the justices to launch a fast-track review of the immunity claim, a request they rebuffed. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in February ruled 3-0 against Trump's appeal of Chutkan's ruling .The Supreme Court's decision to put off hearing arguments over immunity until this month postponed Trump's trial, which had been scheduled to start in March. Legal experts have said the justices would need to rule by about June 1 for Trump's trial to be held before the election.A ruling is expected no later than the end of June, which could force Chutkan to decide whether to begin a trial in September or October, when early voting already will be underway in some states.If Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes.Trump also faces election subversion charges in state court in Georgia and federal charges in Florida brought by Smith relating to keeping classified documents after leaving office.","US Supreme Court begins hearing arguments over Donald Trump's bid for immunity from prosecution.

Harvard protests mount as tensions spread over Israel-Hamas war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-protests-mount-as-tensions-spread-over-israel-hamas-war/articleshow/109578154.cms,"Students at Harvard University escalated their campus protests over the Israel-Hamas conflict , mirroring actions that have erupted at Columbia, Yale and NYU.Hundreds of Harvard affiliates gathered on Wednesday to demonstrate against the suspension of the Palestine Solidarity Committee, with some flooding into Harvard Yard from their dorms while cheering and putting up tents.The protests, spanning colleges from the University of Michigan to University of California at Berkeley, have centered on calls for the schools to sever financial ties with companies linked to Israel and for the US to end military aid, as well as demands that administrations stop pursuing disciplinary action against students.University officials have been trying to walk the tightrope between upholding free speech and maintaining order, with some resorting to arrests and the dismantling of protest encampments.On Wednesday, hundreds of University of Texas at Austin students walked out in protest but were met by dozens of state troopers in riot gear who demanded they disperse, according to the Dallas Morning News. The troopers were seen arresting some students. Princeton sent a note warning students that anyone involved in an encampment or occupation who refuses to stop will be “arrested and immediately barred from campus.”Columbia University has become a flashpoint in the disruptions facing higher education given the polarization on campuses over the Israel-Hamas war.The demonstrations follow President Minouche Shafik’s congressional testimony last week in which she defended actions she said the school was taking to protect Jewish students. US Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, criticized Shafik’s leadership of the university and called for her resignation. Meanwwhile, faculty and students were outraged after she sent in the police and more than 100 arrests were made.Lawmakers from both parties continue to focus on the strife. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson visited Columbia on Wednesday to meet with Jewish students and deliver remarks on what his office called the “troubling rise of virulent antisemitism on America’s college campuses.” Johnson, speaking while overlooking the Columbia encampment, said if threats continue it may be appropriate for President Joe Biden to call in the National Guard.“We can’t allow this kind of hatred and antisemitism to flourish and we must stop it in its tracks,” Johnson said, as some students booed and chanted pro-Palestinian slogans.In an April 23 statement, Shafik said she supports free speech and recognized that many students were protesting peacefully but warned she would have to consider “alternative options” for clearing the encampment if talks weren’t successful.With the end of the semester nearing and protests continuing, Columbia gave faculty the option to move classes to a hybrid format, allowing students to finish their courses remotely and avoid having to walk through parts of the campus where tensions are running high.Other schools have faced similar disruptions.At Yale, police arrested 60 people including 47 students Monday. President Peter Salovey cited “police reports identifying harmful acts and threatening language used against individuals at or near the protest sites.”Elsewhere in New York City, a group of about 350 New York University students and others gathered in Washington Square Park to protest Israel’s conduct of the war and the school’s handling of the protests. Police arrested more than 100 people this week camped out at a plaza near the university’s business school.A few blocks north, a group of about 50 people protested at the New School’s Greenwich Village campus, calling on the institution to divest its interests with ties to Israel.The protests, occurring around the Jewish holiday of Passover, have also drawn condemnation from the White House and university donors. They have also raised concerns about the use of hard-line tactics by schools against students, and threats against Jewish students by protesters.At some protests at schools, the debate has frequently devolved into harassment and threats, with some demonstrators at Columbia chanting “go back to Poland!” at Jewish students.At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Israel Alliance student group cited “significant fear among the Jewish community” given the events on other campuses, and moved the location of its traditional Passover Seder.Broadly, campus protesters say their goal is to draw attention to humanitarian concerns in Gaza after Hamas militants stormed into Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking scores of hostages, a move that sparked a counterattack by Israeli forces.About 34,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed as part of that response, according to the health ministry run by Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the US government.",Hundreds of Harvard affiliates gathered on Wednesday to demonstrate against the suspension of the Palestine Solidarity Committee.

"Russia warns Europe: if you take our assets, we have a response that will hurt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russia-warns-europe-if-you-take-our-assets-we-have-a-response-that-will-hurt/articleshow/109522142.cms,"MOSCOW: An ally of President Vladimir Putin warned Europe on Tuesday that Russia has already drafted legislation to retaliate if nearly $300 billion of Russian assets were seized by the West and used to help Ukraine.After President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, the United States and its allies prohibited transactions with Russia's central bank and finance ministry, blocking around $300 billion of sovereign Russian assets in the West.Top officials in the United States want to seize the assets to help support Ukraine, though some bankers and European officials are worried that simply taking the assets would create a dangerous precedent.The US house of representatives passed legislation on Saturday including a bill with a provision that would allow the confiscation of Russian sovereign assets, though the lion's share of the assets are in Europe.""We also have a prepared answer,"" Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament, was quoted as saying by state news agency RIA. ""We have a draft law, which we are ready to consider immediately, on retaliatory measures.""""And the Europeans will lose more than we do,"" Matviyenko, who is a member of Russia's powerful Security Council, said.Matviyenko did not give specifics on what the response would be to the seizing of Russian assets which is still under discussion in the West.One option being discussed by the West is to confiscate the income on the underlying assets without taking the actual asset itself.Putin says the West unleashed what he casts as an economic war against Russia but has touted both the resilience of the Russian economy, which grew 3.6% last year, and the failure of sanctions of stop Russian trade.The Kremlin has repeatedly said that any seizure of its assets would go against all the principles of free markets which the West proclaims and that it would undermine confidence in the US dollar and euro while deterring global investment and undermining confidence in Western central banks.Russia has said it will challenge any confiscation of its assets in the courts.Some Russian officials have suggested that if Russian assets are confiscated then foreign investors' assets stuck in special so-called type ""C"" accounts in Russia could face the same fate.It is not clear exactly how much money is in these accounts.The speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said on Monday that Russia had grounds to seize Western assets after the move by the US House of Representatives.Volodin said that of the $280 billion of Russian assets frozen abroad, only $5 to $6 billion was in the United States while about 210 billion euros ($224 billion) was in the European Union.",Russia has drafted legislation to retaliate if nearly $300 billion of Russian assets were seized by the West and used to help Ukraine.

UK passes Rishi Sunak's ambitious Rwanda migrant bill after facing two years of challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-passes-rishi-sunaks-ambitious-rwanda-migrant-bill-after-facing-two-years-of-challenges/articleshow/109516070.cms,"NEW DELHI: The UK Parliament has recently approved a controversial bill that allows the government to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda for their asylum claims to be assessed in the East African nation, as per a report by CNN.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faced opposition in Parliament and legal challenges in British courts while trying to push through this bill, with lawmakers and activists raising concerns about human rights implications.The government's attempts to implement this policy have led to significant embarrassment, as millions of pounds have been sent to Rwanda for a program that has not yielded any results so far, as reported by CNN.The aim of the bill is to deter irregular migration into the UK, particularly targeting individuals who travel in unsafe small boats from France, often facilitated by criminal organizations. Under the legislation, individuals who reach the UK may be sent to Rwanda for their asylum claims to be processed. If their claim is accepted, they will remain in Rwanda. However, if their claim is rejected, the bill states that they cannot be deported from Rwanda to any country other than the UK, although the exact outcome in such scenarios remains unclear.The concept of this scheme was introduced in 2022 when Prime Minister Sunak made it a priority to halt these arrivals, aligning with a Conservative promise to ""stop the boats."" However, two years later, the absence of any deportations has been viewed as a significant setback for Sunak, according to CNN. Last year, the UK Supreme Court deemed the policy unlawful due to the risk that asylum seekers could face ill-treatment if returned to Rwanda, violating international human rights standards. The court highlighted previous concerns regarding human rights abuses in Rwanda, such as extrajudicial killings and torture.In response to these challenges, the UK government introduced the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill earlier this year, asserting that Rwanda is a safe country and overriding the judiciary's concerns. Home Secretary James Cleverly confirmed that the bill has been passed in Parliament and will soon become law, aiming to prevent misuse of human rights claims to obstruct deportations and reaffirming UK sovereignty over European court rulings, as per CNN.Despite the bill's approval, potential legal hurdles may arise in the European Court of Human Rights, given the UK's commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights. The European court has previously prohibited the UK from transferring asylum seekers to Rwanda. The bill has faced delays due to ongoing amendments in a process known as ""ping pong"" between the House of Commons and the House of Lords.In 2022, the migration observatory at the University of Oxford reported 45,744 arrivals via small boats, contributing to a total net migration of 745,000 for the year. These figures pose a challenge for Prime Minister Sunak and the Conservative Party , especially with an upcoming general election. Opposition parties, such as Labour, have expressed intentions to scrap the Rwanda relocation plans if they come into power. The general election is expected to take place later this year, setting the stage for a contentious debate on immigration policies, according to Al Jazeera.(With inputs from agencies)","UK Parliament has approved a bill that allows the government to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda for their asylum claims to be assessed.

The court found that the judge at the landmark #MeToo trial prejudiced the ex-movie mogul with improper rulings, including allowing women to testify about allegations not part of the case.The state Court of Appeals ruling reopens a painful chapter in America's reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures, beginning in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein.The court ordered a new trial, potentially forcing his accusers to relive their traumas on the witness stand.Weinstein, 72, has been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison for charges of criminal sex act and rape in the third degree. These charges stem from incidents involving a TV and film production assistant in 2006 and an aspiring actress in 2013, respectively.Despite the overturning of his New York conviction, Weinstein will remain imprisoned due to his 2022 conviction in Los Angeles for another rape, resulting in a 16-year sentence. Notably, he was acquitted in Los Angeles on charges related to one of the women who testified in New York.Weinstein's legal team argued that Judge James Burke's rulings favored the prosecution, turning the trial into what they described as ""1-800-GET-HARVEY.""This reversal marks a significant setback for the #MeToo movement, coming after the US Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of a Pennsylvania court's decision to overturn Bill Cosby's sexual assault conviction.Weinstein's conviction, initially hailed as a milestone achievement by activists and advocates, has now been dissected by his lawyers and the Court of Appeals.

"Blinken calls for US, China to manage differences ahead of talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-calls-for-us-china-to-manage-differences-ahead-of-talks/articleshow/109592035.cms,"- Pressing on Russia -

BEIJING: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Thursday on the United States and China to manage their differences ""responsibly"" as he landed in Beijing for tough talks with the rival power's leaders.Blinken is expected to address a range of thorny issues including Chinese support for Russia and its treatment of Taiwan, with China likely to raise trade concerns such as new US action against popular social media app TikTok.Blinken headed straight to a closed-door gathering with leading Chinese scholars on Thursday.On Friday a full day of talks with China's political leadership is planned, including a possible meeting with President Xi Jinping .Blinken arrived from Shanghai, where the top US diplomat attempted a charm offensive that saw him sample local food, watch a basketball game and stroll along the city's famous Bund promenade.Visiting the local Communist Party leader in a room with sweeping views of the Shanghai skyline, Blinken said US President Joe Biden was committed to ""direct and sustained"" dialogue between the world's two largest economies after years of mounting tension.""I think it's important to underscore the value -- in fact, the necessity -- of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,"" Blinken said.""We have an obligation for our people -- indeed an obligation to the world -- to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly.""The Chinese Communist Party secretary for Shanghai, Chen Jining, welcomed Blinken partly in English and spoke of the importance of US businesses to the city.""Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity,"" Chen told him.Blinken also met students at the Shanghai campus of New York University, where he voiced hope for more Americans to study in China.He insisted the United States was committed to welcoming Chinese students.Beijing has repeatedly alleged that Chinese nationals with valid travel documents, including students, have been subject to aggressive interrogations and deportations at US airports.""President Biden and President Xi are determined to strengthen our people-to-people ties,"" Blinken said.He also met US business leaders, telling them that the two countries needed to make sure the ""economic relationship is working in the ways that it should work to mutual benefit"".Blinken, the first US secretary of state to visit Shanghai in 14 years, opened his visit Wednesday evening at a restaurant serving steamed buns before going to watch a basketball match between the Shanghai Sharks and the Zhejiang Golden Bulls.Such softer diplomacy, once a staple of US-China relations, would have been unimaginable until recently, with hawks in both countries speaking of an emerging new Cold War.Blinken's aides hope his smiling persona at public events draws an implicit contrast to his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov's gruffer approach when he visited China this month.The next leg of Blinken's trip is set to be far less relaxing when he meets top cadres in Beijing.China has not announced plans for Blinken to meet Xi, although a meeting was announced at the last minute during his previous visit in June.Among the many sticky issues Blinken is expected to raise in Beijing are concerns about China's relationship with Russia.Although US officials were initially pleased that Beijing has not shipped weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine, they now say that China's alarm at Moscow's setbacks on the battlefield has prompted it to export vast quantities of industrial supplies to Russia.US officials believe China is more receptive to Western concerns as it seeks to focus on managing economic headwinds at home and wants to avoid friction with the West.But China is also furious about a series of moves by Biden -- who is facing a tough re-election fight in November against Donald Trump -- they say serve to constrain the Chinese economy.Most recently, the US Congress approved legislation that would force the divestment of TikTok from its Chinese owners or face a ban in the world's largest economy.Biden supports the legislation, arguing that TikTok, popular among young people, poses security and privacy concerns. China has accused the United States of unfair economic coercion.Unusually, Trump has distanced himself from a TikTok ban. He has otherwise championed a tough line on China, with vows to raise tariffs drastically if he returns to office.",US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives in Beijing for talks with China's leaders.

In less than 48 hours, the Pakistani military had carried out retaliatory strikes in Iran on what it said were “hideouts used by terrorist organisations”.Raisi, the first Iranian president to visit Pakistan in eight years, met the country’s top leadership, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, President Asif Zardari and Army Chief General Asim Munir, during his trip. He also extended invitations to President Zardari and PM Sharif to make official visits to Iran.“They (Pakistan and Iran) reiterated the importance of cooperation in the energy domain, including trade in electricity, power transmission lines and Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project,” a joint Iranian-Pakistani statement said, recalling their aim to increase the volume of bilateral trade to $10 billion over the next five years from the current $2 billion.“There was consensus to fully operationalise barter trade mechanisms between the two sides to facilitate economic and commercial activity,” the handout read.The gas pipeline project has languished for more than a decade because of political turmoil and international sanctions.On Tuesday, the US state department had warned Islamabad of the risk of sanctions after it promised greater security and economic cooperation with Iran during President Raisi’s visit.“We advise anyone considering business deals with Iran to be aware of the potential risk of sanctions.

The visit is closely watched amid ongoing tensions with Israel, and US sanctions.“We are committed to strengthening relations at high levels. We have decided to increase economic, commercial, and cultural relations between Pakistan and Iran,” Raisi said.Sharif echoed the sentiment. “We have to keep this relationship strong despite the challenges we face,” he said, commending Iran for its firm stand on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and urging for an immediate cessation of hostilities.Pakistan and Iran share a 900km border, which is susceptible to unlawful crossings, smuggling, and militant infiltration. Both nations accuse each other of failing to prevent terrorist organisations from seeking refuge on their territory and conducting cross-border assaults.Last Jan, Iran launched missile strikes against anti-Iranian militant hideouts in Pakistan’s southwestern Baluchistan province, prompting Islamabad to retaliate with strikes on bases of anti-Pakistan militants operating from Iranian soil. The exchange of strikes raised concerns about larger conflicts and regional instability.The Iranian President is accompanied by his spouse, the foreign minister, cabinet members, and business representatives.Analysts said Raisi’s visit will also address financial and legal issues related to the construction of a gas pipeline between the two countries. Despite signing an agreement in June 2009 for the pipeline to export Iranian natural gas to Pakistan, construction on the Pakistani side has not started, possibly due to US pressure as Iran’s energy sector faces sanctions for its nuclear programme.

The country's only oil refinery was built by Iran in 1969.Raisi arrived in Sri Lanka after a three-day visit to Pakistan that followed tit-for-tat missile strikes in January in the region of Balochistan, which straddles the two nations' porous border.Tehran carried out the first strikes against an anti-Iran group inside Pakistan, with Islamabad retaliating by hitting ""militant targets"" inside Iran.Both nations have previously accused each other of harbouring militants on their respective sides of the border.","Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi arrives in Sri Lanka to inaugurate a power and irrigation project.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Maldives, opposition parties are calling for an investigation and possible impeachment of President Mohamed Muizzu in response to a leaked report dating back to 2018 alleging corruption.The parliamentary elections for the Majlis are scheduled for Sunday, ahead of which, the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and President Muizzu 's People's National Congress (PNC) have engaged in trading barbs and accusations against each other.The political turmoil began when an anonymous individual using the handle 'Hassan Kurusee' shared leaked intelligence reports on social media, which included documents from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Maldives Monetary Authority and the Maldives Police Service. These reports purportedly linked President Muizzu to financial misconduct, citing irregularities in money transfers to his personal bank account and suggesting possible involvement with politically exposed individuals, embezzlement, structured transactions, and the use of corporate entities to conceal fund origins.The allegations sparked a firestorm of reactions on social media, with demands from the MDP and People's National Front (PNF) for an official investigation into the matter. Former vice president Dr Mohamed Jameel Ahmed went a step further, calling for President Muizzu's impeachment based on the leaked intelligence reports. Jameel emphasized the importance of accountability in governance and urged President Muizzu to cooperate with independent investigations into the allegations, including those related to the Ras Male' development project and alleged excessive spending on public relations.President Muizzu responded to the corruption allegations on Tuesday, asserting that the opposition's attempts to implicate him were baseless and driven by desperation. He denied any wrongdoing and accused the opposition of leaking the reports to tarnish his reputation.""The same allegations had been made during his campaigns for mayor and President,"" he said adding, the response would also be the same as before.""While you attempt to pin something on me like this, you couldn't do it before and you can't do it now.

Britain's King Charles grants approval to legislation allowing asylum seekers to be sent to Rwanda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britains-king-charles-grants-approval-to-legislation-allowing-asylum-seekers-to-be-sent-to-rwanda/articleshow/109594288.cms,"What is Rwanda Policy?

NEW DELHI: Britain 's King Charles has granted his approval to the legislation that is crucial for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 's strategy to send asylum seekers to Rwanda .The stage of royal assent marks the conclusion of the legislative process, and essentially 'rubber stamps' the decision made by parliament earlier this week to approve the bill following a lengthy battle between the government and opponents of the plan.The announcement of the Royal Assent took place in the House of Lords on Thursday, signifying that the 'Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill' will now become law.The legislation was approved by parliament in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Sunak mentioned on Monday that he anticipated the first flights to Rwandan to take off in 10 to 12 weeks after it was passed.With an increase in asylum-seekers arriving across the English Channel, the Conservative government vowed to halt this trend. Many of these arrivals, using small and often unsafe boats, seek asylum in Britain. In response, the government introduced the Rwanda policy, stating that those arriving via irregular means would not be eligible for asylum in Britain. Instead, they would be detained and sent to Rwanda for their asylum cases to be processed. The government claimed this policy will deter dangerous crossings, but some experts dispute this.The origins of this policy trace back to early 2021, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson began discussing plans to send asylum-seekers abroad. This initiative aligns with the promises made during the Brexit campaign in 2016. The Nationality and Borders Bill, introduced by Priti Patel in 2021, criminalized irregular entry into the country and expanded authorities' powers to arrest and remove asylum-seekers.By April 2022, a deal was struck with Rwanda to accept asylum-seekers in exchange for development funding. Legal challenges ensued, leading to a Supreme Court ruling against deporting asylum-seekers to Rwanda. However, the Safety of Rwanda Bill and a treaty sought to override this ruling by declaring Rwanda safe.Although no asylum-seekers have been sent yet, Britain has committed substantial funds to Rwanda. The opposition has criticized the high costs, suggesting the money would be better spent on bolstering border security.",King Charles has granted his approval to the 'Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill' The legislation was approved by parliament in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

From whisky to weapons: Why UK is changing its strategy on Taiwan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/from-whisky-to-weapons-why-uk-is-changing-its-strategy-on-taiwan/articleshow/109591313.cms,"NEW DELHI: In recent years, Britain's approach towards Taiwan has undergone a significant shift, moving from primarily economic interactions to a more nuanced engagement that increasingly views Taiwan through a security lens. This change in policy was highlighted during a recent parliamentary debate prompted by Stewart McDonald, an MP from the Scottish National Party, on the United Kingdom's stance towards the Taiwan Strait.The debate, coupled with other recent events, reflects a growing concern in British foreign policy about China's assertive actions on the international stage, a report in the Diplomat said.Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the minister of state for the Indo-Pacific, articulated this shift in her statements during the parliamentary session. Initially, Taiwan was mainly viewed as a vital market for goods like Scottish whisky. However, recent discussions have framed Taiwan as a key security issue, vital to Britain’s economic security. This represents a significant pivot in how the UK perceives its relationship with Taiwan, indicating deeper geopolitical concerns rather than mere economic interests.This re-framing aligns with broader British anxieties about China’s role in global affairs, which were underscored by a Chinese cyber-attack on British democratic institutions reported on the same day as McDonald’s debate. Deputy Prime Minister Olivier Dowden's parliamentary statement on the incident notably omitted Taiwan—a critical oversight given the sustained Chinese cyber espionage Taiwan faces.Despite the lack of formal diplomatic relations, as emphasized in historical and recent debates, the UK maintains ""strong unofficial"" ties with Taiwan. Previous framings of the relationship under ministers like Mark Field and Amanda Milling acknowledged these unofficial yet important links, focusing on shared economic, scientific, and educational interests, the Diplomat report said.However, Trevelyan's recent statements have broadened this scope to include shared security interests, specifically in maintaining stability in the Indo-Pacific region. This evolution in narrative suggests that Britain now sees Taiwan not just as an economic partner but as a pivotal ally in ensuring regional security.","In recent years, Britain's approach towards Taiwan has undergone a significant shift.

The couple found the coins ranging from James I and Charles I gold coins to silver half crowns, shillings, and sixpences from various reigns, including Elizabeth I and Philip and Mary.Upon finding the coins, the Fooks promptly reported their discovery to local authorities, who forwarded the artifacts to the British Museum for cleaning and identification.Now, the coins are set to go under the hammer at Duke’s auctioneers in Dorchester, Dorset, with an anticipated value of approximately £35,000.Betty Fooks, an NHS health visitor, recounted the unexpected find, noting that their decision to lower the ground floor during renovations revealed the hidden treasure. She speculated that the original owner likely intended to retrieve the coins but never had the opportunity, reported The Guardian.""It is a 400-year-old house so there was lots of work to do. We were taking all the floors and ceilings out and took it back to its stone walls. We decided to lower the ground floor to give us more ceiling height... One evening, I was with the children and my husband was digging with a pick axe when he called to say they’ve found something. He put all the coins in a bucket. If we hadn’t lowered the floor, they would still be hidden there. I presume the person intended to retrieve them but never got the chance,” Betty added.Julian Smith, specialist at Duke's auctioneers said that the cottage which was bought by Fooks couple is situated in a small hamlet in west Dorset, and is a 17th century long-house.","Betty and Robert Fooks, hailing from Dorset, unearthed ancient coins from the kitchen's concrete floor while excavating to increase ceiling height.

Four people were treated for injuries, including a soldier who was thrown from one of the horses, according to the London ambulance service.The horses, which belong to the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, a unit that parades in royal pageants, are normally well-trained symbols of London's regal past .On Wednesday, however, they broke into a panicked stampede that had more in common with the Wild West. Galloping past some of London's most famous sites - from Buckingham Palace to Tower Bridge - they left a trail of damaged vehicles and shocked pedestrians, some of whom had to dart out of their way.By 10.30am, the Metropolitan Police said all the horses had been recovered and were back in their barracks in Hyde Park. But some had suffered injuries, including a white horse that had blood splashed on its neck, chest and forelimbs. The drama began shortly after 8am when the horses, apparently spooked by the noise from a nearby construction site, threw off the military riders who were taking them out for routine exercises. Photos showed one of the soldiers being treated while lying on the ground on Buckingham Palace Road.Video footage captured a pair of riderless horses galloping in Aldwych, a stately area in central London. Their hooves clattered in the shadow of grand stone buildings as passers-by scattered, buses jerked to a stop and cars honked. The white horse, wearing a saddle and stirrups with its reins flying behind it, was caught on video later galloping in the vicinity of Tower Bridge. Other pictures showed the result of unexpected encounters between animals and a busy urban landscape: a double-decker tour bus with a smashed windshield and a gray Mercedes van with a dented door and smashed rear windows.As the incident unfolded, the media began carrying live coverage, briefly riveting much of the city. Shortly before 10am, the London police reported that its officers had corralled two of the horses near Limehouse, a neighbourhood adjacent to the city's docklands. That indicated they had made their way across Central London, from Westminster through Covent Garden and past the financial district.Megan Morra, who was on her way to work, told BBC that she saw one of the horses had a head injury. ""There was a lot of blood. I was a bit distressed looking at the poor horse."" The horses are trained to be comfortable in busy streets and around people, which made the episode extraordinarily unusual.","The horses, which belong to the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, are normally well-trained symbols of London's regal past. On Wednesday, however, they broke into a panicked stampede that had more in common with the Wild West. Four people were treated for injuries, including a soldier who was thrown from one of the horses.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109576696,imgsize-950515,width-400,resizemode-4/109576696.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Buckingham Palace on Wednesday announced that Queen Camilla , Prince William, and Catherine, Princess of Wales, have been bestowed with significant royal honours . Prince William has been appointed as the great master of the order of the bath, while Catherine has become a companion of honour, an order that acknowledges outstanding contributions in various fields such as arts, medicine, sciences, and public service.Queen Camilla has been named the grand master of the order of the British empire, a position previously held by Prince Philip and King George VI. These appointments come at a time when the Royal Family's numbers are reduced, and both King Charles and Catherine have been undergoing cancer treatment. The honours recognize the efforts of those who have been carrying out official duties, particularly the Queen, who at 76 years old, has been attending events on behalf of the King.The Order of the British Empire was established in 1917 to honour a wider range of civilian and military recipients. Catherine's appointment as a Companion of Honour, the first royal to receive this honour in the order's 107-year history, is seen as a gesture of support from the King. She joins a distinguished group of individuals recognised for their contributions to public life, including Sir David Attenborough, Ian McEwan, and Sir Elton John.Prince William's role as Great Master of the Order of the Bath, which was previously held by his father when he was Prince of Wales, is a reward for exemplary service in military or civilian life. The Duchess of Gloucester, a working royal at 77, has been appointed as a member of the Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior order of chivalry, dating back to the 14th century.Lord Lloyd-Webber, who composed music for last year's Coronation, has also been made a member of the Order of the Garter, along with Air Chief Marshal Lord Peach and Lord Kakkar, who has had a distinguished career in medicine and public service. However, the anti-monarchy group Republic has criticised these honours, calling them a ""slap in the face for all the hardworking people who get awarded MBEs, OBEs and CBEs"" and an act of ""breathtaking nepotism.""","Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Camilla, Prince William, and Catherine, Princess of Wales, have been bestowed with significant royal honours.
