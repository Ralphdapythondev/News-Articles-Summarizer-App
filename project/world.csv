US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito rejects Democrats’ calls to step away from Trump cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-justice-samuel-alito-rejects-democrats-calls-to-step-away-from-trump-cases/articleshow/110548804.cms,"US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito told lawmakers he won’t recuse from cases involving Donald Trump and the January 6 Capitol riot after revelations that flags associated with far-right causes flew over his homes in Virginia and New Jersey.Responding to Democratic calls that he disqualify himself, Alito said in two letters that his wife, Martha-Ann Alito , was responsible for flying the flags.“My wife is an independently minded private citizen,” he wrote. “She makes her own decisions, and I honor her right to do so.”The court is set to decide by the end of June whether Trump is immune from criminal charges that he illegally tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. In a second case that could have implications for the Trump prosecution, the justices are also weighing an appeal by a man charged with being part of the Capitol assault.The New York Times reported that an upside-down American flag was displayed at Alito’s Virginia house in the days before President Joe Biden’s inauguration. More recently, an “Appeal to Heaven” flag flew at Alito’s beach residence in New Jersey, the Times said. Similar flags were carried by January 6 rioters.“My wife is fond of flying flags. I am not,” Alito wrote to Democratic lawmakers including Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia. “She was solely responsible for having flagpoles put up at our residence and our vacation home and has flown a wide variety of flags over the years.”Alito said his wife flew the upside-down flag during a “very nasty neighborhood dispute” during which a house displayed a sign personally attacking her and a man directed a vile epithet at her. He said he asked Martha-Ann Alito to take down the flag as soon as he saw it, “but for several days, she refused.”He said he presumed his wife was expressing a patriotic and religious message with the “Appeal to Heaven” flag and that neither Alito was aware of any connection to the “Stop the Steal Movement.”Johnson, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary subcommittee that oversees federal courts, said Alito’s response underscored the need for Congress to impose an enforceable code of conduct on the Supreme Court. The code adopted by the Supreme Court in November doesn’t include any enforcement mechanism.“Any unbiased and reasonable person would find laughable Justice Alito’s ‘the dog ate my homework, and I didn’t even know I had homework’ defense,” Johnson said in an emailed statement.Alito, 74, is one of the anchors of the conservative wing that controls the Supreme Court. Two years ago, he wrote the court’s opinion overturing the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling and eliminating the constitutional right to abortion.",US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito told lawmakers he won’t recuse from cases involving Donald Trump and the January 6 Capitol riot. The court is set to decide by the end of June whether Trump is immune from criminal charges that he illegally tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110548799,imgsize-59992,width-400,resizemode-4/110548799.jpg"
"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down massive global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities. The US Department of Justice and the FBI have been instrumental in this operation, which has led to significant financial and operational seizures, including millions in cryptocurrency and luxury assets.Here is all you need to know:(With inputs from agencies)","The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries.

Violence clouds the last day of campaigning for Mexico's election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/violence-clouds-the-last-day-of-campaigning-for-mexicos-election/articleshow/110548139.cms,"MEXICO CITY: Mexico held the last day of campaigning Wednesday before Sunday's nationwide election, but the closing rallies were darkened by attacks on candidates and the country's persistently high homicide rate.Opposition candidate Xochitl Galvez started her last campaign rallies early Wednesday on the outskirts of Mexico City, and she focused her ire on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador 's ""hugs not bullets"" policy of not confronting the drug cartels .Galvez is facing the candidate of Lopez Obrador's Morena party , former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum, who leads in the race, has promised to continue all of Lopez Obrador's policies.""Are we going to continue with hugs, or are we going to apply the law to criminals?"" Galvez asked a cheering crowd. ""Mexico wants peace, wants tranquility.""Lopez Obrador has withdrawn funding for police forces and directed it to the quasi-military National Guard, which critics say lacks the professional and investigative abilities needed to fight the drug gangs. Galvez promised to return the funding to police forces and guarantee them wages of at least $1,200 per month.Galvez also pledged to reconcile a country that has been highly polarized by the outgoing president's rhetoric, saying ""enough division, enough hatred ... we are all Mexicans.""Sheinbaum held her final rally later Wednesday in Mexico City's vast, colonial-era central square. She delivered a strongly nationalistic speech to a large crowd.""Mexico is respected in the world, it is a reference point,"" Sheinbaum said, claiming that Lopez Obrador's government ""has returned to us the pride of being Mexicans.""""Mexico has changed, and for the better,"" she said.On the violence issue, Sheinbaum vowed to continue Lopez Obrador's policy of offering apprenticeships to encourage youths not to join drug cartels.""We will deepen the strategy of peace and security, and the progress that has been made,"" she said. ""This is not an iron fist"" policy, Sheinbaum said. ""This is justice.""While Lopez Obrador has increased the country's minimum wage and increased government benefit programs, he has been unable to significantly reduce the historically high homicide rate, which currently runs at more than 30,000 killings per year nationwide. That gang-fueled violence has also cast a shadow over the campaigns.A mayoral candidate in the western state of Jalisco was shot multiple times by intruders in his campaign offices late Tuesday. Two members of Gilberto Palomar's campaign staff were also wounded, and all three were hospitalized in serious condition, according to Jalisco state security coordinator Sanchez Beruben.Mexicans will vote Sunday in an election weighing gender, democracy and populism, as they chart the country's path forward in voting shadowed by cartel violence. With two women leading the contest, Mexico will likely elect its first female president. More than 20,000 congressional and local positions are up for grabs, according to the National Electoral Institute.Gunmen killed an alternate mayoral candidate in Morelos state, just south of Mexico City on Tuesday, state prosecutors said.Local media reported attackers on a motorcycle shot Ricardo Arizmendi five times in the head in the city of Cuautla in Morelos. Alternate candidates take office if the winner of a race is incapacitated or resigns.About 27 candidates, mostly running for mayor or town councils, have been killed so far this year. While that is not much higher than in some past elections, what is unprecedented is the mass shootings: candidates used to be killed in targeted attacks, but now criminals have taken to spraying whole campaign events with gunfire.","Mexicans will vote Sunday in an election weighing gender, democracy and populism.

"An Iceland volcano starts erupting again, shooting lava into the sky",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/an-iceland-volcano-starts-erupting-again-shooting-lava-into-the-sky/articleshow/110547846.cms,"GRINDAVIK: A volcano in southwestern Iceland erupted Wednesday for the fifth time since December, spewing red lava that once again threatened the coastal town of Grindavik and led to the evacuation of the popular Blue Lagoon geothermal spa.The eruption began in the early afternoon following a series of earthquakes north of the town of 3,800 people that was largely evacuated in December when the volcano came to life after centuries of dormancy and put on an impressive show of nature's power.Although activity began to calm down by early evening, initial estimates found the eruption was the most vigorous in the area so far, as lava shot 50 meters (165 feet) into the sky from a fissure that grew to 3.5 kilometers (2.1 miles) in length, the Icelandic Meteorological Office said.Barriers built to protect Grindavik deflected the flowing lava that cut off two of the three roads leading to town and was close to reaching the third.""It's a much larger volume that's on the move right now headed for town,"" Grindavik Mayor Fannar Jonasson told national broadcaster RUV. ""The lava has already conquered (a lot).""Workers and anyone still in town were ordered to leave earlier in the day, police said.At one point, a dark plume of ash boiled up over the crater from an explosive interaction of magma hitting groundwater, scientists said.The cloud did not rise high enough to initially pose any threat to aviation, but scientists were closely monitoring the situation, Johanna Malen Skuladottir, of the Met Office, told RUV.Grindavik, which is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, has been threatened since a swarm of earthquakes in November forced an evacuation in advance of the initial Dec. 18 eruption. A subsequent eruption overwhelmed some defensive walls and consumed several buildings.The area is part of the Svartsengi volcanic system that was dormant for nearly 800 years before reawakening.The volcano erupted again in February and March. The Feb. 8 eruption engulfed a pipeline, cutting off heat and hot water to thousands of people.Iceland, which sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic, sees regular eruptions and is experienced at dealing with them. The most disruptive in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed huge clouds of ash into the atmosphere and led to widespread airspace closures over Europe.","Lava shoots 50 meters into the sky from a fissure that grew to 3.5 kilometers (2.1 miles) in length.

US to boycott UN tribute to Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi killed in helicopter crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-to-boycott-un-tribute-to-iranian-president-ebrahim-raisi-killed-in-helicopter-crash/articleshow/110547589.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United States will boycott a United Nations tribute on Thursday to Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi , who died earlier this month in a helicopter crash , according to a US official.The 193-member UN General Assembly traditionally meets to honor any sitting head of state at the time of their death. The tribute will include speeches about Raisi.""We won't attend this event in any capacity,"" a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. The US boycott has not previously been reported.Iran 's mission to the United Nations in New York declined to comment. Raisi, a hardliner considered a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, died when his helicopter crashed in poor weather near the Azerbaijan border on May 19.""The United Nations should be standing with the people of Iran, not memorializing their decades-long oppressor,"" said the US official. ""Raisi was involved in numerous, horrific human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killings of thousands of political prisoners in 1988.""""Some of the worst human rights abuses on record, especially against the women and girls of Iran, took place during his tenure,"" the official said.The UN Security Council observed a moment of silence on May 20, at the start of an unrelated meeting, to honor the victims of the helicopter crash that killed Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. Deputy US Ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, reluctantly stood with his 14 counterparts during the tribute.The United States expressed its ""official condolences"" for Raisi's death, the State Department said on May 20. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby also said that day: ""No question this was a man who had a lot of blood on his hands.""The Biden administration faced strong criticism from some Republican members of Congress for offering condolences to Iran following Raisi's death.Raisi, 63, was elected president in 2021. During his tenure, he tightened morality laws, oversaw a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests, and pushed hard in nuclear negotiations with world powers.","The 193-member UN General Assembly traditionally meets to honor any sitting head of state at the time of their death.

"Power outages could linger for days after storms batter Texas again, leaving 1 dead",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/power-outages-could-linger-for-days-after-storms-batter-texas-again-leaving-1-dead/articleshow/110547156.cms,"HOUSTON: Power outages scattered across storm-weary Texas on Wednesday could linger into the weekend after storms flooded streets in Houston for the second time this month and ripped off roofs in Dallas, leaving a teenager dead and injuring others.The teen was killed Tuesday at a construction site while working on a home that collapsed, and three people at a campground were shocked by a downed power line. The severe weather left more than 1 million homes and businesses without electricity at one point.Electric utility Oncor said power in the Dallas area should be restored by Friday for most customers, but some outages will continue into the weekend. More than 1 million homes and businesses were without electricity across Texas at one point, but by Wednesday afternoon, the lights had come back on for about 70% of those customers.Houston was flooded and damaged just weeks after a storm walloped the area, killing eight people. The 16-year-old worker was killed northeast of the city, in the suburb of Magnolia. He was a construction company employee, the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office said.A 6-year-old boy and two others who were shocked by the downed power line at a campground north of Houston were in critical condition, authorities said.Witnesses saw a 59-year-old man touch the line Tuesday, but investigators were trying to determine how the two others were shocked, Montgomery County Fire Marshal Jimmy Williams said Wednesday.A couple driving during the storm in the Houston suburb of Spring missed a turn and then spotted a pickup truck submerged in a culvert.Ashley Renee Young said her boyfriend, Robert Chance, grabbed a sledgehammer from his toolbox, broke the back window and pulled out the driver, who only suffered minor cuts from broken glass. They then bought the man a shirt from a nearby gas station before driving him home.""I think we have lifelong friends now,"" Young said.The potential for heavy rains, localized flash flooding and severe weather continued Wednesday through Oklahoma and Texas. Thunderstorms were predicted late Wednesday and Thursday across eastern Montana and Wyoming and northeast Colorado before pushing into Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and northern Texas.Tuesday's power outages in the Dallas area prompted officials to extend voting by two hours in the state's runoff elections after dozens of polling places lost electricity amid 80 mph winds (129 kph) that caused extensive damage.Social media posts showed winds pushing an unoccupied American Airlines plane away from a gate at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. No one was injured, but the airport said about 500 flights were canceled because of the weather.The National Weather Service said the ""very active and highly impactful"" weather pattern will continue in the central US over the next several days.Destructive storms over the Memorial Day weekend killed 24 people in seven states across the South, the deaths stretching from Texas to Virginia.","More than 1 million homes and businesses were without electricity across Texas at one point.

UK parliament dissolved ahead of general election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-parliament-dissolved-ahead-of-general-election/articleshow/110546979.cms,"The British parliament was dissolved on Thursday, as the five-week campaign period begun leading up to the general election on July 4.The election is expected to bring the Labour party back to power after 14 years of Conservative rule. As the clock struck one minute past midnight, all 650 seats of members of parliament (MPs) became vacant, marking the official commencement of the electoral process.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 's election announcement, which took place amidst a heavy downpour, has been seen by many as a shaky start to the campaign, with some interpreting the rain as an ill omen.Sunak's decision to hold the election on July 4, earlier than anticipated, is viewed as an attempt to regain momentum as his party's popularity wanes in opinion polls. Meanwhile, the Labour party, led by former human rights lawyer Keir Starmer, is poised to capitalize on the opportunity to regain power after 14 years in opposition.The ruling Conservative party is not only trailing significantly behind Labour in the polls but also facing a mass exodus of parliamentarians. An unprecedented 129 MPs, including 77 Conservatives, have announced their decision not to seek re-election, reflecting the bleak prospects of victory for the governing party. Some Tory MPs have expressed frustration at being caught off guard by the July election date, with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Steve Baker opting to continue his vacation in Greece while preparing his campaign remotely.Despite Sunak's efforts to promote the Conservatives as the ""safe"" option during his campaign travels across the country, his campaign has encountered some early setbacks. A visit to the site where the Titanic was built drew comparisons between his leadership and captaining a sinking ship. Sunak's campaign has focused on appealing to older voters and right-wing supporters, with pledges to bring back national service and a substantial tax break for pensioners. However, these efforts have done little to boost the party's favor, with polls indicating a significant lead for Labour.Labour, on the other hand, is aiming to capitalize on the public's fatigue with the Conservatives, who have seen five prime ministers since 2016, along with numerous scandals and economic challenges. The party has sought to position itself as the ""natural party of business,"" garnering the support of 120 industry leaders this week. Under the leadership of Keir Starmer, Labour has shifted towards the center in an attempt to win back voters, including by expelling former leader Jeremy Corbyn and taking steps to address anti-Semitism within the party.However, the past week has also exposed long-standing factional divisions within Labour, with MP Diane Abbott expressing dismay at the party's desire to bar her from candidacy. Starmer has faced criticism from leftist voters who accuse him of backtracking on promises made during his successful leadership campaign. As the campaign progresses, both parties will need to navigate internal challenges while presenting a compelling vision to the electorate.(With AFP inputs)","The British parliament was dissolved on Thursday, as the five-week campaign period begun leading up to the general election on July 4.

What would an ICC arrest mean for Israel's Netanyahu?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/what-would-an-icc-arrest-mean-for-israels-netanyahu/articleshow/110519943.cms,"The International Criminal Court could soon issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu along with his defense minister and three Hamas leaders. If it does, what are the potential consequences?The government in Tel Aviv has cast a cautious eye toward The Hague, Netherlands, home of the International Criminal Court (ICC).The court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. They are accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip.Khan also requested arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismael Haniyeh — on similar charges related to the Islamist militant group's October 7 attacks on Israel What type of criminal case could the ICC bring against Netanyahu? The International Criminal Court only investigates individuals and only becomes active when a person is suspected of being responsible for one of four core crimes: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, or starting a war of aggression.The ICC has in fact been looking into possible war crimes committed by Israel since 2021. At the same time, the court has also been investigating similar accusations leveled against Hamas fighters. Moreover, investigations are currently ongoing in regard to acts of violence committed by Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Recent developments in the war between Israel and Hamas are all being considered in that context.This most recent conflict began when militant Islamist Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and abducting more than 240 back to Gaza. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by numerous Western nations, including many EU member states as well as the US.According to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry, Israel's military response to the attack has killed more than 34,000 people, though these numbers cannot be independently verified. When does the ICC have jurisdiction over Israeli citizens?As a rule, the ICC may only take action when states cannot or will not pursue charges for the above-mentioned crimes at the national level. The current war makes it even more unlikely than usual that Israeli courts would initiate criminal proceedings against the head of its government, its ministers or army leadership. Furthermore, either a perpetrator's home country must also acknowledge the court. Israel does not or the country in which a crime is alleged to have taken place must.That could well be the case here, as the Palestinian territories are signatories to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Joining Israel in their rejection of the ICC are the US, China, Russia, India, almost all Arab states, and Iran.When none of the nations tied to the crimes are ICC Treaty signatories, then the task of contracting the ICC to investigate falls to the United Nations Security Council as was the case, for instance, with Libya and Sudan. What consequences could the ICC warrant have for Netanyahu?An arrest warrant is not a conviction. In the first instance it is a sign that the ICC takes accusations leveled against an individual seriously enough to investigate them.According to the ICC website, judges will issue a warrant of arrest if it appears necessary to ensure that the person will actually appear at trial, that he or she will not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court's proceedings, or to prevent the person from continuing to commit crimes. However, as the ICC has no police force to arrest individuals against whom it has issued warrants, it is highly unlikely that members of the Israeli government will ever appear before judges in The Hague.Still, an arrest warrant would greatly limit the freedom of movement that Netanyahu and his associates enjoy, for each of the ICC treaty's 124 signatories are obliged to arrest individuals with outstanding warrants and to hand them over to the court.That is why Russian President Vladimir Putin has been forced to avoid traveling to most international meetings since the ICC issued a warrant for his arrest over accusations that he is involved in the systematic abduction of Ukrainian children. Putin only travels directly to and from nations that do not recognize the legitimacy of the ICC. How would such an arrest warrant be tied to accusations of genocide leveled at Israel?The ICC's investigation should not be confused with another similar case pending against the state of Israel, namely the charge of genocide leveled against it by several nations. Among others, South Africa has spearheaded a case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) based on the high number of casualties in Gaza.The ICJ is also based in The Hague, but does not investigate individuals nor does it issue arrest warrants, instead dealing exclusively with legal disputes between states. In late January, the ICJ said it recognized the ""risk of genocide in the Gaza Strip.Still, the ICJ refused to back an emergency motion filed by South Africa demanding Israel immediately cease all military operations in the enclave. As a result of that stance, the genocide case against Israel could potentially drag on for months or even years.","The International Criminal Court could soon issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu along with his defense minister and three Hamas leaders. The court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.

In November, he was briefly removed from his position as CEO, causing shockwaves in the rapidly evolving AI industry, but was later reinstated.Altman, who initially established OpenAI as a nonprofit research organization dedicated to developing AI safely for the benefit of humanity, now intends to focus his philanthropic efforts on ""technology that helps create abundance for people."" In a joint letter with his husband, technology investor Oliver Mulherin, dated May 18, Altman expressed gratitude for the hard work and dedication of those who have contributed to the advancement of society, saying, ""There is nothing we can do except feel immense gratitude and commit to pay it forward, and do what we can to build the scaffolding up a little higher.""The Giving Pledge, established in 2010 by Bill Gates , Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett , aims to encourage philanthropy among the world's wealthiest individuals to address pressing global issues. The initiative has attracted more than 240 signatories from 30 countries, although some critics argue that there is insufficient oversight to ensure that pledgers fulfill their commitments.Altman has not specified the exact causes he will support, but his track record suggests a focus on areas such as education, scientific research, and global health. His philanthropic philosophy aligns with his professional mission at OpenAI, where he has emphasized the ethical development and deployment of artificial intelligence.Altman's decision is part of a broader trend among tech leaders who are using their financial resources to address global challenges.

Israel's Rafah operation not a major offensive: US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israels-rafah-operation-not-a-major-offensive-us/articleshow/110516106.cms,"WASHINGTON: The White House on Tuesday provided the most complete definition yet of what it considers a ""major ground operation "" in Rafah that could trigger a change in United States policy toward Israel, and said Israel's actions there have not yet reached that level.""We have not seen them smash into Rafah - we have not seen them go in with large units, large numbers of troops in columns and formations in some sort of coordinated maneuver against multiple targets on the ground. That is a major ground operation. We have not seen that,"" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at a briefing.Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive stirred renewed outrage and prompted an outcry from global leaders after an airstike on Sunday that Gaza officials said killed at least 45 people when a blaze ignited in a tent camp in a western district.The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Israel against launching a large-scale military offensive in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza packed with refugees who followed Israel's previous orders to evacuate there. President Joe Biden himself publicly warned Israel this month that the U.S. would stop supplying it with weapons if Israeli forces conduct a major invasion there without a credible plan to protect civilians.Israel told around one million Palestinian civilians displaced by the almost eight-month-old war to evacuate to Al-Mawasi when it launched its incursion in Rafah in early May. Around that many have fled Rafah since then, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA reported on Tuesday.Asked about reports that Israeli forces have moved into central Rafah, Kirby said ""my understanding is, and I believe the Israelis have spoken to this, that they are moving along something called the Philadelphia corridor, which is on the outskirts of the town, not in the town proper.""""We have not seen a major ground operation and these tanks are moving along a corridor that they have told us previously that they would use on the outskirts of the town to try to put pressure on Hamas,"" Kirby said.The World Court last week ordered Israel to immediately halt its military assault on Rafah, in a landmark emergency ruling in South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide.Israel said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives in a compound and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.""I don't know how anybody could dispute that they were trying to go after Hamas in a targeted precise way,"" Kirby said, adding that the U.S. would wait for the results of Israel's investigation into the incident.The U.S. is by far the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, and it accelerated deliveries after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks.Rafah was a major entry point for humanitarian relief before Israel stepped up its military offensive on the Gaza side of the border earlier this month and seized control of the crossing from the Palestinian side.More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.",The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Israel against launching a large- scale military offensive in Rafah.

Surveillance and Repression

Impact on daily life

NEW DELHI: The Chinese government's crackdown on the Islamic faith, particularly among the Uyghur Muslim population in Xinjiang, has garnered significant international attention and condemnation due to human rights abuses and allegations of cultural genocide.In a recent investigation, UK's Sky News has shed light on China's increasing control over Islamic practices within the country. The report underscores the mounting restrictions and surveillance faced by Muslims, particularly in regions with significant Islamic populations.One poignant scene described in the report occurs in a cold, dusty part of central China, where a local Muslim leader stands alone in the courtyard of a small mosque. ""Religion is dying,"" he laments, highlighting the severe constraints imposed by the Chinese government on religious activities.The report details how the Chinese authorities have intensified efforts to monitor and restrict Islamic practices, including demolishing mosques, banning religious attire, and censoring Islamic texts. This crackdown is part of a broader campaign to align religious practices with the state's ideology and to curb any potential dissent.The Chinese authorities have taken numerous steps to curb the practice of Islam:Demolition of mosques: Many mosques have been demolished, particularly those that do not conform to the government's architectural standards or those deemed too conspicuous.Banning religious attire: Traditional Islamic attire, such as headscarves and long beards, has been banned in certain areas. This is part of an effort to assimilate Muslims into the broader Han Chinese culture.Censoring Islamic texts: The government has also censored Islamic texts, removing any content that could be perceived as promoting extremism or dissent. This includes altering the Quran and other religious literature to fit the state’s narrative.The report highlights the extensive surveillance network that monitors Muslim communities. High-tech surveillance systems, including facial recognition cameras, are prevalent in areas like Xinjiang, home to a significant Uyghur Muslim population. These systems track individuals' movements and behaviors, ensuring strict compliance with the government's regulations.The restrictions have permeated all aspects of daily life for Muslims in China. Religious education for children has been heavily regulated, with many religious schools being shut down. Additionally, community leaders and imams are required to attend government-run re-education programs to ensure they propagate state-approved messages, the Sky News report said.The international community has responded with concern over China’s treatment of its Muslim population. Human rights organizations have condemned the actions, calling for greater transparency and respect for religious freedoms. The Chinese government, however, maintains that these measures are necessary to combat extremism and ensure national security.","Chinese authorities have intensified efforts to monitor and restrict Islamic practices, including demolishing mosques and banning religious attire.

"Phones, Islamic books, tourism: Taliban on charm offensive to revive Afghan economy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/phones-islamic-books-tourism-taliban-on-charm-offensive-to-revive-afghan-economy/articleshow/110493793.cms,"A tale of unexpected prosperity

Yet, amidst this backdrop of hardship, certain sectors and individuals find ways to not only survive but thrive, highlighting a complex interplay of resilience and disparity.

Yunis Safi, a businessman in Kabul, understands the subtle power of appearances in Afghanistan's social and economic spheres. Running a phone shop in the upscale Shar-e-Naw neighborhood, Safi explains, ""In Afghanistan, your phone is your personality."" His store, guarded and stocked with high-end iPhones, serves as a stark contrast to the economic conditions outside its doors.

What they are saying: Safi's customers include not just affluent Afghans but also members of the Taliban, indicating a nuanced shift in the group's stance towards technology and commerce. ""Of course they need smartphones. They use social media, they like making videos,"" Safi told AP, pointing out the demand for advanced features and security in mobile devices among his clientele.

The bigger picture

Beyond individual success stories like Safi's, the overall economic narrative of Afghanistan is one of a country at a crossroads. The telecommunications sector's growth, highlighted by significant investments in network infrastructure, presents a glimmer of hope. According to the communications ministry, 2 million new SIM cards have been issued in the past two years, and subscriber numbers are growing. The government is investing $100 million in the telecom sector and has fully restored hundreds of towers. Out of the 22.7 million active SIM cards in the country of 41 million people, 10 million are for voice calls, and the rest are for mobile internet. The communications ministry's push to expand digital connectivity across the country suggests a strategic pivot towards modernizing even in times of political and social upheaval, an AP report said.

The Taliban has also entered into preliminary agreements with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to establish a logistics hub in western Afghanistan, aiming to position the country as a pivotal route for regional exports, including Russian oil to South Asia, according to Afghanistan's commerce minister. Taliban acting commerce minister Nooruddin Azizi, speaking to Reuters after a tripartite meeting in Kabul last week, announced that technical teams would finalize a written plan for the hub within two months, with investment from all three nations expected six months after discussions.

The proposed hub in Herat province is intended to leverage Afghanistan’s geographical advantage as a historical crossroads of the Silk Road, strategically nestled between South and Central Asia and neighboring China and Iran. Azizi emphasized the significance of this initiative, noting, ""Based on our discussions, a logistics centre is going to be established in Herat province, which can connect the north to South Asia.""

From spring offensive to

charm offensive

In Kabul, about 30 men, including a model and a 17-year-old with no prior job experience, form the inaugural class at a Taliban-run institute designed to foster a cadre of tourism and hospitality professionals. This initiative is part of a broader charm offensive by the Taliban to reshape perceptions of Afghanistan, despite stringent educational and societal restrictions on women. Mohammad Saeed, the head of Kabul's Tourism Directorate, notes a modest uptick in foreign visitors, buoyed by a more peaceful environment and improved flight connections with international hubs like Dubai. Despite this progress, the tourism sector grapples with formidable challenges such as onerous visa processes, severed international diplomatic relations, and a lack of robust infrastructure.

Despite this progress, the tourism sector grapples with formidable challenges such as onerous visa processes, severed international diplomatic relations, and a lack of robust infrastructure. Amidst these efforts, Afghanistan is positioning itself as an emerging tourism destination, a vision supported by the Taliban's leadership, as expressed by Saeed. The students at the institute are optimistic about their futures, with aspirations like Ahmed Massoud Talash's aim to enhance his social media presence through scenic Instagram posts, and Samir Ahmadzai's ambition to enter the hospitality business. The curriculum includes traditional Afghan handicrafts and basic anthropology, with an informal focus on understanding cultural interactions with foreign tourists—especially women, given the strict local customs. The reopening of the women’s spa at Kabul’s Serena Hotel exclusively for foreign women after a prolonged shutdown signals a tentative readiness for more international guests. However, the pervasive restrictions on Afghan women and complex global perceptions continue to pose significant hurdles to Afghanistan's tourism ambitions.

Between the lines

The survival and success of businesses like Safi's and the bustling exchange markets provide critical insights into Afghanistan's adaptive economic strategies. These stories of resilience and adaptation are pivotal in understanding how Afghans navigate their new realities under the Taliban's rule, leveraging every available opportunity to forge stability in an unstable environment.

What next: Monitoring how Afghanistan's economy adapts to the current challenges will be crucial. The resilience of sectors like telecommunications and informal finance may dictate the pace and nature of economic recovery or further decline. How the Taliban supports or stifles these growth areas could significantly impact the nation's economic trajectory and its people's everyday lives.

(With inputs from agencies)

In Afghanistan , the economic landscape has drastically shifted since the Taliban 's takeover in 2021. The nation, once buoyed by international aid and foreign investment, now reels under severe financial distress . The freezing of billions in assets and the cessation of most foreign aid have plunged the country into an economic crisis.Afghanistan's financial woes deepen as foreign support dwindles. The takeover by the Taliban has led to a significant retraction of international financial support, exacerbating an already precarious situation. The economy , heavily reliant on aid, faces a dire future with limited immediate prospects for recovery.On the streets of Kabul, another facet of the economy thrives in the bustling money exchange market. Here, Abdul Rahman Zirak estimates that ""$10 million changes hands daily,"" with remittances from the Afghan diaspora playing a critical role. This sector's vibrancy during economic turmoil underscores the crucial role of informal financial systems in sustaining livelihoods when formal banking sectors collapse.","Afghanistan is positioning itself as an emerging tourism destination.

Economic and Geographic Factors at Play

The Covid-19 pandemic provided many Americans with an opportunity to reassess their living situations, especially with the rise of remote work . This led to significant state-to-state migration , with individuals seeking lower costs of living and new environments. However, the concept of ""sticky"" states—those retaining a high percentage of their native-born population—offers intriguing insights into American mobility, a report in the Independent said.According to a 2023 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Texas leads the nation with approximately 82% of its native residents choosing to stay. Texas' appeal includes its vibrant cities like Austin, lack of state income tax, and relatively low cost of living.Following Texas are North Carolina (75.5%), Georgia (74.2%), California (73.0%), and Utah (72.9%). These states offer various advantages, from cultural vibrancy to economic opportunities, that retain their populations.Conversely, Wyoming (45.2%) ranks as the least sticky state, followed by North Dakota (48.6%), Alaska (48.7%), Rhode Island (55.2%), and South Dakota (54.2%). These states often face challenges such as harsh climates or less economic diversity, prompting residents to seek opportunities elsewhere.For many, the decision to stay or leave their home state involves multiple factors, including family ties, economic conditions, and cultural identity.Leticia Macias of El Paso, Texas, highlights the cultural uniqueness and economic advantages of her home city, influenced by its border-town identity and vibrant local culture.Justin Morris in North Carolina appreciates the state's affordable living costs , family proximity, and the cultural scene around the Research Triangle, which allows him to pursue his artistic career.Fabian Bean, originally from Alaska, moved to Minnesota for educational and professional opportunities more aligned with his interests in politics and environmentalism.Ashley Marie Sorensen, from South Dakota, chose to settle in Minnesota, drawn by its social investments, such as strong public schools and upcoming paid parental leave policies.States like California, despite being among the stickiest, struggle to attract new residents due to high living costs and stringent property tax policies like Prop 13. This paradox shows that while some states retain their populations, they face challenges in welcoming newcomers.Pia Orrenius, co-author of the Dallas Fed study, emphasizes that retention alone isn't indicative of success. States must balance retaining residents with attracting new ones to maintain vibrancy. California, for instance, needs to become more welcoming to continue thriving.In conclusion, the concept of sticky states sheds light on the complex interplay of economics, culture, and geography in American migration patterns, revealing why some states hold onto their residents while others do not.","Texas leads the nation with approximately 82% of its native residents choosing to stay.

NEW DELHI: Race car driver . Property mogul. Private astronaut . Billionaire . Larry Connor 's resume reads like he’s a real-life Tony Stark and he’s trying to add another tick mark to his list of hallowed achievements: become the first person to venture to the Titanic shipwreck after submersible disaster that claimed the lives of four tourists. Connor, a 74-year-old billionaire from Dayton, Ohio recently announced his desire to take a submersible the Atlantic seabed, beyond the OceanGate expedition, to prove that a safe trips to the wreckage of the Titanic is feasible.But, who’s Larry Connor?Connor is the owner of the Connor Group, a real estate investment firm in Dayton, Ohio. Connor graduated from Ohio University in 1972, and went on to purchase Orlando Computer Group, who went on to become the second-largest re-seller of IBM microcomputers in the state of Florida. In 1992, he co-founded Connor, Murphy & Buhrman, that would become the Connor Group when he bought his partners out.In 20 years, the company’s assets increased from $100million to $4 billion. He has also shown a warmer side and during the pandemic donated $1.6 billion of his own money as bonuses to his associates who were earning less than $150,000 per year and also footed their childcare expenses.Connor’s monetary success has allowed him to follow his other passions that have taken him to the depths of the planet and even into orbit. Much like the fictional Tony Stark, Connor also raced formula cars in the 80s, and continued to race at various levels into the 2000s. In 2003, his team won the year’s Petit Le Mans, a sports endurance race held at Road Atlanta, in Braselton, Georgia, USA. His Team C racing outfit also won the Baja 1000, an off-road race held on the Baja California Peninsula.Not just happy with racing, he has also developed a taste for deep dives. He teamed up with Triton Submersible founder Patrick Lahey for an expedition to the Mariana Trench region. The team did three dives: to an undersea mountain in Mariana Trench, one to the third deepest part of the ocean called Sirena Deep and one to Challenger Deep, the deepest known underwater spot on the planet.For the uninitiated, the Challenger is much deeper – approximately 23,000 feet deeper – that the spot where the Titanic lays.Connor was also part of the Axiom Mission 1, in which he played the role of the pilot in the first all-private space mission to the International Space Station.

Could US-Saudi 'mega deal' spark Middle East nuclear race?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/could-us-saudi-mega-deal-spark-middle-east-nuclear-race/articleshow/110524194.cms,"Saudi Arabia 'cannot be trusted'

What does Israel have to do with it now?

US outbidding China?

One part of a predicted, closer US-Saudi relationship is particularly controversial. Experts fear Saudi Arabia may use a civilian nuclear energy program, which the US will help with, to develop their own atomic bombs.Last week, several media reports suggested that Saudi Arabia was on the verge of a ""mega deal"" with the United States. Bombastic phrases like a ""mega deal"" or a ""grand bargain"" are being used because the agreement would bring the US and the Saudis closer in significant ways, including in a mutual defense pact and through cooperation on emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and a civilian nuclear program . Such a deal was originally supposed to be closely tied to the normalization of Saudi Arabia's relations with Israel. However, with the Saudis insistent that any normalization include Israeli recognition of a path towards Palestinian statehood and the Israelis equally insistent that they don't want that, normalization has been put on hold. Instead, according to various reports published by the likes of Reuters, The New York Times, the UK's Financial Times and The Guardian since the start of May, the ""mega deal"" between Saudi Arabia and the US is likely still going ahead — just without Israel. The exact details are not known, but any deal is likely to involve cooperation on Saudi Arabia's long-held ambitions for civilian nuclear energy, a way for the country to diversify away from oil. Many analysts say this is among the most likely-to-happen aspects of a ""mega deal"" — and also among the most controversial.The controversy stems from the fact that the Saudis are determined to enrich uranium on their own soil, Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association in Washington, told DW. The technology used for uranium enrichment produces fuel for civilian nuclear reactors but can also result in uranium suitable for nuclear weapons. ""Saudi Arabia is adamant on [this],"" Kelsey said. ""Riyadh will walk away from a nuclear cooperation agreement with Washington before it forgoes enrichment."" Last September, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman created international headlines when he said if Iran, his country's regional rival, manages to get a nuclear bomb, then Saudi Arabia will need one, too.As reports about a US-Saudi deal started coming out in early May, US Senator Edward Markey wrote to President Joe Biden. ""I fear that Saudi Arabia — a nation with a terrible human rights record — cannot be trusted to use its civil nuclear energy program solely for peaceful purposes and will instead enrich uranium and seek to develop nuclear weapons,"" argued Markey, co-chair of his government's nuclear weapons and arms control working group. Besides fears that the Saudis might end up with nuclear bombs, there are also concerns that simply permitting them to enrich uranium would set off a regional race. ""Allowing Saudi Arabia to acquire such capabilities could set a problematic precedent at the international level. It could possibly encourage other countries in the region, such as Egypt or Turkey, to pursue similar nuclear capabilities, leading to a proliferation cascade in an already volatile Middle East,"" Manuel Herrera, a researcher focused on nuclear non-proliferation at Istituto Affari Internazionali, an Italian thinktank, wrote late last year. Herrera and other experts hope that if a Saudi civilian nuclear program happens, the US government will enforce strict guardrails. These might include deferring uranium enrichment inside Saudi Arabia until later or setting up an enrichment facility that only American citizens can access. It could also include allowing a Saudi-based conversion plant to turn refined uranium powder into gas, but not enriching uranium. The Saudis could also be asked to adhere to conditions, including signing on to specific non-proliferation criteria under Section 123 of the US 1954 Atomic Energy Act and agreeing to additional inspections by the Austria-based International Atomic Energy Agency. ""As far as we know, the US is trying to put forward a deal very similar to the one that they did with the United Arab Emirates in 2009, in which they applied Section 123,"" Herrera explained to DW in an interview earlier this week. However, the Saudis have previously said no to that.""The assumption has been that the various elements [of a US-Saudi agreement] would be mutually reinforcing,"" Robert Einhorn, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institute, wrote in an April briefing. ""For example, normalization would make nuclear cooperation with [Saudi Arabia] more palatable to Israel, and a US security guarantee and nuclear cooperation would make normalization more palatable to [Saudi Arabia]."" But now that Israel is not involved, analysts say the ""mega deal"" may be another way to pressure the Israeli government. Israel's allies, including the US, have been pushing Israeli leaders towards a different, more careful approach in Gaza. The Israeli government has previously said it doesn't want the Saudis to get any kind of uranium enrichment capacities.However, there are also other equally significant motives for US-Saudi nuclear cooperation. As Davenport of the Arms Control Association pointed out, Saudi Arabia's interest in nuclear energy predates the ""push for a broader Israeli-Saudi normalization."" ""And there are also some other countries who have been putting offers on the table,"" Herrera told DW, referring to China.If a US-Saudi nuclear deal goes ahead, this would sideline any Chinese influence in this area. From a commercial perspective, it would also result in healthy contracts for US companies. The recent progress on a US-Saudi deal also has a lot to do with upcoming US elections, Davenport argued. ""The Biden administration wants an agreement before the presidential election."" Other experts have suggested that closer cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the US may also mean the Americans have more influence over Saudi Arabian decisions on oil prices. The US government would obviously prefer these to stay lower in the run-up to elections. But could a deal still end up causing a nuclear race of some kind in the Middle East? ""There is a risk … if you give one actor access to this technology, then the race will be on,"" Herrera agreed. But he thinks that, with sufficient guardrails and monitoring in place, risks could be minimized. Davenport is not as sure. ""It's not inevitable that there will be a proliferation cascade in the region, but Saudi enrichment does make it more likely."" And all that is heightened ""by the disintegration of great power unity on preventing proliferation and the stress facing the broader nuclear order,"" she concluded, referring to increasing threats to use nuclear weapons, such as in Ukraine, or to launch them into outer space.","Reports suggest Saudi Arabia is on the verge of a ""mega deal"" with the United States. Experts fear Saudi Arabia may use a civilian nuclear energy program, which the US will help with, to develop their own atomic bombs. Such a deal was originally supposed to be closely tied to the normalization of Saudi Arabia's relations with Israel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

This commitment follows her previous pledge in 2019 to expand women's power and influence over a ten-year period.French Gates recently stepped down from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, receiving $12 billion from Bill Gates for her future philanthropic endeavors. As one of the most significant supporters of gender equity in the US, she expressed her frustration in a guest essay for The New York Times, stating that people often claim it's not the right time to discuss gender equality . However, she emphasized that ""Decades of research on economics, well-being and governance make it clear that investing in women and girls benefits everyone.""Through her organization, Pivotal Ventures, French Gates has begun directing $200 million in new grants to U.S.-based groups working to protect women's rights and advance their power and influence. These grants, which provide general operating support, have been awarded to organizations such as the National Women's Law Center, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and the Center for Reproductive Rights.Teresa Younger, the president and CEO of the Ms. Foundation for Women, praised French Gates' commitment as part of a growing trend of major women donors generously supporting nonprofits. Younger emphasized the importance of unrestricted, multi-year funding for organizations, stating, ""If philanthropy took lessons from the way that women are moving money, we would see more money in the field having greater impact.""In addition to the grants, French Gates pledged to give 12 individuals $20 million each to distribute to nonprofit organizations of their choice before the end of 2026. These funds will be managed by the National Philanthropic Trust, one of the largest public charities offering donor-advised funds.Out of the promised $1 billion, French Gates has announced $690 million in commitments, which include an ""open call"" for applications to be administered by Lever for Change this fall. A total of $250 million will be awarded to organizations working to improve women's mental and physical health globally.French Gates' Pivotal Ventures, a limited liability company, also manages investments in for-profit ventures. The organization has focused on various avenues to increase women's economic and political participation and power, such as closing the wage gap, compensating care work often performed by women, and encouraging women to run for political office.In her essay, French Gates highlighted the high maternal mortality rates in the U.S., particularly among Black and Native American mothers. She also noted the loss of reproductive rights in 14 states, the lack of national paid family leave, and the increasing number of teenage girls experiencing suicidal thoughts and persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness.As French Gates prepares to leave the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation next week, the organization will change its name to the Gates Foundation.

Nawaz Sharif signals peace as India awaits new government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/nawaz-sharif-signals-peace-as-india-awaits-new-government/articleshow/110542804.cms,"NEW DELHI: While former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has in the past too accused his own country (read Pervez Musharraf ) of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999, his reiteration of the same on Tuesday is significant because of the timing. The elder Sharif, who is now the most powerful civilian leader in the country, spoke about Pakistan having sabotaged the agreement through its Kargil adventurism while taking back the reins of his ruling party after 6 years, and days before the outcome of the Indian elections.“Once Pakistan conducted five nuclear tests in reply to India’s [then Indian premier] Atal Bihari Vajpayee sahib came here and made a [peace] agreement with us ... but we violated it and it was our fault,” said Nawaz, after being re-elected PML-N president, according to the Dawn newspaper.Nawaz, whose brother Shehbaz Sharif is Pakistan PM, has long maintained that he learnt about Musharraf’s Kargil “misadventure” only from a phone call by his then counterpart A B Vajpayee and that the Pakistani military operation scuttled the peace process he had initiated with Vajpayee in the form of the Lahore Declaration early that year.The latest remarks by Nawaz, who has even otherwise been making favourable noises about ties with India, are seen as significant also because they come in the middle of Indian elections, and just before the results are declared on June 4. “It must be read as a significant signal from Pakistan’s currently most important civilian leader for India’s incoming government,” says former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria.Nawaz enjoys a strong rapport with Indian PM Narendra Modi and it was under him, in 2015, that the 2 countries last had a substantive bilateral engagement, although the comprehensive bilateral dialogue they launched to address all issues, including J&K and terrorism, was quickly undone by the Pathankot terrorist attack.The Sharif brothers may hope to break the deadlock in ties if the Modi government returns next week but, for India in that case, the onus will remain squarely on Islamabad to make the first move as it was Pakistan that recalled its high commissioner and called off trade ties, after India revoked the special status of J&K in 2019.There was a hint of some forward movement by Pakistan in March when foreign minister Ishaq Dar said Islamabad would seriously consider restoring trade ties with India. That Pakistan remains conflicted about ties with India was evident again when his own ministry quickly clarified there was no change in Pakistan’s position and that the responsibility to improve ties lied with India. Pakistan officially maintains that talks are possible only if India reverses its actions in Kashmir.No Indian government of course will accede to any such demand by Pakistan, except for working towards an early return to statehood as asked for by the Indian Supreme Court in a verdict last year that upheld the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state. For the Modi government, the judgment was an endorsement of its position that Pakistan is not a stakeholder in the internal administrative process of J&K. Pakistan of course maintains statehood and elections cannot be a substitute to the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination. Whether it can show any flexibility on the issue, without recourse to cross-border terrorism, may determine the road ahead if the Modi government indeed returns.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has accused his own country of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999.

He added that after Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, it was Nawaz Sharif who ""made the party vibrant"".Replying to another question on why Nawaz Sharif wasn't active in politics after the February 8 general elections, Sanaullah said the former PM is not angry with anyone and he is active in the party.

The Chinese were working on Dasu hydropower project, which is about 300km north of Islamabad. The 4,320MW project is being constructed by China Gezhouba with funding from World Bank.“China attaches great importance to the important progress made by the Pakistani side on the investigation of the terrorist attack,” PTI quoted Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. “China calls on countries in the region to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation, root out all terrorist organisations, remove their breeding ground, and protect the common security and development interests of all countries.”Earlier, Pakistani military authorities claimed the suicide bomber was an Afghan national. At a press conference in Lahore Sunday, interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said: “The attack was completely operated from Afghanistan and planned to specifically target Chinese personnel in Pakistan.” He blamed the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and “hostile foreign intelligence agencies”.Pakistan’s allegation further strains bilateral ties as Islamabad continues to urge Kabul to take action against Pakistani Taliban based in Afghanistan. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Afghan Taliban of allowing TTP terrorists to operate on its soil, a charge Kabul denies.Pakistan is under pressure from China as it has urged Islamabad to punish those involved in the attack on its citizens. Recently, Pakistan’s top economic body ECC approved a $2.58 million compensation package for the families of Chinese workers killed on March 26.Thousands of Chinese nationals are working on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a multibillion-dollar energy and infrastructure project under Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese workers have frequently been targeted, mostly by Baloch separatist groups in Baluchistan, who view CPEC as a Pakistani govt ploy to exploit the province’s natural resources.",Beijing backs Pakistan’s investigation into the recent suicide attack that killed five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Islamabad accused Taliban authorities in Afghanistan of sheltering the “plotters” and demanded that they be handed over. The Chinese were working on Dasu hydropower project.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110474977,imgsize-531117,width-400,resizemode-4/110474977.jpg"
Pakistan Revives China Belt and Road Initiative Projects to Boost Economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-revive-china-belt-and-road-initiative-projects/articleshow/110470413.cms,"Pakistan ’s new government is hoping to inject some fresh momentum into projects that fall under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, as it tries to boost the country’s troubled economy.The South Asian nation is looking at joint ventures for renewable energy projects , agriculture collaboration and possibly enticing some Chinese companies to relocate to Pakistan, said Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s federal minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, who also co-heads the committee responsible for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , in an interview.“Yeah, I’m very hopeful because I was there in China recently and I had meetings with their senior leadership,” said Iqbal at his office in Islamabad, decorated with a large map showcasing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. “So I see great interest on the Chinese side to revive the momentum for CPEC and also to take it into the second phase.”Pakistan was seen as a flagship destination for BRI projects , with CPEC — which includes a port in the southern town of Gwadar and new power plants — the crown jewel. The progress on new projects stalled in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and amid Pakistan’s on-going economic difficulties that have required the International Monetary Fund’s intervention.Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was elected to a second successive term in February, has been looking to revive economic cooperation with China for the past two years. Sharif’s older brother, Nawaz, led the country when Pakistan signed on to the BRI in 2013.Projects worth about $25 billion came online in the first phase, including power plants that ended the nation’s chronic power deficit.A Pakistani committee approved a long-delayed railway upgrade project last week — but scaled it down from $10 billion to $6.8 billion.The project will be done in two phases “so there is not a big burden on Pakistan,” said Iqbal. The railway, in its first phase will run from Karachi, the southern coast city, to Multan, a little over halfway to the capital, Islamabad.The Sharif government has also finished some key BRI projects that were pending for years: a water-supply project in Gwadar, dredging work at the port and an electricity transmission line from Iran.“So all these things really help China see that the new government is again serious and it restored their confidence that now Pakistan is, you know, serious about CPEC initiatives ,” said Iqbal.China has also been a key financial lender, alongside the IMF, with its loans helping Pakistan avoid bankruptcy. The country is struggling with low growth and the fastest rising consumer prices in Asia. Islamabad’s difficulties have seen it fall behind on payments related to Chinese-funded power plants.To mark the tenth anniversary of CPEC last year, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng unveiled five new corridors including one focused on growth to boost economic activity in Pakistan. The others are related to livelihood, innovation, green energy and regional connectivity. Sharif is likely to visit China soon, said Iqbal.One change in the second phase would likely involve Islamabad taking a step back while urging the private sector to forge partnerships with Chinese firms.The other big focus, albeit a long-shot prospect, is to try and attract Chinese firms thinking of relocating from China amid rising labor costs and heightening geopolitical tensions.“That would be a success because at the moment more than 80 million jobs are being relocated from China to other countries because of the high level cost in China,” said Iqbal. “They have gone to Vietnam and you know, Laos and Cambodia. There is now overcrowding there. So they are certainly looking for new places.”","Pakistan is looking at joint ventures for renewable energy projects, agriculture collaboration and possibly enticing some Chinese companies to relocate to Pakistan.

PESHAWAR: At least five terrorists were killed and two security personnel lost their lives in a gun battle in Peshawar 's Hassan Khel area , ARY News reported, citing the Inter-Services Public Relations ( ISPR ) on Sunday.

Havaldar Shafiq Ullah, 36, of the Karak district and Captain Hussain Jahangir, 25, of the Rahim Yar Khan area, were both killed during the operation, according to a statement from Inter-Services Public Relations.

The operation takes place in the midst of an increase in terrorist attacks nationwide, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, following the government-broken truce with the banned militant organisation Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan in November 2022.

Earlier on April 9, during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in South Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), security forces shot and killed two terrorists, according to ARY News.

According to the ISPR, two terrorists who were still actively engaged in a number of terrorist attacks in the vicinity were shot and killed by security officers.

DHAKA: Bangladesh forest experts warned Tuesday a key tiger habitat hit by a deadly cyclone had been submerged by seawater deeper and longer than ever before, raising fears for endangered wildlife.Cyclone Remal, which made landfall in low-lying Bangladesh and neighbouring India on Sunday evening, killed at least 38 people in both nations and affected millions more.More than a million people fled inland to concrete storm shelters before the cyclone hit.But it was the vast Sundarbans mangrove forest straddling Bangladesh and India, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers meet the sea that took the brunt of the force.The forest, which hosts one of the world's largest populations of Bengal tigers, was swamped, said Mihir Kumar Doe, the head of Bangladesh's southern forest department.""The entire Sundarbans was under water for more than 36 hours during the cyclone,"" Doe told AFP.""All its freshwater ponds, numbering more than 100, were washed away by saline tidal water.""At least 114 Bengal tigers live in Bangladesh's portion of the Sundarbans, according to official figures.Abu Naser Mohsin Hossain, Bangladesh's senior forest official for the Sundarbans, had said he feared for the wildlife if the freshwater lakes were tainted.""We are worried,"" said Hossain. ""These ponds were the source of fresh water for the entire wildlife in the mangroves including the endangered Bengal tigers.""The Sundarbans, the world's biggest mangrove forest, is regularly battered by intense monsoon storms.But Azizur Rahman, director of the state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department, said the cyclone was ""one of longest in the country's history"", blaming climate change for the shift.Doe said his teams had recovered dozens of dead spotted deer, as well as boars, the tigers' main prey.""We are very concerned over the wild animals including tigers,"" Doe said.""The Sundarbans is such a dynamic ecosystem, it is tough to know whether any tigers or wild animals were washed away or died.""Mangroves grow mainly in seawater or brackish water but Doe said the flooding was on a scale he had not witnessed before.""This 36-hour inundation is very unusual,"" he said, noting that it was three times longer than during Cyclone Sidr in 2007.During the latest cyclone, areas nearer the sea were three metres (10 feet) underwater, while areas further upstream were under 1.2-1.5 metres (4-5 feet) of water.""Even during low tide, the water did not recede,"" Doe said. ""This is very unusual.""Tiger expert Monirul Khan, zoology professor at Jahangirnagar University, said he feared smaller animals such as deer would be hardest hit.""I fear for the animals who are less strong such as spotted deer,"" he said.""Spotted deer are helpless to strong tides during cyclones or longer inundation of the forest.
