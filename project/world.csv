'Protests are healthy, shouldn't be violent or

silenced'

NEW DELHI: After being marred by weeks of pro-Palestine protests by students in US universities , hundreds of students adorning graduation robes walked out of Harvard commencement ceremony chanting ""free, free Palestine"" on Thursday.This came a day after the university announced that 13 students would not get their diploma as they participated in pro-Palestine protests. Expressing support for their counterparts, students chanted “Let them walk, let them walk”, urging the authority to allow those 13 students to receive their diplomas.The decision by Harvard's senior governing board comes after faculty members recommended on Monday that the 13 students be allowed to graduate despite their participation in the encampment. However, Harvard said that each of the 13 students had broken university policies by their actions during the encampment protest.“In coming to this determination, we note that the express provisions of the Harvard College Student Handbook state that students who are not in good standing are not eligible for degrees,” it said in a written statement.Expressing disappointment over the way university handled the protestors, student speaker Shruthi Kumar said “this semester our freedom of speech and our expressions of solidarity became punishable.”“I am deeply disappointed by the intolerance for freedom of speech and the right to civil disobedience on campus,” she said.“This is about civil rights and upholding democratic principles,” she said. “The students had spoken. The faculty had spoken. Harvard do you hear us?”, she added.Addressing the graduates at the ceremony, speaker Maria Ressa, a journalist and advocate for freedom of press said that “you don't know who you are until you're tested, until you fight for what you believe in. Because that defines who you are.”“The campus protests are testing everyone in America. Protests are healthy. They shouldn't be violent. They shouldn't be silenced,” she added.(With inputs from AP)","Hundreds of students walked out of Harvard commencement ceremony chanting ""free, free Palestine"" on Thursday.

US senators tell Trudeau to meet Nato defense spending pledge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-senators-tell-justin-trudeau-to-meet-nato-defense-spending-pledge/articleshow/110379096.cms,"A bipartisan group of US senators urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to produce a plan to meet a Nato commitment to increase defense spending to 2% of gross domestic product.Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Thom Tillis, co-chairs of the Senate Nato observers group, and 21 other senators signed a letter to Trudeau on Thursday, demanding that Canada hit the defense spending target agreed to by members of the security alliance in 2006 and reaffirmed as recently as 2023.Trudeau’s government released a policy update in April that projects defense spending will rise to 1.76% of GDP by 2030. The new plan places a heavy emphasis on securing Canada’s Arctic, which faces growing threats from Russia and China.The US senators wrote that they’re “concerned and profoundly disappointed” that Canada may still fall short of the 2% pledge. It’s certain to be a topic when members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization gather in Washington this summer.“The United States’ commitment to Nato is unwavering,” they wrote. By the time of the July summit, “we will expect your government and every Nato member that has not met the 2% defense spending threshold to have a plan to reach this benchmark as soon as possible.”Other signatories to the letter include Democrats Joe Manchin, Tammy Duckworth and Jeff Merkley and Republicans Dan Sullivan, Tim Scott, Mitt Romney and Ted Cruz.Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair told reporters in Ottawa that the government’s defense budget will increase by 27% next year compared with this year and that the recent defense policy update applies a “very significant and necessary focus on continental defense.” He pointed to a promised investment of nearly C$40 billion ($29.1 billion) in upgrading systems under Norad, the North American Aerospace Defense Command.“We know that Canada needs to invest in other capabilities that are not yet included in this year’s budget,” Blair added, mentioning submarines and air missile defense systems that are expected to lift Canada closer to 2%.The senators’ letter comes just over a week after Blair visited Washington to meet with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.“I’m sure I’d be able to assure those concerned senators that Canada will be a ready and capable ally to Nato in North America and NORAD and around the world,” Blair said.",US senators urge Canada to meet a Nato commitment to increase defense spending to 2% of GDP.

The ground floor of the building was utilized for the sale and repair of electric bicycles, as per reports.""I heard an explosion like fire crackers. I thought there was a fight, or something hitting the window. I ran down and saw the fire. Many of the neighbours had run out of the alley, crossing through other neighbours' houses.

Firefighters tried their best to look for survivors. They rescued an old lady and then brought another four people out. We checked carefully, there were no other ones inside,"" he said.

A year ago, a karaoke bar blaze near Ho Chi Minh City, the country's commercial hub, resulted in 32 fatalities and 17 injuries.The owner was subsequently arrested on charges related to violating fire prevention regulations. In response to these incidents, the prime minister ordered an inspection of all high-risk venues, and fire safety equipment and instructions have been installed in numerous streets and buildings throughout the city.","Fire broke out at around 12:30 am (1730 GMT Thursday) in Hanoi.

Deadly turbulence: How Singapore Airlines flight's 400-foot drop happened within minutes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/air-turbulence-singapore-airlines-flights-400-foot-rise-and-drop-within-minutes-how-it-happened/articleshow/110324673.cms,"Passenger accounts and crew response

Aftermath and safety protocols

Investigations and future precautions

A Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore encountered severe turbulence, causing a rapid ascent and descent of 400 feet within a minute, resulting in the death of one passenger and injuries to at least 30 others. The Boeing 777-300ER, which departed from London’s Heathrow Airport, was diverted to Bangkok, where it made an emergency landing.The turbulence hit about 10 hours into the flight, as the plane flew over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar, a region known for severe weather conditions.The aircraft, carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members, was at an altitude of 37,000 feet when it suddenly encountered ""sudden extreme turbulence,"" causing it to drop 6,000 feet in about three minutes.Andrew Davies, a 54-year-old passenger from London, recounted his experience during the turbulence to the Wall Street Journal. He was deciding between taking a nap and watching a movie when the seatbelt sign flashed on. Just as he secured his seatbelt, the plane began to drop violently. ""Pillows, plates and cups were thrown in the air. His seat belt tugged at his waist, and he found himself covered in his neighbor’s coffee. Oxygen masks dropped down,"" Davies told the WSJ.The chaos in the cabin was immediate and severe. ""I saw a woman with a deep gash on her head, covered in blood. Flight crew members also appeared bloody and injured, hobbling around trying to help passengers,"" Davies added. An elderly passenger, identified as Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British national with a history of heart problems, likely suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by the crew to perform CPR for 20 minutes, they were unable to revive him.The plane's abrupt altitude change was documented by FlightRadar24, which reported a ""rapid change in vertical rate, consistent with a sudden turbulence event."" The turbulence was likely clear-air turbulence (CAT), which is difficult to detect and can occur without warning. ""Developing thunderstorms often have strong updrafts, a zone of upward moving air, that rises very rapidly, sometimes at more than 100 mph, and can leave pilots little time to react if it occurs directly in front of the plane,"" explained Dan DePodwin, Senior Director of Forecasting Operations at AccuWeather.Former pilot Marco Chan noted the turbulence likely occurred within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, notorious for thunderstorms. ""With turbulence of such magnitude, it is likely the [Singapore Airlines] flight was navigating through difficult thunderstorms,"" he said.Following the incident, Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong expressed condolences and assured that the airline was providing necessary support to affected passengers and their families. ""We are very sorry for the traumatic experience that everyone on board SQ321 went through,"" Goh said.Of the injured, 18 were hospitalized, with seven in critical condition. The Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok treated 71 passengers. The incident has renewed calls for strict adherence to safety protocols, emphasizing the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during a flight. ""It is a matter of life and death,"" said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.This event marked the first fatal incident involving Singapore Airlines in almost 25 years. The airline, recognized as one of the world's leading carriers, has a strong safety record, with its last major accident occurring in October 2000.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the US and Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau are investigating the incident. Preliminary findings suggest that climate change may be increasing the frequency and intensity of turbulence events. ""For clear-air turbulence, climate change is increasing the temperature difference across the jet stream between the cold poles and the warm tropics,"" explained Dr Paul Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading.As investigations continue, the aviation industry is urged to enhance real-time weather data sharing and improve safety protocols to better prepare for such unpredictable turbulence events.(With inputs from agencies)","Singapore Airlines Flight SQ321 was flying from London’s Heathrow airport to Singapore.

NEW DELHI: The International Criminal Court (ICC) is pursuing arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant, and two other top Hamas leaders, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (also known as Mohammed Deif) and Ismail Haniyeh, according to a statement released by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan on Monday.The charges are related to the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, which Khan alleges constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity .The charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh, and al-Masri include ""extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention"", while the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include ""causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,"" said Khan in his statement.The ICC's decision to target Netanyahu marks the first time the court has sought an arrest warrant for the top leader of a close US ally, placing him in the same category as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is also facing an ICC arrest warrant over the war in Ukraine.A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan's application for the arrest warrants.Israel's top leaders slammed the development as a ""historical disgrace"".A furious Netanyahu lashed out at the ICC and the prosecutor, stating that the ""absurd"" move was ""exactly what new anti-Semitism looks like"".Vowing to bring down Hamas and achieve total victory, Netanyahu said Israel was fighting a ""just war"".Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz also hit out at the ICC chief prosecutor, stating: ""The Attorney General in the same breath mentions the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel alongside the abominable Nazi monsters of Hamas -- a historical disgrace that will be remembered forever.""Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz slammed the move which he said draws ""parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation (Hamas)"". ""It is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,"" he added.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri also panned the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that the decision ""equates the victim with the executioner"" and encourages Israel to continue its ""war of extermination"" in Gaza.Wasel Abu Youssef, member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee, said: ""The Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves ... The ICC is required to issue arrest warrants against Israeli officials who are pursuing crimes of genocide in the Gaza Strip.""When reports of the potential ICC action surfaced last month, Netanyahu called it ""an outrage of historic proportions"" and asserted that Israel has an independent legal system that thoroughly investigates all violations of the law. In response to Netanyahu's comments, Khan stated, ""Nobody is above the law,"" and advised Israel to raise a challenge before the court's judges if they disagree with the ICC's jurisdiction.Although Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, the court claims jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court's founding principles in 2015.The US also slammed the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that such a ""shameful"" decision puts ""truce talks at risk"".""We reject the prosecutor's equivalence of Israel with Hamas ...

How algebra in US schools became a national flashpoint,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-algebra-in-us-schools-became-a-national-flashpoint/articleshow/110377114.cms,"From suburbs in the Northeast to major US cities on the West Coast, a surprising subject is prompting ballot measures, lawsuits and bitter fights among parents: algebra . Students have been required for decades to learn to solve for the variable x, and to find the slope of a line. Most complete the course in their first year of high school. But top-achievers are sometimes allowed to enroll earlier, typically in eighth grade.The dual pathways inspire some of the most fiery debates over equity and academic opportunity in American education : Do bias and inequality keep Black and Latino children off the fast track? Should middle schools eliminate algebra to level the playing field?The questions are so fraught because algebra functions as a crucial crossroads in the education system - students who fail it are far less likely to graduate. Those who take it early can take calculus by 12th grade, giving them a potential edge when applying to elite universities and lifting them toward society's most high-status and lucrative professions.But racial and economic gaps in math achievement are wide in the US, and grew wider during the pandemic. In some states, nearly 4 in 5 poor children do not meet math standards. To close those gaps, former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio adopted a goal embraced by many districts elsewhere. Every middle school would offer algebra, and principals could opt to enrol entire eighth graders in the class.San Francisco took an opposite approach: If some children could not reach algebra by middle school, no one would be allowed to take it.The central mission in both cities was to help disadvantaged students. But solving the algebra dilemma can be more complex than solving the quadratic formula.New York's dream of ""algebra for all"" was never fully realized, and Mayor Eric Adams' administration changed the goal to improving outcomes for ninth graders taking algebra. In San Francisco, dismantling middle-school algebra did little to end racial inequities among students in advanced math classes. After a huge public outcry, the district decided to reverse course.""You wouldn't think that there could be a more boring topic in the world,"" said Thurston Domina, a professor at the University of North Carolina. ""And yet, it's this place of incredibly high passions.""'Things run hot,' he said.In some cities, disputes over algebra have been so intense that parents have sued school districts, protested outside mayors' offices and campaigned for the ouster of school board members. Teaching math in middle school is a challenge for educators in part because that is when the material becomes more complex, with students moving from multiplication tables to equations and abstract concepts. Students who have not mastered the basic skills can quickly become lost, and it can be difficult for them to catch up.Many school districts have traditionally responded to divergent achievement levels by separating children into distinct pathways, placing some in general math classes while offering others algebra as an accelerated option. Such sorting, known as tracking, appeals to parents who want their children to reach advanced math as quickly as possible.But tracking has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on inequality. Around a quarter of all students in the United States take algebra in middle school. But only about 12% of Black and Latino eighth graders do, compared with roughly 24% of white pupils, a federal report found.""That's why middle school math is this flashpoint,"" said Joshua Goodman, an associate professor of education and economics at Boston University. ""It's the first moment where you potentially make it very obvious and explicit that there are knowledge gaps opening up.""","Algebra is a crucial crossroads in the education system.

This will be the fourth installment of military aid for Ukraine since Congress passed a long-delayed foreign aid bill late last month and comes as the Biden administration has pledged to keep weapons flowing regularly and to get them to the front lines as quickly as possible.The package includes high mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, munitions as well 155 mm and 105 mm high-demand artillery rounds, according to the two US officials. Additional items in the aid package include Javelin and AT-4 anti-tank systems; anti-tank mines, tactical vehicles, small arms and ammunition for those weapons, one of the officials said. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details of the aid package before the public announcement.It follows a monthly gathering Monday of about 50 defense leaders from Europe and elsewhere who meet regularly to coordinate getting more military aid to Ukraine. At this latest meeting, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Ukraine was in a ""moment of challenge"" due to Russia's new onslaught on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.

The mystery behind Vivek Ramaswamy purchasing stakes in BuzzFeed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-mystery-behind-vivek-ramaswamy-purchasing-stakes-in-buzzfeed/articleshow/110369188.cms,"Top Picks For You BuzzFeed shares soar as Vivek Ramaswamy takes stake

NEW DELHI: The unexpected move by Vivek Ramaswamy , a former presidential candidate and known supporter of Donald Trump, to acquire a significant stake in BuzzFeed has sparked a wave of speculation and theories. The acquisition , which seemed improbable given Ramaswamy's political and business background, has left many puzzled about his intentions and the future direction of the digital media outlet.The Business Insider, in a report, talks about four primary theories circulating regarding Ramaswamy's motivations:Diversification strategy: Some analysts believe Ramaswamy's purchase is part of a broader strategy to diversify his business interests. Ramaswamy, known for his success in the biotechnology sector, might be looking to expand his portfolio into digital media. BuzzFeed's extensive digital media presence could offer him a new platform to influence public opinion and expand his reach into an industry that has significant cultural impact. This move could also provide a hedge against market fluctuations in his other business ventures.Political Influence : Another prevailing theory suggests that Ramaswamy's investment is aimed at gaining political leverage. By controlling a popular media outlet, he could potentially shape the narrative in favor of his political beliefs and those of his allies. Given his outspoken support for conservative causes and figures, owning BuzzFeed could offer a unique opportunity to influence a younger, more progressive audience, potentially swaying public opinion and political discourse. ""This acquisition could be a strategic move to insert his viewpoints into mainstream media and balance the predominantly liberal slant,"" said a political analyst.Economic Opportunity: There is speculation that Ramaswamy sees untapped economic potential in BuzzFeed's brand and audience. Despite its financial struggles, BuzzFeed's loyal user base and its innovative approach to digital content creation might present a lucrative opportunity for a strategic investor. Ramaswamy could leverage his business acumen to revitalize BuzzFeed's financial health, possibly exploring new revenue streams such as expanded e-commerce, premium content, or strategic partnerships. ""BuzzFeed's engagement metrics are impressive, and with the right investment and strategy, it could become a powerhouse in digital media,"" suggested a media expert.Personal Interest: Lastly, some propose that Ramaswamy's decision could be driven by a personal interest in the media industry or a particular affinity for BuzzFeed's content and community. Ramaswamy, known for his intellectual pursuits and public commentary, might be attracted to the idea of owning a platform that can disseminate ideas and foster discussion. ""He may see BuzzFeed as a vehicle to promote the values of innovation and free speech that he often champions,"" noted a close associate.The acquisition has certainly turned heads, with observers keenly watching how Ramaswamy will integrate his new stake in BuzzFeed into his broader business and political endeavors. The purchase has not only surprised industry insiders but also led to a mix of excitement and apprehension among BuzzFeed's staff and audience.","Vivek Ramaswamy, a former presidential candidate and known supporter of Donald Trump, to acquire a significant stake in BuzzFeed.

"In a first, more Americans smoke marijuana daily than drink alcohol: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-a-first-more-americans-smoke-marijuana-daily-than-drink-alcohol-study/articleshow/110364675.cms,"NEW DELHI: A new study has revealed that the number of Americans who use marijuana daily has surpassed those who consume alcohol with the same frequency. According to research conducted by Carnegie Mellon University , an estimated 17.7 million Americans used cannabis daily or almost daily in 2022, compared to 14.7 million daily alcohol drinkers.This marks the first time in history that daily marijuana use has exceeded daily alcohol consumption. ""A good 40% of current cannabis users are using it daily or near daily, a pattern that is more associated with tobacco use than typical alcohol use,"" explained Jonathan Caulkins, the study's author and a researcher at Carnegie Mellon.The findings, published in the Addiction medical journal, are based on data from the US government’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health. While alcohol remains more widely used overall, it is not consumed on a daily basis by as many individuals.The surge in regular cannabis use coincides with increasing legalization across the US. Nearly half of all states have approved recreational marijuana use since Washington and Colorado led the way in 2012. Additionally, most states have legalized medical marijuana, and some have decriminalized possession for personal use.Daily marijuana use was at a low of fewer than one million Americans in 1992. Since then, per-capita rates of regular use have increased fifteenfold. Caulkins suggests this rise may be partly due to growing public acceptance, which has led more people to openly admit their regular use of the drug.Despite the growing acceptance and legalization, the US National Institute on Drug Abuse has issued warnings about the health risksassociated with cannabis use. These include breathing problems similar to those caused by smoking tobacco, an increased risk of heart attacks, and potential developmental issues during and after pregnancy. Long-term use can also lead to mental health problems such as paranoia, hallucinations, and an exacerbation of schizophrenia symptoms.Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have linked addictive marijuana use to an increased risk of psychosis. ""There is a lot of misinformation in the public sphere about cannabis and its effects on psychological health , with many assuming that this drug is safe to use with no side effects,"" stated David Gorelick, a psychiatry professor at the University of Maryland. He added that nearly half of people with cannabis addictions have another psychiatric condition.",An estimated 17.7 million Americans used cannabis daily or almost daily in 2022.

The US Air Force has unveiled new official photos of the B-21 Raider , offering the first official images of the stealth bomber since its maiden flight last year. The images, showing the aircraft taking off, in flight, and stationed in a hangar at Edwards Air Force Base, provide rare glimpses of the highly secretive bomber.These new photos, taken in January and early April, reveal the B-21 conducting flight tests , which include ground testing, taxiing, and flying operations. These tests are crucial as the B-21 progresses towards becoming the backbone of the US Air Force bomber fleet. The B-21 Raider is designed to penetrate the most highly contested threat environments globally, with the range, access, and payload to hold any target at risk.The B-21 Raider has captured public imagination with its otherworldly appearance and capabilities. The images of the bomber in flight have evoked commentary like ""aliens have arrived"" due to its sleek design and advanced technology . This comparison highlights the advanced nature of the bomber and the significant technological strides made by the US Air Force.The program is on track to deliver aircraft to Ellsworth Air Force Base , South Dakota, in the mid-2020s. Ellsworth will serve as the first B-21 main operating base and the location for the B-21 formal training unit.As per an Air and Space Forces report, the B-21 Raider’s test flight program is “proceeding well,” according to Air Force acquisition executive Andrew Hunter. He emphasized that the flight tests are effectively helping to understand the unique characteristics of the B-21 platform. ""It is doing what flight test programs are designed to do, which is helping us learn about the unique characteristics of this platform, but in a very, very effective way,” Hunter told lawmakers on the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 8. He also mentioned that there are ""key points still to come this year"" in testing.The exact number of test flights completed by the B-21 remains undisclosed. However, the Air Force has indicated that B-21 test aircraft will be considered “usable assets” once airworthy, with plans to convert them to operational configuration after developmental and operational testing.The B-21 Raider is a developmental penetrating strike bomber capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear munitions. With a wingspan projected at about 140 feet, the B-21 is smaller than the B-2’s 172-foot wingspan. The Air Force plans to acquire at least 100 B-21s to replace its 45 B-1s and 20 B-2s over the next decade. The B-21 program aims to enhance mission effectiveness and joint interoperability in advanced threat environments, thereby strengthening US deterrence and strategic advantage.","The US Air Force has unveiled new official photos of the B-21 Raider.

Additionally, the suspects were purportedly engaged in filming the abuse and circulating the videos within the vicinity, as reported by ARY News.The investigation into the matter was initiated following the disappearance of a child on May 11. Subsequent interrogations led to the unraveling of the gang's illicit activities.One of the suspects, identified as Nisar, reportedly enticed children from gaming zones and transported them to the gang's hideout. There, the minors were allegedly subjected to sexual abuse and also trafficked to others.It was disclosed by the police that the gang predominantly targeted children aged between 12 to 14 years.Law enforcement authorities further elaborated that the suspects employed a strategy of wearing a helmet associated with an online motorcycle service to evade detection while transporting the children from one location to another, ARY News reported.Data collected by Sahil, an NGO dedicated to addressing child sexual abuse, reveals a disturbing trend: the majority of abusers are individuals known to the victims, such as acquaintances, neighbours, or even family members.Shockingly, religious teachers and clerics emerge as the primary perpetrators within institutional settings, surpassing even police officers, school teachers, or nuclear family members in the number of complaints filed against them, according to Dawn.Primary data remains limited and organisations rely on media reports and police complaints but the trend over the past 20 years shows the gender divide of abused girls in madrassas is slightly higher than that of boys ('Cruel Numbers').","Police in Karachi have dismantled a gang allegedly engaged in the sexual abuse of children.

3-year-old booked for electricity theft in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/3-year-old-booked-for-electricity-theft-in-pakistans-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/articleshow/110327584.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: A 3-year-old toddler was booked for electricity theft in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province after an FIR was filed against the minor, as reported by ARY News.The Peshawar Electric Supply Company (PESCO) and the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) filed the complaint , leading to an FIR against the minor. The child was brought before the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, where his legal representative asserted that the judge dismissed the case after receiving an affidavit.Officials from WAPDA and PESCO expressed uncertainty regarding the child's involvement in the alleged offense.This incident follows a significant revelation last month, where power theft within Power Distribution Companies (DISCOs) reportedly caused a loss of PKR 438 billion to the national treasury. Sources indicated that these losses were a considerable portion of the total annual billing of PKR 723 billion.The power division identified the poorest performing DISCOs, highlighting companies in Hyderabad, Sukkur, Peshawar, Quetta, and Tribal areas for their records. On April 7, the Punjab energy department raised concerns about power distribution companies overcharging government institutions, which it labeled a burden on the provincial exchequer.The department noted that Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO), Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) were overcharging government departments.The department reported that there are over 102,000 electric connections across provincial departments, with a significant discrepancy between actual consumption and billed amounts. For the financial year 2022-23, the provincial departments consumed electricity worth over PKR 1.91 billion but were billed PKR 76 billion.In response to this issue, the federal government approved the deployment of Federal Investigation Officers (FIA) to electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) to curb power theft and enhance revenue recovery. This measure was in line with demands from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as reported by ARY News.","A 3-year-old toddler was booked for electricity theft in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

He added that temperatures could reach up to 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit) above the monthly average. This week could rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country, Babar said.It's the latest climate-related disaster to hit the country in recent years. Melting glaciers and growing monsoons have caused devastating floods, at one point submerging a third of the country.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual monthly rainfall, according to the national weather center. Last month's heavy rains killed scores of people while destroyed property and farmland, experts say the country witnessed heavier rains because of climate change .Pakistan is still trying to recover from $30 billion in losses caused by devastating climate-induced floods that killed 1,739 people in 2022.According to health officials, hospitals were instructed to set up emergency heatwave response centers so that those affected by the scorching temperatures could be quickly treated.Doctors say heatstroke is a serious illness that occurs when one's body temperature rises quickly because of sweltering heat, potentially causing some to fall unconscious. A severe heatstroke can cause disability or death.Some areas in Pakistan are also currently facing hours-long power outages.""We were without electricity for hours on Monday,"" said Ibrar Abbasi, who lives on the outskirts of Islamabad.Scientists have long warned that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and certain agricultural practices, will lead to more frequent and prolonged bouts of extreme weather, including hotter temperatures.Babar said another intense heat wave will hit the country in June, when the temperature is likely to reach 45 degrees (113 Fahrenheit). He said people should drink a lot of water and avoid unnecessary travel. Farmers and other livestock owners should take measures to protect their animals during extreme heat, he said.However, many people, especially laborers and construction workers in the impoverished nation, ask how they can stay indoors as their families will suffer if they don't work.""I am not feeling well because of the stifling heat, but I have to work,"" said Ghulam Farid, who owns a small general store in Sheikhupra, a city in Punjab province.Construction workers were seen sitting near a road on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, hoping to get a job.

NEW YORK: In perhaps the first acknowledgement of its kind on a global forum that the ""new India is a dangerous entity"", Pakistan 's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.Pakistan's permanent representative at the world body also quoted from a report in a leading US daily to say the ""new India comes into your home and kills you"".Addressing the General Assembly on May 2, Akram said, ""Pakistan's foreign minister informed the Security Council, as well as the secretary general and the president of the General Assembly of India's campaign of targeted assassinations in Pakistan. This extra-territorial state terrorism is not limited to Pakistan. It has been extended to targeted killings of political opponents in Canada and attempted in the United States and probably in other countries.""""The Washington Post reported that Prime Minister Modi last week told his cheering supporters, and I quote, ""Today, even India's enemies know this is Modi. This is the new India. This new India comes into your home and kills you"". This new India is a dangerous entity, it is a net provider of insecurity, not security,"" Pakistan's permanent representative to the UN alleged.Earlier, top British daily, The Guardian, claimed in a report that the Indian government carried out assassinations of wanted individuals deep inside Pakistan as part of a ""wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil"".It said, citing intelligence sources, that targeted assassinations increased significantly in 2023, claiming India's involvement in the suspected deaths of about 15 people, ""most of whom were shot at close range by unknown gunmen"".Earlier, some countries in the West raised concerns over what they claimed were targeted killings on their soil at the behest of the Indian government.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused 'agents' allegedly in the employ of the Indian government of killing Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan leader and a designated terrorist by the country's elite National Investigation Agency (NIA), in 2020.However, India has dismissed the claim as 'absurd' and 'motivated'.Nijjar was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A purported video clip of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March, this year, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men in what was alleged to be a 'contract killing'.In a recent development in the Nijjar case, the Canadian Police arrested four Indian nationals for their alleged involvement in the killing of the separatist Khalistleader outside a gurudwara in British Columbia last June.Reacting to the arrests, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar denied receiving any evidence implicating Indian nationals' involvement in the killing in Canada of the India-designated terrorist.Responding to media queries, Jaishankar said, ""I also read that another arrest has been made. If that person is an Indian national, then usually by consular practice, you inform the government or the embassy of the country of origin. But beyond that, we have long maintained that if anything, any event in Canada, any violence in Canada, has any evidence or information which is relevant to be investigated in India, we are open to investigating it.""He emphasised that while any Indian national's arrest would usually prompt notification to the government or embassy, no specific evidence justifying investigation by Indian agencies has been received to date.""But to date, we have never received anything, which is specific and worthy of being pursued by our investigative agencies. And I'm not aware anything has changed in the last few days in that regard,"" the External Affairs Minister said at a media interaction at a seminar on Indian Capital Markets 'Roadmap for Viksit Bharat' at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in Mumbai earlier.At a weekly media briefing, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), too, informed that Canada had not formally conveyed the arrests and India had not yet received any consular access request.On being asked about the fourth Indian arrested by Canada in connection with the Nijjar killing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have seen reports of the fourth person being arrested. We have not been formally conveyed of it. So far, we have not received any consular access request as well.""Earlier, campaigning for the ongoing general elections in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a telling remark vis-a-vis its western neighbour, saying India does not send dossiers on terrorism anymore but eliminates terrorists in their own backyard.""Today, India doesn't send dossiers.(Today India strikes back at terrorists on their own turf),"" PM Modi said at a poll rally in Maharashtra's Latur.Expanding on the difference in how his government tackles terrorism as compared to previous Congress regimes at the Centre, Prime Minister Modi said the earlier approach of handing dossiers to Pakistan has been replaced by taking out the wanted terror conspirators on their own turf.At a separate rally, PM Modi doubled down on remarks made by the INDIA bloc leader Farooq Abdullah that Pakistan was not wearing bangles and was a nuclear-amed nation, saying, """" (I was told Pakistanis don't even have bangles, we will make them wear some)"".Addressing a public meeting in Muzaffarpur, PM Modi said, ""These (Congress and INDIA alliance) people are so afraid that they see Pakistan's atom bombs even in their dreams. Can such a government and leader run the country? They (INDI alliance leaders) say, ''. (i am told Pakistanis don't even have bangles...we will make them wear some. They are desperately crying out for wheat, they don't have electricity and now they don't even have bangles to wear.) Some leaders in the Opposition are even giving clean chits to the 26/11 accused.""""Some people are doubting the surgical strikes and air strikes (after the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks). These leaders want to weaken the morale of our forces and cast aspersions on our nuclear power. It seems like 'INDI alliance ne India ke khilaf supari le li hai' (INDI partners have taken out a contract against the country),"" PM Modi added.In the US, federal prosecutors earlier alleged the involvement of two Indian nationals, including a government employee, in a plot to murder Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Canadian also holding American citizenship, on its soil.According to the indictment of the US Justice Department, an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, who is currently in custody, was charged with the murder-for-hire of Pannun. The US Justice Department claimed that an Indian government employee, who was not identified in the indictment filed, recruited Gupta to hire a hitman to allegedly assassinate Pannun, which was foiled by US authorities.India set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.","Pakistan's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.

IMF asks Pakistan ensure transparency in working of Special Investment Facilitation Council,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-asks-pakistan-ensure-transparency-in-working-of-special-investment-facilitation-council/articleshow/110302522.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The IMF has asked Pakistan to share a draft of the under-preparation investment policy and ensure transparency in the working of the much-hyped Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) as the cash-strapped country is seeking a fresh bailout package from the global lender, a media report said on Tuesday. The SIFC was established in June last year under an "" economic revival plan "" devised by civilian and military leaders to capitalise on ""untapped potential in key sectors"" and attract foreign direct investment (FDI).The hybrid government body promises to create an enabling business environment in the country and offer a one-window solution to investors.A visiting team of the Washington-based lender , which is on a sort of assessment mission, has not yet converted ongoing engagement into formal talks with the Pakistani authorities, The News International reported.Both sides expressed divergent views on the macroeconomic framework for the next fiscal budget for 2024-25, the newspaper said.The Pakistani authorities informed the International Monetary Fund's assessment team that the new investment policy was under preparation and would be announced after conducting due deliberations, the report said.The IMF asked for transparency in the working of the SIFC. The assessment team also inquired about the potential investment in different projects and especially asked for privatisation of the national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other state-owned enterprises (SOEs).Envisaging the CPI-based inflation on the higher average rate of 12.7 per cent for the next budget 2024-25, the Washington-based lender also inquired about the tax exemptions offered by the government for the upcoming Special Economic Zones (SEZs) under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The IMF wants maximisation of non-tax revenues as the proposal under consideration is to increase the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) for increasing collection up to Pakistani Rs 1.08 trillion in the next fiscal year or slap a carbon levy to compensate the zero rate of GST on petroleum products, The News International reported.The international lender has recommended imposing 18 per cent GST on petrol and diesel along with PDL.The IMF has refused to accept the macroeconomic framework of the Finance Ministry and so far pitched the macroeconomic framework for the next budget 2024-25 including a real GDP growth rate of 3.5 per cent while the CPI-based inflation was projected on the higher side at 12.7 per cent.The Ministry of Finance has prepared a macroeconomic framework whereby the GDP growth was envisaged at 3.7 to 4 per cent while inflation was kept on average in the range of 11 to 12 per cent, the report said.For the outgoing fiscal year 2023-24, the provision GDP growth figure may hover around 2 to 2.5 per cent of GDP against the official target of 3.5 per cent, it said.Pakistan has made a formal request for a fresh bailout package of USD 6 to USD 8 billion under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the possibility of being augmented through climate finance. If successful, it would be the 24th IMF bailout programme for the country.Last month, Pakistan completed a short-term USD 3 billion programme with the IMF, which bailed the country out of any default.It was unclear whether the IMF mission would end with a formal staff-level agreement for the next bailout package, according to The Express Tribune newspaper.The duration, instrument, and size of the next IMF programme were open to discussion, the report said, quoting sources.Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high of 38 per cent last May.The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall, and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around two per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","The IMF has asked Pakistan to share a draft of the under-preparation investment policy and ensure transparency in the working of the Special Investment Facilitation Council.

"Are those mimes spying on us? In Pakistan, it's not a strange question",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/are-those-mimes-spying-on-us-in-pakistan-its-not-a-strange-question/articleshow/110281673.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The street performers first appeared a few years ago along busy intersections of Islamabad. Coated head to toe in eye-catching gold paint, they stood perfectly still, leaning on glimmering canes and tipping their top hats open. Perhaps in a different place, the emergence of mimes on the street looking to earn a few dollars might go unnoticed.But this is Pakistan , where things under the security state often are not as simple as they seem. So as the number of golden performers grew, so, too, did the intrigue around them. Could they be informants for the nation's intelligence agency? Lookouts for powerful politicians? Maybe spies for CIA ?Today, the ""golden men"" of Islamabad have been added to the ranks of the conspiracy theories sprouted, knocked down and rehashed every day across the city. In Pakistan, where the hand of the security services is seen everywhere, conspiracy theories have been embraced in the mainstream for decades. Suspicion has become so universal that wild tales take root after almost every news event. In the wake of catastrophic floods in 2010, people asserted that they had been caused by CIA weather-controlling technology. Media pundits claimed that a US ""thinktank"" was behind a failed car bombing by a Pakistani-American in Times Square that year and that Osama bin Laden was actually Jewish.In such a climate, everyone - even street performers - can be seen as potential tools of the state. For most of Pakistan's 76-year history, the surveillance was a routine facet of daily life. But in recent years, frustration with the military's role in politics has exploded. ""With the political atmosphere so polarised, we're becoming more suspicious of being watched or who is listening,"" said Ali Abas, 25, a resident of Islamabad.On the other side of the city, Mustaq Ahmed, 53, stood on a median of a busy intersection. His jacket, pants, walking cane and top hat were all spray-painted gold. Gold makeup was caked onto his face and hand. Ahmed once sold umbrellas, but became ""Golden Thakur"" three years ago after he overheard another golden man saying he made up to Pak Rs 8,000 - or nearly $30 - each day. It was more than five times what Ahmed was taking home. That cash has dwindled recently as the novelty of the golden men has waned, he said. When asked if he would ever supplement his income with a little side work for the intelligence agencies, he immediately replied: ""no, no, no."" Was there any chance that other golden men were earning a few extra dollars that way? ""Maybe,"" he said with a shrug. ""It's Pakistan.""","In Pakistan, where the hand of the security services is seen everywhere, conspiracy theories have been embraced in the mainstream for decades.
