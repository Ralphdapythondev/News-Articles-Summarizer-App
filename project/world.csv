'You can’t suppress it forever': Prince Harry opens up about losing mother Diana at 12,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/you-cant-suppress-it-forever-prince-harry-opens-up-about-losing-mother-diana-at-12/articleshow/111300423.cms,"Prince Harry’s Afternoon with Scotty’s

BBC News Feature on Event with Prince Harry

NEW DELHI: Prince Harry has appeared in a new video discussing grief , encouraging children and young people to express their emotions. Speaking as a global ambassador for Scotty’s Little Soldiers, a charity that supports kids who have lost parents in the military, Harry shared his personal experiences.Having lost his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, at the age of 12, he offers his perspective on coping with loss. The video, shot in May and released ahead of Armed Forces Day, aims to highlight the support needs of bereaved military children in the UK.Harry spoke frankly about the misconceptions children can have after losing a loved one. He explained that it can be easy to convince oneself that prolonged sadness is necessary to prove the person is missed. He said, however, that the lost loved one would likely want the living to find happiness.""It’s so easy as a kid to think or convince yourself….you convince yourself that the person you’ve lost wants you, or you need to be sad for as long as possible to prove to them that they are missed. But then there’s this realisation of, no, they must want me to be happy,"" he said.Prince Harry, 39, has previously criticised what he feels was a lack of family support following his mother’s death in 1997. He believes this led him to suppress his emotions until he sought therapy. He stressed the importance of talking about loss as a way to celebrate the lives of those who have passed.""That’s the hardest thing, especially for kids, I think, which is, 'I don’t want to talk about it because it will make me sad, but once realising that if I do talk about it, I’m celebrating their life, then actually, things become easier'… as opposed to this 'I’m just not going to talk about it, and that’s the best form of coping,' when in fact it’s not. It can be for a period of time…you can’t suppress it forever. It’s not sustainable. And will eat away at you inside,"" he added.Addressing the difficulty of discussing painful topics, he noted the natural defense mechanisms that come into play. ""No one wants to be in the position where they are forced to talk about the very thing they don’t want to talk about, especially when every defense mechanism in your mind, nervous system and everything else is saying 'do not go there',"" he said.The video features a conversation with Nikki Scott, founder of Scotty’s Little Soldiers. She recounted the heart-wrenching moment she had to tell her five-year-old son, Kai, that his father, Cpl Lee Scott, had been killed in Afghanistan in 2009. At the time, she also had a seven-month-old daughter, Brooke.The charity released the video to draw attention to the ongoing needs of bereaved military children. Scott was inspired to create Scotty’s Little Soldiers after witnessing the positive effects a family holiday had on her grieving son.Expressing his admiration for Scott’s work, Harry said, ""What you’ve done is incredible. It is truly inspirational. I’m really honored and privileged to be part of Scotty’s now and I really look forward to us doing everything we can to bring in more people, more interest, raise more funds and be able to get the message out there to get more kids the support they so desperately need.""Scotty’s Little Soldiers currently supports over 680 members and estimates that each year 2,100 children are newly bereaved of a parent who served in the British Armed Forces. The charity's mission is to ensure these children receive the emotional support they need to cope with their loss and lead fulfilling lives.The video aims to help children understand that expressing their feelings is a vital part of healing. Through this initiative, Prince Harry hopes to bring attention to the importance of open conversations about grief and loss.","Prince Harry is a global ambassador for Scotty's Little Soldiers, a charity that supports kids who have lost parents in the military.

NEW YORK: A court in New York on Wednesday sentenced former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez to 45 years in prison after he was convicted of trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into the United States.Anti-Hernandez protesters gathered outside the Manhattan courthouse ahead of sentencing brandishing placards decrying the former head of state's crimes with one declaring ""Narco government -- makes the people emigrate.""""The role of Mr Hernandez was to use his political power as president of Congress and president of Honduras to limit the risks of drug traffickers in exchange of money,"" said Judge Kevin Castel as the disgraced statesman stood impassively.He said Hernandez provided police and military support and helped to send 400 tons of drugs -- worth $10 billion at market prices -- to the United States.In a speech ahead of sentencing, Hernandez, who wore prison garb and used a walking stick to enter court, was interrupted by the judge for contesting the trial's outcome and insisting he was wrongly charged.The sentence, which also included an $8 million fine, was less than the life imprisonment that prosecutors had sought -- although Hernandez's age, 55, means he may die behind bars.""He's going to pursue every single possible legal remedy that he can pursue,"" Hernandez's lawyer Renato Stabile told reporters outside court.Hernandez, who US federal prosecutors said turned his Central American country into a ""narco-state"" during his 2014-2022 presidency, has previously indicated through his legal team he would appeal his conviction.He was convicted in March of having facilitated the smuggling of hundreds of tons of cocaine -- mainly from Colombia and Venezuela -- to the United States via Honduras since 2004, starting long before he became president.Hernandez used the drug money to enrich himself and finance his political campaign, and commit electoral fraud in the 2013 and 2017 elections, prosecutors said.He had presented himself as a champion of the war on drugs and was initially seen by Washington as an ally in the fight.In 2017, the United States was one of the first countries to recognize his re-election, while the opposition denounced fraud against a backdrop of violent protests that left some 30 people dead.He was extradited to the United States in 2022 using a law he had himself helped to pass as Congress president under pressure from Washington, accused of aiding drug smugglers in return for millions of dollars in bribes.US Attorney General Merrick Garland said Hernandez ""abused his power to support one of the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world, and the people of Honduras and the United States bore the consequences.""The fall of Hernandez, who is known in his country as ""JOH,"" was abrupt.No sooner had he handed over power to the new left-wing president Xiomara Castro, the outgoing leader was shackled and paraded in front of journalists.Hernandez follows in the footsteps of other former Latin American heads of state convicted in the United States, including Panama's Manuel Noriega in 1992 and Guatemala's Alfonso Portillo in 2014.The short, athletic leader was known for his military haircut, having served as an officer before training as a lawyer, completing a masters degree in New York in 1995.His legal woes began in earnest in 2018 when his brother, Juan Antonio Hernandez, was arrested in Miami and sentenced in March 2021 to life imprisonment for ""large-scale"" drug trafficking.After his arrest in Honduras in February 2022, Hernandez said he was a victim of ""revenge"" by the drug lords, many of whom testified against him in New York.","Former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez sentenced to 45 years in prison.

However, due to a 60% income tax deduction, the effective cost per ton will begin at 120 kroner ($17.3) and increase to 300 kroner by 2035.While carbon dioxide typically garners more attention for its role in climate change, methane is far more potent, trapping about 87 times more heat over a 20-year period, as noted by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Livestock, including cows, sheep, and pigs, contribute significantly to methane emissions , accounting for approximately 32% of human-caused methane emissions, according to the UN Environment Program.""We will take a big step closer to becoming climate neutral by 2045,"" Bruus stated, emphasizing Denmark's pioneering role as the first country to implement a genuine CO2 tax on agriculture and expressing hope that other nations will follow suit.Denmark's initiative follows months of protests by farmers across Europe against climate change regulations , which they argue threaten their livelihoods.

He said security forces had arrested two key militant commanders— TTP’s Nasrullah, alias Maulvi Mansoor, and Idrees, aka Irshad— and then showed a recorded statement of the former.In the video statement Nasrullah claimshe belongs to South Waziristan’s Sararogha tehsil and that he had worked from slain Baitullah Mehsud’s platform before joining TTP in 2007.He recalled that he had settled in Afghanistan’s Paktika province during the2014 military offensive in North Waziristan and had been working as an “emir” in TTP’s defence commission since 2023.He thenexplainedaplanhe had been briefed about in Jan 2024 according to which a BLA guide would take him to southern Balochistan by helping him cross the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan through Spin Boldak town. According to the militant, Bashir Zeb, commander of BLA Majeed Brigade, was complicit in the plan’s creation.Nasrullah alleged India’s intelligence agency R&AW was behind all this, that it wanted a BLA-TTP nexus, and that TTP bases be established in Khuzdar, Balochistan.“TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsudand the outfit’s defence minister, Mufti Muzahim, said we(TTP)and our friends(R&AW)have three objectives in establishing a foothold in Balochistan,” he claimed, adding: “Sabotaging CPEC projects, including targeting Chinese citizens; carrying out kidnappings for ransom to play up the matter of enforced disappearances so that intelligence agencies can be defamed; and spreading anarchy and frustration among the people by fomenting terrorist activities in Balochistan.”He claimed that Mehsud held meetings with R&AW agents at the Indian embassy in Kabul and that this was fully supported by the Afghan government.After showing Nasrullah’s video statement, Langau said, “The global community should have no doubt left that there is India behind all this.”He said that while TTP vowed to “introduce an Islamic system”, the BLA on the other hand was their “ideological opposite”. “Their nexus only means that their investor is the same who is using them from two angles,” he alleged. “If you look at the financial support or the intelligence of BLA and TTP, or their members sitting abroad, there is no doubt that RAW is funding them,” Langau alleged.","Minister Ziaullah Langau’s allegations came during a press conference in Quetta.

NEW DELHI: From the past few years, Karen Read’s murder trial has been surrounded by the controversy of a fatal love story and police corruption since John O'Keefe , her partner was found dead outside a fellow officer’s house in Canton, Massachusetts in 2022. The court, on Wednesday, will begin a second day of deliberation of the trial.Read has been accused by the prosecutors of the victim of vehicular manslaughter and leaving the accident spot. According to Court TV, the duo were dating for two years before O'Keefe’s death. The alleged involvement of Michael Proctor , a state police trooper, in planting false evidence against Read at the crime scene has also made headlines.Now, the question is arising whether Read is guilty of killing her alleged boyfriend or is it a police cover-up to save the real culprits.Citing a witness, the Associated Press reported a fight that erupted between the couple in 2021 in Cape Cod over how O’Keefe treated her. The witness also said how Read became angry after accusing O'Keefe of kissing another woman during Aruba vacation.Read and O’Keefe were drinking at a Canton bar before the argument, prosecutors said.According to the prosecutors, Read’s SUV hit O'Keefe outside the home of Brian Albert. Albert was hosting an after-party at his residence.Read was arrested on February 1, 2022. However, she got bail the next day.Alan Jackson , Read's lawyer has highlighted the alleged police corruption in the murder case and called it a cover-up. He called Read a ‘convenient outsider’ and thus being framed to save the real culprit.“Ladies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,” Jackson said.“You have been lied to in this courtroom. Your job is to make sure you don’t ever ever look the other way,” he said in the Tuesday argument.Michael Proctor is also accused of sending derogatory text messages to friends and family about Read.Proctor said, ""She's a whackjob (about Read)"" and ""hopefully she kills herself"" in his chats.Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally , however, denied any cover-up. He presented evidence before the jurors mentioning about the voice message in which Read is screaming, “John, I (expletive) hate you!”According to Lally, four witnesses had heard Read saying “I hit him. I hit him. Oh my God. I hit him.”Read, 44, if convicted in the O'Keefe’s murder case, will be sentenced for life.","Karen Read's murder trial has been surrounded by the controversy of a fatal love story and police corruption.

He vowed to stand firm and named a new army commander, who immediately ordered the troops to stand down.Soon the soldiers pulled back, along with a line of military vehicles , ending the rebellion after just three hours. Hundreds of Arce's supporters then rushed the square outside the palace, waving Bolivian flags , singing the national anthem and cheering.The soldiers' retreat was followed by the arrest of army chief gen. Juan Jose Zuniga , after the attorney general opened an investigation.Government minister Eduardo del Castillo said that in addition to Zuniga, former navy vice Adm. Juan Arnez Salvador was taken into custody.""What was this group's goal? The goal was to overturn the democratically elected authority,"" del Castillo told journalists in announcing the arrests.The apparent coup attempt came as the country has faced months of tensions and political fights between Arce and his one-time ally, former leftist presidentEvo Morales , over control of the ruling party. It also came amid a severe economic crisis.The clashes have paralysed the government's efforts to deal with the economic crisis. For example, Morales' allies in Congress have consistently thwarted Arce's attempts to take on debt to relieve some of the pressure.Zuniga referenced that paralysis during the rebellion, telling reporters the military was tired of the infighting and was seeking ""to restore democracy.""""We are listening to the cry of the people because for many years an elite has taken control of the country,"" he said, adding that politicians are ""destroying the country: look at what situation we are in, what crisis they have left us in.""""The armed forces intend to restore the democracy, to make it a true democracy,"" he said.The rapidly unfolding crisis began in the early afternoon as the streets of La Paz started filling with soldiers. Arce tweeted that the troops deployment was irregular, and soon he and other political figures warned of an attempted coup.Still, the apparent attempt to depose the sitting president seemed to lack any meaningful support, and even Arce's rivals closed ranks to defend democracy and repudiate the uprising.In a twist, Zuniga claimed in comments to journalists before his arrest that Arce himself told the general to storm the palace in a political move. ""The president told me: 'The situation is very screwed up, very critical. It is necessary to prepare something to raise my popularity',"" Zuniga quoted the Bolivian leader as saying.Zuniga said he asked Arce if he should ""take out the armoured vehicles?"" and Arce replied, ""Take them out.""Justice minister Ivan Lima denied Zuniga's claims, saying the general was lying and trying to justify his actions, for which he said he will face justice.Prosecutors will seek the maximum sentence of 15 to 20 years in prison for Zuniga, Lima said via the social media platform X, ""for having attacked democracy and the constitution.""The spectacle shocked Bolivians, no stranger to political unrest; in 2019 Morales was ousted as president following an earlier political crisis.As the crisis unfolded Wednesday, Arce confronted Zuniga in the palace hallway, as shown on video on Bolivian television. ""I am your captain, and I order you to withdraw your soldiers, and I will not allow this insubordination,"" Arce said.Surrounded by ministers, he added: ""Here we are, firm in Casa Grande, to confront any coup attempt. We need the Bolivian people to organize.""Less than an hour later, Arce announced new heads of the army, navy and air force amid the roar of supporters, and thanked the country's police and regional allies for standing by him. Arce said the troops who rose against him were ""staining the uniform"" of the military.""I order all that are mobilized to return to their units,"" said the newly named army chief Jose Wilson Sanchez. ""No one wants the images we're seeing in the streets.""Shortly after, the armoured vehicles roared out of the plaza, tailed by hundreds of military fighters, as police in riot gear set up blockades outside the government palace.The incident was met with a wave of outrage by other regional leaders, including the organization of American States, Chilean president Gabriel Boric, the leader of Honduras, and former Bolivian leaders.Bolivia has seen intensifying protests in recent months over the economy's precipitous decline from one of the continent's fastest-growing two decades ago to one of its most crisis-stricken.Arce and Morales have been battling for the future of Bolivia's splintering movement for socialism, known by its Spanish acronym MAS, ahead of elections in 2025.Following Wednesday's chaos, reports on local media showed Bolivians stocking up on food and other essentials in supermarkets, concerned about what will come next.But addressing supporters outside the presidential palace, the country's vice president, David Choquehuanca, vowed: ""Never again will the Bolivian people permit coup attempts.""","Army chief Gen. Juan Jose Zuniga is arrested, along with a former navy vice Adm. Juan Arnez Salvador. The army chief says the military is tired of infighting and is seeking ""to restore democracy"" President Luis Arce vows to stand firm and names a new army commander, who immediately ordered the troops to stand down.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111301074,imgsize-68440,width-400,resizemode-4/111301074.jpg"
Prosecutors drop nearly 80 arrests from a pro-Palestinian protest at the University of Texas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prosecutors-drop-nearly-80-arrests-from-a-pro-palestinian-protest-at-the-university-of-texas/articleshow/111300705.cms,"DALLAS: Nearly 80 criminal trespass arrests stemming from a pro-Palestinian protest at the University of Texas have been dismissed , a prosecutor said Wednesday, the latest dropped charges against demonstrators arrested on college campuses across the US this spring.Delia Garza, a democrat who is the elected attorney for Travis County, said 79 criminal trespass cases that were dismissed all stemmed from the April 29 protest. She said cases involving other offenses remain pending.Garza said her office determined it couldn't meet the legal burden to prove the cases beyond a reasonable doubt. She said factors that were considered included whether the protesters' right to free speech had been violated, whether prosecutors had sufficient evidence to seek a conviction and if pursuing the case was in the interest of justice.At campuses across the US this spring, demonstrators sparred over the Israel-Hamas war. Texas' protest and others grew out of Columbia University 's early demonstrations.Last week, prosecutors in New York announced that dozens of Columbia students who were arrested for occupying a campus building as part of a pro-Palestinian protest would have their criminal charges dropped. The Manhattan district attorney's office said it would not pursue criminal charges for 31 of the 46 people initially arrested on trespassing charges inside the administration building.On April 29 at UT, officers in riot gear encircled about 100 sitting protesters, dragging or carrying them out one by one amid screams. Another group of demonstrators trapped police and a van full of arrestees between buildings, creating a mass of bodies pushing and shoving. Officers used pepper spray and flash-bang devices to clear the crowd.The university said in a statement at the time that many of the protesters weren't affiliated with the school and that encampments were prohibited on the campus in the state capital. The school also alleged that some demonstrators were ""physically and verbally combative"" with university staff, prompting officials to call law enforcement. The Texas department of public safety said arrests were made at the behest of the university and Texas gov. Greg Abbott.Garza said she wished that state and university leadership had looked for ""another solution to allow these students to voice what they felt like they needed to voice."" She said the reaction to the protests showed that elected leaders ""continue to prioritize extreme government outreach over actual public safety.""In a statement, UT said the school was ""deeply disappointed"" by Garza's actions, adding that the school ""will continue to use the law enforcement and administrative tools at our disposal to maintain safety and operational continuity for our 53,000 students who come to campus to learn, regardless of whether the criminal justice system shares this commitment.""""Free speech is welcome on our campus. Violating laws or rules is not,"" the statement said. ""Actions that violate laws and Institutional Rules should be met with consequences, not with political posturing and press conferences.""","Nearly 80 criminal trespass arrests stemming from a pro-Palestinian protest at the University of Texas have been dismissed.

Death Sentence: Texas man executed for 2001 abduction and killing of 18-year-old woman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-man-executed-for-2001-abduction-and-killing-of-18-year-old-woman/articleshow/111300159.cms,"HUNTSVILLE: A Texas man who admitted he kidnapped, sexually assaulted and fatally shot an 18-year-old woman in 2001 was executed Wednesday evening.Ramiro Gonzales , 41, was pronounced dead at 6:50 PM following a chemical injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville for the January 2001 killing of Bridget Townsend.Gonzales was repeatedly apologetic to the victim's relatives in his last statement from the execution chamber.""I can't put into words the pain I have caused y'all, the hurt, what I took away that I cannot give back. I hope this apology is enough,"" he said.""I never stopped praying that you would forgive me and that one day I would have this opportunity to apologize. I owe all of you my life and I hope one day you will forgive me,"" he added, just before the lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital began flowing.As the drug took effect, he took seven breaths, then began sounds like snores. Within less than a minute, all movement had stopped.Gonzales kidnapped Townsend, who would have turned 41 on Wednesday, from a rural home in Bandera County, northwest of San Antonio. He later took her to his family's ranch in neighboring Medina County, where he sexually assaulted her before killing her. Her body wasn't found until October 2002, when Gonzales led authorities to her remains in southwest Texas after he had received two life sentences for kidnapping and raping another woman.""We have finally witnessed justice be being served,"" Townsend's brother, David, said after watching the execution. ""This day marks the end of a long and painful journey for our family. For over two decades we have endured unimaginable pain and heartache.""He said Gonzales' death ""provides us a little bit of peace. I do want to say we are not joyous. We are not happy. This is a very, very sad day for everyone all the way around.""The US supreme court declined a defense plea to intervene about 1 and 1/2 hours before the execution's scheduled start time. The high court rejected arguments by Gonzales' lawyers that he had taken responsibility for what he did and that a prosecution expert witness now says he was wrong in testifying that Gonzales would be a future danger to society, a legal finding needed to impose a death sentence .""He has earnestly devoted himself to self-improvement, contemplation, and prayer, and has grown into a mature, peaceful, kind, loving, and deeply religious adult. He acknowledges his responsibility for his crimes and has sought to atone for them and to seek redemption through his actions,"" Gonzales' lawyers had written Monday in their unsuccessful request to the supreme court for a stay of execution. After re-evaluating Gonzales in 2022, Gripon said his prediction was wrong.Earlier this month, a group of 11 evangelical leaders from Texas and around the country asked the parole board and gov Greg Abbott to halt the execution and grant clemency. They had said Gonzalez was helping other death row inmates through a faith-based program.In video submitted as part of his clemency request to the Texas board of pardons and paroles, Gonzales admitted responsibility.""I just want (Townsend's mother) to know how sorry I really am. I took everything that was valuable from a mother,"" said Gonzales, who was 18 years old at the time. ""So, every day it's a continual task to do everything that I can to feel that responsibility for the life that I took.""On Monday, the parole board voted 7-0 against commuting Gonzales' death sentence to a lesser penalty. Members also rejected granting him a six-month reprieve.Prosecutors described Gonzales as a sexual predator who told police he ignored Townsend's pleas to spare her life. They argued that jurors reached the right decision on a death sentence because he had a long criminal history and showed no remorse.""The State's punishment case was overwhelming,"" the Texas attorney general's office said. ""Even if Dr. Gripon's testimony were wiped from the punishment slate, it would not have mattered.""Gonzales' execution was the second this year in Texas and the eighth in the US on Thursday, Oklahoma is scheduled to execute Richard Rojem for the 1984 abduction, rape and killing of a 7-year-old girl.","Ramiro Gonzales, 41, was pronounced dead at 6:50 PM following a chemical injection.

Two astronauts stuck on ISS as Boeing capsule faces technical woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/two-astronauts-stuck-on-iss-as-boeing-capsule-faces-technical-woes/articleshow/111299153.cms,"The current situation

If the unexpected happens

If Starliner cannot be used

WASHINGTON: Problems with Boeing's Starliner capsule, still docked at the International Space Station, have upended the original plans for its return of its two astronauts - Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore - to Earth, as last-minute fixes and tests draw out a mission crucial to the future of Boeing's space division. Nasa has rescheduled the planned return three times, and now has no date set for it. Since its June 5 lift-off, the capsule has had five helium leaks, five manoeuvring thrusters go dead and a propellant valve fail to close completely, prompting crew in space and managers in Houston to spend more time than expected pursuing fixes.Starliner can stay docked at the ISS for up to 45 days, according to Nasa's commercial crew manager Steve Stich. But if absolutely necessary, it could stay docked for up to 72 days, relying on various backup systems, according to a source. Internally at Nasa, Starliner's latest targeted return date is July 6, according to this source. Such a return date would mean that the mission, originally planned for eight days, instead would last a month.Starliner's expendable propulsion system is part of the craft's service module. The current problems centre on this system, which is needed to back the capsule away from the ISS and position it to dive through Earth's atmosphere. Many of Starliner's thrusters have overheated when fired, and the leaks of helium - used to pressurise the thrusters - appear to be connected to how frequently they are used. Stich said recent test-firings of the thrusters gave mission teams confidence in a safe return. The mission team in Houston, made up of Nasa and Boeing personnel, is scrutinising data on the propulsion issues and considering how to fix them, such as by updating software or changing how the hardware is used. Once Nasa officials give the team a go-ahead for a return, Starliner's thrusters would be used to undock the capsule from the ISS and begin a roughly six-hour journey home. This is Starliner's first mission to orbit carrying astronauts - the final test needed for Nasa to certify it as its second ride to ISS along with SpaceX's Crew Dragon.Even with the propulsion system issues, Nasa has said Starliner still would be capable of returning the astronauts to Earth if absolutely necessary - that is, if the capsule must serve as an escape pod from the ISS in an emergency or if any of Starliner's perishable items - such as solar panels - show signs of expiring earlier than planned.If Starliner is deemed incapable of safely returning Wilmore and Williams to Earth, one option would be sending them home aboard Crew Dragon, which ferried four astronauts to the ISS in March and is able to fit more people in an emergency. That scenario, considered unlikely, would be embarrassing for Boeing. The last time a Nasa astronaut needed an alternative ride home came in 2022, when Russia's Soyuz capsule sprang a coolant leak after delivering to the station two cosmonauts and US astronaut Frank Rubio. He used an empty Soyuz capsule that Russia launched as a rescue craft. His mission was extended from 6 months to 371 days - a record-breaking duration for an American in space.","Nasa has rescheduled the planned return three times, and now has no date set for it.

Pakistan's general elections were plagued by a nationwide mobile internet shutdown on election day, arrests and violence during the lead-up, and unusually delayed results. These issues led to widespread accusations that the vote had been rigged.Lawmakers supporting resolution HR 901, titled 'Expressing support for democracy and human rights in Pakistan', said that the overwhelming support highlighted the United States' commitment to promoting democratic values globally.The resolution passed on Tuesday by an overwhelming 368-7 vote urged US President Joe Biden to collaborate with Pakistan in upholding democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.It emphasised the importance of free and fair elections, calling for a thorough and independent investigation into any claims of interference or irregularities in Pakistan's 2024 elections.The resolution emphasised the need for Pakistani public participation in the democratic process, months after the general elections were contested as rigged.Jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is among those opposing the election results, citing significant obstacles faced by its candidates, leading them to run as independents without their iconic bat symbol due to a legal battle with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).Following the elections, Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Bilawal Bhutto-led Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) formed a coalition government, leaving PTI and other parties in opposition.The resolution calls for a ""full and independent investigation of claims of interference or irregularities in Pakistan's February 2024 election.""It also condemns ""attempts to suppress the people of Pakistan's participation in their democracy, including through harassment, intimidation, violence, arbitrary detention, restrictions on access to the Internet and telecommunications, or any violation of their human, civil, or political rights.""It also denounces ""any effort to subvert the political, electoral, or judicial processes of Pakistan.""Congressman Rich McCormick, a Georgia Republican, sponsored the resolution. Congressman Daniel Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan, co-sponsored it. The original resolution was introduced in the House on November 30, 2023, and the text was amended on June 18 this year, the Dawn newspaper reported.Meanwhile, Pakistan on Wednesday criticised Resolution 901, saying it was neither constructive nor objective due to its perceived lack of understanding of the country's political situation and electoral process.Responding to media inquiries regarding the resolution, Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch confirmed that Pakistan had noted its passage.""We believe that the timing and context of this particular resolution do not align well with the positive dynamics of our bilateral ties and stem from an incomplete understanding of the political situation and electoral process in Pakistan,"" Baloch was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune newspaper.She emphasised that Pakistan, as the world's second-largest parliamentary democracy and fifth-largest democracy overall, remains committed to constitutionalism, human rights, and the rule of law in line with its national interests.Baloch stressed the importance of constructive dialogue and engagement based on mutual respect and understanding.""Such resolutions are therefore neither constructive nor objective. We hope that the US Congress will play a supportive role in strengthening Pakistan-US ties and focus on avenues of mutual collaboration that benefit both our peoples and countries,"" she added.","The US House of Representatives has passed a resolution supporting democracy and human rights in Pakistan.

Those charges stemmed from WikiLeaks' release in 2010 of hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washington's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - one of the largest breaches of secret information in US history.During a three-hour hearing held earlier in the US territory of Saipan, Assange pleaded guilty to one criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified national defence documents. He defended his actions, describing himself as a journalist seeking information from sources, a task he said he saw as legal and constitutionally protected.

It also argued that private entities making decisions based on that information are not state actors unless threatened with adverse consequences.The supreme court's decision comes as part of a series of rulings concerning free speech rights in the digital age. In March, the justices decided that public officials can sometimes be sued under the First Amendment for blocking critics on social media.

It will commence with actions against terrorists. The operation has no political motive, its sole purpose is to counter the surge in terrorism,” the minister said.“We fought two wars under the Zia-ul-Haq and Musharraf regimes for US interests.

Indus Water Treaty Talks: Pakistani Delegation Visits Jammu for Bilateral Discussions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-delegation-arrives-in-jammu-for-indus-water-treaty-talks/articleshow/111211635.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Pakistani delegation arrived in Jammu on Sunday evening as part of ongoing discussions concerning the 1960 Indus Water Treaty (IWT). The team is scheduled to visit various dam sites in the region over the next few days. This visit marks is a step towards bilateral efforts to address and manage water resources shared by India and Pakistan under the treaty, which governs the use of the Indus River and its tributaries. The delegation's itinerary includes inspections of key dam projects to facilitate discussions on water management and treaty compliance.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed by then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and former Pakistan President Ayub Khan in 1960, establishes a framework for cooperation and information exchange on the use of the Indus River system. The treaty is overseen by the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), a bilateral body with commissioners from both countries tasked with implementing and managing treaty provisions, and resolving any questions, differences, or disputes that may arise.The PIC, which includes Indus Commissioners from India and Pakistan, has been a crucial platform for technical discussions and treaty compliance. Despite the treaty's framework, India and Pakistan have faced ongoing disagreements over hydroelectric projects. Pakistan has raised objections to India's construction of the Kishanganga (330 megawatts) and Ratle (850 megawatts) hydroelectric plants, arguing they violate treaty provisions. India, however, maintains that the projects are compliant with the treaty's guidelines and asserts its right to develop them.Efforts to resolve these disputes have been ongoing, with the World Bank encouraging both nations to explore alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. In 2015, Pakistan requested the appointment of a Neutral Expert to review its technical objections to India's projects but later sought arbitration in 2016. Despite five meetings of the PIC from 2017 to 2022, Pakistan has refrained from discussing the issue, complicating efforts to reach a consensus.The arrival of the Pakistani delegation signals a continued commitment to dialogue and cooperation under the Indus Waters Treaty, with the upcoming site visits expected to further discussions on water management and treaty implementation.",Pakistani delegation arrives in Jammu as part of ongoing discussions concerning Indus Water Treaty.

"Eye on China, India to help Bangladesh conserve Teesta river",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/eye-on-china-india-to-help-bangladesh-conserve-teesta-river/articleshow/111196168.cms,"Top Picks For You Hasina's visit reflects deep ties: President Droupadi Murmu

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives - spanning across areas like connectivity, health, trade, energy, defence and maritime cooperation - as PM Narendra Modi hosted his counterpart Sheikh Hasina for the first state visit after the formation of the new NDA government. Among the new initiatives was an announcement by Modi after the meeting that India will soon send a technical team to Bangladesh for management and conservation of the Teesta river inside Bangladesh.The announcement is significant as it comes amid efforts by China to convince Dhaka to allow it to develop the Teesta basin. Aware of India’s reservations about China’s role, Bangladesh has maintained it will consider “geopolitical issues” before going ahead with the project, which will apparently cost $ 1 billion.Hasina is expected to soon visit China, a country Dhaka - in a fine balancing act - continues to have strong economic ties with for its development needs. “As part of our development cooperation, we will also undertake conservation and management of Teesta River inside Bangladesh with Indian assistance within a mutually agreed timeframe,” said a joint statement, in which the leaders announced a shared vision for commerce, connectivity and collaboration.Sharing of Teesta waters has remained a long outstanding issue between the countries, after opposition from West Bengal prevented them from signing a water-sharing agreement finalised during the UPA government. India’s technical team is expected to first examine if there’s any need for a reservoir to be built, something which the Chinese have reportedly suggested. For India, it’s important that Bangladesh remains mindful of Indian security concerns while pursuing economic projects with Beijing.The leaders also welcomed formation of a Joint Technical Committee to initiate discussions for the renewal of the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty of 1996. They pledged to intensify cooperation in border management, counterterrorism and against radicalisation, while agreeing to start talks for a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA).“We have prepared a futuristic vision for cooperation in new areas. We have managed to restore in the past 10 years connectivity that was there before 1965. We will now focus on energy and digital connectivity. We will soon launch CEPA negotiations to take our economic cooperation to new heights,” said Modi.There was focus on long-term defence cooperation as well as India and Bangladesh signed an MoU for cooperation concerning military education in the field of strategic and operational studies. For modernization of the Bangladesh Armed Forces, the leaders said they will explore defence industrial cooperation, while ramping up military engagements in the form of exercises, training and capability development.The 2 countries announced signing of agreements for digital and green partnerships, as also a significant initiative by India to provide e- visa for medical patients from Bangladesh. “To facilitate easier cross-border travel and as a supportive gesture to the friendly people of Bangladesh, India will extend e-Medical Visa facility to people from Bangladesh travelling to India for medical treatment,” said the joint statement, adding India will also help Dhaka with supply of essential commodities.Other major announcements included new Assistant High Commission of India in Rangpur in Bangladesh, train service between Rajshahi and Kolkata and bus service between Chittagong and Kolkata. To promote sub-regional connectivity, government said India will extend transit facilities for movement of Bangladesh goods to Nepal and Bhutan through railway network.India is also looking at early operationalization of two Special Economic Zones (SEZs) offered by Bangladesh to India in Mongla and Mirsharai and to opening of new border-haats. The 2 countries also signed an MoU to enhance railway connectivity. The joint statement also said they will pursue collaboration in frontier technologies, including civil nuclear, oceanography and space technology. “To this end, we will partner in joint development of a small satellite for Bangladesh and its launch using Indian launch vehicle,” it said.",India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives.
