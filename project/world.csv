Biden: ‘Every reason’ to believe Bibi prolonging war for political survival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/biden-every-reason-to-believe-bibi-prolonging-war-for-political-survival/articleshow/110717963.cms,"Hamas says can’t agree to any deal unless Israel commits to permanent ceasefire, full withdrawal

‘Israeli air strikes in Syria have killed Iran general’

(With Reuters inputs)

US Prez Joe Biden , asked whether PM Benjamin Netanyahu was prolonging the war in Gaza in an effort to hold on to office, said that he believes “there is every reason for people to draw that conclusion”, lending his voice to something many in his administration have been saying privately for months.His statement came in an interview with Time magazine that was conducted May 28, three days before Biden gave a speech revealing details of what he called an “Israeli plan” to bring about an exchange of hostages and a permanent ceasefire . His decision to describe the Israeli plan in public appeared to be a clear effort to lock in Netanyahu, who didn’t publicly reveal the details and seemed to back away from some of them after Biden’s statement last Friday.Both in Jerusalem and Washington, Netanyahu is widely seen as highly aware that an end to the conflict could easily result in his being swept from office — especially once investigations began into how Israel ignored evidence of the Oct 7 attack that killed 1,200 Israelis, and how slowly Israel’s defence forces responded. Street protests against him have begun to gather momentum again, seven months after the attack. Netan yahu has made clear, both before and after the attacks, that he is against a two-state solution .Tensions between Biden and Netanyahu have been obvious for months, as the Israeli PM has refused American calls for Israel to allow far larger amounts of aid to reach Palestinians, and to come up with a plan to evacuate displaced refugees from Rafah, the current centre of military action. But Biden was careful not to criticise Netanyahu other than to agree that he was clinging to office by prolonging the war.Israeli govt spokesman David Mencer, asked about the interview, said it was “outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country” for Biden to make such comments.Meanwhile, the White Hou se said Biden believes the ceasefire deal on the table is the best chance to get hostages out of Gaza and end hostilities. The US will continue to work with Netanyahu to try to get the proposal over finish line, spokesman John Kirby said.Hamas cannot agree to any deal unless Israel makes a “clear” commitment to a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from Gaza, a senior official from the Palestinian militant group said on Tuesday. “Israel only wants one phase where it takes all its hostages, then it resumes its aggression and war on our people,” Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, told a televised press conference.Qatar, which alongside the US and Egypt has been mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, has also urged Israel to provide a clear position that has the backing of its entire govt to reach a deal.Israeli air strikes near Aleppo, Syria, in the early hours of Monday killed a general in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps who had been deployed to the country as an adviser, according to Iranian media reports. The Iranian was identified as General Saeed Abyar by Tasnim News agency, a media outlet affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards.He was believed to be the first Iranian killed by Israel since the two countries nearly went to war in April, after Israel bombed Iran’s embassy compound in Damascus, killing several commanders. Iran retaliated, attacking Israel with a barrage of 300 drones and ballistic missiles, after which Israel attacked an Iranian military base with a missile. Since then, however, the two countries stepped back from direct confrontations, facing intense global pressure to not ignite a new, wider regional war. And Iran is now enmeshed in a domestic leadership crisis, making a new wave of attacks on Israel seem unlikely. Iran has been reeling from the sudden death of Prez Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash two weeks ago.Abyar was a member of Iran’s Quds Force, a branch of the Revolutionary Guards that operates largely in other nations. He had been in Syria since 2012, when he was deployed to help the govt in Damascus fight a civil war with opposition forces and IS terrorists. The Quds Force now uses Syria as a regional headquarters for coordinating and arming militia groups known as the “axis of resistance”, including in Lebanon, Iraq and West Bank.","Hamas says can’t agree to any deal unless Israel commits to permanent ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza.

Russia bots target Paris Olympics with deepfake Tom Cruise video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russia-bots-target-paris-olympics-with-deepfake-tom-cruise-video/articleshow/110718318.cms,"With its athletes barred from competing in the Summer Olympics under the country’s flag, Russia has turned its fury on the Games and this year’s host, Paris.

Russian propagandists have created an hour-long documentary, spoofed news reports and even mimicked French and US intelligence agencies to issue fake warnings urging people to avoid the Games, according to a report released on Sunday by Microsoft. The report details the disinformation campaign created by a group the company calls Storm-1679. The campaign appears to have accelerated since March, flooding social media with short videos raising alarms about pos sible terrorist attacks and stoking fears about safety. The operation, while aimed at the Games, is using various techniques to spread disinformation that could also be employed in European and US elections.

The work began in earnest last summer with the release of a fake documentary about the International Olympic Committee, expropriating Netflix’s logo and using an artificial-intelligence-powered voice impersonating Tom Cruise . The committee succeeded in having the video titled “Olympics Has Fallen” — a spoof of the 2013 film “Olympus Has Fallen” — removed from YouTube. The attacks have continued, though, with persistent efforts to discredit its leadership, the committee said in March, citing a campaign that used fake recordings of what purported to be telephone calls by officials of the African Union on behalf of Russia.

Storm-1679 now appears to be making shorter videos that are easier to create. It used to focus on disparaging Ukrainian refugees in the West, but after French Prez Macron began to publicly consider sending French troops to Ukraine, it shifted to the Olympics. Microsoft estimates that Storm-1679 produces three to eight faked videos a week, in English and French, with many impersonating the BBC, Al Jazeera and other broadcasters. The group appears to respond quickly to news events, su ch as protests in New Caledonia, a French territory in the Pacific. Others focus on the prospect of a terror attack in Paris.

Most of the videos pretending to be from CIA and French intelligence are relatively simple. They are unlike anything CIA has actually produced, but to unsuspecting readers online, they could appear legitimate, using the agency’s logo and stark white-on-black typography. “They are trying to cultivate an anticipation of violence,” Clint Watts of Microsoft, said of the group Storm-1679. “They want people to be fearful of going to the Olympics.” French officials and Microsoft say one of the group’s tactics appears to be trying to get the attention of factcheckers. “The content doesn’t normally travel from one platform to another, but when their false content is fact-checked by accounts with a large following, the content gets far more views and in front of new and different audiences,” Watts said","Russian propagandists have created an hour-long documentary, spoofed news reports and even mimicked French and US intelligence agencies.

Aus military to recruit non-citizens in a bid to boost troop numbers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/aus-military-to-recruit-non-citizens-in-a-bid-to-boost-troop-numbers/articleshow/110718226.cms,"MELBOURNE: The Australian military will begin recruiting some non-citizens in a bid to boost troop numbers , the govt said Tuesday. Only people from other members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partnership who hold Australian permanent residency will be eligible.

The move is part of a push to build a military that can resist foreign coercion through blocked trade routes in the future, defence minister Richard Marles said. Marles, who is also deputy PM, said the change was a major step toward addressing a 4,400-person shortfall in the Australian Defence Force , whose target strength is 63,600 fulltime personnel.

The govt intends to increase that number to 80,000 by 2040. Relatively low unemployment is one of the factors working against the Australian military attracting and retaining personnel.

Australia is particularly reliant on open sea and air routes as an island nation that trades with the world and is therefore suspectable to coercion from foreign militaries, Marles said. “We are not trying to make ourselves a peer of the US or of China,” Marles told delegates at a securi ty conference. “That’s not a credible thing to propose.” “In a far less certain world, do we have an ability to be able to resist coercion of any adversary and to make our way?” he added.

The return of the populist politician, a key player in Britain’s 2016 decision to leave the EU, is a major headache for Sunak’s party, which already trails Labour in opinion polls.

The uploads also included pictures of Pakistan’s current civilian and military leaderships and alleged they stole the mandate of the Imran-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in general elections this Feb.“Every Pakistani should study the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and get to know who was the true traitor, General Yahya Khan or Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” said a quote attributed to Imran.The commission had probed Pakistan’s political-military involvement in East-Pakistan --- current-day Bangladesh --- from 1947 to 1971. The video referred to purported crimes by the Pakistani military during the civil war in East Pakistan and claimed former military dictator General Yahya was responsible.Strong backlash followed the posts, especially from government ranks who called it “alarming” and accused PTI of fuelling a narrative of “hatred and incitement” by drawing comparisons between Imran and Mujib.On Friday, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials visited the prison where Imran has been kept to quiz him over the post but he refused to meet them without lawyers. FIA has sent a notice to Imran on the matter.This was followed by a meeting of army commanders, which vowed to defeat what it termed “digital terrorism” by trying to induce despondency and sowing discord by peddling “blatant lies, fake news, and propaganda”. “The nation is fully cognisant of their ugly and ulterior motives and the designs of these nefarious forces,” General Munir was quoted army’s media wing as saying.Imran’s PTI had until recently been trying to disassociate itself from the controversial posts but “owned” them on his directions. A meeting of PTI’s core committee was held on Friday. “Hamoodur Rehman Commission Report must be made public to avoid 1971 like grave challenges, learn a lesson from the past and apprise the people about what exactly happened in 1971,” PTI said in a statement after the meeting.The statement then sought to draw a parallel between 1970 and the current situation in Pakistan. “In 1971 debacle, the most important aspect was rejection of the people’s mandate, which is also presently prevailing in the country,” PTI said.",The posts were uploaded by Imran’s social media team last week on his X account.

"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down huge global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities.

NEW DELHI: Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota , near Madison. This significant find includes a canoe dating back to 2500 BC. The Wisconsin Historical Society revealed the discovery on May 23, noting that the initial two canoes were found in 2021 and 2022.Dr Amy Rosebrough, State Archaeologist for the Wisconsin Historical Society, explained the importance of this find, saying, ""The Indigenous peoples of Wisconsin and the wider United States fished, traveled, and traded extensively on inland lakes and streams, and until now we have not had a clear look at the canoes used in the Great Lakes region."" She likened the discovery to understanding life in the Midwest without ever seeing a real pickup truck, emphasizing the crucial role canoes played in transportation and trade.Radiocarbon dating revealed that the oldest canoe dates back to 2500 BC, contemporary with the construction of Stonehenge, and much earlier than the founding of Ancient Rome or the birth of Jesus Christ. The youngest canoe dates to 1250 AD.Not all canoes will be removed from the lake due to their fragility. Rosebrough mentioned that divers also found stone tools in the water, suggesting the presence of an ancient village site, which has yet to be located. ""Even without finding the village, the discovery of these canoes and the tools found within the first canoe reminds us that people have lived and worked alongside the lake for thousands of years,"" she added.Efforts are ongoing to explore the lake further, using non-destructive remote sensing techniques to uncover more about this prehistoric site. Rosebrough highlighted the unique archaeological potential of smaller bodies of water like Lake Mendota, which often receive less funding than the Great Lakes but hold distinct historical significance.The Wisconsin Historical Society, in partnership with Native Nations in Wisconsin, aims to uncover and share the rich history of these discoveries at the new Wisconsin History Center, set to open in early 2027.","Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota.

Biden: Netanyahu could be prolonging Gaza war for political aims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-netanyahu-could-be-prolonging-gaza-war-for-political-aims/articleshow/110710343.cms,"US President Joe Biden , in an interview with Time magazine, suggested that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might be prolonging the war in Gaza for political reasons. The US president's comments came just before he outlined a proposal for a ceasefire in the region, as Netanyahu grapples with deep political divisions within his country.When asked if he believed Netanyahu was extending the war for his own political gain, Biden responded, ""There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion."" He also expressed uncertainty about whether Israeli forces had committed war crimes in Gaza, rejecting claims that Israel was using starvation as a warfare tactic, but stating, ""I think they've engaged in activity that is inappropriate.""The Israeli government spokesperson, David Mencer, criticized Biden's remarks about Netanyahu, calling them ""outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country."" Last month, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor in The Hague requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his defense chief, and three Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes.Israel launched an offensive in Gaza last October, vowing to destroy the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas after it attacked inside Israel, resulting in the deaths of around 1,200 people and the capture of more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. The Israeli assault has claimed the lives of over 36,000 people in Gaza, as reported by local health authorities, who also state that thousands more bodies remain buried under rubble.Despite most Israelis supporting the war, opinion polls indicate that they hold Netanyahu responsible for the security failures during the Hamas attack on Israeli communities near Gaza on October 7. The polls also suggest that if an election were held, Netanyahu would be voted out of office. Weekly mass street protests, attended by tens of thousands, have become commonplace, with demonstrators demanding that the government do more to bring home the hostages seized by Hamas and calling for Netanyahu's resignation.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Joe Biden suggested that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might be prolonging the war in Gaza for political reasons.

Meet the other Nitish Kumar who loves switching teams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-the-other-nitish-kumar-who-loves-switching-teams/articleshow/110708535.cms,"After switching alliances for the umpteenth time and flipping to the NDA before the 2024 Lok Sabha Election , Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar , while sharing a dais with PM Narendra Modi, had promised that he won’t switch alliances again. Given how close the 2024 Lok Sabha General Elections Results turned ou t, the BJP will hope that Nitish Kumar doesn’t have another change of heart. Most pollsters suggested that the NDA would be in the 370-400 mark, but it will probably turn out close to 295. That will make the seats held by allies like JD(U) and TDP become extremely crucial. While the Bihar Chief Minister’s desire to switch teams is well-known, there he has a namesake who also exhibits a similar tendency.Born in Scarborough, Ontario in 1994, Nitish Kumar is an all-rounder who played almost all of Canada’s matches in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup qualifiers. He holds the record for being the youngest player to debut for Canada in a first-class match when he played in the ICC Intercontinental Cup Fixture against Kenya in August 2009. He is also the second-youngest ODI player (15 years and 273 days), only bettered by Pakistan’s Hasan Raza. Kumar later swapped colours and started representing the US national team. In this year’s T20 World Cup , he is representing the USA.Incidentally, Nitish Kumar’s middle name is Roenick, a tribute to National Hockey League star Jeremy Roenick. Incidentally, Kumar played for Canada in the 2011 World Cup when here became the tournament’s youngest player. Kumar even captained Canada and last played for the team 2019. He recently made his debut for the US national side and is part of the T20 World Cup squad being held in US soil.

"CFO of Trump-loving The Epoch Times arrested, charged with money laundering and bank fraud",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cfo-of-trump-loving-the-epoch-times-arrested-charged-with-money-laundering-and-bank-fraud/articleshow/110689900.cms,"What is the Epoch Times?

A top executive at a right-wing media company has been arrested and charged with laundering at least $67million in stolen money. Weidong Guan , a top executive at The Epoch Times was indicted by a federal grand jury, one count of money laundering and two counts of bank fraud .A report in The New York Times claims that Guan lied to a financial institution through the source of the cash, some of which was pilfered through fake unemployment benefits. According to the Justice Department, the money boosted The Epoch Times’ revenue by 400% in just one year.Guan, it’s Chief Financial Officer, was arrested on Monday and pleaded not guilty. Guan faces 20 years in prison for the money-laundering charge and 30 years for each count of bank fraud.The Epoch Times is associated with Falun Gong , a spiritual movement in China. For years, the outlet solely focussed on criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, but more recently it became a prominent supporter of Donald Trump and his right-wing allies.Prosecutors claim that Guan ran a “sprawling, translational scheme” over four years to buy prepaid debit cards on the internet at a discounting using cryptocurrency and then deposited the cards’ money into both personal and company accounts. Prosecutors said that some of the money, loaded on the debit cards, was illegally obtained. Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York said the charges represented the government’s “commitment to vigorously enforcing the laws against those who facilitate fraud through money laundering and to protecting the integrity of the U.S. financial system”.Guan of Secaucus of New Jersey was in custody and faces a $3 million bail package, including a $250,000 cash deposit. He will have to remain in home detention. Meanwhile, the Epoch Times said that it will fully cooperate with the investigation dealing with the allegations against Guan.The Epoch Times was founded in 2000 in Georgia by current CEO, John Tang, then a Georgia Tech graduate student and a follower of Falun Gong. During the 2016 election, they embraced Donald Trump, and became enthusiastic supporters after Trump’s victory.Along with a newspaper, The Epoch Times runs a digital news site, produces podcasts and also operates the broadcaster New Tang Dynasty Television, better known as NTD.Its critics have accused it of spreading right-wing conspiracy theories and in 2019, Facebook banned the company on advertising on the platform after it was found to be obscuring its ad purchases in violations of transparency requirements. The Epoch Times also claims it’s the fourth-largest newspaper in the US, but since it doesn’t participate in industry audits, there’s no way to verify this claim.The money-laundering scheme started in 2020. The total revenue increased to $71million from $15million. The following year it jumped to $121million. While Guan attributed the financial results to growth in paid subscribers and donations from supporters even telling a member of Congress that the subscriptions accounted for the company’s growth.However, the money actually came from a criminal scheme involving an overseas-based team called Make Money Online. Even when pressed by banks or other trading platforms, Guan claimed they were donations from supporters. Guan also deposited $16.7 million of the proceeds into his personal accounts, income that he didn’t report.","The Epoch Times is associated with Falun Gong, a spiritual movement in China.

Was missing crypto-scam queen Ruja Ignatova murdered by a Bulgarian drug lord? New investigation tries to shed light on her disappearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/was-missing-crypto-scam-queen-ruja-ignatova-murdered-by-a-bulgarian-drug-lord-new-investigation-tries-to-shed-light-on-her-disappearance/articleshow/110672742.cms,"One conspiracy theory that has intrigued enthusiasts around the world for generations is the DB Cooper Escape. For those who don’t know, DB Cooper was the media moniker given to a man who demanded $200,000 in ransom and then opened the aircraft’s door and parachuted into the night over southwestern Washington, US. Despite numerous suspects and a manhunt for years by the FBI, DB Cooper’s body or whereabouts were never ascertained. It was never discovered whether DB Cooper lived or died, or who was the mysterious gentleman who disappeared into the night. The DB Cooper case took place in 1968 but like Cooper, there was another extraordinary criminal who simply disappeared into thin air: Ruja Ignatova .Ruja Ignatova made billions with a fraudulent crypto-currency before she suddenly vanished in 2017. A new BBC investigation tries to find out if she was murdered or just diseappeared. Ruja Ignatova was born in Bulgaria and raised in Germany, ostensibly pursuing a successful career in finance before being charged with financial fraud in Germany in 2012.She later returned with OneCoin , a fraudulent, non-existent crypto currency that was pegged as a Bitcoin killer. Between August 2014 and March 2017, people from across the globe, from Brazil to Yemen, invested in OneCoin. An FBI estimate puts the total amount invested at $4.5 billion.Millions donated before they realised that OneCoin wasn’t a cryptocurrency, doesn’t even have a blockchain and wasn’t a currency that could be used anywhere. FBI says OneCoin claimed to have a “private blockchain”. Actually, it when OneCoin users logged in to check their wallets, they’d simply see random numbers on a screen.In early 2019, she was charged by US authorities for wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering. She was added to FBI's 10 Most Wanted in June 2022.In 2017, as investigators from Germany and the US closed in, Ignatova took an early morning Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens and was never seen again. Most of her alleged collaborators were arrested including OneCoin’s co-founder Sebastian Greenwood. He was detained in Thailand in 2018 and extradited to the US. Meanwhile, Ignatova’s younger brother Konstantin Ignatov was arrested in March 2019 in Los Angeles. He pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering charges. Mark Scott, a former corporate lawyer was convicted in 2019 for laundering $400milion for the group. But Ignatova’s remained elusive.However, a recent BBC investigation claims that that a top mafia figure in Bulgaria, a business associate who was kept her safe might have been responsible for her murder. His name is Hristoforos Nikos Amanatidis, better known as Taki , who has a El Chapo-like image in his native Bulgaria.Over the years, Taki has been accused of numerous crimes including armed robbery, drug smuggling, and murder, but was never prosecuted in Bulgaria.Former Bulgarian Deputy Minister Ivan Hristanov said in 2022: “Taki is the ghost. You'll never see him. You only hear about him. He's talking to you through other people. If you don't listen, you just disappear from earth. The only person who can protect her from all those investigations, including from foreign agencies - it was Taki.”Taki, it’s believed now lives in Dubai, where Ignatova has a luxury penthouse and where her bank accounts received millions from the OneCoin fraud. Sources claim the two were close and Taki was even the godfather to Ignatova’s daughter. Frank Schneider, a former adviser to Ruja Ignatova, claimed his old boss was working with “gangsters”.A few months after talking to BBC, Schneider also disappeared. Meanwhile, document found at the home of murdered Bulgarian officer by Bulgarian journalist Dimitar Stoyanov of BIRD, an investigative website stated that a police informant had overheard Taki’s brother-in-law say that Taki had murdered, dismembered and dumped Ignatov off a yacht in the Ionian sea.Kuro, another associate of Taki was found assassinated in his Cape Town home in May 2023.Stoyanov, who was forced to leave Bulgaria after getting death threats, says property records show that Ignatova’s properties are now used by Taki and his associates in Bulgaria. However, Taki has never been arrested over the claims, Ignatova’s body was never discovered, and investigators don’t believe there’s enough to prosecute him.Only time will tell if Ignatova was murdered, whether she disappeared or it might not, and we might never learn her fate. Just like we never found out about DB Cooper.","Ruja Ignatova made billions with a fraudulent crypto-currency before she suddenly vanished in 2017.

"Biden takes a big swing at hostage-for-truce deal, puts onus on Israeli, Hamas officials to step up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-takes-a-big-swing-at-hostage-for-truce-deal-puts-onus-on-israeli-hamas-officials-to-step-up/articleshow/110684865.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is looking past resistance from key Israeli officials as he presses Israel and Hamas to agree to a three-phase agreement that could immediately bring home dozens of Israeli hostages, free Palestinian prisoners and perhaps even lead to an endgame in the nearly eight-month-old Gaza war.Biden's big swing - during a tough reelection battle - could also demonstrate to a significant slice of his political base demoralized by his handling of the conflict that he's doing his part to end the war that has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and left hundreds of thousands struggling to meet basic needs.White House officials on Monday said Biden's decision to make public what it describes as an Israeli proposal - just one day after it was delivered to Hamas - was driven by a desire to put Hamas on the spot. The move diverged from the US administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.""The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome,"" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.Almost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal - which includes a cease-fire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.Netanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain ""gaps"" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis ""reserve the right to return to war.""Kirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he ""expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.""""This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,"" Kirby said. ""This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.""But even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition - National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich - have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.Smotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is ""the only language understood in the Middle East.""Netanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages - officials say about 80 people captured by militants i n the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others - to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.Even as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.""They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,"" Sullivan said in an appearance at the US Global Leadership Conference in Washington.To that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was ""the best possible opportunity for an agreement,"" the White House said.Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US envoy to the United Nations, said the US circulated a draft resolution seeking support for the proposal from the 14 other members of the U.N. Security Council.Sullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.Group of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.""We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,"" the G7 leaders said in a statement.Biden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.The first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.The Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.Hamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one - and the six-week pause in fighting - would bring about a ""downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.""""I'm not sure they can expect much more,"" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.""Indeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.Just last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.But with Election Day in the US now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.",White House officials say Biden's decision to make public what it describes as an Israeli proposal was driven by a desire to put Hamas on the spot.

White bike installations pop up across New York as reminder of road safety,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-bike-installations-pop-up-across-new-york-as-reminder-of-road-safety/articleshow/110684638.cms,"On a chilly Saturday evening in April, Kevin Daloia took a bicycle that he had painted white and locked it to a pole on East 161st Street and Melrose Avenue in the Bronx. Then he climbed up, stood on the seat of the bike and mounted a metal sign on the pole above it. “Cyclist Killed Here/Rest In Peace,” the sign said.The cyclist , Thierno Balde, was hit by a car on Feb 23 while on his way home from prayers at his mosque. The driver fled after the crash and then ditched a crumpled Jeep Grand Cherokee a few blocks away, according to repo rts. The police said Balde had run a red light. But the authorities also said the driver had been speeding. Daloia didn’t know Balde, but that didn’t matter.In his free time, Daloia volunteers to paint old bicycles and fasten them to poles as “ghost bikes” for the New York City Street Memorial Project, which consists of installations around the city marking locations where cyclists have died. The bikes — completely white, including tires, spokes and pedals — serve as stark memorials, both an alert to passers-by that a cyclist was killed and a re minder of the dangerous conditions cyclists face in New York. The activistshope to catch the attention of drivers as well.Daloia isn’t sure how many, exactly, he has erected. “I’ve done this for a long time,” he said. “Anything in the Bronx I’ve touched, and I’ve touched a lot more throughout the city. I don’t know the number, man. Probably 20, 25?” Last year was the deadliest for cyclists in New York since 1999. Thirty cyclists were killed in 2023, according to the city’s department of transportation. Of those, 23 were riding e-bikes. Most fatalities oc curred in collisions with cars and trucks — on streets that did not have dedicated bike lanes.In New York, a group of artists called Visual Resistance first put up ghost bikes in 2005 in response to a couple of cyclist deaths. “It was supposed to speak more powerfully than words,” said Leah Todd, another volunteer. “A silent but very communicative memorial.” The idea caught on and continues to gain momentum. “We had some grand idea and hope that people would want to care — and want to limit these deaths.”Ghost bike volunteers recei ve donated bicycles from bike shops, friends or word of mouth. They remove a few essential parts from each bike, rendering it un-ridable and therefore less likely to be stolen. Although cyclist fatalities are usually caused by car crashes, the volunteers who install ghost bikes are not necessarily anti-car. Daloia describes himself as “a cycling traffic safety advocate who starts his car every day”. He believes cars, people and bicycles should be able to coexist peacefully. “I want some of the roads around here to be safer for pedestrians and cyclists.”","Last year was the deadliest for cyclists in New York since 1999.

The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public. Other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue. Senior White House officials have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout.Biden has been deliberating for months to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed at the behest of Republicans, who defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico .","President Joe Biden is preparing to sign off on an executive order that would shut down asylum requests to the US-Mexico border.

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California. First Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden’s wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before US district Judge Maryellen Noreika. “Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,” Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House.Hunter’s trial gives Republicans a chance to shift atten-tion away from Trump’s legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.In the case brought by US special counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last Sept Hunter was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in Oct 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges. If convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter faces up to 25 years in jail, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the justice department.Noreika began screening potential jurors for their ability to commit to serving length of the trial, likely to run through end of next week.","Hunter Biden, 54, arrived at the courthouse for the first trial of the child of a sitting president.

Building trust

Financial manipulation

In a heartbreaking story, a 75-year-old professional from the American Midwest fell victim to an online scam known as ""pig butchering."" The ordeal began with an innocent LinkedIn message. The scammer, posing as a wealthy young Chinese woman, praised the man’s professional achievements and suggested moving their conversation to WhatsApp for more privacy. This marked the beginning of a sophisticated fraud known as "" pig butchering ,"" where scammers build a romantic rapport with their victims to gain their trust and access their finances.The scammers often masquerade as beautiful young women with abundant wealth and few worries, convincing their victims that they share a special, clandestine bond. In reality, they are frequently men contacting their targets from dystopian compounds operated by Chinese criminal syndicates in parts of Southeast Asia and West Africa. These ""scam dens"" are notorious for abuse. Many scammers are trafficked in, given scripts and smartphones preloaded with fake profiles, and coerced into committing fraud under threat of violence.As per a Wall Street Journal report, the scammer, who introduced herself as Violaine Chen , claimed to be a successful gold futures trader living in San Francisco. She shared pictures of a luxurious lifestyle and engaged the victim in daily conversations about her meals, workouts, and charitable activities. The victim, captivated by her seemingly genuine personality and shared interests, began to trust her implicitly.“She hooked me,” the victim said, reflecting on how deeply he was drawn into the scam.As their relationship deepened, Violaine introduced the idea of investing together on a trading platform called FX6, which she claimed was owned by her uncle. She guided the man through the process of setting up an account on a related app called Fuex and convinced him to make his first deposit of $1,500. The two began to plan a romantic future together, discussing a road trip in an RV and the possibility of the man retiring early.Despite red flags, such as warnings from his bank and the occasional strange message from Violaine, the man continued to invest more money at her urging. He sold stocks and mutual funds, ultimately depositing over $300,000 into the Fuex account. The app appeared to show their combined investments growing to nearly $1.5 million, the WSJ report said.However, when the man attempted to withdraw funds for a down payment on a house Violaine's uncle wanted them to buy, his request was blocked. Fuex customer service agents, who were actually part of the scam, informed him that his account was frozen and demanded additional fees to release his funds. Desperate, the man paid the fees using his remaining investments, a bank loan, and a home-equity loan.In the end, the man had lost $716,212 and was left with no money, no family, and no soul mate. Violaine blamed him for the situation and eventually stopped responding to most of his messages. The man reported the crime to the FBI but has had no luck tracing where his money has gone. He continues to try accessing his locked Fuex account every day, hoping for a resolution that may never come, the WSJ report said.He continues to grapple with the emotional and financial fallout of the scam, hoping his story will raise awareness and prevent others from falling prey to similar schemes.“Please answer me. I need to know what’s going on here,” he pleaded in one of his last messages to Violaine, a woman he now understands never truly existed.","A 75-year-old professional from the American Midwest fell victim to an online scam known as ""pig butchering"" The scammer, posing as a wealthy young Chinese woman, praised the man’s professional achievements and suggested moving their conversation to WhatsApp for more privacy.

'Vicious' atmosphere

LONDON: Stormy Daniels , the adult film actor, broke her silence after former US president Donald Trump 's conviction to say he should be jailed, in an interview published in British tabloid The Mirror at the weekend.""I think he should be sentenced to jail and some community service working for the less fortunate, or being the volunteer punching bag at a women's shelter,"" Daniels said in the interview, published late on Saturday.A jury of 12 New Yorkers on Thursday found Trump guilty on 34 counts of business fraud for trying to cover up hush money payments to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election .Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid $130,000 to keep silent and prevent scandal from breaking ahead of the election, in which Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton After years of exchanging insults with Trump on social media, Daniels now says she finally has been ""vindicated"", although she was ""shocked"" at how quickly the jury made a decision -- one that made Trump the first ever former US president to be convicted of a crime.Daniels also accused the White House hopeful of being ""completely and utterly out of touch with reality"" and compared him to a child at one point in the interview.The former adult film actor and director helped bring Trump down in court with her gripping testimony, which included graphic descriptions of what she says was a casual sexual encounter in 2006.""Being in court was so intimidating with the jurors looking at you,"" she said in the Mirror interview, adding that she was glad it was proved that she had been ""telling the truth the entire time"".""It's not over for me. It's never going to be over for me. Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy.""The 45-year-old had remained uncharacteristically quiet in the days following the Thursday conviction.Daniels's husband Barrett Blade had previously told CNN that she was ""still processing"" the trial. He suggested that she could be threatened by Trump 's supporters.""You know, all the MAGA idiots are going to be coming after her,"" Blade said, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again movement.Daniels also said she would never escape death threats from Trump's supporters, the Mirror reported.""It's so vicious and threatening... from the standpoint of just the fear of what somebody might do,"" Daniels's lawyer Clark Brewster said of the atmosphere around the trial in an interview with a local ABC News channel.Daniels is a self-made woman who rose from a difficult childhood and through the challenging world of adult movies to become a successful businesswoman.But in a recent documentary, she revealed that behind her outwardly tough, humorous persona on social media, she has been hurt by the constant insults from Trump and his supporters.""Back in 2018 that was stuff like 'liar', 'slut', 'gold digger',"" she said in the film, ""Stormy"".""This time around, it is very different. It is direct threats, it is, 'I'm going to come to your house and slit your throat', 'your daughter should be euthanised'.""The trial and its revelations have added to tensions in the already bitterly divided country.On Friday, Trump launched into a stream of insults and non-factual claims, lashing out that the trial and the judge who presided over it.His campaign on Friday said that it had raised nearly $53 million in online donations after the conviction, boasting that the verdict had boosted his support ""like never before"".Trump is due for sentencing on July 11 but is expected to appeal the verdict. He potentially faces a prison sentence but is much more likely to receive probation.","Stormy Daniels says former US president Donald Trump should be jailed.

Oil producers led by Saudis extended supply cuts amid slack prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/oil-producers-led-by-saudis-extended-supply-cuts-amid-slack-prices/articleshow/110644871.cms,"FRANKFURT: Saudi Arabia and allied oil producing countries on Sunday extended output cuts through next year, a move aimed at supporting slack prices that haven't risen even amid turmoil in the middle east and the start of the summer travel season.The Opec+ alliance, made up of members of the producers cartel and allied countries including Russia, extended three different sets of cuts totaling 5.8 million barrels a day.International benchmark Brent has loitered in the $81-$83 per barrel range for the past month. Even the war in Gaza and attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels in Yemen have not pushed prices up toward the $100 per barrel level last seen in September 2022. Reasons include higher interest rates, concerns about demand due to slower than desired economic growth in Europe and China, and rising non-Opec supply including from US shale producers,Yet the Saudis need higher oil prices to fund ambitious plans by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the country's economy away from fossil fuel exports. Higher oil prices would also help Russia maintain economic growth and stability as it spends heavily on its war against Ukraine.Analysts say the cuts could push oil prices higher in coming months, but much depends on demand for oil going forward. The summer usually sees a spike in demand through the July-September quarter, but uncertainty about demand grows after that.US motorists have benefitted from weaker oil prices. Gasoline prices have been quiescent recently, averaging $3.56 per gallon last week, a penny less than a year ago. That is down from a record national average high of $5 per gallon in June 2022. US prices can vary by region and Western states have been paying more, with gas hitting an average $5.05 per gallon in California.US gas prices rise along with crude because the price of oil makes up half the cost of a gallon of gasoline. The price swings are much smaller in Europe because there taxes make up a bigger proportion of the price of fuel.The cuts that are being extended break down as follows: 2 billion barrels a day agreed among all 23 Opec+ members were extended through the end of 2025, according to an Opec statement.Then, voluntary reductions of 1.65 million barrels a day by a smaller group of members was extended until end 2025 as well, according to a report on the official Saudi Press Agency.And another 2.2 million barrels a day in voluntary cuts, due to expire at the end of this month, were extended until September but would then be gradually reduced month by month until they are eliminated by September 2025.","International benchmark Brent has loitered in the $81-$83 per barrel range for the past month.

An Islamabad HC division bench, comprising justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, delivered a short verdict, accepting their appeals against the convictions.“The state had badly failed in proving its case and even its prosecutors had abandoned the case. Hats off to the honourable judges. It was a case of first impression. Imran and Qureshi did not do any anti-state activity,” remarked Imran’s counsel Salman Safdar following the verdict.Despite the acquittal, Khan will remain imprisoned to serve his sentence in the “iddat” case, related to his alleged unlawful marriage to Bushra Bibi, his third wife. Both are serving seven-year jail terms after a trial court ruled that their 2018 marriage broke the law by not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called “Iddat”, after Bibi divorced her previous husband.Qureshi remains on physical remand until June 5, accused of inciting violence on May 9 last year when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters stormed military and civilian govt assets following Imran’s arrest.The 71-year-old former cricket star has faced a series of political and legal challenges since being ousted as PM in April 2022 after losing a confidence vote in parliament. A special court, constituted under Official Secrets Act, 1923, had convicted the two PTI politicians for sharing classified communication between Washington and Islamabad, which Khan claimed was part of a US conspiracy to overthrow his govt in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Washington and Pakistan’s military dismissed the allegation.Khan’s conviction in the cipher case was one of three charges against him leading up to the Feb 8 elections this year, which he alleged were orchestrated to prevent his return to office. Last year, the same court overturned his conviction in a corruption case involving the unlawful sale of state gifts during his term from 2018 to 2022. The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes — the most expensive being $304,000.","Former PM Imran Khan and ex-foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi were serving 10-year sentences after being convicted of leaking state secrets.

NEW DELHI: A Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country. His statements were made in the case of poet and journalist Ahmed Farhad Shah, who the lawyer said cannot be brought to the federal capital for court proceedings from PoJK, as he was in 'foreign territory' that does not come under the country's jurisdiction.During the session, additional attorney general Munawar Iqbal Duggal said that Farhad faced charges in PoK and was in custody until June 2. Duggal mentioned that Farhad's family had met him, suggesting that the habeas corpus petition should be dismissed.Presiding over the proceedings, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani considered the plea filed by Arooj Zainab, Farhad's spouse, as reported by Dunya News.Petitioner's counsel Imaan Mazari emphasised that her client sought not only her husband's return but also action against those responsible for his enforced disappearance.The HC emphasised that the case would only conclude upon Farhad's appearance in court.AAG Duggal argued that PoJK, with its own constitution and courts, was considered foreign territory. Judgments from Pakistani courts were treated akin to those from foreign courts, as per Dunya News.The petitioner's attorney informed the court that Farhad's family had traveled from Islamabad to the Dhirkot police station but were told upon arrival that he had been moved to Muzaffarabad due to terrorism-related charges. When questioned about Farhad's whereabouts before his May 29 detention, the Islamabad prosecutor general deferred to the PoK court.Justice Kayani remarked that everyone should work within the law, to which the prosecutor general maintained that he works within the law, reported Dunya News.""We have to determine the misuse of law,"" Kayani said to the petitioner's attorney's argument that the court should also consider cases involving the misuse of laws and procedures.The court adjourned the hearing of the case until June 7, rejecting the request to dispose of the petition for the recovery of poet Ahmed Farhad.","Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan- Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country. His statements were made in the case of poet and journalist Ahmed Farhad Shah, who the lawyer said cannot be brought to the federal capital for court proceedings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110613634,imgsize-546683,width-400,resizemode-4/110613634.jpg"

"Improving energy resilience in Pakistan could avert 175,000 deaths by 2030, UNICEF says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/improving-energy-resilience-in-pakistan-could-avert-175000-deaths-by-2030-unicef-says/articleshow/110597885.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A new study by the United Nations children’s agency says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.UNICEF said improved energy resilience would also contribute $296 million to the country’s fragile economy over the next 20 years by reducing maternal, adult and infant mortality.The study, conducted by UNICEF’s Economist Impact Unit and released Friday, comes as Pakistan is experiencing an intense heatwave that has sickened thousands of people, further burdening the country's health care system.Temperatures in various parts of Pakistan soared as high as 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday. Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said. ""We need the private sector to play a bigger role as public sector resources will not be enough. This is everybody’s business.”","UNICEF says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.
