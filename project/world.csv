A source aboard the flight said that while Lula remained calm, he was concerned throughout the ordeal for the people onboard.The plane encountered a technical problem shortly after departing from Mexico City, prompting a return to the airport, where Lula planned to board another plane later that day to continue his journey to Brasília.Lieutenant Brigadier Marcelo Kanitz in a statement said that the “security procedures for the problem” were performed successfully, but pilots must “wait for the necessary fuel consumption so the airplane returns to the same airport it took off from.”Lula would switch to another aircraft for his return to Brazil, Kanitz added.According to the Brazilian air force's statement, the Airbus A319 was still in the airspace above Mexico City on Tuesday afternoon. FlightAware, a flight tracking website, displayed a Brazilian air force Airbus A319, presumably carrying Lula, circling repeatedly over Felipe Angeles airport in the vicinity of Mexico City.Lula was en route back to Brazil after attending the inauguration of Mexico's new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, when an issue arose shortly after takeoff. He arrived in Mexico on Monday and held a meeting with outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador .In a separate incident in January, an airplane carrying Lula's security personnel experienced technical difficulties during a trip to the northeastern Brazilian state of Paraiba, preventing the plane from taking off.

US Senator and the vice presidential running mate for Republican Donald Trump JD Vance, faced off against Minnesota governor Tim Walz, the Democratic choice of Kamala Harris , in a high stakes debate on Tuesday. With the November 5 election approaching, this debate may mark the final opportunity for both candidates to address voters directly.Here are the key takeaways from the event:The debate commenced with a question regarding the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, specifically whether either candidate would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran to thwart its nuclear ambitions.Both candidates exhibited reluctance to directly address the issue.A visibly nervous Walz sidestepped the question, redirecting the focus to a critique of Trump’s presidency. ""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" he said, highlighting that Trump's age and recent debate performance suggested he was unfit for the moment.Vance, in response, seemed to mock Walz's avoidance but later discussed his own background before eventually stating that a second Trump administration would support Israel’s decisions regarding Iran. He defended Trump's foreign policy, characterising it as a period of unprecedented peace, deterrence and stability.Both candidates faced scrutiny over previous statements that questioned their credibility. For Walz, the challenge came from reports revealing he was not in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square uprising, despite previously claiming he was there. His meandering response included a confession of his imperfections: “I’ve not been perfect, and I’m a knucklehead at times.” When pressed further, he admitted, “I got there that summer and misspoke on this.”Vance, meanwhile, was confronted about his prior criticisms of Trump, including comparing him to Adolf Hitler. Acknowledging his past mistakes, he stated, “I was wrong about Donald Trump,” and noted that Trump had delivered on many issues he previously doubted.Throughout the debate, both Vance and Walz chose to direct their criticisms more towards their running mates than each other. This tactic underscored a strategic approach: most voters typically focus their attention on the presidential candidates rather than their vice presidential picks.Walz criticised Trump for failing to fulfill his promise of constructing a complete barrier along the US-Mexico border, claiming, “Less than 2% of that wall got built, and Mexico didn’t pay a dime.” Vance, echoing this focus, suggested that Walz was more interested in solutions than Harris, stating, “I think that you want to solve this problem, but I don’t think that Kamala Harris does.”In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, both candidates tackled the subject of climate change with a focus on domestic issues. Vance linked climate change to jobs and manufacturing, suggesting that increasing domestic production would be the best way to combat it, while sidestepping Trump’s previous dismissal of global warming as a “hoax.” He positioned the US as having the world’s cleanest energy economy.Walz, in a similarly domestic-oriented response, highlighted the Biden administration’s renewable energy investments and the record production levels of oil and natural gas, saying, “You can see us becoming an energy superpower in the future.” His perspective presented an optimistic outlook on a daunting global challenge.Both candidates acknowledged the issue of illegal immigration but placed the blame for the current stalemate squarely on their opponents. Vance echoed Trump's rhetoric by labeling Harris the “border czar” and claimed she had rolled back Trump’s immigration restrictions, resulting in negative consequences such as an influx of fentanyl and increased housing costs.While Harris was never officially designated as the ""border czar,"" she was tasked by Biden to address the root causes of migration. In contrast, Walz argued that Trump had single-handedly derailed a bipartisan Senate effort to enhance border security and improve immigration processing. He noted that Republican backing for the deal diminished after Trump criticized it as inadequate.","JD Vance, the vice presidential running mate for Republican Donald Trump, faced off against Minnesota governor Tim Walz, the Democratic choice of Kamala Harris.

Minnesota governor and Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz found himself in hot water at the debate with JD Vance on Tuesday after responding to questions regarding his claims about being in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989—claims that have come under fire for being inaccurate.Walz has previously asserted that he was present in Hong Kong during the pro-democracy demonstrations that culminated in the violent crackdown on June 4, 1989.However, recent news reports contradict this narrative, indicating that he was in Nebraska at the time and only departed for China to teach high school in August of that year.When pressed about these discrepancies, Walz admitted that he had ""misspoken"" and referred to himself as ""a knucklehead at times."" He acknowledged the mix-up, saying, “I can get caught up in the rhetoric.”In response to a report revealing that he was not in China during the infamous crackdown, Walz insisted, “I got there that summer and misspoke on this. So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, and from that I learned a lot about what it means to be in governance.”A CNN report shared a 2019 radio interview where Walz claimed to have been in Hong Kong on the day of the massacre, despite evidence suggesting he was still in Nebraska at that time.The Tiananmen Square protests were a pivotal moment in China's history, with thousands of pro-democracy students gathering for seven weeks in Beijing. The protests ended tragically when the Chinese military opened fire on demonstrators, resulting in an estimated 500 deaths.","Tim Walz claimed he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

Walz highlighted Israel's right to self-defense following Hamas’ deadly October 7 attack but refrained from explicitly endorsing a preemptive strike on Iran. Instead, he focused on the importance of diplomacy, coalition-building, and maintaining stability in the region. ""What is fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz argued, stressing that Vice President Kamala Harris had demonstrated calmness and effective coalition-building in the face of adversity.Vance, representing the Republican camp, took a different approach, praising Trump’s foreign policy during his tenure as one of deterrence and stability. He criticised the current administration for unfreezing billions of dollars in Iranian assets, suggesting these funds had empowered Iran’s military capabilities, ultimately contributing to the conflict. “Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world. Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration,” Vance said. He accused the Democrats of enabling the very aggression the US now faces.Walz’s criticism also touched on Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, a key point in the Democrat's foreign policy argument. “Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon because of Donald Trump’s fickle leadership,”This comes as Israel continued its offensive against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and faced retaliatory missile strikes from Iran. Iran launched a massive barrage of at least 180 missiles late Tuesday night, marking another dangerous chapter in the long-standing conflict between the two nations.","Tim Walz and JD Vance offered starkly contrasting views on US foreign policy.

The attack comes amidst a volatile situation in the Middle East, threatening to escalate into a full-scale regional war.As the air raid sirens went off across Israel at night, residents rushed into bomb shelters, witnessing the missile trails illuminating the night sky.Despite the scale of the attack, Israel reported only minor damage and few injuries. However, the psychological impact was significant, as the nation warned of potential further escalation.In the West Bank, one man was killed amid the chaos, though the exact circumstances remained unclear. Israel, meanwhile, vowed swift retaliation, warning that Iran had crossed a line.Iran declared its missile attack complete but issued a warning with foreign minister Abbas Araqchi saying on X, ""Our action is concluded unless the Israeli regime decides to invite further retaliation. In that scenario, our response will be stronger and more powerful.""The missile attack intensified tensions that had been escalating for months. Israel had recently targeted Hezbollah in Lebanon in response to the group's persistent rocket fire. The Israeli military had even conducted a ""limited ground incursion"" in southern Lebanon to halt the Iran-backed militant group's attacks, which mirrored the ongoing conflict between Israel andHamas in Gaza.Both Hezbollah and Hamas, with significant support from Iran, have remained steadfast in their assaults. Hezbollah has pledged to continue its rocket fire until Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel, however, remains determined to strike Hezbollah until displaced residents from the northern border can safely return home.The United States reaffirmed its support for Israel, promising that Iran would face ""severe consequences"" for the missile attack.

Malcolm Gladwell , the best-selling author ofone of the most important non-fiction books of the 21st century, is back with its dark sequelWhile discussing the new book with the Guardian, Gladwell calls out what he calls Harvard’s admission officers’ “bias towards affluent white students”.Pointing out the disparity between Harvard and an institution with a merit-based admissions process like Caltech compared to Harvard, he writes: “My suspicion is that for many people it’s unconscious, but there must be a point at which [Harvard admissions tutors] are confronting the fact that they have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their campus hasn’t become dominated by Asians and Indians.”In the book, Gladwell notes that Caltech, a highly competitive university with a merit-based admissions system, saw the proportion of Asian American students rise from 25% to 43% between 1992 and 2013.In contrast, at Harvard, where the admissions process is influenced by factors such as legacy, donor contributions, and athletic scholarships, the percentage of Asian American students has remained consistently between 15-20% during the same period. Indian applicants are even more likely to be excluded by Harvard’s application process.Gladwell goes on to argue: ""Meritocracy is one of the most beautiful inventions of the 20th century – it is a foundation of a free society.""Here are 10 other key points aboutand Malcolm Gladwell:Malcolm Gladwell was initially reluctant to revisit his debut work but ultimately chose to create an entirely new version, one that reflects today's more anxious world rather than simply updating the original.The foundational idea that social trends behave like epidemics, initially growing slowly before suddenly taking off, still holds true. However, some of Gladwell's original examples have not aged well.Gladwell now finds his earlier chapter on crime ""embarrassing,"" as he once credited New York City's crime reduction to 'broken windows' policing. He has since acknowledged that this approach led to over-policing in minority neighbourhoods and wasn't actually responsible for the drop in crime rates.Gladwell values the process of learning from errors, a trait he respects in his father. He proposes that authors should periodically reassess their original works every 25 years to stay aligned with new insights.The new book is darker and more nuanced than the original. It delves into how a small number of individuals can disproportionately influence significant events, such as the opioid crisis, where a minority of doctors were responsible for nearly half of all prescriptions.While The Tipping Point became a cultural phenomenon, Gladwell’s latest book explores how individuals with substantial influence can shape societal changes, both positively and negatively.Gladwell reflects on how male leadership failures over the past eight years make a strong case for female leaders, particularly in the current political climate.Gladwell has expressed his support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, noting a personal connection through his mother, who shares Jamaican heritage with Harris's father.He argues that recent examples of male leadership failures have made it increasingly difficult to justify misogynistic attitudes and believes that America is ready for a female president.Now living with his partner and two young daughters, Gladwell views parenting as a journey of intellectual humility. He continuously adapts his understanding of his children as they grow and sees this phase of his life as a ""productivity mechanism"" that shapes his evolving perspective.","Malcolm Gladwell's new book, ""Revenge of the Tipping Point,"" is darker and more nuanced than the original.

Israel's military recently conducted a significant airstrike targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah using U.S.-supplied BLU-109 bombs with JDAM guidance kits. These 2,000-pound bombs, also known as ""bunker busters,"" are designed to penetrate fortified underground structures. The airstrike was captured in a video showing Israeli F-15i jets carrying out the mission, where the bombs were deployed to strike Hezbollah's underground command centre.This operation was part of Israel’s ongoing efforts to neutralise threats posed by Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran.As per reports, the U.S. has provided Israel with bunker buster bombs since 2005, with over 1,000 bombs included in a $6.5 billion military aid package in 2023. These bombs are equipped with delayed fuses, ensuring detonation only after penetrating the targeted bunkers.The strike resulted in the death of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrullah along with both military and civilian casualties, drawing international attention to the precision of Israel's military operations and the destructive capabilities of these advanced weapons.Bunker buster bombs, also known as ground-penetration munitions, are specialised weapons designed to destroy heavily fortified structures or underground bunkers. These bombs, weighing between 2,000 and 4,000 pounds, are loaded with explosives and equipped with delayed fuses to ensure they only detonate after reaching their target. They can penetrate up to 30 metres of earth or six metres of reinforced concrete, maximising structural damage through their impact and internal explosion.The concept of bunker busters originated during World War II, developed by German engineer August Coenders and tested between 1942 and 1943. However, these bombs gained prominence in modern warfare, particularly during the Gulf War, when precision-guided munitions became essential for targeting deeply buried enemy assets.: Developed during the Gulf War, this 5,000-pound bomb uses laser-guided technology for precision targeting.A GPS-guided bomb effective in adverse weather, capable of hitting deeply buried targets.: The largest bunker buster weighing 30,000 pounds, designed to penetrate up to 200 feet of reinforced concrete.Bunker busters bombs are equipped with advanced GPS or laser guidance systems for precise targeting, reducing collateral damage. Their strong casings allow the bombs to drill deep into hardened structures before detonating, making them ideal for targeting command centres, weapons depots, and other strategic locations.While bunker busters bombs are not banned by international law, their use in densely populated areas raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding potential civilian casualties. The Geneva Conventions emphasise avoiding unnecessary harm to civilians, making the deployment of such bombs controversial when used in urban environments.","Israel's military recently conducted a significant airstrike targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah using U.S.-supplied BLU-109 bombs.

The new law, effective in the fall of 2025, impacts some of the country's most renowned institutions, such as Stanford University and the University of Southern California .The legislation addresses growing concerns about equity in college admissions , particularly following a Supreme Court decision last summer that banned race-based considerations in the admissions process.The ruling shed light on how legacy status—an applicant's familial connections to alumni—has influenced admissions decisions at elite schools.Assembly member Phil Ting, a San Francisco Democrat and the bill's author, highlighted the importance of creating a level playing field in higher education, saying, ""If we value diversity in higher education, we must level the playing field.""By enacting this legislation, California joins Maryland as the only states to ban legacy admissions at private, non-profit universities. Other states, such as Illinois, Colorado, and Virginia, have implemented similar prohibitions, but only for public universities, the Guardian reported.To ensure adherence to the new law, private colleges and universities in California will be required to submit yearly reports demonstrating compliance. This oversight measure aims to ensure transparency and accountability within admissions processes as institutions adapt to the new legal requirements.California's legislation aligns with public opinion, as evidenced by a Pew Research study from April 2022, which revealed that 75% of Americans believe a student's relationship to an alumnus should not influence admissions decisions.","California governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill on Monday that prohibits private colleges and universities from considering legacy preferences when evaluating applicants.

On Monday, Choi will go head-to-head with 31 other contestants for the tiara — and a chance to represent South Korea at the Miss Universe final in Mexico this November, according to the CNN.The Miss Universe organization recently lifted the age limit for contestants, which had previously restricted participation to women between 18 and 28 years old. This change, along with the removal of other eligibility requirements by the Korean pageant organizers, aimed to make the competition more inclusive and diverse. The swimsuit competition was also eliminated, further modernizing the event.","Choi Soon-hwa, an 81-year-old South Korean fashion model, competed in the Miss Universe Korea pageant held in Seoul on Monday.

A banker's vision for a livable planet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-bankers-vision-for-a-livable-planet/articleshow/113867107.cms,"Ajay Banga , the 14th President of the World Bank , recently held court in Stanford’s Hoover Institution. The former MasterCard CEO, who in 2021 became an advisor to General Atlantic's climate-focused fund, painted a picture of a world at a crossroads—grappling with climate change , refugee crises, and the promise (and perils) of AI.Banga took the reins at the World Bank last year.He said. ""We are a Knowledge Bank,"" repositioning the Bank from being just a “money bank” to a venerable institution focused on solving many problems.On climate, Banga was cautiously upbeat. He pointed to the Paris Agreement as a turning point, not just for governments but also for public awareness. ""This wasn't even a topic 5-8 years ago,"" he noted. The rapid progress in renewable energy particularly caught his eye. ""It now takes a day to install a Gigawatt of solar. It used to take 100 days a few years ago,"" Banga said.But it's not all sunshine. Banga highlighted the issue of fairness in climate policy. Developing countries, he explained, often feel they're being asked to forgo the very fossil fuels that powered Western growth. Similarly, there are issues on carbon credits. ""These are greenwashed, no certification, no registry,"" all of which needs to be fixed.Banga's solution is to ‘think big, but act small’. ""Let us work on electricity but also construction, carbon capture, and more,"" he said. ""Think of bite-sized chunks you can make a difference to.""When Kat Hu, a student at Stanford Graduate School of Business, asked about the World Bank's role in AI governance , Banga admitted they're still getting started. However, he pointed out an ""AI divide"" between developed and emerging markets. ""People think AI is the answer to their future in emerging markets,"" he said, ""but most don't have the four things required for AI: compute, electricity, lots of data, and people who know how to manage that data.""Saleh Dadkhahipour, student at Stanford GSB, said: “Drawing from his experience in Agriculture in Iran, further echoes the importance of cooperatives in bringing discipline to countries' climate policies.”Throughout the talk, Banga kept circling back to a central theme: the need for the World Bank to focus on outcomes, not just inputs. ""I want to get to outcome,"" he insisted. ""Not how many girls went to school but how many girls ended up with a better life years down the line.""Under Banga's leadership, the World Bank is aiming to be more than just a source of funds. It wants to be a catalyst for real, measurable change. Whether it can pull off this transformation remains to be seen. But one thing is definitive: with Ajay Banga at the helm, it won't be business as usual at the World Bank.","Ajay Banga is the 14th President of the World Bank.

"Indian American business owners support Trump, feels Republican fund-raiser Jiten Agarwal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-american-business-owners-support-trump-feels-republican-fund-raiser-jiten-agarwal/articleshow/113865710.cms,"Jiten Agarwal , a prominent Indian American business and community leader and CEO of QuantAi, a global data and AI company, is one of the hosts of a high-profile reception for Republican Presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump , later this week in Houston, Texas.Not surprisingly, the reception has a fund-raising component to it, with the US Presidential election, which remains too close to call between Democratic candidate and US Vice-President Kamala Harris and Trump, coming up next month.“The event is expected to raise over $5 million. There is a lot of support and contributions, for the event, from Americans; with only a few big Indian American donors including Swapnil Agarwal, CEO & managing partner Nitya Capital, Houston,” Agarwal, who had earlier hosted a fund-raiser for Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance, told the Times of India.“There is a lot of support for Republican Party within the Indian American community, especially among business owners and CEOs, of both small and large businesses. The establishment dislikes Trump and Trump voters dislike the establishment. Hence ‘support for Trump’ is tough ball game. Like mainstream American community, there are some conservatives within the Indian American community who are Trump’s staunch supporters, while other traditional conservatives do not like him at all. However, all agree that the Republicans are needed to win and govern the country now,” Agarwal said about his support for the Republican Presidential nominee.He feels that the upcoming US Presidential election is not about choosing the most likable person but about choosing between two vastly different ideologies and policy framework including US foreign policy in the current decade of conflicts. “Trump, during his past presidential tenure between 2016 and 2020, has proven that his administration can deliver on immigration, foreign policy, world peace, law and order, and domestic economy in an effective manner. There was no major conflict during the Trump administration, and America was on a path to prosperity until the pandemic hit in 2020,” Agarwal said. He added that the current situation, under the Biden/Harris administration, since 2020 in USA has been marked by chaos during withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, handling of Russia-Ukraine war, Israel-Hamas conflict, high inflation, huge influx of illegal immigrants in US and bumps in US-India relations. “A weak foreign policy has emboldened America’s foes. Switching Biden for another progressive candidate, Kamala Harris, is not going to solve the problem. I always support capitalism and have almost no appreciation for the policies of liberals leaning towards the extreme Left, especially profligate spending that has produced the highest inflation in 40 years. Given the choice of the two Presidential candidates this year, we need to think about the country we want to leave to our next generations, before voting,” he said.Having worked closely with the campaign of Indian American Republican Presidential candidate and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley , before she dropped out of the race, Agarwal feels that her campaign did not resonate among the Indian community in the US. “I do not think that Haley dropping out has had any impact. It was not easy to gather support for her from the Indian American community as many did not consider her a visionary leader and a strong contender against Trump. She offered a good conservative alternative in my opinion, but there was nothing new she had to offer. People perceived her as an establishment candidate and perception plays an important role in politics. If she had been picked by Trump as a VP candidate, a much wider support for the Trump ticket, from the Indian American community, was likely,” he said.Though Agarwal has hosted an event in support of the Republican vice-presidential candidate, he has not interacted with Vance’s Indian American wife Usha Chilukuri Vance and feels that she is not actively involved in her husband’s campaign. “Vance spoke very highly about her during my personal interaction with him. He owes his success to his wife and appreciates the values Usha [Vance] represents having grown up in a Hindu household. J.D. Vance is highly impressed by Hinduism. He had a separate Hindu ceremony officiated by a Hindu priest, honouring his wife’s cultural heritage at his wedding. He talked about the shared principles that guide their family life despite their diverse religious backgrounds,” Agarwal said.","Jiten Agarwal is a prominent Indian American business and community leader. He is one of the hosts of a high-profile reception for Republican Presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump. The reception has a fund-raising component to it, with the US Presidential election still too close to call.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113865709,imgsize-1520122,width-400,resizemode-4/113865709.jpg"

""I will always ensure that Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias.""Harris voiced her full support for President Joe Biden’s directive authorizing the US military to assist in countering the missile threat. ""Initial indications are that Israel, with our assistance, was able to defeat this attack,"" she added, reiterating Washington’s resolve to safeguard its allies in the region.Iran's missile barrage, totaling at least 180 projectiles, marks the latest development in the decades-long confrontation between Israel and Iran. The hostility has steadily worsened, threatening to drag the entire Middle East into broader conflict.Alongside its operations in Gaza, Israel has escalated its military efforts in Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah militants backed by Tehran. The campaign has killed hundreds and displaced more than a million people, according to local reports.This regional tension was sparked by a devastating October 7 attack carried out by Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza, which led to Israel’s ongoing military offensive. The war in Gaza has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, with widespread displacement and severe humanitarian crises unfolding across the territory. Israel has faced growing international scrutiny, including allegations of genocide, which it vehemently denies.","US Vice President Kamala Harris called Iran a ""dangerous"" and ""destabilizing"" force in the Middle East.

Veep debate no laughing matter with lightweights expected to do heavy lifting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/veep-debate-no-laughing-matter-with-lightweights-expected-to-do-heavy-lifting/articleshow/113860257.cms,"JD Vance and Tim Walz (Picture credit: AP)

WASHINGTON: Traditionally, American vice-presidents were considered so nondescript that Thomas Marshall , the country’s 28th VP, joked about two brothers, one who ran away to sea, the other who became vice-president: Neither of them was ever heard from again. In fact, the 17th US veep, Schuyler Colfax , is said to have died unrecognized on a railroad platform.Times changed with adoption in 1967 of the 25th amendment to the US Constitution that made the veep lawful successor to the president if he exited mid-term due to death, disability, or resignation. So today, the title that Franklin Roosevelt’s first veep, John Nance Garner, said wasn’t worth “a bucket of warm spit,"" is throwing up a mouthwatering debate involving running mates of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris , JD Vance and Tim Walz , one of whom will be a heartbeat away from the Oval Office.Both Vance, from Ohio, and Walz, from Minnesota, have midwestern roots. They were ostensibly picked to appeal to middle America by Presidential candidates who are from the east coast and west coast respectively. Once considered the political equivalent of lift operators, the veeps remit now extends to nationwide heavy lifting on policy matters, particularly domestic issues.Clearly lacking policy chops and riding on sulfurous rhetoric, MAGA supremo Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he will be ""doing a personal PLAY BY PLAY of the Debate... between the Brilliant J.D. Vance and the Highly Inarticulate “Tampon” Tim Walz,"" adding, ""I hope that Cognitively Challenged, Lyin’ Kamala Harris, will be listening so that she can again show the World how she will make up false facts and stories in order to change around an administrative FAILURE!"" Harris will be watching too despite her preoccupation with managing the devastating aftereffects for Hurricane Helene, which has provided the backdrop of some political showboating.The debate, to be telecast on CBS at 9 pm EST on Tuesday, will last 90 minutes and have no audience, like with the presidential debate. But unlike the presidential debate, it will have no live fact checking from the moderators, leaving the candidates to duke it out on open mikes, with plenty of interruptions and fireworks expected.While it is the only debate scheduled between the veep candidates, Harris is still pushing for a second debate with Trump. “ I know we will cheer on Coach Walz on Tuesday when he debates JD Vance. But their debate should not be the last word. I think Donald Trump and I should debate again. As they say here in Vegas, I’m all in. But it looks like my opponent is ready to fold,” she trolled Trump during a campaign stop in Nevada. On their part, Trump supporters who believe the former President had the worst of the first debate are hoping Vance will salvage some points for the Republicans.","US vice-presidents were once considered so nondescript that Thomas Marshall joked about two brothers, one who ran away to sea, the other who became vice- president.

Watch: Shocking close encounter between US and Russian fighter jets near Alaska,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-shocking-close-encounter-between-us-and-russian-fighter-jets-near-alaska/articleshow/113857132.cms,"Russian aircraft passing closely to US jet

US military officials on Monday released a video of a close encounter between a Russian fighter jet and a US Air Force F-16 near Alaska .This incident occurred on September 23, when the Russian aircraft approached from behind and passed very close to the US jet, as shown in the video.The North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ), which directed the US pilot, shared the video of the incident on the social media platform X.""On Sept. 23, 2024, NORAD aircraft flew a safe and disciplined intercept of Russian military aircraft in the Alaska ADIZ ,"" NORAD posted on X.The encounter took place after several Russian planes entered the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone, which lies just outside US sovereign airspace.General Gregory Guillot, commander of NORAD and US Northern Command, criticized the Russian pilot's actions. ""The conduct of one Russian Su-35 was unsafe, unprofessional, and endangered everyone — not what you’d expect from a professional air force,” Guillot said. He added that the NORAD aircraft followed a ""safe and disciplined"" interception procedure.The close pass occurred a few weeks after Russian military planes and navy vessels, including submarines, approached Alaska during joint drills with China. Although none of the aircraft entered US airspace, approximately 130 US soldiers were temporarily stationed on Shemya Island, about 1,200 miles southwest of Anchorage, before returning to their bases.US senator Dan Sullivan, a member of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, said the recent incident highlights the need to strengthen America's military presence in Alaska and the Arctic. “The reckless and unprofessional maneuvers of Russian fighter pilots — within just a few feet of our Alaska-based fighters — in Alaska’s ADIZ on September 23 put the lives of our brave airmen at risk and underscore the escalating aggression we’re witnessing from dictators like Vladimir Putin,” Sullivan said.In July, Russian and Chinese bombers flew together in international airspace near Alaska for the first time, signaling increased cooperation between the two countries. In 2022, a US Coast Guard ship encountered a formation of Chinese and Russian naval vessels in the Bering Sea, about 85 miles north of Alaska’s Kiska Island.","US military officials released a video of a close encounter between a Russian fighter jet and a US Air Force F-16 near Alaska. The North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ), which directed the US pilot, shared the video of the incident on the social media platform X.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113858984,imgsize-4596517,width-400,resizemode-4/113858984.jpg"
October Surprise: What is 'October surprise' Hillary Clinton warns Kamala Harris about?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-october-surprise-hillary-clinton-warns-kamala-harris-about/articleshow/113858860.cms,"What was the October surprise in 2016?

Ahead of the US election 2024 in November may come an October surprise , Hillary Clinton has warned vice president Kamala Harris . ""I anticipate something will happen in October, as it always does,"" Hillary said on PBS News when she was asked to put on the Cassandra hat and tell about something that she can see happening in the near future that should be taken more seriously.""I anticipate there will be a full-court press in October, The digital airwaves will be filled.And why does that matter? Because the press, that is pro-Trump anyway, oftentime stories are put on digitally that then are picked up by, let's say it, Fox and others. Then those stories are stories, so the mainstream press reports on them, and so that story then takes on a life of its own.""""Russians are active in the election, so is Iran, we know. Chinese uses TikTok; they certainly used against Biden and for Trump. I think they're a little less pro-Trump right now. So you look at where people get there information from and they get their information largely from social media. And so the campaign is doing its best job to combat that both domestic and foreign false disinformation,"" Hillary said.""There will be concerted efforts to distort and pervert Kamala Harris, who she is, what she stands for, what she's done. Look, I mean the crazy story about me running a child-trafficking operation out of a basement at a pizzeria. Don't laugh, don't laugh. It was a huge story. And it got one young man in North Carolina to get in his car with his, you know, assault rifle and drive up to liberate these non-existent children and shoot up a pizzeria in Washington DC,"" Hillary said.""This is dangerous stuff. It starts online often on the dark web. It migrates. It's picked up by the pro-Trump media. It's then reported on by everybody else which makes sure it has about 100 per cent coverage, and people believe it,"" Hillary said.Both Clinton and Trump experienced an October surprise during their 2016 campaigns. The Washington Post published its ""Access Hollywood tape"" story on October 7, which documented Trump bragging in extremely lewd terms about groping women. Hours earlier, Wikileaks began releasing hacked emails from Clinton's campaign, which showed a debate question was leaked to her in advance","""I anticipate something will happen in October, as it always does,"" Hillary said on PBS News.

Security has generally improved since Taliban surged back to power in 2021, however the regional chapter of the group, known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), has emerged as the main challenge to their rule.A sweeping security crackdown broadly quashed the number of domestic attacks but there was a string of shootings and bombings by IS-K this summer.Taliban govt spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said ""special forces"" apprehended ""key members of the insurgent group"" which claimed a Kabul suicide bombing that killed six people this month. He said the suicide attacker ""infiltrated Afghanistan"" from a training camp in Pakistan, while others arrested in a series of raids had also ""recently returned"" from there.

Islamabad, In an effort to minimise administrative expenditures, cash-strapped Pakistan on Sunday announced to abolish about 150,000 government posts , close six ministries, and merge two others, as part of reforms agreed upon with the IMF under USD 7 billion loan deal . The International Monetary Fund on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to cut expenditures, increase tax-to GDP ratio, tax non-traditional sectors like agriculture and real estate, limit subsidies and transfer some fiscal responsibilities to provinces.Addressing the media on his return from the US, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that a programme had been finalised with the IMF, which would be the last programme for Pakistan.""We need to implement our policies to prove that it will be the last programme,"" he said, and emphasised that in order to join the G20, the economy must be formalised.The minister said right-sizing within ministries was going on and the decision to close six ministries is set to be implemented, while two ministries will be merged. ""Additionally, 150,000 posts across various ministries will be eliminated,"" Aurangzeb said.He dwelt at length on increasing tax revenues, noting that there were approximately 300,000 new taxpayers last year, and so far this year, 732,000 new taxpayers have registered, increasing the total number of taxpayers in the country from 1.6 million to 3.2 million.Aurangzeb also said that the non-filers category will be abolished and those not paying taxes will no longer be able to purchase property or vehicles.The minister claimed that the economy was moving in the right direction and the country's foreign exchange reserves had increased, reaching their highest level. He highlighted significant growth in both national exports and IT exports, and stated that investor confidence regarding the strength of the economy is a major success.Aurangzeb stated that the policy rate has been reduced by 4.5 per cent by the government after coming to power, and expressed optimism that the exchange rate and policy rate will remain as expected.""Our claim that the economy is improving is not a hollow claim because inflation has decreased due to government policies. Inflation has dropped to single digits,"" he said.Pakistan has been struggling to fix its economy for the last many years and it was close to default in 2023 but a timely loan of USD 3 billion by the IMF saved the situation.Pakistan has negotiated a long-term loan with the global lender with the hope and commitment that it would be the last loan. However, many doubt this claim as the country has already secured about two dozen loans from the Fund but failed to address the economy on a permanent basis.","Pakistan to abolish about 150,000 government posts, close six ministries, and merge two others.

ISLAMABAD: At least 64 people have been killed this week in a fresh outbreak of violence involving the Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan 's militancy-prone Kurram district along the Afghanistan border in the northwest, where a ceasefire had been signed just over a month ago.Governor Faisal Karim Kundi of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said dozens on either side were wounded in the fighting, which continued Friday amid reports of higher casualties than the official figure.Police said the clashes started after the Boshehra Shias of upper Kurram started setting up bunkers on land belonging to the Sunni Ahmadzai community last week. The dispute quickly engulfed other areas and became a full-blown sectarian conflict , they said.In Aug, the warring sides signed a truce after clashes resulted in 50 deaths and injuries to over 200 people.Security officials said the renewed fighting led to closure of roads, triggering a shortage of food, medicines and fuel. Educational institutions have also remained shut for a week.Kurram, a mountainous area that shares a long border with Afghanistan, is home to about 700,000 people, of which more than 42% belong to the Shia community. The district's Parachinar town is one of the few Shia-dominated areas in largely Sunni Pakistan. The region has seen frequent tribal and sectarian clashes in recent years.","At least 64 people killed in fresh outbreak of violence involving Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan's militancy-prone Kurram district.

Rescuers search for missing people in Nepal as death toll due to floods climb to 224,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/rescuers-search-for-missing-people-in-nepal-as-death-toll-due-to-floods-climb-to-224/articleshow/113854931.cms,"The disaster struck Himalayan nation just before Dasain, the country's most significant festival, which starts on Thursday.

The search for the missing and the recovery of the deceased continued in Nepal on Tuesday, following the devastating floods and landslides that claimed more than 200 lives over the weekend.The death toll has risen to 224, with 158 injured and 24 others still unaccounted for as rescue efforts continue, according to Eak Narayan Aryal, the government's chief secretary.Aryal also said that the flooding had damaged 16 hydroelectric power plants, resulting in decrease in Nepal's electricity production, while additional 18 projects under construction were also affected.The disaster struck Himalayan nation just before Dasain , the country's most significant festival, which starts on Thursday.Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli 's government has faced severe criticism for its slow response to the crisis, especially after a landslide hit several vehicles stranded for hours just 16 kilometers (10 miles) from the capital, Kathmandu, resulting in the deaths of approximately three dozen people.Oli said that the government would continue to look for those missing and help the thousands impacted. ""We were prepared for a disaster but could not predict it would be of this big scale,"" he said.As weather improved slightly, workers began clearing the highways that had been blocked by landslides. However, sections of several other highways adjacent to raging rivers were washed away, and repairs are expected to be time-consuming and challenging. Only nine out of the 37 damaged highways have been reopened for traffic so far.The flooding was caused by heavy rain that arrived at the end of Nepal's monsoon season, which typically begins in June and ends by mid-September.","The death toll has risen to 224, with 158 injured and 24 others still unaccounted for as rescue efforts continue.
