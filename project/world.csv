Presidential Debate: How mute button will work at tonight's Biden-Trump debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-mute-button-will-work-at-tonights-biden-trump-debate/articleshow/111323120.cms,"How will the mute button work?

Joe Biden and Donald Trump will clash with each other at the much-awaited first presidential debate on CNN Thursday. This is the first time that there will be no live audience to cheer or boo the speakers. There will also be a mute button -- which was introduced in 2020 from the second debate after Trump and Biden talked over each other in the first debate.CNN's debate night control room will mute the microphones of candidates when it is not their turn to speak.Behind the podiums, there will be two green lights which are a signal that his microphones are on. When the lights are off, the microphone is mute. CNN showed how the mute button will work and how will viewers see it on their screen. When a candidate speaks, the microphone of the other remains off and at that time if the second one interrupts the first one, his voice will not reach the viewers -- he will only be seen miming.But as they are be standing at lecterns that are only 8 feet apart, they will hear each other, even if on mute.In the demo video, CNN reiterated that both the campaign agreed to abide by these rules. ""By agreeing to participate in this debate, both campaigns and candidates have also agreed to abide by these rules,"" CNN said.The 90-minute debate will include two commercial breaks, and campaign staff cannot interact with their candidate during the break, the network said. The second debate between Biden and Trump is slated for September on ABC.CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, already accused by Trump's campaign of spreading fake news against Trump, will use ""all tools at their disposal"" to ensure a civilized discussion.The debate starts at 9 pm and will continue for 90 minutes -- with only two commercial breaks. This is a normal length for a presidential debate, but the commercial breaks are noteworthy: General-election debates in past cycles, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates rather than an individual news organization, did not have them. The candidates will not be allowed to talk to their aides during the commercial breaks, but they will have time to take a breather and collect themselves in a way they would not have in past years.","The first presidential debate will have no live audience to cheer or boo the speakers.

Le Pen threatens to challenge Macron's control on military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/le-pen-threatens-to-challenge-macrons-control-on-military/articleshow/111323086.cms,"With just three days to go until France 's landmark legislative election, far-right politician Marine Le Pen on Thursday raised the question of who would be in charge of the military if her party takes over the govt after the two-round balloting.The early elections are plunging France into uncharted territory, and political scientists are scrambling to interpret how exactly Prez Macron and a PM who is hostile to most of his policies will share power if Le Pen's National Rally wins majority in the National Assembly.Macron has three years to serve out his term as prez.Le Pen has repeatedly said that Jordan Bardella, her protegee, will lead France's next govt if their party wins. She suggested in an interview that Bardella, 28, will also take over at least some decisions on France's defence and its armed forces. ""Serving as a commander-in-chief of the armed forces is an honorary title for the president since it's the PM who actually pulls the strings,"" she said.France's constitution states that ""the President of the Republic is the head of the armed forces"". However, the constitution also states that ""the PM is responsible for national defence."" Constitutional experts say the exact role of PM in foreign policy and defence appears to be subject to interpretation. Historian Jean Garrigues said ""the president is the head of armed forces, (but) it's the PM who has the armed forces at his disposal"". In practice, he said this means that ""if the prez decided to send troops on the ground to Ukraine, the PM would be able to block this decision.""","Le Pen has repeatedly said that Jordan Bardella will lead France's next govt if their party wins.

Brazil top court decriminalises pot possession for personal use,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/brazil-top-court-decriminalises-pot-possession-for-personal-use/articleshow/111323067.cms,"BRASILIA: Brazil's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that purchasing and possessing up to 40 grams of marijuana for personal use will no longer be a crime, though police can still seize the drug. Marijuana continues to be illegal in Brazil and its use in public places will still be prohibited. But a person caught using marijuana and possessing up to 40 grams - roughly enough for 80 joints - will not receive a criminal record and will just appear before a judge to hear a warning on the drug's dangers, it ruled.Police will, however be able to arrest a person caught selling marijuana even if it is less than 40 grams, when there are clear signs of intent to sell it, the justices decided.The verdict makes the nation of 203 million the largest to take such a measure and the latest sign of a growing global acceptance of the drug. More than 20 countries have now decriminalised or legalised recreational use of marijuana, most in Europe and the Americas.The SC said its guidelines on private use of marijuana will stand until Congress passes legislation. Conservatives in Brazil's Congress are pushing a bill that would modify the constitution to criminalise any possession of marijuana.

"Russian satellite breaks up in Space, forces ISS astronauts to shelter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russian-satellite-breaks-up-in-space-forces-iss-astronauts-to-shelter/articleshow/111322214.cms,"A Russian Earth observation satellite , RESURS-P1 , which was declared dead in 2022, has disintegrated into more than 100 pieces of debris in orbit . The break-up occurred on Wednesday, near the International Space Station (ISS), causing the astronauts on board to take shelter in their spacecraft for about an hour as a precautionary measure. US Space Command stated that there was no immediate threat to other satellites.The cause of the satellite's break-up is currently unknown, and Russia 's space agency, Roscosmos, has not provided any comments on the incident.LeoLabs, a US space-tracking firm, detected the satellite releasing fragments until 6 pm Mountain Time. US Space Command confirmed that the event generated ""over 100 pieces of trackable debris.""Large debris-generating events in orbit are uncommon but are becoming a growing concern as space becomes increasingly crowded with vital satellite networks. In 2021, Russia faced strong criticism from Western countries when it destroyed one of its defunct satellites using a ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) missile, creating thousands of pieces of orbital debris. While the RESURS-P1 passed over the Plesetsk rocket site during the initial break-up window, there was no immediate indication that Russia had launched a missile to strike the satellite.When satellites reach the end of their operational life, they either remain in orbit until they eventually descend into Earth's atmosphere and burn up, or they are moved to a ""graveyard orbit"" 36,000 km from Earth to minimize the risk of colliding with active satellites. Roscosmos decommissioned RESURS-P1 in 2021 due to onboard equipment failures and had been lowering its altitude for an eventual atmospheric reentry.The incident highlights the growing need for an international mechanism to manage space traffic and address the risks associated with satellite collisions and space warfare. Space advocates and lawyers have been calling for countries to establish such a system, which does not currently exist, to ensure the safe and sustainable use of space for all."," RESURS-P1 disintegrated on Wednesday, near the International Space Station.

Elon Musk's SpaceX gets $843m to help discard ISS around 2030,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-spacex-gets-843m-to-help-discard-iss-around-2030/articleshow/111323006.cms,"WASHINGTON: Nasa awarded SpaceX $843m to build a vehicle capable of pushing the Internation Space Station into Earth's atmosphere for its planned destruction around 2030, it said on Wednesday, a task originally meant for Russia's thrusters.Under its new Nasa contract, SpaceX will build what the space agency called the US Deorbit Vehicle to deorbit the ISS and avoid risks to populated areas, with Nasa taking ownership of the craft and handling the deorbiting operation.The football field-sized research lab, led primarily by the US and Russia, has been continuously staffed with govt astronauts during its some 24 years of operation, but its aging components have led Nasa and its foreign partners to set 2030 as a planned retirement date.The first segment of the ISS was launched in 1998. Weighing 430,000kg, ISS is by far the largest single structure ever built in space. Based on past observations of how other stations such as Mir and Skylab disintegrated on atmospheric re-entry, Nasa engineers expect the orbital outpost to break up in three stages. First, the massive solar arrays and the radiators that keep the orbital lab cool will come off, then individual modules will break off from the truss, or the station's backbone structure. Finally, the truss and the modules themselves will tear apart. Much of the material will be vaporised, but large pieces are expected to survive. For this reason, Nasa is aiming for an area of the Pacific Ocean called Point Nemo, one of the most remote areas of the world and known as the graveyard of satellites and spaceships.The US, Japan, Canada and the countries under the European Space Agency have committed to the space station partnership through 2030, while Russia has agreed to remain a partner through 2028, the date through which the Russian space agency Roscosmos believes its hardware can last. Russian thrusters maintain ISS's orbital altitude and US solar arrays keep its power running.For after 2030, Nasa has been funding early development of privately built space stations in low-Earth orbit to maintain US presence in the cosmic region, with Airbus and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin involved in those efforts.","Nasa awarded SpaceX $843m to build a vehicle capable of pushing the Internation Space Station into Earth's atmosphere for its planned destruction around 2030.

US SC blocks opioid settlement that gave immunity to Purdue co's Sackler family,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-sc-blocks-opioid-settlement-that-gave-immunity-to-purdue-cos-sackler-family/articleshow/111322988.cms,"Washington: The US Supreme Court on Thursday blocked OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma 's bankruptcy settlement that would have shielded its wealthy Sackler family owners from lawsuits over their role in the nation's deadly opioid epidemic. The 5-4 decision reversed a lower court's ruling that had upheld the plan to give Purdue's owners immunity in exchange for paying up to $6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits accusing the firm of unlawful misleading marketing of OxyContin, a powerful pain medication introduced in 1996.The ruling represented a victory for Prez Biden's administration, which had challenged the settlement as an abuse of bankruptcy protections meant for debtors in financial distress, not people like the Sacklers who have not filed for bankruptcy.Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the ruling, which was joined by fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett, as well as liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""The Sacklers haven't filed for bankruptcy and have not placed virtually all their assets on the table for distribution to creditors, yet they seek what essentially amounts to a discharge,"" he wrote.Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined be fellow conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, and liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. ""The decision is wrong on the law and devastating for more than 100,000 opioid victims and their families,"" he said.Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 to address its debts, nearly all of which stemmed from thousands of lawsuits alleging that OxyContin helped kickstart an opioid epidemic that has caused more than half a million US overdose deaths over two decades. At issue in the case was whether US bankruptcy law lets Purdue's restructuring include legal protections for members of the Sackler family, who have not filed for personal bankruptcy.

"'Fired after complaining about poor repair work on Boeing 787 jets', claims whistleblower",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-richard-cuevas-another-whistleblower-who-warned-boeing-of-flaws-in-787-dreamliner/articleshow/111299686.cms,"Who is Richard Cuevas?

What issues did Cuevas observe in the Boeing?

What were the previous complaints?

What the company said?

Another whistleblower has come forward on Wednesday with allegations that certain components of Boeing 's 787 Dreamliner aircraft were constructed in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to ""devastating consequences.""Richard Cuevas , a mechanic employed by Strom, a former contractor, has filed complaints with two US agencies, claiming he faced retaliation after raising concerns about potential manufacturing issues on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.According to his attorneys at Katz Banks Kumin, Cuevas was terminated in March 2024 after he brought attention to manufacturing deviations in the forward pressure bulkhead, a crucial component for managing pressure during flights, as per CNN reports.Richard Cuevas is the latest in the list of whistleblowers who have come forward from Boeing's operations, further intensifying the scrutiny faced by the plane manufacturer, in an incident involving a 737 MAX aircraft operated by Alaska Airlines in January, after the plane was forced to make an emergency landing due to an inflight issue.Cuevas was employed by Strom, a contracting company that assigned him to work atSpirit AeroSystems , the manufacturer responsible for building fuselages for the Dreamliner.According to CNN, in October 2023, Cuevas submitted a complaint to Boeing, claiming that Spirit had implemented unapproved modifications to the dimensions of fastener holes located in the forward pressure bulkhead of 787 aircraft.The Boeing initiated an investigation into his concerns in October 2023, notifying Spirit management of the complaints. During this period, Cuevas says a colleague commented, ""we've got a snitch among us,"" and in March, Spirit abruptly terminated his employment.Katz Banks Kumin said, ""Our client witnessed critical issues with the forward pressure bulkhead assembly on multiple planes that deviated from Boeing's specifications.""""He recognized the substandard work and expressed concern about his safety concerns, but Spirit and Boeing failed to stop the faulty manufacturing processes. Mr. Cuevas was fired when his manager found out that an employee complained about these issues, and suspected that employee was Mr. Cuevas,"" he added.Cuevas reported that he observed gaps in the forward pressure bulkheads of two aircraft he helped construct, which could potentially lead to ""catastrophe.""Cuevas witnessed the improper drilling of holes into the forward pressure bulkheads of 787 planes at Spirit's facility in Wichita, Kansas, during 2023,"" which he believes could compromise power and air pressure on the planes, posing a serious safety risk to passengers.He filed a report with Boeing's ethics hotline, informing management that he believed Spirit was concealing the issues from Boeing.Cuevas witnessed these issues with three planes he worked on and believes that these problems may affect at least 10 to 12 planes, either in production or already delivered to Boeing.In response to the allegations, Boeing has said that they had previously investigated Cuevas' claims and determined that they did not present a safety issue.The bulkhead is a critical component of an airplane's structure, essential for maintaining the aircraft's integrity while in flight.A previous whistleblower, Sam Salehpour , a Boeing engineer, reported similar gaps in 787 and 777 aircraft. The FAA and Boeing suspended deliveries of new Dreamliners for nearly two years starting in 2021 to investigate the gaps.The same attorneys are also representing Sam who testified before the Senate in April regarding his concerns about the manufacturing practices of the 787 and the retaliation he faced for speaking out.More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has increased significantly since a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane in January just after takeoff, leaving a large hole in the side of the plane, CNN reported.Last week, a current Boeing employee claimed that the company attempted to conceal broken or out-of-specification 737 Max plane parts from regulators and lost track of them, fearing that they may have been installed on planes carrying passengers.The Boeing said, ""A subcontractor's employee previously reported concerns to us that we thoroughly investigated as we take seriously any safety-related matter. Engineering analysis determined that the issues raised did not present a safety concern and were addressed.""""We are reviewing the documents released today and will thoroughly investigate any new claim,""they added.company spokesperson Joe Buccino said, Spirit ""leadership is aware of the allegations and looking into the matter. We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected.""Attorneys representing Cuevas submitted complaints to the Federal Aviation Administration and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration in a letter of submission, saying ""based on his direct observations of glaring safety issues, that Boeing's and Spirit's statements to the public and investors about the safety of 787 Dreamliners are fraudulent.""The FAA has initiated multiple investigations into Boeing, and the US Department of Justice has stated that it may file criminal charges against the company due to its ongoing quality and safety failures.""We strongly encourage anyone with safety concerns to report them and we thoroughly investigate every report,"" the FAA said.According to the FAA, it has received a total of 126 such reports in the current year, while only 11 were submitted last year.","Richard Cuevas, a mechanic, has filed complaints with two US agencies.

Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic in June last year and was extradited to the US on June 14.State department spokesperson Matthew Miller responded to a question at a press briefing and said, “They (Indian officials) have announced that they are conducting an inquiry, and we will look forward to the results of that inquiry.”Miller's remarks came in response to a question about a letter sent by members of the foreign senate foreign relations committee to secretary of state Antony Blinken . The letter called for a strong diplomatic response to the Indian government's alleged involvement in the assassination attempt on a US citizen on American soil.In response to these allegations, India has formed a high-level inquiry committee to investigate the information provided by the US regarding the plot.Miller emphasized, “We will respond to those members privately as we always do. I won't speak to that here. But as pertains to the other issue, when this issue first arose, we made clear that we had raised it with the government of India and told them that we expected there to be a full investigation.”During a virtual media briefing on Wednesday, US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell reiterated that the US has been in consistent contact with India for updates on the investigation into the foiled plot to kill Pannun. He underscored the importance of accountability in the case.“We have had constructive dialogue with India on this topic and I would say that they have been responsive to our concerns,” Campbell said.“We've made clear that we seek accountability from the Government of India and we have consistently asked for updates on the Indian committee of inquiry's investigations,” Campbell added.Campbell further noted, “And I would just simply say that we raised this issue directly with the Indian government...at the most senior levels between our two sides.”He made these comments while responding to a query about whether the 'murder-for-hire' plot targeting Pannun was discussed during his and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's meetings with their Indian counterparts.When asked about the Lok Sabha elections in India, Miller commented on the US’s position regarding India's democratic process.“When it comes to the Indian elections, we have been quite clear on behalf of the United States government that we celebrate what was the largest exercise of democracy in the history of the world,” Miller said.“It was an extraordinary achievement. And then when it comes to the outcome of the election, we obviously take no side. That's a question for the people of India to decide,” Miller concluded.The US maintains that it seeks accountability from India regarding the alleged assassination plot and has consistently pursued updates from Indian authorities on their investigation. Both Campbell and Miller highlighted the ongoing dialogue and cooperation between the two countries on this sensitive issue.","The United States is anticipating the results of an Indian investigation into allegations that an Indian official was involved in a plot to assassinate Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York.

Family dynamics: How Melania-Ivanka relationship changed after Trump conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/family-dynamics-how-melania-ivanka-relationship-changed-after-trump-conviction/articleshow/111292947.cms,"In recent discussions, the dynamics between Melania Trump , her husband Donald Trump, and his daughter Ivanka Trump have come under renewed scrutiny. According to reports, the relationship between Melania and Ivanka has seen some changes following Donald Trump's legal troubles.A source close to the family noted that ""Melania and Ivanka are rumored to be getting along better since Donald Trump was convicted in New York."" This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years, a Newsweek report said.Melania Trump's former friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff , weighed in on the evolving dynamics within the Trump family. Wolkoff, who has previously published a tell-all book about her time with the former first lady, described some of the recent claims about Melania and Ivanka's relationship as ""ridiculous."" Wolkoff's comments suggest that the public may not have the full picture of the intricate relationships within the Trump family.This development comes as Donald Trump faces various legal challenges, which have undoubtedly impacted the family's interactions. The former president's conviction in New York has led to increased media attention on his personal life, including his relationships with Melania and Ivanka.Historically, there have been reports of tension between Melania and Ivanka. Ivanka, who served as a senior advisor during Donald Trump's presidency, often took on a prominent role, leading to speculation about her influence and relationship with her stepmother. However, the current situation appears to show a thawing of relations between the two women, perhaps brought on by the pressures of their shared circumstances.Melania Trump has largely remained out of the public eye since leaving the White House, making few public statements and maintaining a low profile. Ivanka, on the other hand, has also stepped back from the political spotlight but continues to be a figure of interest due to her high-profile role during her father's administration.As the Trump family navigates these legal and personal challenges, the evolving relationships within the family continue to be a topic of public fascination. The reported improvement in Melania and Ivanka's relationship adds a new layer to the complex narrative of the Trump family's public and private lives.","A source close to the family noted that ""Melania and Ivanka are rumored to be getting along better since Donald Trump was convicted in New York"" This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111292941,imgsize-10050,width-400,resizemode-4/111292941.jpg"

- 'Inflationary' policies -

ATLANTA: Donald Trump accused Joe Biden on Thursday of doing a ""poor job"" on the US economy and of presiding over a disastrous rise in inflation -- reflecting how rising prices and the cost of living have become key issues ahead of November's presidential election .""He has not done a good job. He's done a poor job,"" Trump said during CNN's head-to-head debate with Biden in Atlanta, Georgia.""And inflation is killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.""Biden said the US economy had turned a corner under his leadership, but that more needed to be done to help the working class.""We got to take a look at what I was left when I became president,"" he said. ""We had an economy that was in free fall. The pandemic was so badly handled, many people were dying.""Americans have named inflation or the cost of living as ""the most important financial problem facing their family,"" in each of the last three years, according to a recent poll from the DC-based firm Gallup.Perhaps more worryingly for Biden, 46 per cent of US adults said they have ""a great deal"" or ""a fair amount"" of confidence in Trump to do or recommend the right thing for the world's largest economy, while just 38 per cent said the same thing about him, according to another Gallup poll.A post-pandemic supply crunch and the war in Ukraine helped fuel a surge in US consumer inflation, which hit a multi-decade high in 2022.In response, the US Federal Reserve hiked its key lending rate from almost zero to a two-decade high of between 5.25 and 5.50 per cent -- where it has remained for the past year.Higher interest rates cool down the economy by raising borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, indirectly impacting everything from mortgage rates to auto loans.Inflation has fallen sharply since the Fed started hiking rates but remains stuck stubbornly above its long-term target of two per cent -- keeping the US central bank on pause as it waits for more positive data.Because inflation has remained high for several years, consumer prices have now risen by around 20 per cent since January 2021, when Biden took office, according to the Labor Department's consumer price index (CPI) inflation calculator.In contrast, consumer prices rose by less than six per cent during the same timeframe under Trump.Although Congress has given the Fed the mandate to tackle inflation on its own, it is still a difficult topic for Biden, who has looked to talk up his economic record ahead of November's election.The Fed currently expects inflation will continue to ease this year and next, before hitting its long-term target of two percent in 2026.But what happens next will likely depend on who becomes president in November -- and which parties will control the House of Representatives and the Senate.Trump has suggested that, if he wins the election, he will look to extend a series of tax cuts made under his leadership, severely restrict immigration, deport some foreign-born illegal immigrants and slap tariffs on all US imports.These policies would all ""likely be inflationary,"" by putting up prices, placing upward pressure on wages and boosting and adding to the nation's debt, JP Morgan economists wrote in a recent note to clients.As things stand, Republican control of the House, Senate and the White House is not the most likely scenario come November, Oxford Economics lead US economist Bernard Yaros wrote in a recent note to clients.""If Biden is reelected but presides over a divided government, the upside risk potential to the economy from fiscal policy is limited,"" he said.""If Trump returns to the White House with a divided government, he will have a tougher time enacting his fiscal agenda,"" he added.","Donald Trump accuses Joe Biden of doing a ""poor job"" on the US economy.

The two men, who make no secret of their disdain for each other, did not shake hands as they walked to their podiums at the start of the debate. Biden frequently referred to Trump as ""this guy"" during his remarks. The current president and his predecessor hadn't spoken since their last debate weeks before the 2020 presidential election. Trump skipped Biden's inauguration after leading an unprecedented and unsuccessful effort to overturn his loss that culminated in the January 6 Capitol insurrection by his supporters.

frequently referred to Trump as ""this guy"" during his remarks. The current president and his predecessor hadn't spoken since their last debate weeks before the 2020 presidential election. Trump skipped Biden's inauguration after leading an unprecedented and unsuccessful effort to overturn his loss that culminated in the January 6 Capitol insurrection by his supporters. Biden, who received the first question, defended rising inflation since taking office, attributing it to the situation he inherited from Trump amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The president cleared his throat twice during his initial response, his voice sounding hoarse, while Trump smirked.

In the opening minutes of the debate, Biden experienced several verbal missteps, struggling with a raspy voice and halting delivery as he attempted to defend his economic record and criticize Trump. The 81-year-old seemed to lose his train of thought while addressing the national debt, referring to ""billionaires"" as ""trillionaires"" before correcting himself. While arguing for increased taxes on the wealthy, Biden paused for an extended, awkward moment, seemingly unable to complete his sentence before ending his thought incoherently.

During a tense exchange on the war in Ukraine, Biden warned that he believes Vladimir Putin is a ""war criminal"" who wants to re-establish part of the ""old Soviet empire"". ""Do you think he wants to stop there [Ukraine]?....what do you think happens to Poland, to Belarus, to those Nato countries?""

is a ""war criminal"" who wants to re-establish part of the ""old Soviet empire"". ""Do you think he wants to stop there [Ukraine]?....what do you think happens to Poland, to Belarus, to those Nato countries?"" Biden also brought up a controversial moment from Trump's presidency, in which he allegedly said that fallen US soldiers were ""losers and suckers"". ""My son was not a loser and not a sucker,"" he said. ""You're the sucker. You're the loser,"" he added, addressing the former president. Trump responded that the quote was ""made up"" and he never said it.

The first presidential debate of the 2024 election season took place, with Joe Biden and his Republican challenger, Donald Trump , facing off in an attempt to persuade undecided voters.For Biden, the 81-year-old Democratic incumbent, the debate provided an opportunity to assure voters of his ability to lead the nation through various challenges. Trump , 78, sought to move past his recent felony conviction in New York and demonstrate to millions of viewers that he possesses the temperament to return to the White House.The Atlanta debate marked several firsts, including the oldest pair of presidential candidates to ever face each other and CNN's inaugural hosting of a general election presidential debate.","The two men, who make no secret of their disdain for each other, did not shake hands as they walked to their podiums at the start of the debate.

Trump's 'if we had a leader' jibe at Biden over Ukraine

In the first mega faceoff ahead of the presidential election, US President Joe Biden took on Republican candidate Donald Trump , who with the same force retorted to Biden's arguments on the range of issues concerning Afghanistan evacuation, illegal immigration, abortion, aides granted to Ukraine and the deadly Israel-Hamas that has terribly rocked Gaza for months now.The heat of rivalry appeared palpable when both candidates on Thursday walked directly to their respective podiums, avoiding a handshake. Unlike the 2020 face-off, the debate took off with fierce salvos, with both the presidential candidates accusing each other of swaying the US off track.In the debate that brought their deep hostility towards each other to the surface, Trump tore into Biden's decision to troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling it ""the most embarrassing day in the history of our country's life.""Biden, forced to defend the spiralling inflation since he assumed office, pinned the blame on Trump, claiming that when Trump left the White House ""things were in chaos"". The Republican candidate disagreed saying when the transition of power happened, ""Everything was rocking good"".Biden accused his Republican rival of exaggerating and telling lies about the state of the immigration crisis looming in the US.Biden said the idea that illegal immigrants are being welcomed in the United States is ""simply not true"".""There's no data to support what he said. Once again, he's exaggerating. He's lying,"" Biden said.Attacking Trump for appointing justices to the Supreme Court who ended Roe vs Wade, a decision which allowed abortion rights around the US, Biden said, ""It's been a terrible thing, what you've done.""Referring to women who have been raped, Biden said, ""It's just ridiculous, and they can do nothing about it.""In the vitriolic exchange of words, Biden cited incidents that Trump had described soldiers who died in the Normandy landing as ""suckers"" and noted his own son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died of cancer.""My son was not a loser, was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser,"" Biden said.Trump denied the remarks and repeatedly accused Biden of not being coherent in his remarks.Biden addressed the Republican rival as a 'convicted felon', referring to charges Trump has been facing including the hush-money case and the confidential document case among others.""The only person on this stage is a convicted felon is the man I'm looking at right now. And the fact of the matter is, what he's telling you is simply not true,"" Biden lashed out at Trump after he said some Democrats should be in prison.Trump did not directly answer if he would support an independent Palestinian state to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, while Biden pitched a plan to end the Gaza war.Biden's part of the plan included trading the hostages in exchange for Palestine prisoners and a continued ""ceasefire with additional conditions"".""The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas. “We’re still pushing hard to get them to accept,"" Biden said.Republican Donald Trump laid the blame for the Ukraine war on Biden, asserting that the invasion, or special operation as Russia calls would never have happened ""if we had a leader.""""This is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war... He's given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine, he's given $200 billion. That's a lot of money. I don't think there's ever been anything like it,"" Trump said.Both candidates agreed to hold the debate without an audience to avoid the chaos that marred the 2020 matchups. The debate's two commercial breaks offered another departure from modern practice, while the candidates have agreed not to consult staff or others while the cameras are off.Thursday's broadcast on CNN, moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, marked the earliest presidential debate in history. It was the first-ever televised presidential faceoff hosted by a single news outlet after both campaigns ditched the bipartisan commission on presidential debates, which had organised every matchup since 1988.","US President Joe Biden took on Republican candidate Donald Trump in the first mega faceoff ahead of the presidential election.

In response to the incident, Alton Parks and Recreation announced on their Facebook page that Gordon Moore Park would remain closed pending an investigation.New Frontier Materials , a building supply company, informed that the sinkhole was the result of subsidence from the subterranean mine. Michael Haynes, the Director of the Alton Parks and Recreation Department, stated: ""The mines have been here and in this area for decades and decades.

Annie, a TikTok user, slammed a sports channel for showing her and her friend having ice cream at the 2024 Men's College World Series final.

US supreme court rejects opioid settlement that shields Sackler family,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-rejects-opioid-settlement-that-shields-sackler-family/articleshow/111321390.cms,"The US supreme court has overturned a portion of Purdue Pharma 's bankruptcy agreement that would have protected members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits related to their involvement in the opioid epidemic but also would have provided billions of dollars to combat the opioid epidemic.The Sacklers, who owned and ran the company that produced Oxycontin, had agreed to contribute $6bn towards a broader settlement in exchange for extensive protection against civil claims connected to the addictive opioid.However, the supreme court determined that granting such protections to individuals who did not personally file for bankruptcy was not permitted under bankruptcy law. The decision is a win for the US government, which had opposed the deal, contending that releasing the Sacklers was an abuse of the system.Nevertheless, it raises significant questions about the settlement's future, which had garnered considerable, albeit mixed, support from many who sued the company and viewed it as the only feasible way to access the family's wealth for drug treatment and other purposes.Purdue gained notoriety in the US as the manufacturer and marketer of OxyContin, a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe despite knowing it was highly addictive and widely misused. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2019 after being hit with thousands of lawsuits from states, cities, and families. It later admitted to criminal charges, including deceiving health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors.The ruling leaves open the possibility of restarting negotiations. Cheryl Juaire, the mother of two sons who died of opioid overdoses and helped negotiate the deal as a member of the creditors' committee, said, ""There's no win-win here. If the Sacklers go to jail, that would be justice for a lot of people but it wouldn't save lives.""Abbe Gluck, a Yale Law School professor, noted that the justices were under ""a lot of pressure not to stop this money from flowing to victims."" However, she said the case served as a ""test case"" for broader legal issues, as more companies turn to bankruptcy courts to resolve claims of mass wrongs. She believes the decision is a warning against that trend, stating, ""The court is sending a signal of caution I think that should have an impact on other pending cases.""","The US supreme court has overturned a portion of Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy agreement.

EMTALA ensures that patients at hospitals receiving Medicare funding can receive emergency care. Idaho is one of six states with abortion bans that do not include exceptions to safeguard the health of pregnant women.US President Joe Biden praised the decision, stating, ""Today's supreme court order ensures that women in Idaho can access the emergency medical care they need while this case returns to the lower courts.""""No woman should be denied care, made to wait until she's near death, or forced to flee her home state just to receive the health care she needs. This should never happen in America... Yet, this is exactly what is happening in states across the country since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade,"" Biden added, referring to the 2022 decision that reversed the 1973 precedent that had recognized a constitutional right to abortion.However, the supreme court's decision, which was accidentally posted on the court's website on Wednesday, did not resolve the underlying legal dispute. Instead, the court chose to dismiss the case as ""improvidently granted.""Liberal justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a separate opinion, agreed with the decision to lift the stay but argued that the case should not have been dismissed, describing the legal situation as a ""fragile detente."" ""This court had a chance to bring clarity and certainty to this tragic situation, and we have squandered it,"" Jackson wrote.Idaho's abortion ""trigger"" law, which was passed in 2020, took effect automatically when Roe was overturned. The law prohibited nearly all abortions, with an exception only to save the mother's life, and imposed severe penalties on doctors who violate it.However, EMTALA requires Medicare-funded hospitals to ""stabilize"" patients with emergency medical conditions, which may necessitate an abortion to prevent serious health risks or organ damage.","The US supreme court issued a ruling on Thursday that allows abortions to proceed in the state of Idaho when pregnant women are experiencing medical emergencies.

However, he has secured relief in other cases, including £190 million reference and Toshakhana, and acquittal in the cypher case, according to Geo News report.Earlier in February, the district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi each to seven years in prison after the trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Bushra Bibi's former husband, Khawar Maneka, approached the court against the couple's marriage.The district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra each, to seven years in prison in February earlier this year after a trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Khawar Maneka, Bushra's ex-husband, moved the court against the couple's marriage.Khawar Maneka said that the marriage was solemnized during Bushra Bibi's iddat period, the time a woman goes into isolation after a divorce or her husband's death. Imran Khan and his wife then filed appeals, including the ones against their conviction and those seeking suspension of their sentences.Considering Khawar Maneka's repeated expression of no-confidence, the Islamabad high court (IHC), on Judge Arujmand's request, transferred the case to the court of additional district and sessions judge Muhammad Afzal Majuka.On June 25, the district and sessions court reserved its verdict on pleas against Khan and Bushra Bibi's conviction, after directions given by IHC to decide the matter of suspension of the sentences within 10 days, Geo News reported.The court had also given one month for the decision on the petition filed by the couple against their conviction. Meanwhile, Bushra Bibi had requested a decision on her plea filed in the sessions court seeking suspension of her sentence.The court will announce the reserved verdict on June 27 at 3 pm (local time) while the hearing on the couple's plea seeking annulment of their conviction in the said case will be resumed on July 2, Geo News reported.PTI has been awaiting a favorable decision as a major relief for Imran Khan, who has been acquitted in some cases or has been granted bail in others. However, it is also likely that the government will try to block his release as Pakistan prime minister's Adviser on political and public affairs Rana Sanaullah on Tuesday gave credence to the reports that the federal government was planning to register new cases against the incarcerated PTI founder.Speaking on Geo News programme 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath', Sanaullah said, ""Imran Khan's main agenda is to destabilise the country and spread chaos and anarchy in the country that's why the government will certainly try to keep him behind bars as long as possible.""Rana Sanaullah made these remarks while responding to a question on reports that the government was planning to delay the release of former Pakistan PM Imran Khan as the courts granted him relief in several cases, according to Geo News report.Sanaullah said Imran Khan ""boycotted"" parliament and launched the agitation movement against the government after the PTI government was ousted through a no-confidence motion in 2022.Pakistan PM's adviser said, ""Persistently he has only one agenda spread anarchy and mischief in the country, hence for the betterment of the country he [Imran Khan] should be kept behind bars.""

He said security forces had arrested two key militant commanders— TTP’s Nasrullah, alias Maulvi Mansoor, and Idrees, aka Irshad— and then showed a recorded statement of the former.In the video statement Nasrullah claimshe belongs to South Waziristan’s Sararogha tehsil and that he had worked from slain Baitullah Mehsud’s platform before joining TTP in 2007.He recalled that he had settled in Afghanistan’s Paktika province during the2014 military offensive in North Waziristan and had been working as an “emir” in TTP’s defence commission since 2023.He thenexplainedaplanhe had been briefed about in Jan 2024 according to which a BLA guide would take him to southern Balochistan by helping him cross the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan through Spin Boldak town. According to the militant, Bashir Zeb, commander of BLA Majeed Brigade, was complicit in the plan’s creation.Nasrullah alleged India’s intelligence agency R&AW was behind all this, that it wanted a BLA-TTP nexus, and that TTP bases be established in Khuzdar, Balochistan.“TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsudand the outfit’s defence minister, Mufti Muzahim, said we(TTP)and our friends(R&AW)have three objectives in establishing a foothold in Balochistan,” he claimed, adding: “Sabotaging CPEC projects, including targeting Chinese citizens; carrying out kidnappings for ransom to play up the matter of enforced disappearances so that intelligence agencies can be defamed; and spreading anarchy and frustration among the people by fomenting terrorist activities in Balochistan.”He claimed that Mehsud held meetings with R&AW agents at the Indian embassy in Kabul and that this was fully supported by the Afghan government.After showing Nasrullah’s video statement, Langau said, “The global community should have no doubt left that there is India behind all this.”He said that while TTP vowed to “introduce an Islamic system”, the BLA on the other hand was their “ideological opposite”. “Their nexus only means that their investor is the same who is using them from two angles,” he alleged. “If you look at the financial support or the intelligence of BLA and TTP, or their members sitting abroad, there is no doubt that RAW is funding them,” Langau alleged.","Minister Ziaullah Langau’s allegations came during a press conference in Quetta.

What they're saying

“A soft state can never gain the trust of investors,” PM Shehbaz remarked. “The responsibility of the fight against terrorism is the collective duty and the primary obligation of all state institutions. It’s not about you and me, it’s about us, we have to trample it together.”

""The campaign will be complemented by socioeconomic measures aimed at addressing genuine concerns of the people and creating an environment that discourages extremist tendencies,"" said a statement from Sharif's office.

Ihsanullah Tipu, a security analyst, noted, ""Pakistan views the use of active military force as the most effective approach to counter armed violence.""

Some analysts suggest that the operation's timing may also be influenced by domestic political and economic considerations. Asfandyar Mir of the US Institute of Peace said, ""With the election done and a government in place, and the economic situation stabilizing, Pakistani leadership probably feels confident to pursue a vigorous campaign.""

What is the main objective of

Operation Azm-e-Istehkam

?

The primary objective of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam is to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan. This includes addressing domestic security threats and dealing with armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan. The operation also aims to implement socioeconomic measures to create an environment that discourages extremist tendencies.

Why now?

The timing of the operation is linked to a dramatic increase in violent incidents over the last 18 months. Most of these attacks have been claimed by the TTP , which ended a ceasefire in November 2022.

, which ended a ceasefire in November 2022. Additionally, recent attacks targeting Chinese interests in Pakistan have further underscored the urgency of a robust military response.

Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023. Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have increased, highlighting the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ).

). Senior Chinese officials have also emphasized the need for improved security for Chinese nationals and investments in Pakistan.

How will the operation be different from previous military campaigns?

Unlike previous large-scale military operations that required mass displacement of local populations, Azm-e-Istehkam is not intended to be a kinetic large-scale military campaign. The focus will be on augmenting the efforts of armed forces with intelligence-based operations and legal measures to address terrorism-related cases. The operation is described as a “multi-domain, multi-agency, whole of the system national vision” for enduring stability.

What are the potential challenges to the success of this operation?

Security analysts highlight several challenges, including the transient nature of TTP bases in Pakistan and the risk of escalating tensions with Afghanistan if cross-border operations are conducted. Additionally, the lack of public support for security forces in provinces heavily affected by violence could hinder the operation’s effectiveness. There is also the issue of diverging approaches between Pakistan and China regarding the Taliban in Afghanistan, a report in AlJazeera said.

What has been the reaction of opposition parties to this operation?

Opposition parties, including the PTI, JUI-F, and ANP, have expressed significant criticism of the operation. They argue that it could worsen the volatile situation in border regions and have questioned the government's decision-making process, claiming it lacked sufficient consultation with parliament and local stakeholders.

How has China reacted to recent attacks targeting its nationals and investments in Pakistan?

China has expressed strong concerns over the security of its nationals and investments in Pakistan, urging the Pakistani government to take effective measures to protect them. Following attacks on Chinese engineers and installations, Chinese officials have reiterated the importance of security and the need to protect Chinese interests in the country.

Will the operation affect Pakistan’s relationship with Afghanistan?

The operation could strain already tense relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly if cross-border military actions are taken. The Taliban government in Kabul has consistently denied harboring TTP militants, and any escalation of military activities could complicate diplomatic relations further.

Since 2001, Pakistan's military has conducted many high-profile operations like ""Zarb-e-Azb"", ""Rah-e-Nijat"", ""Rah-e-Rast"" and many more against homegrown militants in border areas. It seems it's time for another military operation against militants in Pakistan. But the Pakistan military has failed to root out these militant groups time and again.However, under pressure from China, the Pakistan government has again approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability."" This initiative, announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after a review of the country's counterterrorism efforts, aims to address domestic security threats and the activities of armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.The operation comes amid heightened tensions between Islamabad and the Taliban rulers in Kabul.(With inputs from agencies)","Operation Azm-e-Istehkam aims to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan.
