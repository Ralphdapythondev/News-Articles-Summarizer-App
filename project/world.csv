'You bear responsibility of ...': Houthis issue warning to shipowners in new phase of escalating Red Sea attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/you-bear-responsibility-of-houthis-warn-shipowners-in-new-phase-of-escalating-red-sea-attacks/articleshow/113924664.cms,"An unusual email landed in the personal inbox of a senior executive at a prominent Greek shipping company just before midnight. What appeared to be a routine correspondence quickly spiraled into a significant concern, as the email cautioned that one of the company's ships traversing the Red Sea was at risk of being targeted by Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi militia .This particular ship had breached a Houthi-imposed transit ban by docking at an Israeli port, prompting the warning that it would be ""directly targeted by the Yemeni Armed Forces in any area they deem appropriate."" The email, accessed by news agency Reuters, said, ""You bear the responsibility and consequences of including the vessel in the ban list.""This was not an isolated incident. The communication marked the beginning of a series of increasingly alarming emails sent to at least six Greek shipping companies since late May, amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.Reuters quoting sources within the industry reported that this was just the tip of the iceberg in a broader campaign by the Houthis, who have launched nearly 100 attacks on vessels in the Red Sea since November, striking in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel's ongoing conflict in Gaza.The warnings escalated in severity, with one email threatening “sanctions” against entire fleets if vessels continued to disregard the Houthi transit ban. In one particularly stark communication sent from a Yemeni government domain, the message stated, “Your ships breached the decision of Yemen Armed Forces ... Therefore, punishments will be imposed on all vessels of your company.”This expansion of threats to entire shipping fleets marked a new phase in the Houthis’ tactics. Since last year, the group has ramped up its military operations, firing missiles and deploying drones against commercial ships connected to Israeli, US, and UK interests. The recent email campaign highlights the Houthis’ determination to cast a wider net, targeting Greek merchant ships even if they have little to no connection to Israel.The ramifications of these threats are profound. Greek-owned vessels account for approximately 30% of Houthi attacks on shipping, according to Lloyd’s List Intelligence data. The situation has prompted many shipping companies to reevaluate their routes. The traffic through the Suez Canal has dropped significantly, falling from around 2,000 transits per month before November 2023 to just 800 in August, as cargo vessels opt for longer, safer paths around Africa to avoid the Red Sea.Adding to the tensions, the European Union’s naval force, Aspides, confirmed in a recent closed-door meeting that the Houthis had shifted their strategy to include broader threats. They advised ship owners to disable their Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders to avoid detection, highlighting a chilling reality: the Houthis’ missile strikes have shown a staggering 75% accuracy against vessels with AIS on, compared to only 4% accuracy against those that turned it off.An executive from a shipping firm that received the Houthi threat emphasised the difficult balancing act between contractual obligations and the safety of their crews. ""If safe transit through the Red Sea cannot be guaranteed, companies have a duty to act – even if that means delaying their delivery windows,"" said Stephen Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport Workers' Federation.The ongoing threats and attacks have significantly impacted insurance rates for Western ship owners, with some insurers suspending coverage altogether. Conbulk Shipmanagement Corporation, a Greece-based firm, halted all Red Sea voyages following multiple attacks on its vessel, citing crew safety as a top priority. CEO Dimitris Dalakouras remarked at a recent shipping conference, “Once the crew is in danger, all discussion stops.”The Houthis have not completely halted traffic, offering reassurances to Chinese and Russian-owned vessels, which they do not associate with Israel.While some companies have opted to avoid the Red Sea entirely, others continue their operations, driven by binding long-term agreements or the pressing need to transfer goods in this vital region. The Red Sea remains the fastest route for delivering goods to consumers in Europe and Asia, but the increasing danger is reshaping the landscape of international shipping.","Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi militia has launched nearly 100 attacks on vessels in the Red Sea since November.

EXCLUSIVE: JD Vance FIRST Post-Debate Interview

Instead, he was just checking a timer near it to manage his speaking turns.“This thing that has gone super viral of me kind of doing the Jim from ‘The Office’ thing... I wish I could take credit for it,” Vance said. “But it’s because I guess the timer is right by the camera.”Despite it being unintentional, Vance took the attention in stride and appreciated the amusement his glances brought, saying, “It spawned a million viral memes .

"Longshore Workers: US dock workers end strike after 3 days, reach agreement to boost wages by 62%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-dock-workers-end-strike-after-3-days-reach-agreement-to-boost-wages-by-62/articleshow/113922168.cms,"Representative Image (Picture credit: AP)

Longshore workers in the United States have reached an agreement to end the work stoppage that halted shipping on the East Coast and Gulf Coast. The agreement includes a wage increase of approximately 62 percent over six years, with average wages rising from $39 per hour to around $63 per hour during the contract period, according to Reuters sources close to the situation.This marks the resolution of one of the most significant work stoppages in nearly 50 years, which disrupted the unloading of container ships from Maine to Texas. The ILA started the strike involving 45,000 port workers on Tuesday after negotiations for a new six-year contract failed.The International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) had initially sought a 77 per cent raise, while the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) proposed almost a 50 per cent raise.Both parties announced that they would extend their master contract until January 15, 2025, to address the remaining issues at the bargaining table. ""Effective immediately, all current job actions will cease and all work covered by the Master Contract will resume,"" they stated.Due to the strike, there were shortages of items such as bananas and auto parts and a backlog of ships anchored outside major ports. By Wednesday, at least 45 container vessels were unable to unload and anchored outside affected ports, up from just three before the strike began on Sunday.""After the first week, we can expect some impact on perishable products like bananas, other fruits, seafood, and coffee, meaning fewer goods are reaching consumers, potentially driving up prices,"" said Tony Pelli, global practice director for security and resilience at BSI Americas.The strike impacted 36 ports, including New York, Baltimore, and Houston, which handle a variety of containerised goods. Economists suggested that the port closures would not immediately raise consumer prices due to accelerated shipments of key goods in recent months. However, a prolonged stoppage could eventually lead to higher food prices.President Joe Biden's administration has supported the union, urging port employers to improve their offer and noting the shipping industry 's profits since the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The tentative deal represents critical progress towards a strong contract,"" Biden said on Thursday.The administration resisted calls from business groups and Republican lawmakers to use federal powers to end the strike, aiming to maintain union support ahead of the November 5 presidential election.","Longshore workers in the United States have reached an agreement to end the work stoppage that halted shipping on the East Coast and Gulf Coast.

'Worst is yet to come’: Living ‘Nostradamus’ warned of Middle East conflict—and it’s happening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/worst-is-yet-to-come-living-nostradamus-warned-of-middle-east-conflictand-its-happening/articleshow/113922238.cms,"Brazilian psychic Athos Salomé , often referred to as the "" living Nostradamus "" had warned that the tensions will escalate in the Middle East this year. Salomé claims his earlier prophecies of deadly conflict between Israel and Iran are beginning to unfold, with even darker days ahead.The Daily Star reported that he foresaw a future where geopolitical strife escalates beyond regional borders, threatening to destabilize the world.Salomé had garnered attention for his uncanny foresight, which includes predictions of major global events like the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the Covid-19 pandemic, and Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.Salomé’s prediction for a violent clash between Israel and Iran became real earlier this year. It started with an Israeli airstrike on April 1, 2024, that targeted the Iranian embassy in Syria. Less than two weeks later, on April 13, Iran retaliated by launching a massive offensive of drones and missiles at Israel. The Brazilian psychic believed this exchange is only the beginning of a far more destructive conflict.The conflict escalated significantly as Iran launched some 200 missiles on Israel earlier this week, with most of them -- but not all -- intercepted by Israeli air defences with help from allies.“The situation in Israel is currently tense and intricate, characterized by a cycle of violence deeply rooted in historical, political, and religious issues,” Salomé had said, reflecting on the fragile peace in the region.While his initial vision centered on disputes over oil resources, particularly involving the now-deceased Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, his more recent insights offered a far broader scope.""The worst is yet to come, as the great leaders, adherents of occultism, use these practices to achieve surgical precision and choose the exact moment for their attacks and major events."" The Daily Star quoted Salomé saying.According to the Daily Mail, Salomé had also suggested that modern conflicts in the Middle East may heavily rely on artificial intelligence (AI). “AI could either serve as a peacekeeping tool or exacerbate conflicts, depending on how it’s deployed,” he said.According to the psychic, both Israel and Iran may increasingly use AI to shape their military strategies, adding an unsettling dimension to the already complex hostilities.Salomé also points to a growing threat of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) strikes—a form of warfare that could cripple electronic infrastructure and lead to widespread chaos. He believes that superpowers like the United States, Russia, China, and even North Korea are edging towards the use of EMP technology.Salomé’s prophecy includes a scenario he calls the ""three days of darkness,"" a period in which EMP attacks would bring down power grids, plunging societies across the globe into turmoil. Should this vision come true, nations may find themselves grappling with the collapse of essential systems.","Athos Salomé, often referred to as the "" living Nostradamus,"" had warned that the tensions will escalate in the Middle East this year.

Diabolically smart tbh. ” he added.""That’s why I keep saying that, unless Trump wins and reverses this scam, 2024 is the last election in America. The Dem machine’s voter importation scam is the true threat to democracy, not Trump!” Elon Musk said in a post.Musk’s made the remarks alongside sharing a snipped of data, highlighting staggering increases in illegal immigrant populations across several key swing states since 2021: 401% in Georgia, 446% in North Carolina, 241% in Pennsylvania, 734% in Arizona, 562% in Nevada, 775% in Michigan, and 467% in Wisconsin. This surge, he argues, is part of a larger strategy that poses a “true threat to democracy,” similar to the concerns often raised by former President Donald Trump.The billionaire entrepreneur's comments come at a time when immigration is a hot-button issue, particularly for the Republican Party, which has consistently criticised Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of the border crisis. Trump's campaign has repeatedly targeted Harris, claiming she has overseen record numbers of undocumented migrants crossing the US border in recent years.Harris has proposed reviving bipartisan border agreements that Republicans dismantled earlier this year, yet her administration's approach continues to face backlash from conservatives who argue that more decisive action is needed.","Space X founder accuses Democratic Party of 'voter importation scam' to win swing states.

Like Epstein list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak off sessions, are doing the rounds on social media. The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior.

Doctor pleads guilty in 'Friends' star Matthew Perry's death due to drug overdose,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doctor-pleads-guilty-in-friends-star-matthew-perrys-death-due-to-drug-overdose-ketamine-queen-depression/articleshow/113889172.cms,"San Diego doctor Mark Chavez became the third person to plead guilty in the investigation surrounding Matthew Perry ’s tragic death. Dr Chavez, 54, on Wednesday took the first step in cooperation with federal prosecutors , agreeing to a plea deal that could prove pivotal in targeting larger figures believed to be responsible for Perry’s demise.The “Friends” star, who played Chandler Bing, was found dead in October 2023 from a drug overdose that has now sparked a wide-reaching investigation into the illegal distribution of ketamine .The case exposed the chilling reality of how an off-label treatment for depression spiraled into a lethal cocktail. Perry, who had battled addiction for years, sought refuge in ketamine therapy—a controversial, yet increasingly common treatment for depression. However, as his dependency grew, so did his desperation. When his legal sources dried up, Perry turned to the dark underbelly of the medical world, allegedly aided by Dr Salvador Plasencia and notorious Los Angeles dealer Jasveen Sangha, known as the “ketamine queen.”Dr Chavez, standing before US District Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett, admitted his role in this dangerous network. His admission came as prosecutors recounted how he conspired with Plasencia to distribute ketamine to Perry through fraudulent prescriptions.Chavez, who once took an oath to do no harm, found himself supplying over 22 vials and nine lozenges of the powerful anesthetic. It was this very drug that Perry's assistant would find beside the actor’s lifeless body that fateful October day.“Are you pleading guilty because you did the things the prosecutors described?” Judge Garnett asked Chavez.“Yes, your honor,” he replied.The plea agreement Chavez signed in July binds him to cooperate fully as federal prosecutors continue to build their case against Plasencia, the doctor who allegedly delivered the fatal doses, and Sangha, the woman whose reputation as a drug supplier looms large in Los Angeles. Their roles, prosecutors argue, were far more sinister, as they preyed on Perry's vulnerability in his final months. US Attorney Martin Estrada, during a press conference in August, pointed to their exploitation of Perry’s history of addiction, providing him with “amounts they knew were dangerous.”Plasencia and Sangha are the ultimate targets. Text messages between Plasencia and Chavez, revealed in court filings, shed light on the extent of their illicit operations. In one exchange, Plasencia mused about how much Perry might pay for the drugs, calling the actor a “moron” and suggesting that they make themselves his go-to suppliers. Chavez, while hesitant at first, seemed to approve—so long as they stayed away from “shady stuff"".Chavez remains free on bond until his April 2 sentencing, having surrendered his passport and medical license as part of the agreement.Outside the courtroom, Chavez’s lawyer, Matthew Binninger, spoke briefly, signaling that his client had come to terms with his role in the tragic chain of events. “Mark entered his plea of guilty and that’s now public record,” Binninger said. “You accept responsibility and then you set sentencing,” he said.","San Diego doctor Mark Chavez is the third person to plead guilty in the investigation surrounding Matthew Perry's tragic death.

India’s growing role in global oil consumption trends



Also Read |

Oil remains a vital component of the global economy, impacting geopolitical relations and national revenues. Recent tensions in the Middle East, especially the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, have led to fluctuations in international crude oil prices, underscoring the sector's ongoing volatility and potential supply disruptions.The IEA’s 2024 oil report anticipates a slowdown in global oil consumption growth in the coming years, influenced by rising electric vehicle sales, improved efficiency, reduced reliance on oil for electricity in the Middle East, and broader economic shifts.Global oil demand is projected to increase by 3.2 million barrels per day by 2030 unless stronger policy measures are taken or consumer behaviours change. According to the IEA, advanced economies are expected to see a long-term decline in oil consumption, with usage dropping from 46 million barrels per day in 2023 to below 43 million by 2030. Conversely, Asia's rapidly developing economies, particularly in transportation (India) and petrochemicals (China), will significantly drive global oil consumption.As the region's growth continues, supported by a relatively stable global economy, the IEA slightly raised its growth forecast for 2024 to 5.0%, with a steady prediction of 4.9% for 2025. To accommodate this anticipated demand, non-OPEC+ producers are expected to play a crucial role, contributing three-quarters of the global production increase by 2030. The United States alone is projected to add 2.1 million barrels per day to non-OPEC+ growth, while Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Guyana will collectively contribute an additional 2.7 million barrels per day. In contrast, OPEC+ is set to increase its production capacity by 1.4 million barrels per day between 2023 and 2030, with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Iraq leading this expansion. However, the alliance’s share of global oil production is expected to fall below 50% starting this year as non-OPEC+ nations take the lead in capacity growth.As of April 11, 2024, total world oil production reached 101.81 million barrels per day, with the top ten producing countries accounting for approximately 74.59 million barrels per day, or about 73% of global output.As of April 11, 2024, global oil consumption reached 99.95 million barrels per day, with the top ten consuming countries accounting for about 61.08 million barrels per day, or 61% of global consumption.India ranks as the world’s third-largest oil consumer, utilising approximately 5.05 million barrels per day, which accounts for 5% of global consumption. The country is expected to increase its oil demand by nearly 1.2 million barrels per day by 2030, contributing over a third of the anticipated global demand growth of 3.2 million barrels per day, according to the IEA.The report states that ""India will emerge as the largest contributor to global oil demand growth between now and 2030,"" while growth in developed economies and China is projected to slow and eventually decline. This growth is primarily driven by urbanisation, industrialization, a rising middle class eager for mobility and travel, and efforts to enhance access to clean cooking, which will collectively support the expansion of oil demand.","As of April 11, 2024, total world oil production reached 101.81 million barrels per day, with the top ten producing countries accounting for 74.59 million per day.

Malcolm Gladwell , the best-selling author ofone of the most important non-fiction books of the 21st century, is back with its dark sequelWhile discussing the new book with the Guardian, Gladwell calls out what he calls Harvard’s admission officers’ “bias towards affluent white students”.Pointing out the disparity between Harvard and an institution with a merit-based admissions process like Caltech compared to Harvard, he writes: “My suspicion is that for many people it’s unconscious, but there must be a point at which [Harvard admissions tutors] are confronting the fact that they have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their campus hasn’t become dominated by Asians and Indians.”In the book, Gladwell notes that Caltech, a highly competitive university with a merit-based admissions system, saw the proportion of Asian American students rise from 25% to 43% between 1992 and 2013.In contrast, at Harvard, where the admissions process is influenced by factors such as legacy, donor contributions, and athletic scholarships, the percentage of Asian American students has remained consistently between 15-20% during the same period. Indian applicants are even more likely to be excluded by Harvard’s application process.Gladwell goes on to argue: ""Meritocracy is one of the most beautiful inventions of the 20th century – it is a foundation of a free society.""Here are 10 other key points aboutand Malcolm Gladwell:Malcolm Gladwell was initially reluctant to revisit his debut work but ultimately chose to create an entirely new version, one that reflects today's more anxious world rather than simply updating the original.The foundational idea that social trends behave like epidemics, initially growing slowly before suddenly taking off, still holds true. However, some of Gladwell's original examples have not aged well.Gladwell now finds his earlier chapter on crime ""embarrassing,"" as he once credited New York City's crime reduction to 'broken windows' policing. He has since acknowledged that this approach led to over-policing in minority neighbourhoods and wasn't actually responsible for the drop in crime rates.Gladwell values the process of learning from errors, a trait he respects in his father. He proposes that authors should periodically reassess their original works every 25 years to stay aligned with new insights.The new book is darker and more nuanced than the original. It delves into how a small number of individuals can disproportionately influence significant events, such as the opioid crisis, where a minority of doctors were responsible for nearly half of all prescriptions.While The Tipping Point became a cultural phenomenon, Gladwell’s latest book explores how individuals with substantial influence can shape societal changes, both positively and negatively.Gladwell reflects on how male leadership failures over the past eight years make a strong case for female leaders, particularly in the current political climate.Gladwell has expressed his support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, noting a personal connection through his mother, who shares Jamaican heritage with Harris's father.He argues that recent examples of male leadership failures have made it increasingly difficult to justify misogynistic attitudes and believes that America is ready for a female president.Now living with his partner and two young daughters, Gladwell views parenting as a journey of intellectual humility. He continuously adapts his understanding of his children as they grow and sees this phase of his life as a ""productivity mechanism"" that shapes his evolving perspective.","Malcolm Gladwell's new book, ""Revenge of the Tipping Point,"" is darker and more nuanced than the original.

He was screaming, 'Jesus, Jesus, save me. Jesus. I hear you. Jesus. I'm calling upon you.""""I couldn't have asked for a better son. And he was so happy up until the very end when he was screaming for Jesus. And in that moment, I think he found joy,"" she added.The video showed the anchor, visibly shaken by the mother's account, struggling to maintain composure as the emotional weight of the story became overwhelming.While the mother further continued expressing her belief that her son sought help from a higher power, transcending the physical and human realm. She said that his faith and courage saved them, making him her hero.""He reached for something past flesh, past human, past anything that even grown adults, I think, would reach for,"" Turner told the Fox weather.""My son called out to the one God Almighty.

"Top Republican urges Biden to rush 2,000-pound bombs to Israel held up over human rights concerns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ensure-all-weapons-shipments-to-israel-top-republican-urges-biden-to-expedite-2000-pound-bombs-held-up-over-human-rights-concerns/articleshow/113921713.cms,"US Representative Michael McCaul , Republican and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , has called on President Joe Biden to expedite crucial weapons shipments to Israel .The appeal, made in a letter, highlights a stalled transfer of 2,000-pound bombs, halted for months due to human rights concerns. McCaul however noted that the time to act is now with rising tensions in the region, Reuters reported.“I urge you to act today to ensure all weapons shipments to Israel, including 2,000-pound bombs, are expedited to support our ally,” McCaul wrote in the letter.“We all wish Israel did not need these larger bombs, but they are operationally necessary,” McCaul’s letter highlighted. He pointed to the reality that both Hamas and Hezbollah are employing extensive subterranean tunnels and bunkers, necessitating bombs with the power to penetrate fortified underground structures. The weapons McCaul referred to, 2,000-pound bombs capable of devastating entire fortified areas, remain ready to be shipped but have yet to receive clearance.The delay, which has now stretched over four months, stems from concerns raised earlier this year regarding civilian casualties in densely populated Gaza. These bombs, designed to rip through thick concrete and metal, could wreak havoc in urban areas. Human rights advocates have been vocal in urging restraint, cautioning against the use of such heavy weaponry in regions where civilians could bear the brunt of the impact.However, McCaul is not alone in his calls. Many Republicans have urged the Biden administration to rethink its stance on halting the bomb shipments, arguing that Israel’s safety and its strategic position in the region should come first.“Allow these weapons, which are ready to ship, to be sent to Israel immediately,” McCaul said. His appeal comes amid fears of an expanding conflict, with Hezbollah’s involvement and Iran’s missile barrage raising the specter of a wider regional war.For months, Israel has been locked in an escalating battle with Hamas in Gaza, but more recently, its focus has shifted northward as Israeli forces target Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has been a longstanding adversary of Israel. The fragile truce seems to be on the brink of collapse, with Iran launching over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel earlier this week. The Israeli government has sworn a forceful retaliation.The Biden administration, for its part, has remained silent on McCaul’s letter so far. But with the escalating situation in the Middle East and increasing pressure from Republicans in Congress, the White House may soon have to make a difficult choice.","Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has called on President Joe Biden to expedite a stalled transfer of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel.

"Blackface: GOP Congressman faces backlash over 2006 blackface photos, claims it was 'homage to Michael Jackson'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gop-congressman-faces-backlash-over-2006-blackface-photos-claims-it-was-homage-to-michael-jackson/articleshow/113919234.cms,"Republican representative Mike Lawler (Photo: AP)

New York Congressman and Republican figure Mike Lawler is facing backlash after photographs surfaced showing him dressed in blackface at a Halloween party nearly two decades ago. The images, obtained by The New York Times , depict a 20-year-old Lawler, who is white, dressed as Michael Jackson with his face visibly darkened. The incident occurred in October 2006.Lawler, now 38, did not deny the authenticity of the images.In a statement, he showed regret but insisted that his costume was a tribute to his ""musical hero,"" Michael Jackson, rather than an intentional act of racism. “The ugly practice of blackface was the furthest thing from my mind,” he said. “Let me be clear, this is not that. It was truly the sincerest form of flattery, a genuine homage.”The congressman has often spoken about his admiration for Jackson, even recounting how he attended the pop star's 2005 trial for child molestation charges. However, the newly revealed photos are the first known instance of him darkening his skin to resemble the Black musician, a practice widely regarded as racist.The timing of the controversy could prove damaging for Lawler, who is gearing up for a tough re-election battle in a swing district. His opponent, Mondaire Jones, a Black former congressman, may seize upon the images in a race that is expected to draw national attention.The blackface photos were reportedly shared on Facebook in 2006 and later circulated among Lawler’s classmates at Manhattan College, now known as Manhattan University. Witnesses familiar with the incident told The New York Times that Lawler had borrowed bronzer from female classmates to complete the costume. One photo shows him wearing a red jacket reminiscent of Jackson's iconic ""Thriller"" video and striking a signature dance pose.Although Lawler has apologised to anyone who took offence, he maintained that his intentions were misunderstood. “I am a student of history, and for anyone who takes offence to the photo, I am sorry,” he said. “All you can do is live and learn.”Historians note that while Lawler’s costume appears to be a tribute rather than a deliberate attempt to mock or denigrate Black Americans, it remains problematic. “There’s always an entitlement — a racist privilege — behind the blackface mask,” said Dr Eric Lott, a cultural historian at the City University of New York.Dr Elizabeth Stordeur Pryor, a historian at Smith College and the daughter of comedian Richard Pryor, shared similar sentiments. “There’s a danger to it even when it might be a homage,” she said, warning that such acts cannot be dismissed as harmless, even if not intended to offend.Mike Lawler gained national prominence in 2022 after defeating a powerful Democrat in a left-leaning district.","Mike Lawler, 38, dressed as Michael Jackson at a Halloween party in 2006.

According to authorities, Abraham died from blunt force trauma in what they are treating as a homicide.An arrest warrant obtained by 'PEOPLE' revealed that Thomas was taken into custody a day later in Texas after allegedly being found driving Abraham’s car. When stopped by police , Thomas reportedly attempted to flee, crashing the vehicle into a parking lot.Surveillance footage taken from a store showed an individual driving Abraham’s vehicle shortly before it was abandoned, leading investigators to later identify Thomas as the suspect.Authorities executed a search warrant at Thomas’ Baton Rouge apartment, where they reportedly discovered evidence of a violent altercation, including blood that matched Abraham’s DNA and several sharp objects and weapons.Witnesses also told authorities they saw Thomas dragging an object wrapped in a blue tarp from his apartment, struggling as he brought it down the stairs and into what is believed to have been Abraham’s car.The relationship between the two men remains unclear, and police say there is no indication that Thomas was a client of Abraham, a life coach and licensed professional counsellor who went by the name ""Dr Nick.""""I appreciate the work done by the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's Office, Louisiana State Police and Crime Lab, Baton Rouge Police Department, U.S. Marshal's Service, and all others involved,"" said East Baton Rouge Sheriff Sid Gautreaux.

Tina Peters , the former clerk of Mesa County , Colorado , was sentenced to nine years in prison on Thursday for her involvement in a breach of her county’s voting system, amid her promotion of unfounded conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 presidential election , according to CNBC News.Peters was taken into custody immediately after judge Matthew Barrett dismissed her lawyer’s plea for her to remain free.“I’m convinced you would do it all over again if you could,” Barrett said. “You’re as defiant a defendant as this court has ever seen.”The court had previously heard how Peters, who had requested probation, was convicted in August on seven criminal counts , including attempting to influence a public servant, conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, violation of duty, and failure to comply with secretary of state requirements.Prosecutors had sought a maximum sentence of 20 years, accusing Peters of using another individual’s security badge to facilitate unauthorised access to her county’s election system.

Kamala Harris' husband denies slapping ex-girlfriend: 'Any suggestion....untrue',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-husband-denies-slapping-ex-girlfriend-any-suggestion-untrue/articleshow/113918246.cms,"After a studied silence for a day, the spokesperson of Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff confirmed to Semafor that the report of Kamala Harris' husband slapping his girlfriend in 2012 is untrue. In a statement to Semafor, a spokesperson for Emhoff said “this report is untrue,” and that “any suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false.”Doug Emhoff was the center of the storm after Daily Mail reported that Emhoff slapped his ex-girlfriend for flirting with another man in a booze-fueled assault at Cannes in 2012 -- a year before he started dating Kamala Harris.The Republican campaign pilloried him seeking Kamala Harris' withdrawal from the race on morality grounds. Right wing commentators questioned why the news item was not vastly covered by other US media while Doug's team did not issue any statement.Commentator Megyn Kelly made fun of the silence and questioned the fact that they are not even denying the allegations. The denial, however, came hours later while right-wing activist Laura Loomer claimed she has videpo evidence of the 'slapgate'.Daily Mail said three friends of the assaulted ex-girlfriend confirmed the incident that took place during 2012 Cannes in France.

Islamabad, In an effort to minimise administrative expenditures, cash-strapped Pakistan on Sunday announced to abolish about 150,000 government posts , close six ministries, and merge two others, as part of reforms agreed upon with the IMF under USD 7 billion loan deal . The International Monetary Fund on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to cut expenditures, increase tax-to GDP ratio, tax non-traditional sectors like agriculture and real estate, limit subsidies and transfer some fiscal responsibilities to provinces.Addressing the media on his return from the US, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that a programme had been finalised with the IMF, which would be the last programme for Pakistan.""We need to implement our policies to prove that it will be the last programme,"" he said, and emphasised that in order to join the G20, the economy must be formalised.The minister said right-sizing within ministries was going on and the decision to close six ministries is set to be implemented, while two ministries will be merged. ""Additionally, 150,000 posts across various ministries will be eliminated,"" Aurangzeb said.He dwelt at length on increasing tax revenues, noting that there were approximately 300,000 new taxpayers last year, and so far this year, 732,000 new taxpayers have registered, increasing the total number of taxpayers in the country from 1.6 million to 3.2 million.Aurangzeb also said that the non-filers category will be abolished and those not paying taxes will no longer be able to purchase property or vehicles.The minister claimed that the economy was moving in the right direction and the country's foreign exchange reserves had increased, reaching their highest level. He highlighted significant growth in both national exports and IT exports, and stated that investor confidence regarding the strength of the economy is a major success.Aurangzeb stated that the policy rate has been reduced by 4.5 per cent by the government after coming to power, and expressed optimism that the exchange rate and policy rate will remain as expected.""Our claim that the economy is improving is not a hollow claim because inflation has decreased due to government policies. Inflation has dropped to single digits,"" he said.Pakistan has been struggling to fix its economy for the last many years and it was close to default in 2023 but a timely loan of USD 3 billion by the IMF saved the situation.Pakistan has negotiated a long-term loan with the global lender with the hope and commitment that it would be the last loan. However, many doubt this claim as the country has already secured about two dozen loans from the Fund but failed to address the economy on a permanent basis.","Pakistan to abolish about 150,000 government posts, close six ministries, and merge two others.

UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif on Friday accused India of “massive expansion of its military capabilities” and issuing threats to cross the LoC for taking over Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, as he raised the Kashmir issue again in his UNGA address.
