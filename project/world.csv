Impact on Haitian communities

Context of haitian immigration in the US

Former President Donald Trump has ignited controversy with claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield , Ohio, are abducting and eating pets. During a televised debate on Tuesday with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump echoed inflammatory rhetoric that has sparked outrage and confusion.“There’s been talk that they’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” Trump said, referring to the town of Springfield, which has been at the center of these unsubstantiated claims.Despite the lack of evidence, Trump’s comments are part of a broader pattern of using anti-immigrant rhetoric to fuel fear and controversy.Vice President Kamala Harris responded by labeling Trump’s remarks as “extreme” and laughed off his accusations. Debate moderators quickly highlighted that city officials have dismissed the claims as false.Springfield city manager Bryan Heck's office reiterated that there are no credible reports of pets being harmed by the immigrant community. “There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed,” Heck stated.The false narrative began on September 6 with a social media post that alleged Haitian immigrants in Springfield were involved in disturbing activities involving pets. The post, which included an image of a Black man carrying a Canada goose, was quickly shared and amplified by political figures including Ohio Senator JD Vance and other Republicans. Vance’s office acknowledged that the rumors might be false, but the misinformation had already spread widely.Hours before the debate, Trump further fueled the controversy by posting provocative images on his social media platform, including one of himself surrounded by cats and geese, and another featuring armed cats in MAGA hats.Ohio Governor Mike DeWine declined to directly address the allegations, instead deferring to local officials. However, DeWine voiced support for Haitian immigrants, emphasizing his family's charitable work in Haiti.In contrast, an unrelated incident in Canton, Ohio, has been erroneously linked to the Springfield rumors. Last month, Canton police charged Allexis Ferrell with animal cruelty after she was accused of torturing and killing a cat. Ferrell, however, is not Haitian and has a history of legal troubles unrelated to immigration.Advocates for Haitian immigrants, such as Guerline Jozef of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, have condemned the spread of false narratives, calling them dangerous and harmful. “We are always at the receiving end of all kinds of barbaric, inhumane narratives,” Jozef said. White House national security spokesman John Kirby echoed this concern, noting the potential for such misinformation to incite violence against innocent people.Springfield, with a population of around 60,000, has seen a rise in its Haitian community. Most Haitians in the area are legally residing under a federal program allowing temporary stay due to unsafe conditions in Haiti. The Biden administration recently extended temporary legal status to approximately 300,000 Haitians in the U.S. due to ongoing violence in their home country.","Former President Donald Trump ignited controversy with claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are abducting and eating pets.

CNN had noted that Harris handled Pence's interruptions with composure, avoiding the emotional and angry stereotypes often ascribed to women, particularly women of color.In the current debate, Trump seized on Harris’ apparent policy inconsistencies, saying, “She’s been against fracking for 12 years. Defund the police? She’s been against that forever. She gave up all that stuff, very wrongly, very horribly. And everybody’s laughing at it.”Harris attempted to respond, but Trump continued, ""She went out in Minnesota and wanted to let criminals who killed people and burned down Minneapolis out of jail.

US presidential debate: Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have taken the stage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia for their highly anticipated debate. This is the first time the two candidates have met in person.As the debate commenced, Harris walked over to Trump’s podium to extend her hand, and the two engaged in a brief handshake.With this symbolic gesture, the debate officially began, marking a significant moment in this election cycle.This debate comes months after President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the election on July 21 and endorsed Vice President Harris.Here's who said what-Kamala Harris, facing scrutiny from the White House regarding the economy, emphasized her upbringing as a ""middle class kid"" and expressed her commitment to fostering an ""opportunity economy."" She strongly denounced President Trump's policies, arguing that they would lead to increased financial burdens for the American people. “I believe in the ambition, the aspiration, the dreams of the American people,” she said. She touted her plans to build an “opportunity economy,” including her proposals to make housing more affordable and expand the child tax credit.Kamala Harris said their administration had to “clean up Donald Trump’s mess” after his four years in the White House.She accused Trump of leaving the US with “the worst unemployment since the great depression,” “the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War,” and “the worst public health epidemic in a century.”Meanwhile, former President Trump refuted Harris's assertion that he intends to impose a ""sales tax"" on everyday items, labeling her claim as an ""incorrect statement.""Trump clarified, ""She knows that we're doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world.""He further elaborated, ""And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off because it was so much money.""Kamala Harris criticised Trump's stance on abortion rights, asserting that he should not dictate what a woman does with her body. She expressed her support for reinstating Roe v Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that had previously protected abortion rights nationwide.Harris highlighted the consequences of the Trump abortion bans, which have been implemented in more than 20 states. These bans criminalize healthcare providers, such as doctors and nurses, for offering abortion services. In one state, the penalty for providing such care can result in life imprisonment. Shockingly, these bans make no exceptions, even in cases of rape or incest.""Trump abortion bans that make no exception, even for rape and incest, which, understand what that means, a survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body,"" Harris said.She further condemned the bans as immoral, stating that one does not need to compromise their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government, and especially Donald Trump, should not have the authority to control a woman's bodily autonomy.""Next, that is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,"" Harris asserted. She pledged to sign legislation that would restore the protections provided by Roe v Wade, should Congress approve such a measure.Trump has expressed his stance on abortion, stating in an April video on his Truth Social platform that ""states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land."" This position aligns with the recently updated Republican National Committee platform.Notably, the platform does not include any mention of a nationwide ban on abortion, a policy that certain social conservative factions had hoped to see incorporated. However, Trump has openly declared his opposition to such a ban at the federal level, instead favoring leaving the decision to individual states.Donald Trump called Kamala Harris a “Marxist” and said that her father was also a Marxist professor. It is pertinent to mention that he was a retired Stanford University economist.“If she ever got elected, she’d change it. And it will be the end of our country. She’s a Marxist; everybody knows she’s a Marxist. Her father is a Marxist professor in economics, and he taught her well,” Trump said.Donald Trump slammed Kamala Harris and Biden administration over illegal migration into the US and claimed that she is destroying the country. ""She is destroying this country. We will become Venezuela on steroids if she becomes president,"" Donald Trump said.""You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio. You look at Aurora in Colorado, they are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently. These are the people that she and Biden led into our country, and they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality. And we have to get them out,"" he said.Meanwhile, Harris has quickly started to try to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record during her campaign and outlined her policies.Donald Trump again claimed that pets were being stolen from their houses by Haitian immigrants who were consuming the pets.""In Springfield they are eating dogs, cats. They are eating the pets of the people who live there. We will end up being Venezuela on steroids,"" he said. However ABC news anchor corrected him saying that they reached out to the city manager of Springfield, Ohio and he denied all reports of pets being attacked.On being asked about being regretful about the January 6 riots, Trump said that he offered to give soldiers to then White House speaker Nancy Pelosi to fight against the rioters but she refused to accept it.""I have nothing to do with that other than that they asked me to make a speech. Nancy Pelosi is fully responsible for that.""Reacting on Trump's comments on Capitol attack, the vice president said, ""I was at the Capitol on January 6. The President of the US incited a violent mob to attract our nation's capital, to desecrate our nation's capital.""“On that day, 140 law enforcement officers were injured and some died,” she said. “And understand the former president has been indicted and impeached for exactly that reason. But this is not an isolated situation.”The former president Trump again claimed that the Israel will be gone under Kamala's administration. ""She hates Israel. She didn't even meet Netanyahu when he visited Congress. She also hates the Arab population. Look at what is happening in the middle east. This would have never happened if I were president.""Refuting his claims, the vice president said, ""That's absolutely not true. I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people.""She also said that Israel “has the right to defend itself,” adding “we would” if the United States were attacked. The vice president went on to advocate for a “two-state solution.”On being asked whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war against Russia, Trump responded, “I want the war to stop and want to save lives,” declining to take sides between Russia and Ukraine. Meanwhile, the vice president claimed that if Trump become the president, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be sitting in Ukraine.""I think why Donald Trump says this war would be over in 24 hours because he would give it up. If Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now,"" Kamala said.""Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland,"" Harris said, noting ""how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch.""Harris said it was an example of why America's NATO allies were thankful he was no longer in office, as she and Biden have sent tens of billions of dollars to help Kyiv fend off Russia's invasion.Trump claimed that the vice president has a plan to confiscate everybody's gun. Refuting the claims, Harris said, ""Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away so stop with the continuous lying about this stuff.""Racial divideOne of the most talked about Harris was her ethnicity, race. Earlier, in several rallies, Trump called upon Harris for being black and Asian woman.Answering to question why he had publicly questioned Harris’ dual heritage as a Black and South Asian woman, Trump said, “I don’t care what she is ... I read that she was Black. Then I read that she was not Black.”Asked to respond, Harris accused Trump of using race to divide Americans throughout his career. She cited how he and his father turned away Black renters in the 1970s and how Trump led the public outcry against five young Black and Latino men who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a jogger in New York City's Central Park in 1989.More recently, he openly questioned whether President Barack Obama was a US citizen, Harris noted.""I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has, consistently, over the course of his career, attempted to use race to divide the American people,"" she said.Harris emphasised that the American people deserve better than a leader who persistently encourages citizens to point fingers at one another. ""I think the American people want better than that,"" Harris added. ""We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other.""In response to the criticism, Trump shifted the focus back to economic matters and attempted to associate Biden's economic policies with Harris, suggesting that she was trying to distance herself from Biden. ""She's trying to get away from Biden,"" he said.Seizing the opportunity presented by the attack, Harris positioned herself as a transformative leader for the nation, emphasizing her unique identity and leadership style. ""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and certainly not Donald Trump,"" Harris said, ""and what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country.""","Kamala Harris said their administration had to “clean up Donald Trump’s mess” after his four years in the White House. Trump refuted Harris's assertion that he intends to impose a ""sales tax"" on everyday items, labeling her claim as an ""incorrect statement""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113242615,imgsize-30612,width-400,resizemode-4/113242615.jpg"

Details of the alleged relationship and power dynamics

Political context and responses

California State Senator Marie Alvarado-Gil, who represents the 4th State Senate district, is facing serious allegations in a new lawsuit. The complaint accuses Alvarado-Gil of forcing her former chief of staff, Chad Condit , into performing sexually explicit acts that allegedly led to severe injuries.Marie Alvarado-Gil, born on December 24, 1973, is a prominent American educator and politician.Representing California's 4th State Senate district, she has been a notable figure in California politics since her election to the California State Senate in 2022. Initially a member of the Democratic Party , Alvarado-Gil made headlines with her switch to the Republican Party on August 8, 2024.Alvarado-Gil is known for her fiscal conservatism, frequently aligning with Republicans on labor issues while maintaining progressive stances on social issues. Her career and policy positions reflect a complex blend of ideologies that have both drawn support and sparked controversy.Alvarado-Gil has faced significant health challenges, including a diagnosis of cervical cancer and metastatic thyroid cancer in 2018. She successfully overcame these health battles by 2019. Additionally, she is the mother of two children with special needs, which has profoundly influenced her perspectives on various issues.The 39-page complaint detailed a “sex-based quid pro quo relationship,” with Condit claiming he was coerced into sexual acts during work-related travel to retain his job, according to the suit filed in Sacramento Superior Court, as reported by Sky News.The lawsuit allegeed that during one particularly harrowing encounter, Condit was forced to perform oral sex on Alvarado-Gil in a car, leading to a debilitating back injury. Court documents reveal that Condit suffered three herniated discs and a collapsed hip due to the physical strain of the act.“This was a sex-based quid pro quo relationship of unwelcome advances and sexual behaviors coupled with punishment and flexing of power,” the lawsuit stated. Condit also claims that resistance to Alvarado-Gil’s advances led to retaliation, including a disciplinary letter accusing him of inappropriate behavior and his eventual firing in December.According to the complaint, Condit met Alvarado-Gil in 2022 after losing a primary election for the California assembly. Alvarado-Gil, having been elected as state senator that year, hired Condit as her chief of staff. The lawsuit alleges that Alvarado-Gil began “grooming” Condit with intimate details about her personal life and compared him to his father, former Democratic Representative Gary Condit, who was involved in a high-profile scandal in the early 2000s, reported the Sky News.The complaint further alleges that Alvarado-Gil exerted increasing control over Condit by involving him in personal errands, such as transporting her children and caring for her dog. “This growing control and exercise of power by [Alvarado-Gil] further conditioned [Condit] into an unequal and subservient position,” the lawsuit reads. The complaint describes how Alvarado-Gil allegedly established a dominant-submissive relationship, culminating in sexual advances during a trip to Inyo County.Alvarado-Gil’s recent defection from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party has stirred additional controversy. She criticized the Democratic Party as “unrecognizable” from what she once knew, and in the lawsuit, she is portrayed as an “erratic” and “controlling” boss who exploited her position of power.Her attorney, Ognian Gavrilov, has strongly denied the allegations, calling them “fabricated” and “financially motivated.” Gavrilov argues that the claims are a desperate attempt by a disgruntled former employee to secure a financial payout.","California State Senator Marie Alvarado-Gil is facing serious allegations in a new lawsuit.

How to watch the Lunar Eclipse 2024

The 2024 Lunar Eclipse, or Chandra Grahan , is an eagerly awaited celestial event. Scheduled for September 18, 2024, this second lunar eclipse of the year promises to captivate skywatchers globally. However, the event won’t be visible in India, as the Moon will remain below the horizon throughout the eclipse.A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth aligns between the Moon and the Sun, casting a shadow on the Moon.This shadow can darken the Moon and occasionally give it a reddish hue. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are visible from many regions around the world, contingent on clear skies and the timing of the event.The second lunar eclipse of 2024 will take place on September 18. While this event will be a visual treat for many, it will not be observable from India due to the Moon’s position below the horizon during the eclipse.No, the eclipse will not be visible in India. The other places where observers can witness the eclipse will be in Europe, Africa, North and South America, and parts of Asia will have the chance to witness it. Clear skies will provide the best viewing conditions.Even though the eclipse won’t be visible in India, here are the local timings for the various phases according to Indian Standard Time (IST):Despite these timings, the Moon will be below the horizon in India, making it impossible to observe the eclipse.In India, the Chandra Grahan holds religious significance, even if not visible. The sutak kaal, a period deemed inauspicious, begins several hours before the eclipse starts. For the September eclipse, this period will commence on the night of September 17. During this time, many people follow specific religious practices, including advising pregnant women to remain indoors and avoid certain activities.While the eclipse won’t be visible from India, viewers in other parts of the world can enjoy the spectacle. For those unable to witness it firsthand, many observatories and space agencies will offer live streams of the event online.The September 18, 2024, lunar eclipse is a much-anticipated event globally, even if it’s not visible in India.

What's in a name?

The asteroid 99942 Apophis , dubbed the "" God of Chaos "" for its menacing potential, is making headlines once more. As Earth prepares for an unprecedented celestial rendezvous in 2029, Nasa 's latest revelations promise to keep our eyes on the skies.Discovered in 2004 by astronomers at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Apophis quickly rose to notoriety.With a diameter of approximately 1,100 feet (335 meters), it was initially deemed one of the most dangerous near-Earth objects. The asteroid was predicted to come perilously close to Earth in 2029, sparking fears of a potential collision. This forecast, however, has been revised as astronomers tracked Apophis with increasing precision.The breakthrough came in March 2021. Using the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex and the Green Bank Telescope, scientists gathered high-resolution radar data that allowed them to accurately map Apophis's orbit.Apophis, classified as an S-type asteroid, is composed of silicate materials mixed with nickel and iron. Its shape, resembling a ""peanut,"" adds to the intrigue. Scientists are keen to understand its rotation and structural dynamics, including its potential for ""asteroid quakes"" due to gravitational interactions.On April 13, 2029, Apophis will pass within 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) of Earth's surface—closer than the geostationary satellites that orbit the planet. This close approach will offer a rare, unfiltered view of the asteroid for those in the Eastern Hemisphere. ""Although Apophis made a recent close approach with Earth, it was still nearly 10.6 million miles away,"" explained JPL scientist Marina Brozovic. ""We were able to acquire incredibly precise information about its distance, setting up a wonderful science opportunity.""The recent surge in attention is largely due to reports of Nasa broadcasting a live feed of Apophis , offering a rare glimpse at an asteroid of this magnitude as it hurls through space. However, this claim is incorrect.Although NASA and other astronomers are actively monitoring Apophis due to its close approach to Earth in 2029, there is no continuous live feed dedicated to tracking the asteroid.The potential changes in its trajectory can be tracked on Nasa's official website Experts, however, are reassuring the public that despite the asteroid's nickname, the chances of a collision remain incredibly slim — at least this time around.“Apophis is not on a direct collision course with Earth in 2029,” said Dr Sarah Thompson, a leading astrophysicist at Nasa, according to media reports. “But we’re watching closely, as space objects can have unpredictable behavior over time.”“It’s a one-in-a-million shot, but it’s there,” Dr Thompson added. “We’re using every resource we have to calculate its movements and ensure we’re not taken by surprise.”However, Davide Farnocchia of Nasa’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, said the extensive analysis confirmed that the asteroid poses no threat for at least the next century. ""A 2068 impact is not in the realm of possibility anymore,"" said Farnocchia.As per media reports, if Apophis were to ever strike Earth, the results would be catastrophic. An impact from an asteroid of this size would release energy equivalent to over 1,200 megatons of TNT—enough to flatten entire cities. The event would have both local and global effects, from tsunamis to severe atmospheric disruptions.In anticipation of this close encounter, Nasa has repurposed its OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, now dubbed OSIRIS-APEX, for a detailed study of Apophis. After successfully completing its mission to collect samples from asteroid Bennu in 2023, OSIRIS-APEX will fly by Apophis on April 23, 2029, and then conduct an 18-month investigation. The spacecraft will map Apophis’s surface, analyze its composition, and observe any changes triggered by the flyby.Formed over 4.6 billion years ago, Apophis is a remnant from the early solar system. Its journey from the main asteroid belt to its current near-Earth orbit was shaped by planetary forces, particularly Jupiter's gravity.Named after the ancient Egyptian demon of chaos, Apophis continues to captivate scientists and the public alike. As we prepare for the asteroid’s close approach, it reminds us of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of our solar system.","Asteroid 99942 Apophis, dubbed the "" God of Chaos "" for its menacing potential, is making headlines once more.

PM Modi hasn't handled China well: Rahul Gandhi in Washington,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pm-modi-hasnt-handled-china-well-claims-chinese-troops-occupying-delhi-sized-territory-in-ladakh-rahul-gandhi-in-washington/articleshow/113243682.cms,"LIVE: Shri Rahul Gandhi interacts with the media at the National Press Club, Washington DC, USA.

NEW DELHI: Leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government over the ongoing border standoff with China, stating that the situation has been mishandled. Speaking at the National Press Club Washington on Wednesday, during his visit to the United States, Gandhi remarked, ""We've got Chinese troops occupying land the size of Delhi in Ladakh, and I think that's a disaster.""Rahul expressed concerns about the presence of Chinese troops in Indian territory and questioned how any government could consider that situation to be well-managed.""We've got Chinese troops occupying land the size of Delhi in Ladakh, and I think that's a disaster. The media doesn't like to write about it. How would America react if a neighbour occupied 4,000 square kilometers of its territory? Would any president be able to get away with saying he's handled that well? So, I don't think Mr Modi has handled China well at all. I see no reason why Chinese troops should be sitting in our territory,"" he said.The border standoff between India and China has been ongoing since May 2020 when Chinese troops attempted to alter the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. The conflict escalated with a violent clash between the two sides in the Galwan Valley. Since then, Indian forces have been stationed in forward positions, with more than 50,000 soldiers deployed along the LAC to prevent further Chinese incursions.Gandhi also addressed broader issues of economic development and emphasized the need for a decentralized, democratic vision of production in contrast to China's centralised manufacturing model. He criticised India's current over-reliance on a services-based economy, arguing that the country cannot generate enough employment without a strong manufacturing base.""We don't want to do it like the Chinese are doing it. We don't want to do it in an environment which is non-democratic, which is not liberal. So the real question for the 21st century, the Chinese have placed a production vision on the table. It's a non-democratic production vision. Can the United States and India answer that by placing a vision for production in a democratic free society? And I think that's where a lot of answers lie,"" he said.""For a country like India to simply say that we're going to ignore manufacturing and only run a services-based economy means you cannot give employment to people,"" Gandhi stated. He called for a vision that embraces production in a democratic and liberal society, highlighting that both India and the United States have an opportunity to reclaim their roles as global producers.Gandhi advocated for supporting small and medium-sized businesses and reviving traditional industries across India. ""Each area in India has its own specialty of production. For example, Ballari in Karnataka has a deep textile industry that has been destroyed. We are looking at these pockets of excellence and trying to bring modern technology and financial support to build them,"" he explained.He said that not manufacturing enough means, not enough employment can be generated. Rahul further added that there is a huge opportunity for both India and the US to regain the ability to produce.""Here in the United States that the West, America, Europe, and India, the West used to be the producer of the world. If you wanted to buy a car, in the 60s, you bought an American car, washing machine, refrigerator...You guys were at the forefront of that. And then somewhere along the line, America decided, India decided, and the West decided that we're just going to stop. And we handed the whole thing to the Chinese. Now for a country like India, to simply say that we're going to ignore manufacturing, and only run a services-based economy, it means you cannot give employment to people,"" said Rahul Gandhi.""I am more interested in the act of production- also called manufacturing. Look at what most American, Indian and European countries do. They organize consumption. Uber organizes consumption. Organizing consumption is easy. Organizing production is a completely different ballgame, much more complicated. You have to deal with things when you organize production that you simply don't have to deal with when you organize production. So to me, there's a huge opportunity for India and the United States to regain that ability to produce,"" he further added.In contrast to China’s model of large, centralized factories, Gandhi proposed a more decentralised production system, where small and medium businesses are empowered with modern technology. His party is already testing some of these ideas in the Congress-governed states of Karnataka and Telangana, focusing on revitalizing traditional industries like textiles.Rahul Gandhi’s criticism of the Modi government extended to domestic economic policies as well, particularly the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few large business conglomerates. He pointed out that the current economic model was monopolizing Indian industries and harming the country’s productivity.During his interaction, Gandhi also addressed his role as the Leader of the Opposition and the ideological battle between the INDIA alliance and the BJP-RSS. He vowed to defend India's institutions and protect the rights of marginalized communities, including lower castes, tribals, and minorities.Rahul’s US visit included interactions with the Indian diaspora, students, faculty, and US lawmakers, marking his first trip to the US since becoming the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.","Rahul Gandhi criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government over the ongoing border standoff with China.

Giant plumes of smoke dot Southern California skies as crews fight several major wildfires,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/giant-plumes-of-smoke-dot-southern-california-skies-as-crews-fight-several-major-wildfires/articleshow/113242823.cms,"TRABUCO CANYON: Apocalyptic-looking plumes of smoke dotted skies over parts of Southern California on Tuesday as firefighters continued to battle at least three major wildfires that erupted amid a blistering heat wave and were threatening tens of thousands of homes and buildings.In Orange County, firefighters used bulldozers, helicopters and planes to control a rapidly spreading blaze that started Monday and spread to about 3 square miles (8 square kilometers) in only a few hours.The blaze was ignited by a spark from heavy equipment being used by public workers, officials said.By Tuesday, it had charred more than 14 square miles (36 square kilometers) and was heading over mountainous terrain into neighboring Riverside County with no containment, said Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdi. It burned some communications towers on top of a peak, though so far officials said they did not have reports of the damage disrupting police or fire communication signals in the area.Two firefighters who suffered heat-related injuries and a resident who suffered from smoke inhalation were treated at a hospital and released.Sherri Fankhauser, her husband and her daughter set up lawn chairs and were watching helicopters make water drops on a flaming hillside a few hundred yards away from their Trabuco Canyon home on Tuesday.They didn't evacuate even though their street had been under a mandatory evacuation order since Monday. A neighbor did help Fankhauser's 89-year-old mother-in-law evacuate, Fankhauser said. The flames died down last night but flared up again in the morning.""You can see fire coming over the ridge now,"" Fankhauser said Tuesday afternoon. ""It's getting a little scarier now.""She said she trusted the crews would get things under control and that firefighters were keeping them informed.Meanwhile, in the San Bernardino National Forest , about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, some 65,600 homes and buildings were under threat, including those under mandatory evacuations and those under evacuation warnings, nearly double the number from the previous day.Residents along the southern edge of Big Bear Lake were told to leave the area Tuesday night, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. It's unclear how many people were affected in the area, which is a popular destination for anglers, bikers and hikers.The blaze had charred about 44 square miles (114 square kilometers) of grass and brush and blanketed the area with a thick cloud of dark smoke Tuesday. The acrid air prompted several districts in the area to close schools through the end of the week because of safety concerns. Three firefighters have been injured since the blaze was reported Thursday, state fire managers said.The fire was 14% contained and was affecting small mountain towns where Southern California residents ski in the winter and mountain bike in the summer.Other major fires were burning across the West, including in Idaho, Oregon and Nevada, where about 20,000 people had to flee a blaze outside Reno.Firefighters hope to gain the upper hand as cooler weather moves into California later in the week.An excessive heat warning issued for the Los Angeles area will expire Tuesday night.Another blaze in Southern California's Angeles National Forest, north of the city of Glendora , in Los Angeles County, grew to more than 4 square miles (12 square kilometers) and wasn't contained at all as of Tuesday.The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department ordered visitors at a campground and residents of an adjacent river community to evacuate, the US Forest Service said.In Northern California, a fire measuring less than a square mile (2.6 square kilometers) that started Sunday burned at least 30 homes and commercial buildings and destroyed 40 to 50 vehicles in Clearlake City, 110 miles (117 kilometers) north of San Francisco, officials said. Roughly 4,000 people were forced to evacuate by the so-called Boyles Fire, which was about 40% contained Monday afternoon.In Nevada, the uncontained Davis Fire burning about 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) outside Reno grew to about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) after igniting Sunday. It originated in the Davis Creek Regional Park in the Washoe Valley and was burning in heavy timber and brush, firefighters said.An emergency declaration issued for Washoe County by Gov. Joe Lombardo on Sunday noted that about 20,000 people were evacuated from neighborhoods, businesses, parks and campgrounds. Parts of south Reno remained under the evacuation notice on Monday and some homes, businesses and traffic signals in the area were without power.In Idaho, fire managers were prepared for an active day, with warm, dry and windy conditions and even more challenges on Tuesday. The Boulder and the Lava Fires are burning in western Idaho.In central Oregon, several blazes prompted evacuation warnings, including one west of Mount Bachelor in the Deschutes National Forest.","In Orange County, firefighters use bulldozers, helicopters and planes to control a rapidly spreading blaze that started Monday.

The outcomes of these votes could potentially influence presidential elections in swing states, control of Congress, and closely contested state offices. Missouri Democrats hope the amendment will boost voter turnout among abortion-rights supporters in the November election.Mary Catherine Martin , a lawyer for the Thomas More Society, the group that filed the lawsuit opposing the measure, told judges on Tuesday that the wording of Amendment 3 would ""absolutely mislead"" voters.""The average voter reading this would have no way of knowing that it has a limiting effect"" on the state legislature's ability to regulate abortion, Martin said, according to the Washington Post.Under state law, the ballot measure needs support from at least 50% of voters to pass.

A video of California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell reacting to viral memes of Donald Trump with cats and ducks has taken the internet by storm.

Although the theory has been debunked by local police, the memes have continued to spread, projecting Trump as a protector of animals.In the viral clip, Swalwell is seen with one of the memes, posted by Republican House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan , displayed behind him.Clearly exasperated, Swalwell exclaims, ""What in the hell is this?"" He then addressed Jordan directly, saying, ""The chairman tweets to protect our ducks and kittens in Ohio because he’s gone down some crazy rabbit hole… My god, are you okay, Mr. Chairman?""The conspiracy theory that triggered the memes had gained traction on social media but was swiftly debunked by police in Springfield, Ohio.

Trump vs Harris: Betting markets reveal who’s expected to win the US presidential debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-harris-betting-markets-reveal-whos-expected-to-win-the-us-presidential-debate/articleshow/113242140.cms,"While Harris is predicted to take the upper hand in the debate, there’s a twist—Trump is still favored to win the overall election.

Debate impact versus election reality

The anticipation for the first presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday night is sky-high, with betting markets already identifying Harris as the likely winner of the showdown.According to the Fox News , traders on Polymarket , a popular prediction platform, gave Harris a 75% chance of dominating the debate, compared to Trump’s 25%.Similarly, BetUS favored Harris with a 68.75% chance of success, leaving Trump trailing with odds of 39.22%.While Harris is predicted to take the upper hand in the debate, there’s a twist—Trump is still favored to win the overall election. According to BetUS, Trump has a 54.55% implied probability of securing victory in the presidential race, compared to Harris' 52.38%. Polymarket echoes this sentiment, giving Trump a 52% chance of winning the election, with Harris at 45%.These forecasts create an intriguing paradox: The vice president is poised to win the debate but faces an uphill battle in the broader race. Real Clear Politics ’ average of six betting markets shows Trump leading Harris with a 51.7% chance of clinching the presidency, compared to her 46.7%. However, PredictIt offers a slightly different take, giving Harris a 53% chance of winning the election and Trump a 52% chance.Rutgers University’s Harry Crane, an expert on prediction markets, explained the apparent disconnect. He pointed out that platforms like Polymarket often rely on polling data from Ipsos/538, which tend to lean more liberal, favoring Harris in debates.

Imran’s flock detained after protest for his release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imrans-flock-detained-after-protest-for-his-release/articleshow/113240529.cms,"ISLAMABAD

:

Pakistani police have detained several leaders and lawmakers of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) from parliament’s compound, days after the party held a rally and served a two-week ultimatum for the release of the jailed former PM. The detentions followed alleged violation of norms during the rally.In a separate development, Ali Amin Gandapur , chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) from Imran’s PTI, went missing from Islamabad for eight hours Monday and emerged in his provincial capital Peshawar Tuesday.Sources revealed Gandapur was in the custody of an intelligence agency and added that the CM of the northwestern province was quizzed for hours before his release early Tuesday.Gandapur came under fire for a tirade against the military during PTI’s protest-cum-power show Sunday in Islamabad’s suburbs. “Fix your institution, fix your generals, fix yourself. If the founder of PTI (Imran) is not legally released within one to two weeks, we will have him freed ourselves,” the CM vowed.While several PTI lawmakers apologised for Gandapur’s remarks, Imran defended him, saying he had merely expressed the nation’s sentiments. “Party members who have apologised for Gandapur’s remarks are weak and cowards. They should not remain in PTI,” Imran was quoted as saying at his prison in Rawalpindi.Last week, the federal govt passed a law to “regulate” public gatherings in Islamabad. It set three-year jail terms for participants of “illegal” assemblies, with 10 years for repeat offenders. The Islamabad administration had allowed PTI’s Sunday’s rally from 4pm till 7pm, but the gathering went on until 11pm. “They were arrested due to violation of the new law,” Islamabad police spokespersonTaqi Jawad said, referring to PTI arrests, including that of chairman Gohar Khan .Since his removal from power in April 2022, Imran and his PTI have waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against the military.The PTI says it has faced a months-long crackdown since protesters allegedly linked to the party attacked and damaged govt and military installations on May 9, 2023, after Khan’s brief arrest that day in a land graft case. Hundreds of PTI arrests followed. Many remain behind bars. The military, which says Imran and his party were behind the attacks, has initiated army court trials of at least 103 people accused of involvement in the violence.In Feb this year, Imran and PTI were barred from the national election, which was alleged to have been rigged. Candidates aligned with the party, forced to contest independently, still won most seats in parliament but not enough to form the govt. PTI alleged that its mandate was “stolen” by PM Shebaz Sharif’s governing coalition with the all-powerful military’s backing.

Several top leaders of Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad. The arrests included barrister Gohar Khan, Sher Afzal Marwat, and advocate Shoaib Shaheen, following a violent clash between PTI supporters and police during a protest demanding Khan's release. The arrests have been widely condemned by PTI as politically motivated.PTI has vehemently opposed the arrests, calling them a ""direct attack on democracy."" In posts on X (formerly Twitter), the party criticised the government's actions, arguing that the arrests are an attempt to suppress their movement.PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari condemned the detentions as ""illegal"" and said, ""These arrests won’t change anything; they will only increase public anger against this puppet government.""Omar Ayub Khan, another senior PTI figure, also denounced the arrests and revealed that police had been forming teams to apprehend him and other top PTI members, including Zartaj Gul Wazir . ""This fascist regime has gone completely mad... We will continue raising our voices for our leader, PM Imran Khan ,"" he wrote on X.Despite the crackdown, many PTI lawmakers remained inside Parliament House to avoid arrest, and more detentions are expected in the coming days. The Islamabad high court bar association has also condemned the arrests, demanding the release of Marwat and Shaheen, both respected members of the legal community.The arrests occur amidst growing political tension in Pakistan. Imran Khan, who has been imprisoned since 2022 on corruption charges, remains a central figure in the country's political landscape. His supporters’ continued protests and the government’s aggressive response have only heightened the political discord.The arrests were made under the newly enacted Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Bill, 2024. This legislation, which came into effect just before the PTI rally, empowers authorities to regulate and ban public gatherings in Islamabad. Under this law, the district magistrate can disband any assembly deemed likely to disturb public peace, with penalties including up to three years in prison or fines. Repeat offenders face even harsher penalties, potentially extending to 10 years of imprisonment. The PTI leaders were accused of violating these regulations by inciting their supporters to clash with police during the protest.","Top leaders of Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad.

At least 16 more Taliban members were wounded in the clash, the second since last week along one of the 18 border crossings linking Pakistan's Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces with Afghanistan in the southwest and northwest.Confirmation of the Taliban casualties by Pakistan's state-owned media contrasted with a statement by Afghanistan that unprovoked firing and shelling from across the border caused civilian deaths and displacement.Pakistan said the fighting started after the Taliban attempted to illegally set up a checkpoint near the border. Light and heavy weapons were used by both sides, officials said.“Afghan Taliban opened unprovoked firing with heavy weapons yesterday from inside Afghanistan, targeting Pakistani checkpoints,"" Radio Pakistan reported Monday. ""Pakistani security forces responded effectively and killed eight Afghan Taliban, including commanders Khalil and Jan Muhammad .""Scores of families along the Durand Line, the 2,640km border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, have fled their homes due to repeated clashes between the Islamic Emirate forces and the Pakistani military.""We have two casualties, one of them a woman, and about 11 wounded,"" Thamin Khan , a resident of Zazi Maidan district, was quoted as saying by official Afghan media.""Bullets struck our homes and it is unclear what will happen next. This situation has caused problems for us, forcing many to migrate,"" Mohibullah, another resident of the conflict zone, said.Videos circulating on social media showed heavy gunfire in the area.Khost's deputy governor directed residents and the forces stationed along the Durand Line to respond appropriately to any attacks, while the Afghan deputy minister for borders and tribal affairs said in Kabul that the latest dispute had been resolved. Pakistan military's media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations, hadn't responded to the claim till late Monday.Clashes between Afghan Taliban and Pakistani forces have occurred frequently along the Durand Line, a disputed border, in recent years, often resulting in casualties on both sides.Of the 18 border crossings, Chaman and Torkham are the busiest. Clashes often lead to closure of these border crossings, disrupting trade and movement of people. The Torkham border has been shut for the past three days after Afghan Taliban announced they were investigating reports of Pakistani fighter jets violating Afghan airspace to patrol Nangarhar and Kunar provinces.Pakistani officials have accused the Afghan Taliban of sheltering the banned militant group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

How costly is a cup of tea in Kabul? Ask Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/how-costly-is-a-cup-of-tea-in-kabul-ask-pakistan-terrorism-ttp-imran-khan-taliban-afghanistan/articleshow/113190988.cms,"'Missteps by Imran Khan govt'



Strategy backfires

NEW DELHI: In an unusual critique of the military establishment, Pakistan 's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three-star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism throughout the country.In September 2021, as the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan after the sudden pullout of US troops in August, then ISI chief general Faiz Hameed had visited Kabul and was photographed enjoying tea, during which he assured a journalist that ""everything will be fine"" -- a pivotal point in Pakistan's military and intelligence strategy towards Afghanistan.""The country is paying a price for that cup of tea in Afghanistan,"" said Dar, without naming Hameed.The deputy PM further said that the decision by the general to release some militants was the reason behind increased attacks across Pakistan. ""Those released at that time are masterminding terrorism in Balochistan today,"" he said, indicating there is a widely held belief that the decisions made by military leaders during this period were not only misguided but have also contributed to the current instability in Pakistan.Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, made the rem­a­rks during a press conference at the Pakistan High Commi­ss­i­on in London.Stating that the 2021 visit to Kabul could not have happened without the permission of former PM Imran Khan, Dar hit out at the ""mistakes"" made by the ousted leader, particularly in relation to economic and security decisions, and linked the former administration's ""missteps"" to the current rise in terrorism and economic challenges.""I find it difficult to accept that he [Hameed] could have gone without the permission of the prime minister [Imran Khan]. We are working with the security establishment on issues today, these things are not possible without the PM's approval,"" said Dar.After criticising military officials of the ""past"", Dar was quick to praise the curr­ent military establishm­ent.""They cannot be praised en­o­ugh as its members are very professional. Their agenda is Pakistan, as is ours. This is a very good omen. They are not interested in who comes in government or opposition,"" he said.The Taliban's rise to power was initially seen by some in Pakistan as a potential boon, with expectations that the group would help curb the activities of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has long posed a threat to the Pakistani state.However, the reality has proven to be quite different, with the TTP intensifying its attacks since the Taliban's takeover, undermining the very stability that Pakistan hoped to achieve through its support of the Taliban.The situation in Balochistan is particularly alarming. The province has witnessed a significant uptick in violence, with attacks attributed to both the TTP and other militant groups.The Pakistani military's response has included increased operations against these groups, but the effectiveness of these measures remains in question. Dar's comments suggest a recognition that past decisions, particularly those made by military leaders like Hameed, have directly contributed to the current security crisis.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three- star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism.

The rally - postponed twice in the last two months - was held near Sangjani Cattle Market in the suburbs of Islamabad after the capital administration issued a no-objection certificate (NOC).Thousands of PTI supporters attended the rally, proving that the party's power base was intact despite several hurdles it faced, including the incarceration of its 71-year-old founder.Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been in jail in different cases. On Sunday, Khan completed 400 days in prison.The rally was scheduled to end at 7 pm (local time) as per the NOC. As soon as the deadline ended, the district administration directed the police to take action against the rally-goers for not complying with the NOC.The authorities stated that the organisers violated the rules and regulations by not concluding the gathering before the deadline.In response to the crackdown, PTI workers began pelting stones at police, injuring many security personnel, including Senior Superintendent of Police Shoaib Khan .""Strong turnout for PTI rally despite the state's tactics to limit numbers through roadblocks and containers, and despite the risk of violent crackdowns and arrests. Its size and popularity ensure its mobilization capabilities remain intact despite relentless attempts to curb it,"" Micheal Kugleman, a South Asian expert, said in a post on X.Several PTI leaders addressed the gathering, demanding Khan's immediate release. PTI leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan said the party would not sit until Khan was released.""We are soldiers of Imran Khan and will not sit until he is set free,"" he said, adding that soon Khan would be with his supporters.He condemned physical hurdles put on roads to restrict the movement of participants and also announced that the PTI would now hold rallies across the country.It was the first major rally by the PTI in Islamabad since the February 8 elections. The party wants to exert pressure on the government to release Khan, who languishes in jail despite the courts either acquitting him or giving him bail in all cases he was convicted.PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said the government turned the city into a cage, but still thousands of people attended the rally. ""It shows that Imran Khan is a reality, and you will have to accept it...Imran Khan is a leader and will always be a leader,"" he said.He told the participants that Khan was their only leader who never surrendered and would never surrender. He warned that the PTI would not accept new cases against Khan.Gohar said that the PTI planned this rally for six months and followed Khan's instructions to hold the rally after getting permission from the government. He criticised the government for introducing a new law to restrict political activities.Slogans were raised during the rally demanding Khan's release from jail.He ended his speech with the promise that ""Imran Khan will be soon out of jail and with his people"".The key speech was made by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur who came from Peshawar, leading a large number of Khan's supporters from the province.In his emotional address, he vowed to continue the struggle for the rights of people. He said those who put Khan in jail were being humiliated while ""Khan is winning in jail"".He said that the government gave permission for the rally and blocked all roads leading to the venue of the rally. ""Imran Khan you have won while all others lost,"" he said, vowing to go to any length for Khan.He also announced to hold the next rally in Lahore, irrespective of whether the government gives permission or not.Gandapur also rejected that Khan would be tried under army law, saying no one could do it.Khan has repeatedly shown a willingness to hold talks with the establishment while refusing to sit with the government. So far, all his tactics have failed to get any relief. Mass protest is an option, but his party has been facing pressure to avoid it.Today's rally was a test for both the government and the PTI as it will help them gauge the ground power swell for Khan and fine-tune their policies and tactics in the coming days.Sources told PTI that the Islamabad administration put security on high alert this morning and blocked off multiple arteries leading to the capital city. Hospitals were put on alert by the administration. The Metro bus services were stopped in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Addressing the rally, former minister Hammad Azhar said the hindrance created by the rulers showed that they were afraid of Khan and his supporters.He pointed out that most of the party's Punjab leadership is in jail, paying tribute to incarcerated leaders, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Umar Sarfraz Cheema .Another leader Sher Afzal Marwat said they will soon hold rallies in Punjab for Khan's release and the supremacy of law and the Constitution.""We will enter Punjab with 50,000 people from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa within a week,"" he said, adding that they will even set off on foot and face the tear gas.Additional forces have been summoned to the location where the clash between the police and party workers originally started.Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law the Public Order and Peaceful Assembly Bill 2024 hours before the planned rally, instituting strict measures for unauthorised gatherings.The new law introduces penalties for holding gatherings without permission in Islamabad, with violators facing up to three years in prison and fines.

IG Islamabad and tout government should STOP playing with people's lives. This is highly disgusting and shameful, the people sent a huge message today!"" the party added.The rally, which had faced multiple delays due to revoked permissions, finally commenced on the outskirts of Islamabad on Sunday. Despite being denied permission several times earlier, the PTI brought together supporters from across the province, as reported by Dawn.Addressing the rally, senior PTI leader Hammad Azhar said that the gathering was a stand for the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution in Pakistan. ""We will, God willing, secure Imran Khan's release,"" Azhar said, adding that no obstacle would deter their cause.The rally had originally been scheduled for July, then postponed to August, before being further delayed due to security concerns cited by authorities. PTI has been pushing for Imran Khan’s release since his imprisonment in August.Although Khan’s conviction in the Iddat case was recently overturned, his release was blocked by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), which arrested him in connection with a new Toshakhana case shortly after. His previous Toshakhana sentences were suspended, and he was also acquitted in the cipher case by the Islamabad high court.PTI has been trying to secure permission for a public meeting in Islamabad for several months, but the district administration has repeatedly denied their requests, citing security risks. The party even approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in March for approval.In July, PTI announced another protest , but the district administration revoked their non-objection certificate (NOC) at the last moment, delaying the rally until September 8. Despite preparations for the event, the capital police blocked major entry points to the city, citing intelligence reports of a ""medium-level"" terrorism threat linked to the gathering.Senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser decried the government’s preventive measures, including the placement of containers and police blockades. ""It is unfortunate that this fascist government with a stolen mandate is creating such a hostile environment,"" Qaiser said in a video message posted on X.

Speaking to a private news channel Geo News, Asif said, ""Evidence against the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) points towards military trial.""Imran Khan has been embroiled in numerous legal cases, including one related to the May 9 riots, where military installations were attacked.Fearing prosecution in a military court, Khan filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking to halt the trial. However, the IHC raised concerns about the petition's validity, citing the absence of a specific first information report (FIR) or supporting documentation.Khan's petition comes amid ongoing legal debates. In December 2023, Pakistan's Supreme Court , in a 5:1 majority ruling, suspended an earlier decision that declared civilians' military trials unlawful. This ruling, tied to the May 9 riots, has left the final decision on military trials pending the court's verdict on intra-court appeals filed by the federal and provincial governments and the defence ministry.Asif also commented on former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, who he claimed aspired to become Pakistan's army chief. Asif alleged that Faiz had reached out to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) seeking support for his bid, offering loyalty in exchange. Faiz, currently facing allegations of land grabbing, was arrested by the army in August.""General (retd) Faiz wanted to become army chief, his name was on the list. He contacted the PML-N leadership in this regard and assured of his loyalty against support for his bid for army chief,"" said Asif.He further noted that Faiz's frustrations grew after the appointment of the current army chief. Asif suggested that Faiz may now try to deflect blame onto others, adding, ""He [Faiz] might say that even if he was part of the conspiracy then the objectives [of conspiracy] were of the PTI founder's and not his.""Meanwhile, Imran Khan, who is currently detained in Adiala Jail, has warned of protests if the government undermines the judiciary's independence. In a message shared on social media, Khan said, ""Pakistan's army belongs to everyone – to the whole nation – not just one political party or the army chief. They robbed the election and are now not allowing the judiciary to function independently.""Khan also criticised the treatment of Pakistan's current leadership in prison, claiming they enjoyed preferential conditions compared to him. ""I have not spent a single day at the prison hospital,"" he said, contrasting his treatment with that of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and others, who, according to him, had access to air-conditioned rooms with en-suite bathrooms during their time in custody.","Khawaja Asif says evidence against Imran Khan points towards military trial. Khan has been embroiled in numerous legal cases, including one related to the May 9 riots. Khan filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking to halt the trial.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113166755,imgsize-815440,width-400,resizemode-4/113166755.jpg"

On both occasions, the military had publicly denied direct involvement, saying indigenous Kashmiri rebels were fighting Indian forces.In 1999, however, thousands of paramilitary Northern Light Infantry regulars, drawn exclusively from Gilgit-Baltistan and skilled in high-altitude combat, were sent to occupy military posts that Indian troops would vacate in the snowy months.They established positions on the heights and commanded a view of the Srinagar-Leh highway, a major supply route for Indian troops stationed on the Siachen glacier.When India detected the incursion in early May 1999, Pakistan had claimed they were Kashmiri militants fighting Indian rule.According to observers, Pakistan had sent troops to Kargil to cut Indian supplies to Siachen, inflict heavy losses on Indian troops and pressure them into negotiating a settlement of the Kashmir dispute on Pakistani terms. Since Islamabad had conducted nuclear tests a year earlier, Pakistani generals were expecting a muted response from India.But the Indians hit back hard, sending infantry backed by artillery and air support. By mid-June the Pakistani positions on the hills began to fall. There were also international calls for Pakistan to withdraw its forces. Evidence suggested the Pakistani military leadership had not shared details of the Kargil operation with the govt of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif . On July 4, Sharif was forced to announce a unilateral ceasefire. His govt was toppled in a military coup two months later.India had reconquered the Kargil heights by July 26. It lost more than 500 troops in the war, while estimates of Pakistani losses range from 400 to about 4,000. Thousands of people made homeless by the war are displaced in Pakistan to this day.","Pakistan's military had attempted on at least two occasions to send its forces into Kashmir to start a rebellion against Indian rule.

The discovery could potentially offer a drastic boost to the nation's economy, according to a Pakistani senior security official quoted by DawnNewsTV.The official explained that the survey has successfully identified the location of the reserves, and relevant government bodies have been informed.These resources, located in the depths of Pakistani waters, represent a critical step towards capitalising what the official referred to as the "" blue water economy .""While this discovery could lead to a major boost for Pakistan’s energy sector, the process of exploration is still in its early stages.The work of digging wells and actually getting oil out could take several years. The official also talked about the potential of the blue water economy, pointing out that valuable minerals and elements could be extracted from the ocean, providing additional economic benefits for Pakistan.Estimates suggest that this discovery could be among the world’s largest oil and gas reserves , potentially placing Pakistan as the holder of the fourth-largest deposit globally.Venezuela currently leads in terms of oil reserves, with approximately 3.4 billion barrels, followed by countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Canada, and Iraq. The US is also notable for holding the most significant untapped shale oil reserves.In an interview with DawnNewsTV, Muhammad Arif, a former member of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) said that while the discovery is a positive development, there is no guarantee the reserves will be as large or easily recoverable as initially hoped.He said, ""If this is a gas reserve, it can replace LNG imports and if these are oil reserves, we can substitute imported oil.""The significant financial investment needed to explore offshore oil and gas reserves, estimating the cost at around $5 billion just for exploration, further claimed Arif.","A significant deposit of petroleum and natural gas has been discovered within Pakistan's territorial waters.

NEW DELHI: In a first, Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War , during a recent defence day speech. Previous army chiefs and political leaders, such as Pervez Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif, have acknowledged Pakistan's involvement in the Kargil operation.According to several media reports, General Munir -- while addressing a ceremony at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi to mark the country's 59th Defence Day, said: ""Be it 1948, 1965, 1971 or 1999 Kargil war, thousands of Shuhadas (martyrs) have sacrificed their life for the country and nation.""This marks the first time a serving army chief has openly admitted to the army's direct role in a conflict that has long been shrouded in denial and controversy in Pakistan.The audio of the video, which has been circulated widely online, has not been independently verified.For years, Pakistan's military and political leadership has maintained a narrative that distanced itself from the Kargil operations, often referring to the infiltrators as mere ""Kashmiri freedom fighters"".India has, however, repeatedly said that the operation was a calculated military strategy aimed at altering the Line of Control (LoC) and asserting Pakistan's claim over Kashmir.The Kargil War was characterised by its high-altitude combat and brutal conditions, taking place in one of the most challenging terrains on Earth.The Pakistani military's strategy involved infiltrating troops disguised as militants into Indian territory, occupying strategic heights that overlooked key supply routes.The operation was intended to disrupt Indian logistics and draw international attention to the Kashmir issue, thereby internationalising the longstanding conflict.In strong retaliation to the Pakistan 'infiltrators', between mid-May and July 1999, the Indian Armed Forces gradually recaptured critical positions from the Pakistani infiltrators. The Kargil War officially concluded on July 26, 1999, when the Army announced the complete eviction of Pakistani forces from Indian soil.Over two months, intense battles took place in the challenging mountainous terrain. The Indian Army, as part of Operation Vijay, managed to drive out Pakistani intruders and successfully recaptured Tiger Hill and other strategic positions.","Pakistan army chief publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War.

The Taliban were not immediately available for comment.The Taliban - who took over Afghanistan in 2021 during the final weeks of US and Nato withdrawal - have excluded women from most areas of public life and stopped girls from going to school beyond sixth grade, despite initial promises of a more moderate rule.They are also restricting women's access to work, travel and health care if they are unmarried or don't have a male guardian, and punishing those who don't comply with the Taliban's interpretation of hijab, or Islamic headscarf.The Taliban last month issued the ban on women's voices in public under new laws approved by the supreme leader in efforts to combat vice and promote virtue.""I want to make clear my abhorrence of these latest measures, which include forbidding even eye contact between women and men who are not related and imposing mandatory covering for women from head to toe, including their faces,"" Turk said.Taliban policies are propelling Afghanistan further down a path of isolation, pain and hardship, he added.Last year, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the country needs $4.62 billion in aid for nearly 24 million people in need. The Taliban takeover drove millions into poverty and hunger after foreign aid stopped almost overnight.Sanctions, a halt on bank transfers and frozen billions in Afghanistan's currency reserves restricted access to global institutions and the outside money that supported the country's aid-dependent economy before the withdrawal of US and NATO forces.The situation for children was especially devastating, with 12.4 million children in desperate need, Turk said, but a massive shortfall in funding was ""sharply undercutting"" the response by the UN and its partners.Another speaker at the council session was Richard Bennett , the UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Afghanistan. Bennett has frequently criticized the Taliban's treatment of women and girls. Last month, he confirmed he was no longer allowed to visit the country.In his first address since being barred from Afghanistan, Bennett said the morality laws reinforced the Taliban's institutionalized system of sex and gender discrimination, segregation and oppression and affected almost the entire population."" Unaddressed , the repercussions will shape future generations,"" he said.Bennett said he had talked to Afghans in several provinces who had described a visible increase in the presence of morality inspectors as well as tightening restrictions, in particular on people's freedom of movement.""We have also received information that barbers are instructed not to shave men's beards shorter than the specified length, while the ban on broadcasting of images of human beings is impacting the media,"" he said.Afghan media have reported that the Vice and Virtue Ministry has stopped female journalists from working in Daikundi province and administered a religious test to government employees, warning they risk dismissal if they do not participate.There have also been reports that the state-controlled broadcaster RTA has stopped airing in Kandahar province, the Taliban's power center in the south and the base of its leader Hibatullah Akhundzada , because morality laws prohibit the depiction of living beings.The Taliban have not responded to requests for comment on the reports.","Taliban's control over women and girls in Afghanistan is unparalleled, says UN rights chief.

Bangladesh's interim government allayed fears that there are no intentions to change the national anthem, "" Amar Sonar Bangla ."" This statement follows claims made by a former military officer, who suggested that India imposed the anthem, written by Rabindranath Tagore , during the country's 1971 independence.Religious Affairs Adviser AFM Khalid Hossain assured the public that the Muhammad Yunus-led government would avoid actions that could spark unnecessary ""controversy.""On Friday, in a display of unity, the cultural organization Udichi Shilpigosthi organized a nationwide event where citizens collectively sang the national anthem.According to the Dhaka Tribune, the national flag was raised, and patriotic songs were performed to promote national pride amidst the growing discourse surrounding the anthem.During a press conference on Tuesday, September 3, former military officer Abdullahil Amaan Azmi argued that ""Amar Sonar Bangla"" is outdated and no longer represents the identity of an independent Bangladesh.Azmi, the son of former Jamaat-e-Islami leader Ghulam Azam, claimed that the anthem, written by Tagore and linked to the Bengal partition, does not align with the spirit of a liberated Bangladesh. ""It reflects the time of the Bengal partition and the merging of the two Bengals,"" he said.He alleged: “How can an anthem created to unite the two Bengals become the national anthem of an independent Bangladesh. This anthem was imposed on us by India in 1971.”He added: ""There are many songs that could serve as a national anthem. The government should form a new commission to select a new national anthem.”Azmi, who had previously been forcibly disappeared and later freed following the fall of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, also called for constitutional reforms to bring national laws more in line with Islamic principles. His views have gained momentum on social media, with some users supporting the call for a new anthem and proposing alternatives.The debate over the anthem arises amid political turmoil and increasing communal tensions in Bangladesh. The removal of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5, following intense anti-government protests, has resulted in violent outbreaks, particularly targeting the Hindu minority. Hindu-owned businesses and temples were vandalized during student-led demonstrations, raising concern both domestically and internationally.Earlier, Yunus dismissed the claims of violence against minorities in Bangladesh, suggesting that India's concerns were overstated and used as a pretext. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day speech, expressed optimism that the situation in Bangladesh would soon stabilize, highlighting the concern of 1.4 billion Indians for the safety of Hindus and other minorities in the neighbouring country. On August 5, Bangladesh faced a political crisis when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India following weeks of protests that escalated into violence, resulting in the deaths of at least 300 people.","Bangladesh's interim government allayed fears that there are no intentions to change the national anthem, "" Amar Sonar Bangla.""

The interim government headed by Yunus was appointed days after Hasina resigned and fled to India on August 5 following unprecedented anti-government student-led protests over a controversial quota system in government jobs .Last week, Yunus expressed a desire for good ties with India but insisted Delhi must abandon the narrative that only Hasina's leadership ensures the country's stability.Meanwhile, Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain Sunday expressed surprise over defence minister Rajnath Singh's remarks, emphasising that he does not foresee any immediate threat of conflict between the neighbours. ""I am more surprised than concerned. I don't understand why he (Singh) made such remarks... I don't find any reason behind that,"" he told reporters. Singh had called upon the military brass to analyse the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza as well as the current situation in Bangladesh to ""predict"" any future problems and stay prepared.","Yunus, 84, made the remarks while responding to a question at a meeting with students who had participated in the revolution that ousted PM Sheikh Hasina last month.
