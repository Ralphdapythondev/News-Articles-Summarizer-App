'Trying to spark chaos': US Republicans on hurricane misinformation spread by own party members,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trying-to-spark-chaos-us-republicans-on-hurricane-misinformation-spread-by-own-party-members/articleshow/114102189.cms,"Chuck Edwards (Reuters file photo)

As misinformation about recent natural disasters spreads across the United States, several congressional Republicans have stepped forward to denounce conspiracy theories being circulated by their own party members.Representative Chuck Edwards of North Carolina, whose district was devastated by flooding from Hurricane Helene in late September, spoke out against ""outrageous rumors"" he said were spread by ""untrustworthy sources trying to spark chaos.""Edwards urged constituents to rely on reputable sources for information, saying, ""Nobody can control the weather.Please make sure you are fact-checking what you read online.""The flooding which ravaged parts of North Carolina's inland west, came as a surprise in a state typically accustomed to hurricane impacts along its Atlantic coastline.Meanwhile, Florida is bracing for Hurricane Milton , which is expected to hit the state's western coast directly.One of the sources of misinformation about the disasters is fellow Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Greene used her congressional social media accounts to spread baseless claims about weather manipulation. ""Ask your government if the weather is manipulated or controlled. Did you ever give permission to them to do it? Are you paying for it? Of course you are,"" Greene posted on Monday.Without naming Greene directly, Edwards pushed back against such conspiracy theories. ""Please make sure you are fact-checking what you read online with a reputable source,"" he said.Representative Carlos Gimenez , a Republican from Florida, also condemned the false claims. In a post responding to Greene, Gimenez wrote, ""News flash: Humans cannot create or control hurricanes. Anyone who thinks they can, needs to have their head examined.""US Senator Thom Tillis, another Republican from North Carolina, called the spread of misinformation a ""distraction"" during an interview with CNN. ""Many of these observations are not even from people on the ground,"" he said.President Joe Biden , in a briefing on Wednesday, also addressed the issue, criticising former President Donald Trump for leading what he called an ""onslaught of lies."" Biden called Greene's claims ""bizarre"" and ""ridiculous,"" adding, ""It's got to stop. In moments like this, there are no red or blue states.""Despite requests, Greene's office did not immediately respond for comment.","Representative Chuck Edwards of North Carolina spoke out against ""outrageous rumors"" Edwards urged constituents to rely on reputable sources for information.

Sean Combs: Sean Diddy's legal team accuse US government of leaking Cassie assault footage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sean-diddys-legal-team-accuse-us-government-of-leaking-cassie-assault-footage/articleshow/114102077.cms,"Sean 'Diddy' Combs and Casandra Ventura (Picture Credit: X)

Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs' attorney accused the federal agents and prosecutors of leaking surveillance footage in a court filing on Wednesday.The hip-hop mogul’s lawyers are accusing the government of leaking hotel surveillance footage to CNN, in which he could be clearly seen beating his ex-girlfriend.After the surveillance footage was released by CNN in May, Combs was forced to publicly apologise for his ""inexcusable"" behaviour.A video from an InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles shows Combs, wearing a towel, striking, kicking, and dragging Cassie (Casandra Ventura) as she tries to leave.While prosecutors haven't named her, the case aligns with Cassie's lawsuit, which accused Combs of years of abuse.The defendant's lawyers have requested that the widely circulated video be excluded from the trial. On the eve of his court appearance, the music mogul's attorneys claimed that leaks had caused ""damaging, highly prejudicial pretrial publicity,"" which they argued could taint the jury pool and deny Combs a fair trialWhereas prosecutors have made it clear in court papers that the particular footage is the key evidence in their case, and that footage will be used as a piece of evidence during the trial.While the source of the footage leak still remains unclear, in a court filing on Wednesday, Combs’ lawyers blamed the Department of Homeland Security for the leak when they raided his homes in March.“The videotape was leaked to CNN for one reason alone: to mortally wound the reputation and the prospect of Sean Combs successfully defending himself against these allegations,” the lawyers, Marc Agnifilo and Teny Geragos, wrote.According to the government’s account of the hotel footage, Combs assaulted his former girlfriend in an attempt to prevent her from leaving a freak-off session; prosecutors have said they have evidence that there was at least one prostitute inside Mr Combs’s hotel room.Prosecutors referenced the video in their indictment, stating that Combs attempted to bribe a hotel security worker with a ""stack of cash"" to keep the incident under the sheets.Combs, who has pleaded not guilty, was arrested last month and is being held without bail on charges of sex trafficking by force, transportation for prostitution, and racketeering conspiracy . His attorneys are pushing for a speedy trial, while Combs also faces several civil lawsuits from alleged victims.","Hip-hop mogul's lawyers accuse federal agents and prosecutors of leaking hotel surveillance footage.

They could be victims of child labor, of slavery, of many things... also of children in armed conflict,"" M'jid said.She warned that with fighting and lawlessness becoming embedded in several societies globally, such as Sudan and Haiti, ""violence becomes normal.""""When your children are experiencing violence since their early childhood, seeing only that... how are you going to deal with all this?""Violence against children has a ripple effect, damaging their mental health, impairing their education and stymying their productivity later in life, the report argues.""Even if you look at it from the perspective of the cost, it is 11 percent of the national GDP in some countries,"" M'jid warned.The solution lies in a coordinated approach to public spending, involvement of business and civil society, and engaging children themselves, she said.But squeezed budgets and the rise of conservative policies on sexual health and reproductive rights risk holding back efforts to combat violence against children, M'jid warned.""The issue of the far-right wing and conservatism in many countries will also set back some forms of action regarding sexual reproductive health (and) gender issues,"" M'jid said.""We are facing a very difficult moment,"" she added.""These children will be the parents of the future generation.""","Young people facing wave of violence and sexual abuse driven by war, climate change, hunger, and displacement.

Esmail Qaani: Who is Esmail Qaani? Iran's Quds Force commander missing since Israel's strike on Beirut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-is-esmail-qaani-irans-quds-force-commander-missing-since-israels-strike-on-beirut/articleshow/114042086.cms,"Who is Esmail Qaani? Iran's Quds Force commander missing since Israel's strike on Beirut (Picture credit: Reuters)

Esmail Qaani was born in 1957 in Mashhad, Iran. He rose through the ranks of Iran’s military elite during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.

He has spent decades as a key figure within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), eventually becoming deputy commander of the Quds Force in 1997. The Quds Force, the overseas arm of the IRGC, handles Iran’s foreign military operations and support for allied paramilitary groups across the Middle East .

Qaani’s leadership became prominent after the assassination of his predecessor, General Qassem Soleimani, who was killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad in January 2020. Soleimani was a charismatic leader, deeply respected by Iran’s allies, including Hezbollah, Iraqi Shi’ite militias, and the Houthis in Yemen.



Qaani took over as head of the Quds Force, but unlike Soleimani, his influence has been more subdued.

67-year-old Qaani has maintained a lower profile compared to Soleimani. While Soleimani was often photographed on the front lines in Iraq and Syria, Qaani has preferred to conduct his meetings behind closed doors.

His leadership has also been characterised by less direct engagement with Iran’s Arab allies, a result of his limited Arabic language skills. Analysts have noted that this language barrier, along with his more discreet approach, has made it challenging for Qaani to build the same level of rapport with militias in Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria.

Despite this, Qaani vowed to continue Soleimani’s mission of expelling U.S. forces from the Middle East. In a public statement after Soleimani's death, Qaani declared that ""the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region.""

Qaani’s last known location was in Beirut's southern suburbs, which is known as the Dahiyeh, a stronghold of Hezbollah. He was there during the Israeli airstrike that targeted Hashem Safieddine, who is seen as a likely successor to Nasrallah.

Since then, both Qaani and Safieddine have been unreachable, leading to growing concerns about their fate. Israeli officials have not confirmed any specific casualties from the strikes but have said that the results are still being assessed.

As tensions in West Asia escalate, the whereabouts of Esmail Qaani , Commander of Iran 's Quds Force , have become the subject of widespread speculation. Qaani has not been heard from since Israeli airstrikes targeted Beirut's southern suburbs last week, reported Reuters citing Iranian sources.These strikes, which hit a Hezbollah stronghold, also targeted senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine .Qaani’s absence has stirred concern, particularly given the strategic role he plays in Iran's military operations across the region.Qaani's disappearance follows the killing of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in a previous Israeli airstrike on September 27. Qaani had travelled to Lebanon to meet Hezbollah officials after Nasrallah's death. His silence since the most recent strikes has led to rumours in media outlets, including Turkish and Israeli sources, suggesting he may have been killed. Iranian authorities , however, have not confirmed his death.If confirmed, Qaani’s death would severely undermine Iran's ability to coordinate its proxy forces across the region. The Quds Force plays a crucial role in managing Iran’s relationships with Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and Shi’ite militias in Iraq. Losing its commander, especially in the wake of recent Israeli military operations, could leave a significant void in Tehran’s regional strategy.In recent weeks, Israel has intensified its airstrikes on Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, further destabilising an already volatile region. The death of Hezbollah leader Nasrallah in late September marked a significant blow to the group, and the potential loss of Qaani would represent a further setback for Iran's regional influence.Who is Esmail Qaani?","Esmail Qaani is the head of Iran's Quds Force, the overseas arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

All about Nobel prize in Physics



From 1901 to 2023, the Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded 117 times to a total of 225 laureates. Notably, John Bardeen is the only recipient to have won the prize twice, in 1956 and 1972. This brings the total number of individuals who have received the Nobel Prize in Physics to 224.

The youngest Nobel laureate is Lawrence Bragg. He received the prize in 1915 “for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays”

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was assigned to award the Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry, the Karolinska Institutet was chosen for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and a committee of five members elected by the Norwegian Parliament (Storting) for the Nobel Peace Prize.

was assigned to award the Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry, the Karolinska Institutet was chosen for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and a committee of five members elected by the Norwegian Parliament (Storting) for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences tasked with selecting the laureates starting in 1969.

The Nobel prize in Physics 2024 has been awarded to John J Hopfield and Geoffrey E Hinton “for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.”The 2024 Nobel Prize laureates in Physics utilized tools from their field to develop methods that have significantly contributed to the foundation of modern machine learning.John Hopfield created a framework capable of storing and reconstructing information, while Geoffrey Hinton developed a technique that enables the independent discovery of properties within data, which is crucial for today’s large artificial neural networks.He developed a network that employs a method for storing and reconstructing patterns, where the nodes can be visualized as pixels. The Hopfield network draws on physics principles related to a material's properties influenced by atomic spin, which allows each atom to act as a tiny magnet.This network is described in terms similar to the energy in a spin system, and it is trained by adjusting the connection values between nodes to ensure that the stored images maintain low energy levels. When presented with a distorted or incomplete image, the Hopfield network systematically updates the values of its nodes, reducing its energy to find the stored image that most closely resembles the input.He built upon the Hopfield network to create a new model known as the Boltzmann machine, which employs a different learning method to recognize key features in specific types of data. Hinton utilized concepts from statistical physics, which studies systems composed of many similar components.The Boltzmann machine is trained by providing it with examples that are highly probable when the machine is executed. It can classify images and generate new instances of the patterns it has learned.","The Nobel Prize in Physics 2024 has been awarded to John J Hopfield and Geoffrey E Hinton.

"Israel shares disturbing video of chaos, panic during October 7 Hamas onslaught",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-shares-disturbing-video-of-chaos-panic-during-october-7-hamas-onslaught/articleshow/114062761.cms,"What happened on October 7, 2023



Supernova music festival, killing hundreds and abducting dozens



NEW DELHI: Israel on Tuesday shared a video commemorating the October 7 attack by Hamas , which claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people and saw over 100 individuals abducted by the militant group.In a post on X sharing a video, Israel said, ""One year ago, Iran-backed terrorists launched a war to wipe Israel off the map. They slaughtered more than a thousand innocents and took 251 hostage.Every day since, Israel has been working to bring all the hostages home while protecting its citizens and fighting a multi-front war for its very survival.""On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale, surprise assault on Israel, marking one of the deadliest escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in recent years. The attack coincided with the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and significantly intensified hostilities in the region, prompting a swift and aggressive response from the Israeli military.The assault began early in the morning when Hamas, which controlsGaza , fired thousands of rockets into Israeli territory. Cities including Tel Aviv, Ashkelon, and Jerusalem were targeted, triggering sirens and causing civilians to seek shelter.However, the rocket attacks were part of a broader, coordinated operation. Hamas militants breached the heavily fortified Gaza-Israel border, using bulldozers to break through barriers, motorcycles for rapid movement, and paragliders to bypass security checkpoints. The militants entered Israeli communities and military bases near the border, leading to numerous casualties.The attack resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis, both civilians and military personnel. In a shocking development, Hamas fighters took dozens of hostages, including women, children, and soldiers, transporting them back to Gaza. Videos circulated on social media showed hostages being paraded through Gaza’s streets, heightening tensions. The abductions added a layer of complexity to Israel's military response as the safety of the hostages became a critical concern.In a forceful response Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) launched extensive airstrikes targeting Hamas positions, command centers, and weapons storage facilities in Gaza. The Israeli government declared a state of war and mobilised hundreds of thousands of reservists.The IDF sought to regain control of the border areas and eliminate any Hamas militants still operating inside Israeli territory. In the ensuing hours, precision airstrikes aimed to disable Hamas’s military capabilities, though these operations also caused significant destruction in Gaza, leading to civilian casualties.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then addressed the nation and declared that Israel is at war and promised a decisive, prolonged response.He vowed that Hamas would ""pay a heavy price"" for the attack, calling it a ""day of infamy"" for Israel.What began as a night of celebration at Israel's Supernova music festival turned into horror when Hamas militants launched a deadly ambush, firing indiscriminately and abducting dozens of attendees. Organised by Osher and Michael Waknin, the event was intended to promote friendship, love, and freedom but became the site of the deadliest attack in Israel's 75-year history.The festival, which attracted around 3,500 electronic music enthusiasts from Israel and abroad, featured multiple stages, international DJs, and camping facilities. As dawn broke on October 7, the music abruptly stopped when rockets fired by Hamas targeted the venue, signalling the start of the tragic events.Ephraim Mordechayev, a 23-year-old soldier enjoying the festivities, recounted his experience. Initially, he and his friends, used to the occasional rocket launches from the Gaza Strip, did not comprehend the severity of the situation. However, as chaos spread, they realised that armed militants had infiltrated the event, arriving on foot, motorcycles, and even by air, firing automatic weapons at civilians.""There is someone that is 20, 10 metres from you with guns and trying to kill you,"" Mordechayev told AFP.","Israel on Tuesday shared a video commemorating the October 7 attack by Hamas.

He later settled in Normandy , France, in 2016, where he pursued a career as a painter.Retailleau, who recently took office as France’s new interior minister, said on X that Omar bin Laden had been residing in the Orne department of Normandy as the spouse of a British citizen.He added that Omar bin Laden “posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that advocated terrorism,” prompting the prefect of Orne to issue an expulsion order.Retailleau said, ""I am today issuing an administrative ban on Mr. Omar Bin Laden, the eldest son of the international terrorist Osama Bin Laden. Mr. Bin Laden, who has lived in Orne for several years as the spouse of a British national, posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that were an apology for terrorism. As a result, the Prefect of Orne issued an OQTF and obtained Mr. Bin Laden's departure. The courts have confirmed the regularity of this decision taken for national security. The administrative ban on the territory guarantees that Mr. Bin Laden will not be able to return to France for any reason whatsoever.""“The courts have confirmed the legality of this decision taken in the interests of national security,” Retailleau affirmed. Additionally, the minister signed a ban preventing Omar bin Laden from re-entering France “for any reason whatsoever.” No further details were provided, and it remains unclear whether he has already left the country.Omar bin Laden gained media attention in 2007 when he married British national Jane Felix-Browne, who later adopted the Muslim name Zaina Mohammed.The marriage, marked by the couple's significant age gap, sparked widespread interest. Omar's application to reside in the UK was previously denied by British authorities.Osama bin Laden, the son of a wealthy Saudi construction tycoon, reportedly fathered around two dozen children. He was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011.Retailleau has pledged to tackle issues related to immigration and crime and said that “the rule of law is neither intangible nor sacred.” His appointment as interior minister reflects the French government’s shift to the right under the leadership of new Prime Minister Michel Barnier, following a hung parliament result in this summer’s legislative elections.","Omar bin Laden, 43, was born in Saudi Arabia and has also lived in Sudan and Afghanistan.

The winner of this year's Fat Bear Contest has triumphed over the bear that tragically killed her cub this summer. Grazer secured her victory by defeating the formidable Chunk , receiving over 40,000 votes from fans watching live at Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve.The Fat Bear Contest invites fans to vote for their favourite bear based on winter preparedness, highlighting the fat accumulated during the summer months.Each year, 12 bears are pitted against each other in a tournament-style bracket. The bears feed on the abundant sockeye salmon that leap upstream at Brooks River, often catching them mid-air at the falls.Grazer’s cub met its fate after slipping over the waterfall, where it was killed by Chunk, the largest brown bear on the river. Grazer's attempts to save her cub were recorded on the live cameras, which have also documented other bear interactions, including a recent incident involving another bear, Bear 402, who was killed by a male bear just before the contest bracket was released.Grazer, easily recognisable by her distinctive blond ears and straight muzzle, is known for her strength and fearlessness, earning her the respect of other bears. Meanwhile, Chunk’s sheer size and aggression have allowed him to dominate the river, reportedly consuming 42 salmon in just ten hours.The annual contest, which attracted over 1.3 million votes last year, celebrates the resilience of the 2,200 brown bears inhabiting the preserve on the Alaska Peninsula. With live cameras capturing their activities, Katmai has become a popular tourist destination, offering viewing stands for visitors eager to witness these magnificent creatures in action.","Grazer defeated the formidable Chunk at Alaska’s Katmai National Park.

Hurricane Milton makes landfall: Will Trump's Mar-a-Lago in Florida survive?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hurricane-milton-makes-landfall-will-trumps-mar-a-lago-in-florida-survive/articleshow/114102808.cms,"As Hurricane Milton crashes into Florida ’s Gulf Coast, there are rising concerns about the survival of former President Donald Trump ’s famed Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach . The storm, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, has already caused significant damage across the state, raising questions about whether the “Winter White House” will weather this storm as it has in the past.Mar-a-Lago, built in 1927 by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, has withstood several hurricanes over the decades.The structure, anchored to the coral reef beneath it, has concrete and steel foundations, with walls as thick as three feet, making it remarkably resilient, the Palm Beach Post reported.As Tony Senecal, Trump’s former butler, famously said in 2005, “This place will not move.” Despite this confidence, recent storms have tested the limits of Mar-a-Lago’s durability.In 2017, Hurricane Irma caused roof damage and knocked down several trees on the property. Although the estate escaped significant structural damage, the storm highlighted the potential vulnerability of even this sturdy mansion. Earlier hurricanes, such as Frances and Jeanne in 2004, similarly left the property with minor damage, mostly to landscaping, the Palm Beach Post reported. Trump purchased the estate in 1985, turning it into a private club while retaining part of it for personal use.Now, with Hurricane Milton producing winds over 100 mph and multiple tornadoes across Florida, Palm Beach and Mar-a-Lago face another test. The storm made landfall near Siesta Key, bringing destructive winds and a potentially deadly storm surge. Videos shared on social media showed funnel clouds forming over Palm Beach County, a stark reminder of the storm's power.More than one million Floridians are without power, and emergency services in some counties have already been suspended as officials urge residents to shelter in place.","Former President Donald Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985 and turned it into a private club.

Vice President Kamala Harris is once again under fire from MAGA supporters , who have accused her of adopting a 'new accent' during her recent appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert During her Colbert interview, Harris engaged in casual banter and opened a Miller High Life beer, aiming to connect with voters on a personal level.However, her comments on empathy and international issues—where she said, ""Have you no empathy, man? No, for the suffering of other people? Have you no sense of purpose? We cannot lose belief in the possibility""—provoked backlash from MAGA supporters, who quickly took to social media to voice their discontent.One MAGA supporter exclaimed, “JAMAICAN ACCENT ALERT?? A new one to add to the long list of Kamalas!” Others described her performance as a “sad, cringe-worthy attempt to act like she’s ‘relatable,’”.The reaction continued to intensify, with comments like, “Imagine if President Trump did these accents. He’d be impeached and probably indicted for them.”This isn’t the first time Harris has faced such accusations. Earlier this year, at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Phoenix Awards Dinner, she was similarly criticized for allegedly using an accent to appeal to her audience.Despite her attempts to engage with Black voters—showcasing her membership in a historically Black sorority and addressing her community—MAGA users labeled her approach as inauthentic. One commenter remarked, ""Kamala’s new accent... worse than Hillary,"" while another highlighted the various accents she has reportedly adopted over the years.Harris, who has faced scrutiny for her handling of various issues during her campaign, used the Colbert interview to critique Trump’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.She recalled the chaos of the early days of the crisis and questioned Trump’s decisions, particularly allegations from journalist Bob Woodward’s new book that claimed he provided rare testing equipment to Russian President Vladimir Putin while Americans struggled to access tests.","US Vice President Kamala Harris is once again under fire from MAGA supporters.

Trump’s post came after Fox News extended an invitation for both candidates to engage in a second debate later this month.""I WON THE LAST TWO DEBATES, ONE WITH CROOKED JOE, THE OTHER WITH LYIN’ KAMALA,"" Trump wrote, referring to his previous showdowns with President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris.He added, ""I ACCEPTED THE FOX-NEWS INVITATION TO DEBATE KAMALA ON SEPTEMBER 4TH, BUT SHE TURNED IT DOWN."" Trump also mentioned his growing lead in the polls, stating that he is ""leading in all swing states"" and that his advantage continues to increase as the election approaches.Reiterating his decision, Trump said there was no need for another debate as voting had already begun. ""THERE WILL BE NO REMATCH! BESIDES, KAMALA STATED CLEARLY, YESTERDAY, THAT SHE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN JOE BIDEN, SO THERE IS NOTHING TO DEBATE,"" he wrote, dismissing Harris’s policies as a continuation of Biden’s.This latest declaration from Trump follows a similar rejection earlier in September when he first declined a rematch with Harris. At that time, he had posted, ""When a prizefighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are, ‘I WANT A REMATCH.’ Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris."" Trump had initially agreed to a Fox News debate on September 4th, but Harris’s team only accepted a debate on ABC News scheduled for a later date.Despite speculation about further debates, Trump has now firmly shut down the idea. ""VOTING HAS ALREADY BEGUN,"" he said, and reiterated his claim that Harris’s policies mirrored those of President Biden, ""SO THERE IS NOTHING TO DEBATE"".Earlier in the campaign, Trump rejected a similar invitation from CNN for an October 23rd debate, which Harris had accepted. The race between Trump and Harris is increasingly tight, with polls showing it neck-and-neck. Harris entered the race after President Joe Biden stepped aside following a poor debate performance, which initially gave Trump a lead, but Harris’s entry has since narrowed the gap.","Former President Donald Trump has once again rejected the possibility of debating Vice President Kamala Harris.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

She cracked a beer with the host in one interview, revealed on another radio show that she's a fan of Formula One racing, and in a third, spoke feelingly about taking care of her mother when she was stricken with cancer. A Kamala Harris ' media blitz on Tuesday sought to generate vibes and humanize her for an electorate large sections of whom say they are not very familiar with her, but it left her MAGA critics unimpressed.Trump minions who complained that she does not do one-on-one interviews are now complaining that she is doing too many, after Harris appeared on 60 Minutes , ABC's The View , Howard Stern Show , the podcast Call Her Daddy , and Late Show with Stephen Colbert over the past 72 hours. ""Whose brilliant idea was it to send her out on a comedy tour as a Category 5 hurricane barrels toward the Gulf coast?"" asked Kayleigh McEnany , Trump's former press secretary, who called it ""political malpractice"" even though her MAGA supremo remains an unrelenting media hog despite his disdain for what he characterizes as ""fake news.""Trump himself, ever mindful of media metrics, waded into the issue, denigrating the five women hosts who constitute a panel on ABC's The View, calling them ""degenerates"" and ""dumb"" who were soft on ""Lyin’ Kamala"" who is being ""exposed as a 'dummy' every time she does a show.""Indeed, Harris got a warm reception and mostly softball questions on all the shows, quite different in tone and tenor though to the simpering, sycophantic encounters Trump has with his MAGA hosts on Fox and allied platforms. Stephen Colbert welcomed her with a beer, with a political aphorism that “People vote for the person they'd have a beer with,” but that in turn triggered the MAGA mob, which found it hard to digest that she was having a beer on a late night show when a Cat 5 hurricane was roaring towards Florida. “She did this to appeal to white men in the midwest,” wailed one MAGA troll.On the Howard Stern show she revealed that she is a fan of Formula one racing, and her favorite driver is “Lewis Hamilton, of course,” – another perceived outreach for the white male vote. But the most glowing reviews for Harris came on ABC’s The View, which has an all-women panel, including a former Trump aide, and a Republican never-Trumper. “I’m basking in the light…I hope we can put this woman in that black job,” joked host Whoopi Goldberg, referring to Trump’s reference to immigrants taking “black jobs.”","Kamala Harris' media blitz on Tuesday sought to generate vibes and humanize her for an electorate large sections of whom say they are not very familiar with her.

Amidst the deteriorating relationship, Pakistani border troops and Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in a clash while the former country's forces engaged in fence repair work.The incident occurred after the Afghan side launched an attack on a border post in the Naushki-Ghazni sector of the Pak-Afghan border , as reported by The Express Tribune. In response, the Pakistan Army launched a strong counterattack on the Afghan checkpoints, resulting in significant casualties for the Afghan Taliban.The Pakistani newspaper's sources suggested that Pakistan would continue to take robust measures to defend its borders, and its security forces reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the country's territorial integrity, delivering a decisive response to this aggression from Afghanistan.This incident was not an isolated case of unprovoked aggression from Afghan forces. In the previous month, the Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing using heavy weapons, targeting Pakistani check posts from the Afghan region of Plosin. The fighting that took place during the night between September 8 and 9 resulted in the death of at least 16 Afghan Taliban fighters and the injury of 27 others.The Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 2021, allegedly with the support of Pakistan, which had hoped that they would eliminate the threat of militancy emanating from their soil.

ISLAMABAD: The JUI-F has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition on a proposed constitutional amendment , according to a media report on Wednesday. The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has claimed that the decision to table the 'Constitutional Package' in Parliament had been postponed by the government at its request, The Dawn newspaper reported.The paper quoted sources in the party as saying that the stance regarding opposition to the amendment had not changed, calling the matter ""disputed"".According to a JUI-F source, the government agreed to postpone the amendment at the demand of Maulana Rehman. ""Now…this matter will be taken up after the SCO summit,"" said a party office-bearer.On Monday, the Maulana attended a multi-party moot on Palestine at the invitation of the president and the prime minister and also held a meeting with the bigwigs of the ruling coalition, giving rise to speculations that he had agreed to support the government.However, according to the party spokesperson, there was no truth to these reports while insiders termed the amendment disputed which the JUI-F chief would not agree to ""under the current circumstances"".Sources said the JUI-F endorsed a separate constitutional court but expressed reservations over the constitutional amendment.""Our concern was based on common sense - we demanded the document that we were supposed to vote for, but the government negotiating teams failed to do so,"" a senior party official remarked on the dialogue between the government and the JUI-F last month.The JUI-F still expects the government to share the draft with the party. The JUI-F leader said they would also share their draft on the constitutional court with the government and expected the government to do the same. In order to take everyone on board, the JUI-F leaders have suggested a separate constitutional bench instead of an independent court.On the other hand, the government is almost ready to table the constitutional amendment, and sources in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) believe that this time, it would not be rushed through Parliament.""There will be separate sessions of the National Assembly and Senate and it is likely to be held on October 18,"" they added.It is likely that the National Assembly and Senate sessions will separately be convened on the same day and after getting it cleared from one house, the amendment would be introduced in the other the same day.In order to achieve a two-thirds majority, the ruling alliance has been trying to win over Maulana Rehman as well as some Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-linked lawmakers whose votes against the party line would not be annulled following a review of Article 63A of the Constitution.The Pakistan Peoples Party and PML-N are in contact with Akhtar Mengal, the head of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) as well, hoping to secure the support of two BNP senators.Sardar Mengal, who recently resigned from the National Assembly, is still a member of the house as his resignation hasn't been accepted by the NA speaker, Dawn reported.",The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit , following India's refusal earlier. Last Friday, India confirmed that foreign minister S Jaishankar would lead a delegation to Pakistan for the summit in Islamabad.Responding to a question on Jaishankar's visit and India-Pakistan relations , the spokesperson said that Pakistan had ""officially received notification"" about the visit and is prepared to welcome all participating members.Further on the question of bilateral talks, the spokesperson cited Jaishnakar's refusal and assured to toe the same line.""Regarding your question about bilateral meetings, I would like you to refer to the remarks made by the Indian minister for external affairs on 5th of October, in which he maintained that his visit was meant for a multilateral event and not for discussing Pakistan-India relations. These remarks are self-explanatory,"" she said.The last time an Indian external affairs minister visited Pakistan was when Sushma Swaraj in December 2015 travelled for a forum on the Afghanistan issue. However, Jaishankar's upcoming visit is looked at as a significant move by New Delhi, given the strained bilateral relations between the two countries.Tensions escalated after India carried out airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Balakot in February 2019, following the Pulwama terror attack. Relations worsened further after India revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and reorganised the state into two union territories in August 2019, leading Pakistan to downgrade diplomatic ties.India has consistently stated its desire for normal relations with Pakistan, which New Delhi has said will depend on Islamabad creating an environment free of terrorism and hostility.In May 2023, Pakistan's then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India for an SCO foreign ministers' meeting in Goa, marking the first such visit by a Pakistani foreign minister in nearly 12 years.Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, however, confirmed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will chair the upcoming Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting of the SCO.""We expect high-level participation from SCO members; the observer state of Mongolia; Turkmenistan as a special guest; and representatives of the international organisations, including Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and European Economic Community (EEC),"" she said.The spokesperson stated that the CHG meeting will focus on discussions regarding cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, environment, and socio-cultural connections, while also reviewing the SCO's overall performance.","Pakistan has ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit.

The group gained prominence in January 2018 after rebranding itself as the PTM, following the popularity it gained for seeking justice for Naqeebullah Mehsud, a fellow Pashtun who was allegedly killed by police in a fake encounter in Karachi.Pakistan authorities have accused the group of being influenced by anti-state elements operating from within and abroad, particularly in Afghanistan. However, the PTM has consistently denied such allegations.","Pakistan bans the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, citing it as a threat to national security.

"'Mountaineering testament to strength...': Nima Rinji Sherpa becomes youngest to summit all 14 peaks above 8,000 meters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/mountaineering-testament-to-strength-nima-rinji-sherpa-becomes-youngest-to-summit-all-14-peaks-above-8000-meters/articleshow/114081056.cms,"Nima Rinji Sherpa

An 18-year-old Nepali mountaineer Nima Rinji Sherpa set a new world record by becoming the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.As per the news agency ANI, his historic feat was completed on Wednesday when he successfully scaled Tibet's 8,027-metre-high Shisha Pangma , marking the culmination of his two-year mission to conquer the most daunting mountains on the planet.Summiting all 14 ""eight-thousanders"" is considered the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, requiring climbers to cross into ""death zones,"" where oxygen levels are too low to support human life for long periods. Nima’s success at such a young age has been hailed as a remarkable testament to his strength and determination.Looking back at his journey, Nima posted about the achievement on his Instagram page. He said, ""This summit is not just the culmination of my personal journey, but a tribute to every Sherpa who has ever dared to dream beyond the traditional boundaries set for us. Mountaineering is more than labour; it is a testament to our strength, resilience, and passion.""Wanting this feat to be an inspiration for the younger generation, he further said, ""Through #SherpaPower, I want to show the younger generation of Sherpas that they can rise above the stereotype of being only support climbers and embrace their potential as top-tier athletes, adventurers, and creators. We are not just guides; we are trailblazers. Let this be a call to every Sherpa to see the dignity in our work, the power in our heritage, and the limitless possibilities in our future.""""To humanity as a whole: let this climb remind us that the peaks we reach together, united, are far greater than any individual achievement. As a teenager, witnessing the division caused by borders, wars, racism and other conflicts, I call for love, respect, and harmony among all people. In this vast world, we are but one human race. No summit, no boundary, no conflict is worth more than the peace and unity we can achieve by understanding and supporting one another,"" he added.Then he called out to the people to preserve nature and said, ""The mountain does not define us; we define the mountain We are its guardians, similarly the world we live in should be defined by people who reside in it ! Let’s all unite to protect and preserve our natural resources to live a sustainable and adventurous life!""Nima Rinji hails from a family of renowned mountaineers.He reached the summit of Shisha Pangma early in the morning, accompanied by fellow climber Pasang Nurbu Sherpa. ""He reached the summit this morning. He had trained well, and I was confident he would do it,"" said his father, Tashi Sherpa, while expressing pride in his son’s accomplishment.The President of the Nepal Mountaineering Association , Nima Nuru Sherpa also expressed his happiness at Rinji’s achievement. “This is a proud moment for our country. Nima broke all the stereotypes, and his success has given a message that nothing is impossible if you have a strong determination"".Nima Rinji began his mountaineering career in earnest in August 2022 when he summited Mount Manaslu at the age of 16. By June 2024, he had successfully climbed his 13th mountain, Kanchenjunga, the third-highest peak in the world. His ascent of Shisha Pangma on October 9, 2024, completed his record-breaking achievement.The record for the youngest person to summit all 14 peaks was previously held by Mingma Gyabu 'David' Sherpa, who achieved the feat at the age of 30 in 2019. Nima Rinji, however, accomplished the same feat at just 18 years and five months, completing his journey in two years and ten days, according to Seven Summit Treks, the expedition organiser.Nepali climbers, particularly Sherpas, have long been considered the backbone of the climbing industry in the Himalayas, often carrying equipment and setting up routes for foreign climbers. However, in recent years, Sherpas have gained recognition in their own right, taking centre stage in some of the most challenging climbs.","Nima Rinji Sherpa is the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.
