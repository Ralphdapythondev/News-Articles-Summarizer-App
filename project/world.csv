"Boeing’s long-awaited space mission, carrying Sunita Williams, aborted just before liftoff",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nasa-boeing-starliner-sunita-suni-williams-space-mission/articleshow/110631968.cms,"Boeing Co and Nasa postponed the first crewed flight of the company’s already long-delayed space taxi on Saturday, halting the countdown less than four minutes before takeoff due to a launchpad computer system issue.The CST-100 Starliner ’s flight from Florida to the International Space Station is a critical test to prove the craft can safely carry people to and from the orbiting research laboratory for Nasa.A launchpad sequencer that controls vital systems during the final countdown triggered the abort, the latest setback for a launch effort years in the making. Nasa said it’s forgoing a possible launch on Sunday to allow the agency, United Launch Alliance and Boeing time to determine what went wrong.The next launch opportunities are June 5 and June 6, Nasa said in a blog post. ULA builds the Atlas V rocket that will loft the Starliner capsule to space.Earlier Sunday, ULA Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno said the remedy might be an easy hardware fix as simple as swapping out a part — or it could be more involved.The launch sequencer is made up of three redundant computers; two of the computers reported normal conditions, while the third one moved more slowly than it was supposed to. That automatically triggered the abort. ULA still doesn’t know what caused the third computer to behave that way.In 2014, Nasa awarded Boeing $4.2 billion and Elon Musk’s SpaceX $2.6 billion in contracts to create vehicles to ferry the agency’s astronauts to space, the centerpieces of its Commercial Crew Program.While Starliner has fallen seven years behind schedule because of to a long line of technical glitches and failures, rival SpaceX has launched nine separate crews to the space station for Nasa since 2020.The repeated delays have added mounting pressure for Boeing, which has racked up roughly $1.5 billion in cost overruns on the program. The company’s defense and space division is expected to lose money during the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Brian West told a conference in May, citing “cost pressure” on fixed-price contracts.Boeing faces questions about the long-term vision for its space business. It’s unclear whether Starliner will be used beyond a half-dozen more missions to the ISS for Nasa. Late last year, West told a small gathering of investors that the company has a decision to make about future investment in the program, Bloomberg has reported.The Saturday launch attempt, meant to carry veteran Nasa astronauts Sunita “Suni” Williams and Barry “Butch” Wilmore, came after weeks of uncertainty about when the mission would get off the ground.Nasa and Boeing tried to launch on May 6, but mission controllers stopped the countdown after noticing some weird behavior with a valve inside the rocket, forcing Williams and Wilmore to exit the spacecraft and wait for another launch day.Engineers replaced the valve, but the launch was delayed again after Boeing discovered a helium leak on one of Starliner’s many thrusters. After weeks of analysis and meetings, Boeing and Nasa ultimately decided to move forward with the launch without fixing the leak, saying it did not pose a safety issue and that engineers would monitor it throughout the flight.It’s possible that recent launch delays will force Boeing to take another incremental charge on Starliner, JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a May 27 research note.For this mission, Williams and Wilmore are slated to stay aboard the space station for about a week. Once their mission is complete, they will undock from the ISS in Starliner and land in the southwestern US under parachutes.","The launchpad sequencer that controls vital systems during the final countdown triggered the abort.

South Africa election ends three decades of ANC dominance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/south-africa-election-ends-three-decades-of-anc-dominance/articleshow/110631423.cms,"'We all are talking'

JOHANNESBURG: South Africans angry at joblessness, inequality and power shortages have slashed support for the African National Congress ( ANC ) to 40% in this week's election, ending three decades of dominance by the party that freed the country from apartheid.A dramatically weakened mandate for the legacy party of Nelson Mandela , down from the 57.5% it got in the previous 2019 parliamentary election, means the ANC must share power with a rival in order to keep it - an unprecedented prospect.""We can talk to everybody and anybody,"" Gwede Mantashe, the ANC chair and current mines and energy minister, told reporters in comments carried by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), dodging a question about who the party was discussing a possible coalition deal with.Vote tallying from Wednesday's poll was entering its final stages on Saturday, with results from 99.53% of polling stations giving the ANC 40.21%.The main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), had 21.80%, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), a new party led by former president Jacob Zuma, managed to grab 14.60%, while the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, got 9.48%.""We have achieved our mission: ... to bring the ANC below 50%. We want to humble the ANC,"" Malema told journalists at the results centre.""We are going to negotiate with the ANC"" for a possible coalition deal, he said, although that would not be quite enough to clinch a majority without including another party on the current count.The ANC has won every previous national election by a landslide since the historic 1994 vote that ended white minority rule, but over the last decade its support has dwindled as the economy stagnated, unemployment rose and roads and power stations crumbled.MK's strong performance, especially in Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, is one of the main reasons the ANC failed to secure a majority.Analysts say one option for the ANC could be a ""government of national unity"" involving a broad spectrum of many parties, rather than a formal coalition between a few - an arrangement similar the one set up after 1994's historic all-race vote.Malema said the EFF was against that idea and preferred to be part of a coalition.Political parties' share of the vote determine their seats in the National Assembly, which elects the nation's president.Investors in Africa's most industrialised economy will hope the uncertain picture can quickly become clear and that the country avoids an extended period of wrangling if the main political players struggle to agree how they can cooperate.Some parties have questioned what they say are vote-counting inconsistencies that may lead to some results being contested.Electoral commission chair Mosotho Moepya told a news conference on Saturday that ""every concern raised in these objections will be considered and we will do so carefully"".ANC First Deputy Secretary-General Nomvula Mokonyane meanwhile urged voters and communities to remain peaceful.Despite the ANC's result, President Cyril Ramaphosa could still keep his job, as the former liberation movement was on course to get about twice as many votes as the next party. But he will be weakened and could face calls to quit both from opposition parties and critics in the deeply-divided ANC.On Friday, however, Mokonyane - one of the ANC's top officials - backed him to stay on as party leader, and analysts say he has no obvious successor.A deal to keep the ANC in the presidency could involve opposition backing in exchange either for cabinet posts or for more control of parliament, perhaps even the speaker.""One of the positions we are going to demand from the ANC is ... the speaker of parliament,"" Malema said.The election commission has pencilled in a final results announcement for Sunday.","The African National Congress ( ANC ) got 40% of the vote, down from 57.5% in previous election.

Stunning archaeological find: Prehistoric discovery in US lake leaves experts in shock and awe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stunning-archaeological-find-prehistoric-discovery-in-us-lake-leaves-experts-in-shock-and-awe/articleshow/110569138.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota , near Madison. This significant find includes a canoe dating back to 2500 BC. The Wisconsin Historical Society revealed the discovery on May 23, noting that the initial two canoes were found in 2021 and 2022.Dr Amy Rosebrough, State Archaeologist for the Wisconsin Historical Society, explained the importance of this find, saying, ""The Indigenous peoples of Wisconsin and the wider United States fished, traveled, and traded extensively on inland lakes and streams, and until now we have not had a clear look at the canoes used in the Great Lakes region."" She likened the discovery to understanding life in the Midwest without ever seeing a real pickup truck, emphasizing the crucial role canoes played in transportation and trade.Radiocarbon dating revealed that the oldest canoe dates back to 2500 BC, contemporary with the construction of Stonehenge, and much earlier than the founding of Ancient Rome or the birth of Jesus Christ. The youngest canoe dates to 1250 AD.Not all canoes will be removed from the lake due to their fragility. Rosebrough mentioned that divers also found stone tools in the water, suggesting the presence of an ancient village site, which has yet to be located. ""Even without finding the village, the discovery of these canoes and the tools found within the first canoe reminds us that people have lived and worked alongside the lake for thousands of years,"" she added.Efforts are ongoing to explore the lake further, using non-destructive remote sensing techniques to uncover more about this prehistoric site. Rosebrough highlighted the unique archaeological potential of smaller bodies of water like Lake Mendota, which often receive less funding than the Great Lakes but hold distinct historical significance.The Wisconsin Historical Society, in partnership with Native Nations in Wisconsin, aims to uncover and share the rich history of these discoveries at the new Wisconsin History Center, set to open in early 2027.","Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota.

"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down huge global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries.

Biden says Israel has offered to Hamas a three-step road map to an enduring ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-says-israel-has-offered-to-hamas-a-three-step-road-map-to-an-enduring-ceasefire/articleshow/110603765.cms,"The first phase would involve a six-week ceasefire, during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza, and hostages, including the elderly and women, would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Palestinian civilians would return to Gaza, including northern Gaza, and 600 trucks would deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza daily.

In the second phase, Hamas and Israel would negotiate the terms of a permanent end to hostilities. ""The ceasefire will still continue as long as negotiations continue,"" the president said.

The third phase would involve a major reconstruction plan for Gaza.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden on Friday said that Israel had proposed a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages, and urged Hamas to accept the new offer, stating that it was the most effective way to end the ongoing conflict.""It's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,"" said Biden, who is facing pressure during an election year to bring the eight-month-long Gaza conflict to a close.Despite mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar, and others, ceasefire negotiations between Israel and the militant group Hamas have repeatedly stalled, with both sides accusing each other of hindering progress. Neither the Israeli prime minister's office nor Hamas immediately responded to Biden's comments.The new proposal outlined by Biden on Friday consists of three phases.According to Biden, the proposal has been relayed to Hamas by Qatar.The president appealed to those in Israel who are advocating for an ""indefinite"" war ""indefinite"" to change their minds.""I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan. And will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some are even in the government coalition. They've made it clear. They want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years and hostages are not a priority for them. Well, I've urged leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes,"" Biden said.""As someone who's had a lifelong commitment to Israel, as the only American president who has ever gone to Israel at a time of war, as someone who just sent the U.S. forces to directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, I ask you to take a step back, think what will happen if this moment is lost. We can't lose this moment,"" he added.Several Israeli media outlets described Biden's speech as dramatic and interpreted it as an attempt to directly appeal to the Israeli public. Channel 12, a leading news channel, interrupted its evening news show to broadcast Biden's speech live. According to anchor Danny Kushmaro, Israel's censor had previously prohibited the publication of the offer's details.An earlier hostage proposal put forward this year called for the release of sick, elderly, and wounded hostages in Gaza in exchange for a six-week ceasefire that could be extended to allow for more aid to be delivered into the enclave. However, the proposed deal collapsed earlier this month after Israel refused to agree to Hamas' demand for a permanent end to the war as part of the negotiations and intensified its assault on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza.Hamas on Thursday said that it had informed mediators that it would not participate in further negotiations during ongoing aggression but was prepared for a ""complete agreement,"" including an exchange of hostages and prisoners, if Israel ended the war.According to a US official speaking on condition of anonymity, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan would meet on Friday with diplomats from 17 countries whose citizens are being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.A senior Israeli security official stated on Friday that Israel will not agree to any halt in fighting that is not part of a deal that includes the return of surviving hostages.The week has been dominated by the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike in Rafah on Sunday that killed 45 Palestinians.","US President Joe Biden said that Israel had proposed a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages.

Hush money trial: Donald Trump is convicted on all 34 charges. Now what?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-trial-donald-trump-is-convicted-on-all-34-charges-now-what/articleshow/110577474.cms,"What happens now

The next step is for Judge Juan Merchan to approve the verdict and enter a final judgment. This is usually a formality. Sentencing typically follows within several weeks, but legal arguments can delay this process. Lawyers on both sides will recommend sentences, which will be debated at the sentencing hearing where Merchan will make a final decision.

Will Trump go to prison?

That is unlikely. While the maximum sentence for falsifying business records is four years in prison, it is rare for first-time offenders of this crime in New York to receive prison time. ""Punishments like fines or probation are more common,"" and alternatives like home confinement or curfews could be considered, given the logistical challenges of imprisoning a former president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.

Can Trump appeal the conviction?

Yes, Trump is expected to appeal. He may argue that the indictment was legally flawed and politically motivated. His defense will likely focus on several legal points, including that state election laws do not apply to federal elections and that the charges themselves were legally improper.

Could Trump still become president?

Yes, the US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years. Even if he were in jail, Trump could theoretically be sworn in as president on January 20, 2025.

Can Trump vote for himself?

Yes, as long as Trump is not imprisoned in New York, he can vote for himself. Florida defers to other states' rules on felony disenfranchisement, and in New York, felons regain their voting rights once they are out of prison, even if on parole.

Will Trump's conviction affect his campaign?

The conviction does not legally prevent Trump from running for or becoming president. The Republican National Convention, which will take place shortly after his sentencing, has no rules disqualifying a convicted nominee. Trump remains popular among the GOP base, and the party's leadership is aligned with him.

What are the broader implications of this conviction?

The conviction marks unprecedented territory in US politics, especially as Trump faces three other criminal cases. The Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts after deliberating for two days. The trial included explicit testimony and evidence that implicated Trump in approving a $130,000 payment to silence Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.

What are the next steps for Trump legally and politically?

Following his sentencing, Trump can appeal to higher courts. His defense team has already laid groundwork for appeals, citing potential judicial bias and procedural issues. Politically, Trump continues to rally support, painting the conviction as a politically motivated attack. Despite the legal challenges, leading strategists believe Trump remains a formidable candidate for the 2024 election.

Robinson died peacefully on Friday morning, leaving behind cherished memories and a lasting impact on her loved ones.Robinson's life was marked by the challenges and triumphs of being an African American woman in the United States. Born in 1937 on Chicago 's South Side, she witnessed firsthand the racial disparities that affected her family. Her father, denied opportunities due to the color of his skin, ""grew mistrustful of a world that seemed to have little place for him,"" the family shared. Despite these obstacles, Robinson's daughter and son-in-law would go on to make history as the first Black family in the White House.While living at the White House, Robinson found comfort in the simpler things.

Her humble nature and genuine connections with others were a testament to her character.Throughout her life, Robinson dedicated herself to her family and her work. She married in 1960 and had two children, including the former first lady. She also worked as a teacher and a secretary, demonstrating her commitment to education and hard work. During her time at the White House, she would often venture outside the gates to purchase greeting cards, and when recognized by others, she would simply smile and reply, ""Oh, I get that a lot.""","Marian Robinson, the mother of Michelle Obama, passed away on Friday at the age of 86.

Boeing Starliner launch scrubbed in final minutes of countdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeing-starliner-launch-scrubbed-in-final-minutes-of-countdown/articleshow/110631198.cms,"Vital test

CAPE CANAVERAL: The first crewed flight of Boeing 's Starliner spaceship was dramatically called off Saturday with just under four minutes left on the launch countdown clock, for reasons that aren't yet clear.It was the second time the test mission to the International Space Station was scrubbed with the astronauts strapped in and ready to lift off, and yet another setback for the troubled program, which has already faced years of delays and safety scares.Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are waiting to be safely removed from the capsule. Mission commander Wilmore had earlier given a short but rousing speech telling tens of thousands of people tuning into the live feed that ""It's a great day to be proud of your nation.""The former US Navy test pilots, who each have two spaceflights under their belts, were previously called back to quarantine after an aborted launch attempt on May 6 due to a faulty valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.A backup date is available for Sunday, but it's not yet known whether the Starship will be ready to launch.Starliner is poised to become just the sixth type of US-built spaceship to fly NASA astronauts, following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the Space Shuttle from 1981 to 2011, and SpaceX 's Crew Dragon from 2020.NASA is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to theISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.Both companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their gumdrop-shaped, autonomously piloted crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.Boeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored over its then-upstart competitor, but its program fell badly behind amid embarrassing setbacks that mirrored the myriad problems afflicting its commercial airline division.These ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.While teams were working to replace the faulty valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of the spacecraft's thrusters came to light.But rather than replace the seal, which would require taking Starliner apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.- Manual flying -Earlier Saturday, Wilmore and Williams emerged from the historic Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building, exchanging thumbs-up signs and waves with their families before boarding a van that took them to their launch pad.When they do fly, they will be tasked with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft.Starliner is set to dock with the ISS for eight days as the crew carry out tests, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event there is a problem on the orbital outpost.After undocking, it will re-enter the atmosphere and carry out a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.A successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its 737 MAX passenger jets.It's also important for more immediate reasons: the Urine Processor Assembly on the ISS, which recycles water from astronauts' urine, suffered a failure this week and its pump needs to be replaced, Dana Weigel, NASA's ISS program manager, told reporters.This mission is thus tasked with carrying spare equipment, which weighs around 150 pounds (70 kilograms). To make way for it, two astronauts' suitcases containing clothes and toiletries had to be pulled off, meaning they'll need to rely on backup supplies kept on the station.","The first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spaceship was dramatically called off Saturday.

Austin's comments at the Shangri-La defence forum in Singapore came the day after he met for more than an hour on the sidelines with Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun, the first in-person meeting between the top defence officials since contacts between the American and Chinese militaries broke down in 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan , infuriating Beijing.Neither side budged from their longstanding positions on Taiwan - which China claims as its own and has not ruled out using force to take - and on China's sweeping claims in the South China Sea , which has led to direct confrontations between China and other nations in the region, most notably the Philippines.While declining to detail the specifics of their conversation, Austin said the most important thing was that the two were again talking.""As long as we're talking, we're able to identify those issues that are troublesome and that we want to make sure that we have placed guardrails to ensure there are no misperceptions and no miscalculations ... that can spiral out of control,"" he said.""You can only do that kind of thing if you are talking.""Addressing the same forum on Friday night, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr bluntly outlined what could be at stake, saying that if a Filipino were killed as China confronts his country's coast guard and merchant fleet to press its claims in the South China Sea, it would be ""very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly.""Marcos added that he assumed the Philippines' treaty partners, which include the U.S., ""hold the same standard.""In his own speech, Austin lauded how Marcos ""spoke so powerfully last night about how the Philippines is standing up for its sovereign rights under international law."" But when pressed later, he would not say how the US might react if a Filipino were killed in a confrontation with China, calling it hypothetical.He did say the US commitment to the Philippines as a treaty partner is ""ironclad,"" while again stressing the importance of dialogue with China.""There are a number of things that can happen at sea or in the air, we recognize that,"" he said. ""But our goal is to make sure that we don't allow things to spiral out of control unnecessarily.""Beijing in recent years has been rapidly expanding its navy and is becoming growingly assertive in pressing its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea.The U.S., meantime, has been ramping up military exercises in the region with its allies to underscore its ""free and open Indo-Pacific "" concept, meant to emphasize freedom of navigation through the contested waters, including the Taiwan Strait.Expressing the concerns of some in the region, Indonesian academic Dewi Fortuna Anwar said any de-escalation of tensions ""would be very welcome to this part of the world,"" but wondered whether the U.S. would allow China's assertive military posture to grow uncontested if Washington's main emphasis was now dialogue.""We are also worried if you guys get too cozy, we also get trampled,"" she said.Austin said that many of those issues were best addressed through talks, but also assured that Washington will continue to ensure that the rights of nations in the region were protected and that they continued to have access to their exclusive economic zones.""War or a fight with China is neither imminent, in my view, or unavoidable,"" Austin said.""Leaders of great power nations need to continue to work together to ensure that we're doing things to reduce the opportunities for miscalculation and misunderstandings,"" he said.

Republicans join Trump's attacks on justice system and campaign of vengeance after guilty verdict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/republicans-join-trumps-attacks-on-justice-system-and-campaign-of-vengeance-after-guilty-verdict/articleshow/110611277.cms,"WASHINGTON: Embracing Donald Trump ’s strategy of blaming the US justice system after his historic guilty verdict , Republicans in Congress are fervently enlisting themselves in his campaign of vengeance and political retribution in the GOP bid to reclaim the White House.Almost no Republican official has stood up to suggest Trump should not be the party's presidential candidate for the November election — in fact, some have sought to hasten his nomination. Few others dared to defend the legitimacy of the New York state court that heard the hush money case against the former president, or the 12 jurors who unanimously rendered their verdict.In fact, any Republicans who expressed doubts about Trump's innocence or political viability, including his former hawkish national security adviser John Bolton or top-tier Senate candidate Larry Hogan, were instantly bullied by the former president’s enforcers and told to “leave the party.”Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said she's voting for Trump “whether he is a free man or a prisoner of the Biden regime.”The firebrand congresswoman also posted the upside-down American flag that has come to symbolize the “Stop the Steal” movement Trump started with allies before the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.The swift, strident and deepening commitment to Trump despite his felony conviction shows how fully Republican leaders and lawmakers have been infused with his unfounded grievances of a “rigged” system and dangerous conspiracies of “weaponized"" government into their own attacks on President Joe Biden and the Democrats.Rather than shunning Trump's escalating authoritarian language or ensuring they will provide checks and balances for a second Trump term, the Republican senators and representatives are upturning longstanding faith in US governance and setting the stage for what they plan to do if Trump regains power.On Friday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan demanded the prosecutors Alvin Bragg and Matthew Colangelo appear for a June hearing on the “weaponization of the federal government” and “the unprecedented political prosecution” of Trump — despite the fact that Biden, as president, has no authority over the state courts in New York.“What we’re gearing up for is if Trump wins, he’s going to use the apparatus of the state to target his political opponents,” said Jason Stanley, a professor at Yale and the author of “How Fascism Works.”Stanley said history is full of examples of people not believing the rhetoric of authoritarians. “Believe what they say,” he said. “He's literally telling you he’s going to use the apparatus of the state to target his political opponents.""At his Trump Tower on Friday in New York, the former president returned to the kinds of attacks he has repeatedly lodged in campaign speeches, portraying Biden as the one who is a “corrupt” and the US as a “fascist” nation.Trump called the members of the bipartisan House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol “thugs” and said Biden was a “Manchurian candidate,” a phrase inspired by the 1960s movie portraying a puppet of a US political enemy.A Trump campaign memo contained talking points for Republican lawmakers, suggesting they call the case a “sham,” “hoax,” “witch hunt,” “election interference"" and “lawfare” designed by Biden, whom it called “crooked.""Biden faces no such charges, and the House GOP's efforts to impeach the president over his son Hunter Biden's business dealings, have largely stalled out. Hunter Biden is due in court next week on an unrelated firearms charge in Wilmington, Delaware.President Biden said Friday that “it’s reckless, it’s dangerous, it’s irresponsible, for anyone to say this is rigged just because they don’t like the verdict.”Asked later at the White House if this could happen to him, Biden said: “Not at all. I didn’t do anything wrong. The system still works.”As for Trump's claims the case is being orchestrated by the Democratic president to hurt him politically, Biden quipped: “I didn’t know I was that powerful.”In the hush money case, Trump was found guilty of trying to influence the 2016 election by falsifying payment to a porn actor to bury her story of an affair. He faces three other felony indictments, including the federal case over his effort to overturn the 2020 election. But they are not likely to be heard before November’s expected election rematch with Biden.Thursday's verdict came after a jury in 2023 found Trump to be liable for sexual abuse against advice columnist E. Jean Carroll and a judge in a 2024 business fraud case determined that Trump lied about his wealth for years, ordering him to pay a staggering $355 million in penalties.Almost to a person, the Republicans in Congress who spoke out provided a singular voice for Trump.Speaker Mike Johnson on “Fox & Friends” amplified the claim, without evidence, that Democrats are trying to hurt Trump. He said he thinks the Supreme Court should “step in” to resolve the case.“The justices on the court, I know many of them personally, I think they're deeply concerned about that as we are,” the Republican speaker said.The outgoing Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said he expected Trump would win the hush money case on appeal, but the three senators seeking to replace him as leader echoed Trump with stronger criticisms of the judicial system.South Dakota Sen. John Thune said the case was “politically motivated."" Texas Sen. John Cornyn called the verdict “a disgrace."" Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said that everyone who calls themselves a party leader “must stand up and condemn” what he called “lawless election interference.”And Sen. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who is known as a bipartisan leader, said the prosecutor “brought these charges precisely because of who the defendant was rather than because of any specified criminal conduct.”With sentencing in the hush money case expected in July before the Republican National Convention, Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said the GOP should move up the convention to speed up Trump’s nomination as the party’s presidential pick.Republican judicial advocate Mike Davis, a former top Senate aide mentioned for a future Trump administration position, circulated a letter outlining the next steps.“Dear Republicans,” he said in a Friday post. If their response to the guilty verdict was “we must respect the process” or “we are too principled to retaliate,” he suggested they do two things: One was an expletive, the other: “Leave the party.”Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, circulated his own letter in which he suggested it was the White House that “made a mockery” of the rule of law and altered politics in “un-American” ways. He and other senators threatened to stall Senate business until Republicans take action.“Those who turned our judicial system into a political cudgel must be held accountable,” Lee said.",Republicans in Congress are fervently enlisting themselves in his campaign of vengeance and political retribution in the GOP bid to reclaim the White House. Almost no Republican official has stood up to suggest Trump should not be the party's presidential candidate.

Ohio Senate approves fix assuring President Biden is on fall ballot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ohio-senate-approves-fix-assuring-president-biden-is-on-fall-ballot/articleshow/110609642.cms,"A temporary fix allowing President Joe Biden to appear on this fall’s ballot cleared the Ohio Senate on Friday as the Republican-dominated Legislature concluded a rare special session .The vote came one day after the House approved the measure, along with a ban on foreign nationals contributing to state ballot campaigns. The latter measure had been demanded by the Senate, which approved it Friday. Both bills now head to Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who is expected to sign both.The latter bill also broadened the definition of “foreign nationals” to include lawful permanent residents of the U.S., also known as green card holders. The provision was added to the House bill, with proponents saying it would close “a glaring loophole” in the bill, but several lawmakers questioned whether it eventually would lead to the courts striking down the entire measure as unconstitutional.The special session was ostensibly called by DeWine last week to address the fact that Ohio’s deadline for making the November ballot falls on Aug. 7, about two weeks before the Democratic president was set to be formally nominated at the party’s Aug. 19-22 convention in Chicago.But when the Senate — and then DeWine’s proclamation calling lawmakers back to Columbus — tied the issue to the foreign nationals prohibition, the Democratic National Committee moved to neutralize the need for any vote in Ohio. In tandem with the Biden campaign, it announced earlier this week that it would solve Biden’s problem with Ohio’s ballot deadline itself by holding a virtual roll call vote to nominate him. A committee vote on that work-around is set for Tuesday.The Democratic National Committee said Friday that the planned virtual roll call will still move forward.On Thursday, Democrats in the Ohio House had accused the Republican supermajorities in both chambers of exploiting the Biden conundrum to pass an unrelated bill that undermines direct democracy in Ohio, where voters sided against GOP leaders’ prevailing positions by wide margins on three separate ballot measures last year. That included protecting abortion access in the state constitution, turning back a proposal to make it harder to pass such constitutional amendments in the future, and legalizing recreational marijuana.Political committees involved in the former two efforts took money from entities that had received donations over the past decade from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, though any direct path from him to the Ohio campaigns is untraceable under campaign finance laws left unaddressed in the House legislation. Wyss lives in Wyoming.If the foreign nationals legislation does become law, it has the potential to affect ballot issue campaigns making their way toward Ohio’s Nov. 5 ballot. Those include measures proposing changes to Ohio’s redistricting law changes, raising the minimum wage to $15, granting qualified immunity for police and protecting certain voting rights.","Ohio Gov.

NEW DELHI: A Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country. His statements were made in the case of poet and journalist Ahmed Farhad Shah, who the lawyer said cannot be brought to the federal capital for court proceedings from PoJK, as he was in 'foreign territory' that does not come under the country's jurisdiction.During the session, additional attorney general Munawar Iqbal Duggal said that Farhad faced charges in PoK and was in custody until June 2. Duggal mentioned that Farhad's family had met him, suggesting that the habeas corpus petition should be dismissed.Presiding over the proceedings, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani considered the plea filed by Arooj Zainab, Farhad's spouse, as reported by Dunya News.Petitioner's counsel Imaan Mazari emphasised that her client sought not only her husband's return but also action against those responsible for his enforced disappearance.The HC emphasised that the case would only conclude upon Farhad's appearance in court.AAG Duggal argued that PoJK, with its own constitution and courts, was considered foreign territory. Judgments from Pakistani courts were treated akin to those from foreign courts, as per Dunya News.The petitioner's attorney informed the court that Farhad's family had traveled from Islamabad to the Dhirkot police station but were told upon arrival that he had been moved to Muzaffarabad due to terrorism-related charges. When questioned about Farhad's whereabouts before his May 29 detention, the Islamabad prosecutor general deferred to the PoK court.Justice Kayani remarked that everyone should work within the law, to which the prosecutor general maintained that he works within the law, reported Dunya News.""We have to determine the misuse of law,"" Kayani said to the petitioner's attorney's argument that the court should also consider cases involving the misuse of laws and procedures.The court adjourned the hearing of the case until June 7, rejecting the request to dispose of the petition for the recovery of poet Ahmed Farhad.","Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan- Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country.

Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said.

This is everybody’s business.”","UNICEF says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.

Pakistan PM Shehbaz calls some judges 'black sheep'; accuses them of giving relief to Imran Khan



(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from former US president Donald Trump , former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday claimed that the February national election was rigged , calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate.""Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, where he is being held in solitary confinement, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations and were being ""victimised.""Despite Khan's party winning the most seats in the February election, they fell short of a majority, allowing his opponent Shehbaz Sharif to form a government with the support of allied parties. The top court granted Khan permission to appear and plead petitions he had filed against amendments to the country's anti-graft laws.The Pakistan Muslim League (N) secured 75 seats, the Pakistan People's Party came third with 54 seats, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) has agreed to support them with 17 seats.Imran Khan's defense was similar to that of former US President Donald Trump who on several occasions has also claimed that the 2020 US elections were 'rigged' and 'stolen' by the democrats.Earlier today, a Pakistan court acquitted Imran Khan in two cases related to violence that occurred on May 9. The court cited a lack of sufficient evidence against the 71-year-old founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. The verdict was delivered by judicial magistrate Umar Shabbir of the district and sessions court of Islamabad, who approved the petition challenging the two cases filed at Shehzad Town police station.The court stated in its verdict: ""Because of insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution, the PTI founder has been acquitted.""Last year, following Khan's arrest in an alleged corruption case, his supporters engaged in vandalism targeting public property, including sensitive army installations. This is not the first time Khan has been acquitted in cases connected to the May 9 violence; on May 15, he was also cleared in two other related cases.Earlier, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday had accused some serving judges, whom he referred to as ""black sheep,"" of allegedly providing relief to Imran Khan in various cases.""Some black sheep in (the) judiciary are there to save Imran Niazi from 190 billion pounds and other cases. Every day, it is planned how to give him bail in certain cases,"" he said.Shehbaz made these allegations during a general council meeting of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), where his elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was re-elected as the party's president.","Imran Khan claims that the February national election was rigged, calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate"" Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations.

'I'm gonna kill all the Jews': Pakistan immigrant attempts to run down kids outside NYC school,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/im-gonna-kill-all-the-jews-pakistan-immigrant-attempts-to-run-down-kids-outside-nyc-school/articleshow/110563848.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a shocking incident on Wednesday, an unhinged driver attempted to mow down Orthodox students and a rabbi outside a Brooklyn Jewish school while allegedly shouting, ""I'm gonna kill all the Jews"".Video footage from the Flatbush Shomrim Safety Patrol captures the driver revving his engine and mounting the curb as he swerved toward Orthodox Jews outside the Yeshiva in Canarsie around 11.25am.As per a New York Post report, the alleged attacker, identified as 58-year-old Asghar Ali, a Pakistani immigrant and cab driver with a history of mental illness, is currently under investigation by the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force. Detectives interviewed Ali on Wednesday night.Ali faces more than a dozen charges, including attempted murder , attempted assault, and hate crimes charges. Police do not believe the attack is terror-related and have not found evidence linking him to radical groups online.The attack began as Ali, driving a 2011 white Crown Victoria, turned onto East 55th Street in front of the Mesivta Nachlas Yakov School and suddenly veered toward students in Orthodox attire. He then circled the block and returned, targeting two more students and a rabbi.“I’m gonna kill all the Jews,” Ali allegedly shouted, according to police. The victims managed to run into the building before being struck. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Authorities have listed five victims in the case: three 18-year-olds, a 41-year-old man, and a 44-year-old man.Rabbi Twersky, who works at the Yeshiva, described the chaos as the driver attempted to strike one of the boys at the corner of Glenwood Road and East 55th Street. Ali then drove up the wrong side of East 56th Street and barreled toward a group of 30 to 40 students.“I’m much more scared than they are — their adrenaline is up,” Twersky said.Tire marks on the sidewalk near the Yeshiva remained visible Wednesday night, with a police car stationed outside. Ali initially got away but was quickly located by the Shomrim Safety Patrol, who swarmed the area and found the attacker at a nearby Dunkin' Donuts, the NY Post report said.“We were able to retrieve the video footage. We got the guy’s plate number,” said Bob Moskowitz, executive coordinator of the patrol. “Obviously it was a very distinct car, a Crown Vic, an old model. You don’t see too many of those around.”Ali, who has lived in the US for over two decades, was taken into custody and transferred to Coney Island Hospital. He is considered an “emotionally disturbed” person with a prior arrest in 1998 for false personation. He has four prior arrests, including one for criminal impersonation, though details of the other arrests were not immediately clear.“We were very pleased to be able to apprehend this individual,” Moskowitz stated. “This is not somebody that we want driving around the streets, especially with this anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish climate that’s out there. So we were glad to be able to put this to rest. The community was kind of uptight about this. Now everybody can be a little more relaxed.”","Asghar Ali, 58, a Pakistani immigrant and cab driver with a history of mental illness, is currently under investigation by the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force.
