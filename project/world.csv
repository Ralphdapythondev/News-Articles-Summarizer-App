Tourist suffers third-degree burns while walking on blazing hot sand dunes in California's Death Valley,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tourist-suffers-third-degree-burns-while-walking-on-blazing-hot-sand-dunes-in-californias-death-valley/articleshow/112029135.cms,"A Belgian man, aged 42, suffered severe burns on his feet after briefly walking barefoot on the sand dunes at Mesquite Flat in California's Death Valley National Park over the weekend, according to park rangers on Thursday. The visitor was immediately taken to a hospital in Nevada. Due to communication barriers, the rangers could not ascertain whether the man's flip-flops had broken or were lost during his short walk on Saturday.The ground temperature would have been significantly higher than the air temperature, which was approximately 123 degrees Fahrenheit (50.5 Celsius) that day.This summer, Death Valley National Park, situated below sea level near the California-Nevada border, has experienced record-breaking temperatures .The man's family sought assistance from other visitors to carry him to the parking lot. Rangers then transported him to a higher elevation where a medical helicopter could land safely, considering the extreme temperatures that reduce roto lift. The Belgian man was airlifted to the University Medical Centre in Las Vegas , which houses the Lions Burn Care Centre.During the summer months, the centre receives numerous patients from Nevada and parts of California with contact burns similar to those suffered by the Belgian visitor.In the urban areas of the desert Southwest, scorching hot surfaces like asphalt and concrete also pose a risk for severe burn injuries. The majority of patients at the Las Vegas burn centre come from the surrounding urban area, where summer temperatures regularly exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit.In Arizona's Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, thermal injuries from hot surfaces such as sidewalks, patios, and playground equipment are also common.Earlier this month, a motorcyclist died from heat-related causes in Death Valley, highlighting the dangers of extreme air temperatures in the region. At Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America , the park has installed a large red stop sign warning visitors of the risks of extreme heat to their bodies after 10 am.Park rangers advise summer visitors not to hike in the valley after 10 am. and to remain within a 10-minute walk of an air-conditioned vehicle. They also recommend drinking ample water, consuming salty snacks, and wearing a hat and sunscreen to stay safe in extreme conditions."," Belgian man, 42, suffered severe burns on his feet after briefly walking barefoot on the sand dunes at Mesquite Flat in California's Death Valley National Park.

In the early months of his presidency, Biden convened a virtual QUAD leadership summit in 2020, and since then, the member countries have been holding annual summits on a rotational basis.This year, India is slated to host the QUAD leadership summit.Kirby suggested that with Biden's decision not to seek reelection, there may be more opportunities on his calendar that were previously unavailable. The administration is currently exploring potential opportunities to advance the President's foreign policy agenda and address national security concerns both domestically and internationally.""So we're all exploring what those opportunities can look like in terms of advancing his foreign policy agenda and national security opportunities here and around the world. But I don't have anything on the schedule to speak to now, but I mean, stay tuned,' he said.""I think there'll be some opportunities that the president is going to want to explore.

Largest wildfire in California this year started by a burning car pushed into a gully; 1 arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/largest-wildfire-in-california-this-year-started-by-a-burning-car-pushed-into-a-gully-1-arrested/articleshow/112028889.cms,"NEW DELHI: Authorities in California have arrested a suspect believed to be responsible for starting the Park Fire, which has grown into the largest wildfire in the state this year. The fire began when a burning car was pushed into a gully, leading to flames that have already scorched over 188 square miles near Chico.Evacuations have been mandated in Butte and Tehama counties, with containment at a mere 3% by Thursday evening.Meanwhile, firefighters in the Pacific Northwest also contended with multiple blazes.Another fire outbreak in California, this time near the Nevada border, led to the displacement of around 1,000 people following evacuation orders on Monday night. The Gold Complex fires, caused by lightning , have devoured more than 4 square miles of land within the Plumas National Forest, about 50 miles northwest of Reno.According to Adrienne Freeman, a spokeswoman for the Forest Service, there have been no reports of structural damage or serious injuries from these fires.""We've made some really good progress on the fires,"" said Forest Service operations section chief Tom Browning on Thursday. ""But it's hot, it's dry, and it's very windy. With the wind and the heat, we don't have great containment on all these lines.""Over at the Park Fire, fire crews are battling not just the flames but also gusty winds that cause new spot fires up to a mile away from the main fire lines. Tim Fike, the incident commander at the Gold Complex fires, pointed out that these conditions are posing severe challenges.""That's been a big, big problem on the Park Fire right now,"" Fike noted.In Oregon, residents of Huntington were allowed to return home following a thunderstorm that brought both much-needed rain and lightning—elements that both aided and threatened the firefighting efforts. The Durkee Fire in Oregon, the nation’s largest active blaze, along with another nearby fire, has burned nearly 630 square miles.Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash described the rain as a ""godsend."" The Oregon State Fire Marshal emphasised the advantage the weather change offered firefighters.Lightning strikes have also led to 15 new fires in Idaho overnight, with several already extinguished by Thursday afternoon, according to the US Forest Service in Boise. The National Weather Service in Boise detected more than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes in southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday.Overall, the Pacific Northwest has seen nearly 1,562 square miles of land burned this summer. In Oregon alone, there are 34 large fires, mostly in the central and eastern regions.The rise in wildfire incidents across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada is tied to climate change, which has increased occurrences of lightning strikes. Record-breaking heat and dry conditions are exacerbating the situation. For the first time, Idaho Power initiated a pre-emptive power outage to prevent the start of new fires by downing power lines.In northern California, fire crews are prioritising evacuations and protecting structures while constructing containment lines using bulldozers in anticipation of further fire spread. CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department reported no deaths or structural damages related to the Park Fire.A smaller but rapidly moving fire in southern California has also necessitated evacuation orders. The Grove Fire near the border of San Diego and Riverside Counties expanded to 1.4 square miles overnight and had 10% containment by Thursday afternoon. The topography of the land is reportedly making it particularly difficult for firefighting efforts.Montana is under a fire warning due to high temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds. Missoula experienced hurricane-force winds, which toppled trees and downed power lines, causing officials to warn the public about the potential dangers of electrified rivers.In Canada, a quick-moving fire hit the town of Jasper in Jasper National Park, causing thousands to evacuate and inflicting significant damage. Like their US counterparts, these wildfires have led to air quality alerts and advice as thick smoke blankets the sky.","Authorities in California have arrested a suspect believed to be responsible for starting the Park Fire.

Who is Ella Emhoff defending Kamala Harris from JD Vance’s 'childless cat lady' remark?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-ella-emhoff-defending-kamala-harris-from-jd-vances-childless-cat-lady-remark/articleshow/112028634.cms,"Who is Ella Emhoff?

Controversy related to Ella

Ella’s Relationship with Harris

Ella Emhoff: The Breakout Fashion Star

Ella Emhoff , stepdaughter of US Vice President Kamala Harris , has recently defended her mother against a derogatory comment made by JD Vance . Vance’s “childless cat lady” remark, from a 2021 interview, resurfaced following President Joe Biden’s endorsement of Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee.In response, Emhoff sharply retorted, “How can you be ‘childless’ when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I?” This defense has attracted attention as Harris faces increased scrutiny in the presidential race.Ella Emhoff is the daughter of Douglas Emhoff, who married Kamala Harris in August 2014. Before this, Douglas was married to Kerstin Emhoff, with whom he had two children: Cole and Ella. The siblings were named after jazz legends Ella Fitzgerald and Cole Porter. Emhoff’s relationship with her stepmother began when Harris was serving as California's Attorney General.Ella Emhoff faced criticism for posting a link to a fundraiser for UNRWA, an organization aiding Palestinian refugees. The group was accused by Israel of hiring individuals linked to the October 7 Hamas attacks, leading to financial withdrawals from various countries. Although Emhoff removed the link from her profile, the incident sparked backlash from UN Watch, as per reports.Ella, 25, and her brother Cole affectionately call Kamala Harris “Momala.” Emhoff gained public attention with her bold fashion choices at Harris’s inauguration and subsequently signed with IMG Models. Kerstin Emhoff, Douglas’s ex-wife, has praised Harris as “caring” and “supportive.”A Parsons fashion student, Ella Emhoff quickly made a name for herself with standout outfits and collaborations. Her Miu Miu coat and partnership with Batsheva Hay garnered global headlines. Emhoff debuted at Paris Fashion Week for Balenciaga and has since worked with major brands like Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein, and Stella McCartney.","Ella Emhoff is the daughter of Douglas Emhoff, who married Kamala Harris in August 2014.

Homeless: 'Act with urgency': California governor Newsom orders urgent dismantling of homeless camps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/newsom-california-directive-act-with-urgency-on-homeless-encampments/articleshow/112028523.cms,"California Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered the dismantling of thousands of homeless encampments across the state. This directive is the nation’s most sweeping response following a recent Supreme Court ruling granting governments greater authority to remove homeless individuals from public spaces.Homeless encampments have been a particularly wrenching issue in California, where high housing costs exacerbate the complex factors contributing to homelessness.Last year, an estimated 180,000 people were homeless in the state, with the majority being unsheltered.Newsom, a Democrat, called for state officials and local leaders to ""humanely remove encampments from public spaces"" and to act ""with urgency,"" prioritizing those that pose the greatest health and safety threats. While his order directly applies to state agencies, he can only pressure local governments to comply by leveraging the billions of dollars the state controls for addressing homelessness.During a news conference, a tearful Premier Danielle Smith described the encampments' removal as ""the worst nightmare for any community,"" highlighting the emotional toll on affected areas. Newsom's administration noted that despite significant investment in homelessness programs, California still faces a severe shortage of emergency housing .""An executive order alone won't solve this crisis,"" said Eric Tars, senior policy director at the National Homelessness Law Center in Washington, DC. ""The only way to end homeless encampments in California is to end the need for homeless encampments. California has an affordable housing crisis , and unless Newsom's executive order comes with sufficient resources to address that, this new push isn't going to work.""Newsom's order extends the approach used by the California Department of Transportation, which has been clearing encampments along freeways. It directs state agencies to connect occupants with local service providers but does not mandate their relocation to shelters or specify penalties for those who refuse to move.The directive has sparked debate among local leaders. Some have begun to clear encampments, while others decry the Supreme Court’s ruling as enabling inhumane measures. Critics argue that criminalizing homelessness does not address the root issues and further stigmatizes those in need.""Dismantling encampments means people can lose all of their possessions, including important legal documents, medications, and other necessary items,"" said Scout Katovich, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). ""Newsom is taking the conservative Supreme Court up on its invitation to make homelessness a crime.""San Francisco, California’s fourth most populous city, welcomed the Supreme Court decision in the case of Grants Pass v. Johnson and has already begun removing tents. The governor's order comes amid Republican criticism of Democrats over urban issues , including homelessness, which they argue has worsened under Democratic leadership.Kamala Harris, a native of California's Bay Area, has also been linked to these issues. Harris, who recently launched her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, served as San Francisco's district attorney before becoming a senator and then vice president. Republicans are keen to tie her political record to urban problems, including homelessness.Newsom, seen as a potential future presidential candidate, has invested about $24 billion into homelessness since taking office in 2019. His administration reports that it helped move more than 165,000 homeless people into temporary or permanent housing two fiscal years ago.Homelessness is rising in the US, driven by chronic shortages of affordable housing. In 2023, around 653,000 people were homeless, the largest number since tracking began in 2007.The California non-profit group People Assisting the Homeless (PATH) criticized the governor’s order, stating that organizations providing services to the homeless ""were not consulted."" The group argued that the directive would ""push vulnerable residents"" off state property and be counterproductive.","California Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered the dismantling of thousands of homeless encampments across the state.

At least 18 bodies were recovered from the small plane that caught fire after skidding off the runway during takeoff from Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu on Wednesday.The sole survivor of the crash was the pilot, who was transported to Kathmandu Medical College Hospital for treatment. According to a doctor cited by AP, the pilot sustained injuries to the eyes but is not in any danger.The aircraft, operated by local carrier Saurya Airlines , was en route to Pokhara city carrying two crew members and 17 technicians for maintenance checks, as said by airport security chief Arjun Chand Thakuri.The cause of the slip remains unclear.""The plane skidded off the runway and crashed into a field east of the runway,"" Thakuri told Reuters. Emergency responders quickly extinguished the fire that erupted from the crash.Television footage showed firefighters battling the blaze as thick black smoke billowed into the sky. Other visuals captured rescue workers sifting through the charred remains of the plane, scattered across lush green fields. Bodies were seen being carried to ambulances on stretchers, with local residents looking on.Tribhuvan International Airport, the primary hub for international and domestic flights in Nepal , has been closed as emergency crews continue their work. Despite the monsoon season in Kathmandu, it was not raining at the time of the crash, though visibility was low across the capital.Saurya Airlines, which operates domestic flights within Nepal, uses two Bombardier CRJ-200 regional jets, both around 20 years old, according to Flight Radar 24.Nepal's air safety record has faced significant scrutiny in recent years. In 2019, a Bangladeshi airliner crashed at Tribhuvan airport, resulting in 51 fatalities while 20 survived. An investigation revealed the plane was misaligned with the runway and the pilot was disoriented, attempting to land in “sheer desperation.”Similarly, in 2015, a Turkish Airlines jet skidded off a slippery runway at the same airport while landing in dense fog. Although the plane was carrying 238 people, no serious injuries were reported.","A small plane skidded off the runway during takeoff from Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu on Wednesday.

Previous debate agreements

Former US President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has announced that he will not engage in a debate with his Democratic rival , Vice President Kamala Harris , until the Democrats formally confirm their nominee. Trump’s decision comes despite Harris’s readiness to participate in a debate.“I have agreed to the previously agreed-upon September 10 debate,” Harris said at Joint Base Andrews upon her return from Houston.“He (Trump) agreed to that previously. Now here he is backpedaling, and I’m ready. The voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage.”Trump, who was officially declared the Republican nominee at the party’s convention in Milwaukee earlier this month, is awaiting the Democrats' formal decision on their nominee. Harris is expected to be declared the Democratic nominee at the party’s convention in Chicago in August.“Given the continued political chaos surrounding Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat Party, general election debate details cannot be finalized until Democrats formally decide on their nominee,” said Trump Campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung in a late-night statement.Cheung further criticized Harris, suggesting that some in the Democratic Party, including former President Barack Obama, doubt her viability as a candidate. “There is a strong sense that Kamala Harris is a Marxist fraud who cannot beat President Trump,” Cheung said.Trump and President Joe Biden had previously agreed to two debates: one on June 27 and another on September 10. However, Biden’s poor performance in the June 27 debate, hosted by CNN, led him to withdraw from the race three weeks later. The September 10 debate was slated to be hosted by ABC News.Trump has expressed willingness to debate Harris, noting that he is not thrilled with ABC. “I want to debate her, and she’ll be no different because they have the same policies,” Trump said earlier this week. He also indicated a willingness to participate in more than one debate.In light of the recent changes, Fox News Media has proposed hosting a debate between Trump and Harris on September 17 in Pennsylvania. “Now that Vice President Kamala Harris is the presumptive Democratic nominee, FOX News Media is amending our proposal for a debate this cycle,” the network stated in letters sent to both campaigns.The proposal suggests holding the debate in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, just as early voting begins. Fox News Media is open to discussing the exact date, format, and location of the debate, with or without an audience.","Trump and Biden had previously agreed to two debates: one on June 27 and another on September 10.

The conviction was tossed out by appeals judges who said jurors shouldn't have heard testimony from women who had accused the film producer of misconduct but whose allegations weren't part of the case.A retrial has been scheduled for November.While his conviction was thrown out, Weinstein has remained behind bars in part because he was sentenced to 16 years in prison in California after he was convicted in a rape case in Los Angeles in 2022.Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.At a recent court hearing, Weinstein's lawyers had said he was in poor health and asked for him to be transferred from the jail to the hospital.","Weinstein, who is awaiting trial in New York on rape and sexual assault charges, was moved from the city's Rikers Island jail complex to a locked ward at Bellevue Hospital.

Wildfires have wreaked havoc in the Canadian town of Jasper, destroying up to half of the community and prompting mass evacuations . Officials report that the blazes have leveled entire streets in Jasper, located in Alberta’s Jasper National Park, according to the BBC.Triggered by a lightning storm and fanned by powerful winds, the fires have left the once-bustling tourist destination in ruins.Smoldering rubble and charred vehicles now mark the site of what were once homes and businesses. Approximately 20,000 tourists and 5,000 residents have fled the mountainous area.Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, tearful during a news conference on Thursday, struggled to convey the scale of the destruction . She estimated that ""potentially 30 to 50 percent"" of buildings may have been lost. ""There is no denying that this is the worst nightmare for any community,"" Smith said, adding that Jasper National Park had been ""a source of pride"" for many generations.Local business owners are feeling the impact profoundly. Karyn Decore, owner of the Maligne Lodge, was on holiday when she received a photograph of her hotel in flames. ""I was horrified and devastated when I saw that photo,"" she told the BBC. ""It's really hard for everyone to comprehend that we lost one of our properties.""Efforts to combat the blaze have drawn in hundreds of firefighters from around the world, including teams from Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and South Africa. Pierre Martel, director of the national fire management program at Parks Canada, described the extreme difficulty in containing the fire. ""It [was] just a monster at that point,"" he said. ""There are no tools we have in our toolbox to deal with it.""The flames, reaching heights of up to 100 meters (328 feet) in some areas, spread rapidly. Alberta's Minister for Public Safety, Mike Ellis, recounted how the fire advanced from being 5 km (three miles) outside of Jasper to engulfing the town in less than 30 minutes. ""Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that,"" Ellis said. ""Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large, and so quickly.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his gratitude towards the emergency services, saying, ""As the heartbreaking images from Jasper emerge, I want to thank the brave first responders who are in Alberta right now, fighting to save every home and every community they can.""Despite some rainfall overnight, officials from Jasper National Park reported that it had ""no significant impact"" on the wildfire. ""While the rain helped reduce fire activity slightly, it is not enough to have made a meaningful impact on the overall wildfire situation, which remains out of control,"" read a post on the park's social media account.The wildfires in Jasper are part of a broader pattern of severe fire conditions in the region. Last year, a record 2.2 million hectares burned in Alberta between March 1 and October 31. In addition to the fires in Alberta, there are over 45 active blazes in British Columbia, and fires are burning in several US states, including California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Utah.","Wildfires have destroyed up to half of the town of Jasper, Alberta, prompting mass evacuations.

"Why is US Air Force moving more F-16 near Korean DMZ, forming 'Super Squadron'?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-air-force-f-16-presence-near-korean-dmz-forming-super-squadron/articleshow/112028139.cms,"The US Air Force is reportedly bolstering its presence near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North and South Korea by shifting nine additional F-16 fighters to Osan Air Base . This move will create a so-called "" Super Squadron "" at Osan, located only 50 miles south of the DMZ, as reported by Air & Space Forces magazine.The fighters are being relocated from Kunsan Air Base in southwestern Korea to Osan, which will see its 36th Fighter Squadron increase from 22 jets to 31.This year-long test aims to evaluate how this enhancement impacts sortie generation, maintenance, and manpower, and to determine if larger squadrons can maximize combat effectiveness, explained Air & Space Forces magazine.""This test is an opportunity for us to see if squadrons of this size increase our training effectiveness while also increasing our combat capability if deterrence fails,"" Lt Gen. David R. Iverson, commander of the 7th Air Force and deputy commander of US Forces Korea, was quoted as saying.Along with the fighters, approximately 150 Airmen, including pilots, engineers, and combat support personnel, are relocating to Osan Air Base. The bases are roughly 100 miles apart.Iverson acknowledged that these changes might present challenges for Airmen and their families but emphasized that leaders are working to mitigate impacts while ""increasing readiness and warfighting capability.""The 25th Fighter Squadron at Osan remains the only internationally based unit to operate A-10 aircraft. While the timeline for the continued operation of A-10s at the base is uncertain, maintenance contracts with South Korean firms extend until 2029. Some analysts suggest that the increased F-16 presence might lead to an earlier-than-planned retirement of the A-10s from the peninsula.As per reports, this shift is part of the Air Force's broader strategy to adjust its fighter posture. The PACAF 2030 Strategy, released in September 2023, highlighted the need to re-optimize the command's basing to better respond to contemporary crises.In addition to the changes at Osan, the Pentagon recently announced the basing of 36 F-15EX aircraft at Kadena Air Base in Japan, replacing the remaining F-15C/Ds. Misawa Air Base in Japan is also set to receive four dozen F-35As, replacing its 36 F-16s, making it the first foreign base in the Indo-Pacific to host USAF F-35 fighters and the second overall, after RAF Lakenheath in the UK.Former PACAF Commander Gen. Kenneth S. Wilsbach highlighted the increasing dangers posed by China, North Korea, and Russia, underscoring the strategic necessity of these adjustments. Osan first received F-16s in 1988, with Kunsan being the first overseas base to convert from F-4 Phantoms to F-16s in 1981. The current modernization efforts include significant upgrades to the F-16 fleet, enhancing their capabilities with new radar and display technologies.","The US Air Force is reportedly bolstering its presence near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North and South Korea by shifting nine additional F-16 fighters to Osan Air Base.

The cartel has long been considered one of the most powerful and dangerous drug trafficking organizations in the world.He, alongside Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, was known for running the cartel’s smuggling operations, but keeping a lower profile. The US Drug Enforcement Administration had offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to his capture.In February, US federal prosecutors charged Zambada with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid. US officials have identified fentanyl as the leading cause of death among Americans aged 18 to 45, highlighting the severe impact of the drug crisis.Zambada's apprehension marks a significant development in the ongoing battle against international drug trafficking . His capture is expected to provide US authorities with critical insights into the operations of the Sinaloa Cartel, which has been responsible for smuggling vast quantities of narcotics into the United States over the past several decades.The detention represents a major victory for law enforcement agencies in both the United States and Mexico, who have long sought to bring him to justice.","Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez were arrested in Texas.

'I will not be silent': Kamala Harris tells Israeli PM Netanyahu 'it is time' to finalize hostage deal and end Gaza war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-will-not-be-silent-kamala-harris-tells-israeli-pm-netanyahu-it-is-time-to-finalize-hostage-deal-and-end-gaza-war/articleshow/112028066.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to finalize a peace deal and expressed her unwillingness to remain silent on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. This marks a departure from the approach of outgoing President Joe Biden, who largely exercised behind-the-scenes pressure on Israel.Speaking to reporters after her meeting with Netanyahu, Harris condemned the ongoing conflict, saying, ""What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating.The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.""Harris, who assumed the Democratic presidential nomination after Biden announced he would not seek re-election, emphasized the urgency of addressing the humanitarian crisis during her ""frank"" discussion with Netanyahu. ""I expressed with the prime minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians. And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there.""In addition to calling for a Palestinian state, Harris urged both Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and release hostages to end the conflict, which began with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel. ""As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,"" she asserted.Harris's forthright stance contrasts sharply with the earlier amicable exchange between Biden and Netanyahu, despite underlying tensions and questions about Biden's influence. Netanyahu praised Biden, saying, ""From a proud Zionist Jew to a proud Zionist Irish American, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel. And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead.""While Harris has previously been more vocal about Gaza than Biden, White House officials maintain there is no significant policy divergence between them. The White House stated that Biden would emphasize the need for ""compromise"" in a deal, following Netanyahu's assertive speech to the US Congress.Biden and Netanyahu also met with families of US hostages held in Gaza, who expressed cautious optimism about a potential new ceasefire proposal. ""We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November,"" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen.Protests erupted outside the White House, echoing the demonstrations during Netanyahu's Congressional address. Despite ongoing US military aid to Israel since the October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been strained by Israel's war conduct and suspicions of stalling on a peace deal.The Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in 1,197 deaths in Israel, predominantly civilians, with 111 of the 251 hostages taken still held in Gaza. Israel's retaliatory offensive has resulted in at least 39,175 Palestinian deaths in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.","Vice President Kamala Harris met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

What's this California law that Musk says 'killed' his son?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whats-this-california-law-that-musk-says-killed-his-son/articleshow/112027765.cms,"On July 17, the world's richest man Elon Musk declared he would pluck the headquarters of two of his companies - SpaceX and X - from California and plant them in Texas. Was it to save on income tax? No, Musk's sudden decision seemed to be shaped by ideology.""This is the final straw,"" he wrote on X, blaming a new California law that requires schools to keep parents in the dark about changes in their children's gender identities.""Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,"" he wrote. As for X, it's going to Austin.Why did Musk react so strongly to this law? Was it because one of his 12 children is a transgender woman who broke all ties with him two years ago?Musk had five sons from his first marriage to Canadian author Justine Wilson. Twins Xavier and Griffin were born in 2004, followed by triplets Damian, Kai and Saxon in 2006.In 2020, amid the Covid pandemic, 16-year-old Xavier Alexander Musk came out as trans but didn't inform Papa Musk, according to the latter's biographer Walter Isaacson. Instead, Xavier texted Elon's sister-in-law: ""Hey, I'm transgender, and my name is now Jenna. Don't tell my dad.""Isaacson says Elon was ""generally sanguine"" about Xavier's transition. Until then he had seemingly embraced diversity and supported LGBTQ rights. In 2018, for example, he ticked off someone for a now-deleted post against Pride Month: ""Don't buy our car if that's a problem. People should be free to live their lives where their heart takes them.""But this was before Jenna officially changed her gender to female and her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson on turning 18 in 2022. She took her mother's surname to disassociate herself from her father, and said in her petition: ""I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.""At the time, Musk had criticised the press for publishing Jenna's (she goes by her middle name) story. ""I think it is important to defend her right to privacy. Please don't out someone against their will - it's not right.""It's ironic that the new law that Musk called his 'last straw' aims to do just that - not out anyone against their will, not even to their parents.Two days before Musk decided to quit California, state governor Gavin Newsom had signed the divisive bill AB-1955, better known as SAFETY (Support Academic Futures and Educators for Today's Youth Act) into law. Musk says he had cautioned Newsom ""about a year ago that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children"". So what, according to Musk, was so dangerous about this law?The law is firstly meant to protect LGBTQ+ students in schools. Nobody at school is allowed to ""disclose any information related to a pupil's sexual orientation, gender identity , or gender expression to any other person (including parents) without the pupil's consent"".Secondly, it shields school staff from the management. They cannot make any rule that forces staff to disclose information about a child's sexual orientation or gender identity to a third person. They also cannot retaliate against an employee or contractor who stands up for students in this regard.To Musk, AB-1955 is nothing but a symptom of the ""woke mind virus"" that he's been complaining about since his estrangement with Jenna. Most recently, on July 22, he brought it up in an interview with Canadian psychologist and conservative commentator Jordan Peterson, saying, ""My son is dead - killed by the woke mind virus"".So, shortly after AB-1955 became law, Musk tweeted: ""The state will take away your kids in California."" His biographer says Musk is waging war against ""woke"" thinking because the rift with Jenna has hurt him ""more than anything in his life since the infant death of his first child, Nevada."" Musk told Isaacson: ""I've made many overtures, but she doesn't want to spend time with me.""He had also indicated his opposition to laws like AB-1955 last year, when he tweeted: ""Consenting adults should do whatever makes them happy, provided it does not harm others, but a child is not capable of consent, which is why we have laws protecting minors.""The same day he wrote: ""I will be actively lobbying to criminalise making severe, irreversible changes to children below the age of consent.""In conversation with Peterson last Monday, Musk described gender-reassignment surgery as ""child mutilation and sterilisation"". He stressed that Xavier had been ""killed"" after he received gender-affirming treatments such as puberty-blockers. By stalling the production of sex hormones in teens, these drugs halt changes associated with puberty.On his own role in the process, he said, ""I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys. This was really before I had any understanding of what was going on, and we had Covid going on, so there was a lot of confusion."" Musk says he agreed to put his son through gender-affirming care only because he was told there was a risk of the boy committing suicide.",Elon Musk is moving the headquarters of SpaceX and X from California to Texas.

She claimed that Khan's residence in Lahore, Zaman Park, had become a ""training hub for terrorists "", where petrol bombs were made and attacks on the state were planned.The May 9 riots erupted across Pakistan after Khan was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a corruption case. Hundreds of PTI workers and senior leaders were arrested for their involvement in the violence and attacks on military installations, including the Jinnah House, ISI building in Faisalabad, and General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi.Maryam also accused the PTI of conspiring to default the country, writing letters to the International Monetary Fund, waving cipher messages, and disrespecting memorials as part of a larger plot. She called for strict action against the PTI under the Constitution and law, citing national security and interests.The chief minister further criticized the PTI for alienating friendly countries, making baseless accusations against the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and disrupting Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit in 2014 by staging a sit-in. She recounted PTI's previous attacks on Parliament, PTV, and the Prime Minister's house, and accused them of violence against police officers and desecrating the Supreme Court's walls.In March, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Ataullah Tarar said that a handful of ""miscreants"" associated with the PTI were bent upon sabotaging Pakistan's deal with the IMF, which he said was crucial for economic stability.He said that at the protest, activists belonging to PTI were urging the IMF to give funds to Pakistan only if their jailed leader was released, regretting that activists of an ""anti-national"" party continued to hold sit-ins and protests outside the IMF offices. He said the protesters only wanted to sabotage the IMF deal because their dream was to make Pakistan default.","Maryam Nawaz, the daughter of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, has accused Imran Khan of orchestrating attacks on government buildings and military installations.

"Anti-terrorism efforts being made controversial by illegal, political mafias, says Pak army",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terrorism-efforts-being-made-controversial-by-illegal-political-mafias-says-pak-army/articleshow/111937180.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan armyaccused its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts , including a new military operation, to the detriment of the country’s national interests following the arrest on Monday of Raoof Hasan, information secretary of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), headed by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan. The army said the party information secretary was in charge of PTI ’s digital media cell which, it alleged, was involved in running anti-state propaganda.Last month PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved a military offensive to counter aspikein terrorist attacks across Pakistan, particularly in volatile northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, but the idea was widely criticised by opposition parties, particularly PTI and the rights group Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). They termed it a ploy against Pashtuns to earn dollars from major powers and exploit their resources.Addressing a presser in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, asked, “Why did a mafia, a political mafia , and an illegal mafia say that they would not let this campaign (OperationAzm-e-Istehkam, or Resolve for Stability) happen?” He added that opponents of the offensive had tried to make it “controversial” and paint it as a purely military operation in which thousands of people would be displaced.He did not name any party or group butcalled the army’s critics “politicalandillegal mafias”,an apparent reference to PTI and PTM.Lt Gen Chaudhry said they were using “fake news and propaganda” to spread lies about the army and its intentions.“This is digital terrorism,” he said. “The physical terrorist also attacks law enforcement agencies and the army, and the digital terrorist also attacks the army. They are doing the same thing.”“Digital terrorists”, the spokesman said, would be deterred through laws, regulation and monitoring.He, however, questioned the lack of action against such individuals despite their activities against the leadership of the state and other institutions. “Instead of the courts and regulations moving forward against them, they’re given further space and they’re made heroes in the name of freedom of expression,” he said.Ahead of Sharif’s press conference, security forces had raided PTI’s offices and arrested Raoof Hasan from the party’s central secretariat. The raid came a week after the govt had said it planned to ban the party.“The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,” Islamabad police said, adding that those directly involved in anti-national propaganda were arrested and all evidence from PTI’s digital media cell wasconfiscated.The party issued a statement on X, saying: “It’s absolutely shameful how Islamabad police continues to completely mock and disregard every law in this country. Law of the jungle is reigning over Pakistan!”The crackdown on PTI follows several court rulings in its favour this month that threaten PM Sharif’s govt, which came to power in Feb this year with the military’s backing.","Pakistan army accuses its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts.

The Pakistan army on Monday accused an "" illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation, codenamed "" Azm-i-Istehkam "" (Resolve for Stability), against rising terrorism in the country.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif, in a press conference in Rawalpindi, stated that a ""massive, illegal political mafia"" has risen to undermine the operation due to ""vested interests"".Sharif clarified that Azm-i-Istehkam is not just a military operation but a comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign launched through national consensus to reinvigorate the already in-place National Action Plan (NAP).He stressed that the purpose of the operation is to eliminate terrorism, which will eventually lead to ""societal and national uplift"".However, the DG ISPR accused a ""very strong lobby"" of having a vested interest in sabotaging the operation, as it does not want the NAP to succeed.He alleged that this entity is receiving a lot of money to subvert the operation.""The stakes in [sabotaging] this operation are very high, and it's not based on any ideology but involves a lot of money,"" he said.Lt Gen Sharif stated that the ""illegal political mafia"" made the first move to make the operations controversial through false and fake arguments.He pointed out that the problem lies in the implementation of the NAP's other points, such as the regularisation and registration of religious seminaries, where only a bit over 16,000 out of about 32,000 seminaries have been registered so far. He questioned whether the army should be responsible for these tasks.The DG ISPR also mentioned the issue of the ""illegal spectrum"", which hides a major illegal economy through which the criminal system and terrorism operate. He said the requirement of the illegal spectrum is a ""soft state"" and the solution to it is the National Action Plan.While the DG ISPR's statements highlight the challenges faced by the government in implementing its counter-terrorism strategy, it is essential to note that the army's involvement in political matters can be a sensitive issue.The military has historically played a significant role in the country's politics, and its direct intervention in political affairs has often been a subject of controversy.It remains to be seen whether the army will take a more active role in the country's affairs in response to the alleged sabotage of the counter-terrorism campaign by the ""illegal political mafia"".","Pakistan army accuses an ""illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation.

This crucial vote is set to shape the future of reforms in the island nation, which is going through with its worst financial crisis in decades.Candidates must submit their nominations by August 15. Current President Ranil Wickremesinghe is expected to run, with nearly 17 million of the country's 22 million people eligible to vote.Wickremesinghe, 75, assumed the presidency in July 2022 after massive protests over the financial crisis led to his predecessor, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, fleeing the country and resigning.Wickremesinghe was elected by Parliament to complete the remainder of Rajapaksa's five-year term, initially won in November 2019.Under Wickremesinghe, the country has begun to recover, aided by a $2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Economic indicators have improved, with inflation dropping from 70% in September 2022 to 1.7% in June. The rupee has strengthened, and foreign exchange reserves are being rebuilt. After contracting by 7.3% at the peak of the crisis and shrinking another 2.3% last year, the economy is expected to grow by 3% in 2024.Recently, bilateral creditors including Japan, China, and India agreed to a $10 billion debt restructuring . This deal offers Colombo a four-year reprieve on repayments, saving the country $5 billion.However, Sri Lanka still needs to finalize a preliminary agreement with bondholders to restructure $12.5 billion in debt before a third IMF review later this year. Despite the progress, higher taxes under the IMF program, ongoing inflation, and a stagnant job market have driven a quarter of the population into poverty and prompted thousands to migrate.Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who leads the Marxist-leaning Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), are expected to contest the presidential election. Both have indicated plans to modify the IMF program to alleviate the cost of living and manage the country’s debt repayment more effectively.""Dissanayake and Premadasa have both publicly stated their intent to revamp the IMF program,"" observed an analyst.Analysts warn that Sri Lanka's recovery remains fragile. Efforts to retract the reforms could potentially lead to another crisis.

Luckily, Captain Manish Ratna Shakya was saved and is the sole survivor of a plane crash. The plane was en route to Pokhra but due to a technical fault , it veered right at the time it was supposed to take off and rammed into the east side of the runway.The sole survivor of the crash has been identified as Manish Ratna Shakya. According to his LinkedIn profile, he joined Saurya Airlines in December 2014 and has been a part of the company for over 9 years. He earlier flew for Simrik Airlines for nearly three years. According to the profile, he seems to have attended a school in India as he listed Mussoorie Modern School in his profile.Upon colliding with the east side of the runway, the cockpit along with the pilot was ripped off from the rest of the aircraft by getting caught inside of a shipping container while the rest of the aircraft burst into flames. This allowed Shakya to be rescued less than 5 minutes after the accident due to which it was possible to save his life while the rest of the people onboard were not so lucky.Images released by Nepal police show Shakya being aided away from the scene of the crash with a bloodied face but he was still stable enough to talk on his way to the hospital, according to PTI.“He was facing difficulty in breathing as the air shield was open. We broke the window and immediately pulled him out,” a statement by Senior Superintendent of Nepal Police Dambar Bishwakarma.The captain sustained a vast number of injuries including scarring on his brain and multiple fractures in his backbone. He is still being treated for his injuries at Kathmandu Medical College however doctors say that the captain is 100% out of danger and has started consuming liquid foods as part of his diet already as well.Nepal unfortunately has had a history of air crashes, according to Nepal's civil aviation body, 914 people have died in aircraft-related accidents since August of 1955.","A Saurya Airlines aircraft crashed during takeoff at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal killing 18 of the 19 people on board.

NEW DELHI: Eighteen people were killed in Nepal when a small passenger plane crashed while taking off from the main airport in the capital Kathmandu, drawing attention once again to the Himalayan nation's poor record on air safety .Here is a look at why Nepal, where more than 360 have died in airplane or helicopter crashes since 2000, is particularly susceptible.Wedged between India and China, landlocked Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 highest peaks, and its planes often have to service small airports nestled in remote hills or near peaks blanketed in clouds.Apart from the physical obstructions, the terrain can also experience sudden weather changes that affect wind speeds and intensity, making navigation tricky.In a 2023 safety report, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) said collision with terrain or another obstacle was the main risk, accounting for 93% of deaths in air accidents in the prior decade.Because of Nepal's scarcity of flat terrain, several areas have tabletop runways, built by excavating peaks to create a flat surface.These have sheer drops at one or both ends, calling for greater skill in landing aircraft but also leading to massive injuries or fatalities if pilots overshoot on the approach.Among the world's poorer countries, Nepal has not invested sufficiently in upgrading or maintaining its planes.Many are ageing, so that they lack some features and facilities common elsewhere, and tend to be poorly maintained, making mishaps more likely.This is partly why the European Union, citing ""safety concerns"", banned air carriers certified in Nepal in 2013.In its latest safety review in 2023, however, the EU recognised the aviation regulator's ""proactive engagement"" and efforts to boost oversight.Experts have called for better training for pilots in Nepal, with some crashes attributed to poor decision making.Nepal's worst crash in three decades killed 72 people in January 2023 and was blamed, for example, on the pilot's lack of awareness of standard operating procedures leading him to mistakenly cut the power to the plane, causing its crash.This was the only fatal accident globally last year, snapping a years-long trend of positive safety in the Asia-Pacific region, the International Air Transport Association said in a report.Aviation services and regulation are handled by separate agencies in most countries, but in Nepal, regulator CAAN both regulates airlines and manages airports.Experts say this is a conflict of interest as the regulator polices its own operations, adding that it has led to corruption and mismanagement.CAAN denies this contention, saying there is no direct link between the units functioning under one organisation.",Landlocked Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 highest peaks. Its planes often have to service small airports nestled in remote hills or near peaks blanketed in clouds. The European Union banned air carriers certified in Nepal in 2013.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112015387,imgsize-111592,width-400,resizemode-4/112015387.jpg"

Partial restoration of broadband internet

Arrests surge past 2,500

Bangladesh eased a nationwide curfew Thursday after last week’s unrest resulted in the deaths of at least 191 people, including several police officers, marking some of the most severe violence during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s tenure. While thousands of troops continue to patrol cities and a nationwide internet shutdown largely remains, clashes have subsided since protest leaders temporarily halted new demonstrations.The government allowed free movement for seven hours, from 10.00 am to 5.00 pm, as a step towards normalcy.The capital city Dhaka, home to 20 million people, saw a resurgence of commuter traffic Thursday morning. This comes days after intense clashes between police and protesters had left the streets nearly empty. Banks, government offices, and garment factories , crucial to the country's economy, reopened on Wednesday after being shut down during the peak of the unrest. The reopening marks a significant move towards restoring regular activities in the city, which had been severely disrupted by the violence and subsequent curfew.Garment factories and banks resumed operations in Bangladesh on Wednesday following a relaxation of the curfew imposed to curb deadly clashes. The protests, driven by students demanding changes to civil service employment quotas, led to the deaths of at least 186 people. Despite the presence of thousands of troops and an ongoing internet shutdown, calm has started to return to the streets. ""We were worried about the future of our company,"" said Khatun, a 40-year-old factory worker. The reopening of these factories is crucial for the country's economy, heavily reliant on the textile industry.Broadband internet services were partially restored in Bangladesh after five days of a nationwide blackout. The shutdown occurred amid clashes between security personnel and protesters, which reportedly resulted in over 100 deaths. The phased restoration, described as a ""trial run"" by the state minister for post, telecommunication, and information technology, prioritizes banking, commercial sectors, technology firms, exporters, outsourcing providers, and media outlets. According to the Internet Service Providers Association of Bangladesh (ISPAB), around 40% of broadband connections have been restored, with efforts ongoing to reconnect the remaining lines.Arrests in Bangladesh following violent protests over employment quotas surpassed 2,500 as of Tuesday, according to an AFP tally. The unrest, which began as demonstrations against politicized government job quotas, escalated into widespread violence, resulting in at least 174 deaths, including several police officers. A curfew and internet blackout were imposed to control the situation. The student group leading the protests has temporarily suspended demonstrations, citing the need to avoid further bloodshed. Despite the government's efforts to restore order, the response has faced criticism for its severity and the high number of casualties.","Bangladesh eased a nationwide curfew Thursday after last week’s unrest resulted in the deaths of at least 191 people, including several police officers.

It said rescue operations were initiated immediately and fire was brought under control. “One injured person (Captain Manish Ratna Shakya) was rescued and taken to the hospital, and 18 people were found dead,” it added.The deceased were identified as co-pilot S Katuwal, the employees of Saurya Airlines and a Yemeni national (Aref Reda).Manu Raj Sharma, a technician of the airline, his wife Priza Khatiwada and their four-year-old son Adhi Raj Sharma were among the deceased. Priza worked as an assistant computer operator at the ministry of energy, water resources and irrigation.A statement issued by the airline said that Priza and her son were initially identified as employees of the company, but it was later revealed that they were passengers.Videos posted online showed the plane being enveloped in fire and smoke. Fire engines and ambulances were rushed to the spot after the incident.“I came out and saw a plane had crashed and there was smoke and fire coming out,” said Ram Kumar Khatri Chetri, who own a car parts store barely 100 metres from the crash site. “There was chaos and confusion. There was no way that anyone could go near the plane and help out,” he said.It is monsoon season in Kathmandu but was not raining at the time of the crash. Visibility was low across the capital, however.Of the deceased, 15 died on the spot while three died during treatment at a local hospital, authorities said.The bodies of the deceased have been shifted to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital for post-mortem. Grieving relatives gathered to collect the bodies of their loved ones, though they are not likely to be released for a day or two.Pilot Shakya, 37, is undergoing treatment at Kathmandu Model Hospital. Officials said that he remains in critical condition following injuries sustained in the accident. He is currently undergoing a crucial eye and spinal cord surgery and is admitted to the neuro-intensive care unit.Co-pilot Sasant Katuwal had been flying only for the past three years after completing training in France, his uncle Dhyan Bahadur Khadka said. He had just received a visa to go to Germany for further training and was excited about that, Khadka said.Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and home minister Ramesh Lekh separately visited the accident site to gather details about the incident and provide necessary directives. Oli said he was deeply saddened by the tragic deaths in the crash and was at the site to enquire about the cause of the air crash with the civil aviation authority's officials. He urged all for patience at this hour of grief.According to Tribhuvan International Airport chief Jagannath Niraula, the plane flying from Kathmandu to Pokhara turned in the wrong direction.“As soon as it took off, it turned right instead of turning left,” Niraula was quoted as saying by the BBC News Nepali. However, “the cause of the accident has not been revealed yet”, he said. The accident happened less than a minute after the plane took off, Niraula said.Nepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record , where many airlines fly to small airports in remote hills and near peaks shrouded in clouds. The country is home to eight of the world's 14 tallest mountain peaks.A cabinet meeting held in Singhadurbar decided to form a five-member committee led by former director general of the civil aviation authority, Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, to investigate the crash. The committee has been given 45 days to submit a report.The aircraft, manufactured by the Canadian company Bombardier in April 2003, was the sixth of its kind purchased for use in Nepal, according to information from planesspotters.com. Following the accident, services at the Kathmandu airport were halted briefly before being resumed, the airport authorities said.According to the company's website, Saruya Airlines operates flights to five tourist destinations within Nepal, with a fleet of three Bombardier CRJ-200 jets.Nepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record in recent years but the reasons also include sudden weather changes and airstrips located in hard-to-access rocky terrains, apart from human error.According to Nepal's civil aviation body, 914 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.In Jan last year, all 72 people on board, including five Indians, were killed when a Yeti Airlines aircraft crashed in the resort city of Pokhara. The crash was attributed to a human error.","Nepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record.

DHAKA: Rush-hour traffic returned to the streets of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Wednesday, as a curfew was eased after four days of nationwide shutdown that followed deadly protests led by university students against quotas in government jobs .Offices reopened and broadband internet was largely restored, although social media continued to be suspended, days after the clashes between protesters and security forces killed almost 150 people.The country has been relatively calm since Sunday after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of an appeal from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government and directed that 93% of jobs should be open to candidates on merit.Bangladesh 's mainstay garment and textiles industries, which supply to major Western brands, also began reopening some factories after a pause in production during the curfew.""All our factories are open today. Everything is going smoothly,"" said S.M. Mannan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.The stock exchange opened too, as well as banks, after remaining shut the past two days.Residents of Dhaka were out on the streets, some making their way to offices as public buses also began running in some places.""It was a hassle to reach the office on time,"" said Shamima Akhter, who works at a private firm in the capital. ""Some roads are still blocked for security reasons. Don't know when everything will get normal.""Local news websites, which had stopped updating since Friday, were back online too.Bangladesh authorities had shut mobile internet and deployed the army on the streets during the curfew that was imposed from midnight on Saturday.The government said curfew restrictions would be relaxed for seven hours on Wednesday and Thursday, and offices would also be open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.Analysts say the student action has given fresh impetus to Hasina's critics, months after she won a fourth-straight term in power in January in a national election boycotted by the main opposition party.""The informal federation of government critics appears deeper and wider than before the election, which presents a serious challenge to the ruling party,"" said Geoffrey Macdonald at the United States Institute of Peace.Hasina, 76, is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, who led the country's movement for independence from Pakistan.The earlier 56% job quotas included a 30% reservation for families of veterans of the 1971 independence war, which critics said favoured supporters of Hasina's Awami League.Hasina's government had scrapped the quotas in 2018, but a high court ruling reinstated the them last month.Students were furious because quotas left fewer than half of state jobs open on merit amid an unemployment crisis, particularly in the private sector, making government sector jobs with their regular wage hikes and perks especially prized.Hasina has blamed her political opponents for the violence and her government said on Tuesday that it would heed the Supreme Court ruling.The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has denied any involvement in the violence and accused Hasina of authoritarianism and a crackdown on her critics, charges denied by her government.Protesting students have given the government a fresh 48-hour ultimatum to fulfil four other conditions of an eight-point list of demands, and said they would announce their next steps on Thursday.""We want the government to meet our four-point demand, including restoration of internet, withdrawal of police from campuses, and opening universities (which have been closed for a week),"" protest coordinator Nahid Islam said.",Bangladesh's mainstay garment and textiles industries also began reopening some factories after a pause in production during the curfew.
