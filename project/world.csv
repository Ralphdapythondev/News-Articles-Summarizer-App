'I cant breathe': Black man dies after being pinned down by cops in Ohio,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/-i-cant-breathe-black-man-dies-after-being-pinned-down-by-cops-in-ohio/articleshow/109637770.cms,"with input from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Ohio police released video of a Black man who died at a local hospital after repeatedly telling the officers, "" I can't breathe ' as they pinned him to the floor of a bar and handcuffed him, bringing old memories of the killing of George Floyd in 2020.Officers from the Canton Police Department arrested a man named Frank Tyson , aged 53, who was suspected of fleeing the scene of a single-car accident on April 18.The 36-minute clip starts with a patrol officer finding a car that had hit an electrical pole and a bystander informing him that the driver of the vehicle had run into a nearby tavern, according to reuters.Officers were observed entering the bar after which an altercation broke out as they attempted to grab his arms and as he shouted, ""They are trying to kill me' and ""Call the sheriff."" Tyson was then handcuffed and assaulted by the officer, who reportedly placed his knee on Tyson's back close to his neck for approximately 30 seconds.Tyson was repeatedly observed saying, ""I can't breathe. I can't... get off my neck,"" as an officer yelled ""Calm down' and ""You're fine' before standing up.The video then shows Tyson lying still on the floor, facing downwards, for approximately six minutes, as officers converse with customers at the bar.The officers then examine Tyson, who seems to be unconscious. They can be heard saying, ""Is he breathing?"" and ""Does he have a pulse?""Eight minutes after the police officers put handcuffs on Tyson, they removed it and started performing CPR. Paramedics arrived at the location and transported Tyson out of the bar on a stretcher and into an ambulance that was ready.Tyson died at a local hospital and the official reason for the death remains unknown yet.The recent event brings back memories of George Floyd's clash with Minneapolis police four years ago. His death, captured on video and widely shared, sparked protests worldwide against police brutality and racism in America.In a similar incident, a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as Floyd, as he repeated ""I can't breathe"" before falling silent.Media reports suggests that Beau Schoenegge and Camden Burch were identified as the officers involved in the latest Tyson incident.Both individuals are placed on administrative leave, and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (OCI) is currently investigating the incident.","Ohio police released video of a Black man who died at a local hospital.

That left the boy angry.Along with two of his aides, he stormed her house Friday noon and asked her mother where she was. She replied the girl wasn't home. Sensing trouble, a relative started calling up other family members for help. It was then the boy shot the 35-year-old woman twice and fled.She was rushed to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital where doctors declared her dead. Police were yet to arrest the three attackers when reports last came in.The girl's family alleged that though cops had been informed many times about the harassment, no significant action was taken to restrain the boy or protect her.The boy had been threatening the family for the past month, a relative claimed, adding that he recently even updated his social media photo where he was seen brandishing a pistol.Following the shooting , a large police force secured the locality in order to avoid communal tension.They also held meetings with elders of both communities. The locals raised concerns about safety of women and effectiveness of policing to deal with such crimes.Cops said they were conducting raids to nab the accused and footage of CCTV cameras was being analysed to track their movement. “Several teams are looking for the accused.

"At Trump trial, Pecker says he killed story of affair even though it cost him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-trump-trial-pecker-says-he-killed-story-of-affair-even-though-it-cost-him/articleshow/109637850.cms,"NEW YORK: Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified on Friday at Donald Trump's criminal trial that he suppressed a story about an alleged affair to help Trump's 2016 presidential bid, even though it would have boosted sales of his tabloid.Testifying for a third day, Pecker, 72, agreed with a prosecutor who asked whether it would have been ""National Enquirer gold"" to publish the story of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's claim that she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007.But Pecker said he opted not to run the story after paying McDougal for it, because it would have hurt the Republican Trump's chances of winning the election over Democrat Hillary Clinton.""You killed the story because it helped the candidate, Donald Trump?"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked him.Pecker said yes.The exchange bolstered previous testimony in which Pecker said he worked with Trump's campaign to suppress allegations of adultery at a time when the then-presidential candidate was facing multiple accusations of sexual misbehavior.Pecker was the first witness in the case, which accuses Trump, 77, of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty.Pecker testified his tabloid paid for the rights to two such stories he never published, a tabloid practice referred to as ""catch and kill."" Pecker also alerted Trump that Daniels was looking to sell her story of a sexual encounter with Trump.The defense argues the hush money payment was made to spare Trump's family embarrassment, not to protect his presidential campaign. Trump, a businessman whose first public office was the White House, denies an encounter took place.After Pecker's testimony, prosecutors called two more witnesses to boost their case.Rhona Graff, who worked as Trump's business assistant from 1987 to 2021, testified she once saw Daniels at Trump Tower before he ran for president. She said she heard Trump say he was interested in casting her on ""The Apprentice,"" the reality TV show he hosted.She said the email addresses of Daniels and McDougal were stored in the computer systems of Trump's company.Trump shook her hand when she left the witness stand.Banker Gary Farro testified that Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, set up accounts with him shortly before the election for two shell companies, including one that was used to pay Daniels.The trial was scheduled to resume on Tuesday.'I know what I remember'During cross-examination, Trump lawyer Emil Bove sought to undermine Pecker's credibility .Bove asked Pecker whether he had inaccurately testified that Trump thanked him at the White House for handling the negative news stories. That conflicted with a report by FBI agents who previously interviewed Pecker, which said Trump had not expressed gratitude.Pecker, 72, said the FBI report could be wrong.""I know what I testified to, and I know what I remember,"" Pecker told the New York court's 12 jurors and six alternates.Bove asked Pecker whether his statements aligned with facts contained in an agreement by the Enquirer's parent company to cooperate with legal authorities to avoid prosecution. Pecker denied any substantial mismatch.Bove also sought to illustrate that Pecker's checkbook journalism was not confined to Trump.Under questioning by Bove on Thursday, Pecker said the Enquirer paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to obtain stories from women who came forward during Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2003 run for California governor to say they had affairs with him.Pecker said the first time he gave Trump a heads up about a negative story was in 1998 in relation to Marla Maples, his wife at the time.Prosecutors say Pecker's arrangement with Trump corrupted the 2016 election. He agreed to cooperate to avoid criminal charges.Trump is the first former president to face criminal charges. The trial, which is expected to run through May, could be the only one of his four criminal prosecutions to be completed before his Nov. 5 election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.One of those cases, which charges Trump with trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden, has been delayed for months by the U.S. Supreme Court, which signaled on Thursday that it might be open to giving him some immunity from criminal charges.Justice Juan Merchan, who is hearing the New York hush money case, has yet to rule on a request by prosecutors to punish Trump for allegedly violating a gag order that bars him from publicly criticizing witnesses, some court officials and their relatives.Merchan said he would hold a hearing next Thursday to examine what prosecutors say are further gag order violations. Trump could be fined $1,000 for each violation or jailed, though prosecutors say they are not seeking imprisonment at this point.",Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testifies at Donald Trump's criminal trial.

Rosanna Arquette, Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino were among those to speak out.""This is unfair to survivors . We live in our truth. We know what happened,"" said Judd, the first actress to come forward with allegations against Weinstein.In what Judd called ""an act of institutional betrayal "", New York's highest court, in a 4-3 decision, ordered a new trial, saying the first one had prejudiced Weinstein, 72, with improper rulings, including letting some accusers testify about allegations that weren't part of the case. Weinstein will remain in jail, however, because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape.""As a survivor, I am beyond disappointed,"" Arquette, actress and Weinstein accuser, told Hollywood Reporter. ""Horrified!... He's a prolific serial predator who raped/harmed 200+women! Disgusted w/justice system,"" said Sorvino, actress and Weinstein accuser, via X. ""They will never overturn who we are,"" Rose McGowan, actress and another Weinstein accuser, via Instagram.However, #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, who nearly two decades ago coined the phrase from her work with sexual assault survivors, said the movement was greater than any court case. It's still there, and it's working. The most obvious proof, she said: ""Ten years ago we could not get a man like Weinstein into the courtroom.""Also seeking to take the long view was Anita Hill. She testified against Clarence Thomas during his 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearing, becoming the face of the fight against sexual harassment more than a quarter-century before the Weinstein revelations launched the #MeToo movement. Hill now heads the Hollywood Commission, which seeks to fight harassment in the entertainment industry. She sought to reassure survivors that progress is real. ""No single legal ruling can ever match the tremendous progress we have made together in the movement against sexual violence. The movement will persist driven by the truth of our testimonies.""","#MeToo founder Tarana Burke says the movement is greater than any court case.

'Divest': US students demand universities to cut Israel ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/divest-us-students-demand-universities-to-cut-israel-ties/articleshow/109637004.cms,"NEW YORK: The students at Columbia University who inspired pro-Palestinian demonstrations across the country dug in at their encampment for the 10th day Friday as administrators and police at campuses from California to Massachusetts wrestled with how to address protests that have seen scuffles with police and hundreds of arrests . Officials at Columbia and some other schools have been negotiating with students who have rebuffed police and doubled down.Other schools have quickly turned to law enforcement to douse demonstrations before they can take hold.As the death toll mounts in the war in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis worsens, protesters at universities across the country are demanding schools cut financial ties to Israel and divest from companies they say are enabling the conflict. ""Disclose! Divest!"" marchers have been shouting, calling on universities to cease investing in suppliers of Israeli weapons.Universities have so far rebuffed exhortations to divest.Defenders of Israel say these calls are unfair to a country that is under threat of attack, and anti-Semitic because they target the only Jewish-majority nation in the world. But pr-Palestinian university students say they won't stop protesting against Israel until that demand is met. ""We're willing to risk suspension, expulsion and arrest, and I think that that will put pressure,"" said Malak Afaneh, a law student at University of California, Berkeley, and a protest organiser.After a tent encampment popped up Thursday at Indiana University, police with shields and batons shoved into protesters and arrested 33. Hours later at the University of Connecticut, police tore down tents and arrested one person. And at Ohio State University, police clashed with protesters just hours after they gathered Thursday. Those who refused to leave were arrested and charged with criminal trespass.The clock is ticking as May commencement ceremonies near, putting added pressure on schools to clear demonstrations. At Columbia University, protesters defiantly erected a tent encampment where many are set to graduate in front of families in just a few weeks. Columbia officials said that negotiations were showing progress as the school's self-imposed early Friday deadline to reach an agreement on dismantling the encampment came and went. Nevertheless, two police buses were parked nearby. ""We have our demands; they have theirs,"" said a spokesperson for Columbia, adding that if the talks fail the university will have to consider other options.California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, has been negotiating with students who have been barricaded inside a campus building since Monday, rebuffing an attempt by the police to clear them out. The school's senate of faculty and staff demanded the university's prez resign in a nonbinding vote of no confidence Thursday, citing the decision to call police in to remove the barricaded students Monday.On the other end of the state, the University of Southern California cancelled the school's May 10 graduation ceremony. The announcement was made a day after over 90 student protesters were arrested.At the City College of New York Thursday, hundreds of students who were gathered on the lawn beneath the Harlem campus' famed gothic buildings erupted in cheers after a small contingent of police officers retreated from the scene.Protesters also stayed overnight at the encampment at George Washington University.

Biden administration indefinitely postpones rule that would have banned menthol-flavoured cigarettes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-administration-indefinitely-postpones-rule-that-would-have-banned-menthol-flavoured-cigarettes/articleshow/109633510.cms,"For the second time in recent months, President Joe Biden's administration has delayed a sweeping plan to ban menthol cigarettes, a decision that is certain to infuriate anti-smoking advocates but could avoid angering Black voters ahead of November elections. In a statement on Friday, Biden's top health official gave no timeline for issuing the rule, saying only that the administration would take more time to consider feedback, including from civil rights groups.""It's clear that there are still more conversations to have, and that will take significantly more time,"" said Health and Human Service Secretary Xavier Becerra, in a statement.The White House has held dozens of meetings in recent months with groups opposing the ban, including civil rights organisers, law enforcement officials and small business owners.The announcement is another setback for the health officials at the Food and Drug Administration, who drafted the ban and predicted it would prevent hundreds of thousands of smoking-related deaths over 40 years. The agency has worked toward banning menthol across multiple administrations for more than a decade without ever finalizing a rule.Previous FDA efforts on menthol have been derailed by tobacco industry pushback or competing political priorities. With both Biden and former President Donald Trump vying for the support of Black voters, the potential impact of the decision has been scrutinized by Republicans and Democrats heading into November's election.Anti-smoking advocates have been pushing the FDA to eliminate the flavour since the agency gained authority to regulate certain tobacco ingredients in 2009. Menthol is the only cigarette flavour that wasn't banned under that law, a carveout negotiated by industry allies in Congress. But the law instructed the FDA to study the issue.More than 11 per cent of US adults smoke, with rates roughly even between white and Black people. But about 80 per cent of Black smokers smoke menthol, which the FDA says masks the harshness of smoking, making it easier to start and harder to quit. Most teenagers who smoke cigarettes also smoke menthols.","Biden's top health official gave no timeline for issuing the rule, saying only that the administration would take more time to consider feedback.

How Iran avoided escalation with Israel through quick military maneuvering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-iran-avoided-escalation-with-israel-through-quick-military-maneuvering/articleshow/109586561.cms,"By swiftly replacing the radar, Iran aimed to maintain its defensive posture and readiness, at least in appearance, to deter further Israeli strikes.

The replacement allowed Iranian propagandists to claim operational readiness and resilience, thereby managing domestic and international perceptions.

Most critically, by not responding further and instead quickly repairing the site, Iran avoided a potential escalation that could have drawn in more regional players and possibly led to a full-scale war.

Khamenei tacitly acknowledges that Tehran hit little in its attack on Israel

In a recent flare-up between Iran and Israel, where both nations exchanged missile and drone strikes, tensions soared, hinting at the potential for a broader conflict. However, the situation de-escalated as quickly as it escalated, with Iran making a strategic move to replace a destroyed air defense radar, thus avoiding further provocation and managing to save face on the international stage, a report in the Economist said.On April 13, for the first time in its history, Iran directly launched a barrage of drones and missiles toward an Israeli air base, which was met with a precise Israeli counterstrike.In response, the Israeli missiles on April 19 targeted and destroyed a critical piece of Iranian air defense, the 30n6e2 ""Tombstone"" radar , located near the heavily fortified Natanz nuclear complex. This radar is essential for tracking incoming air threats and guiding interceptor missiles.Following the Israeli retaliation, new satellite imagery analyzed by Chris Biggers, a former imagery analyst at America’s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, revealed that Iran had swiftly replaced the destroyed ""Tombstone"" radar with a different model, the 96l6e ""Cheese board"" radar. This radar was placed in the exact location of the previous one, and the missile launchers appeared ready for action. Biggers noted that this switch was likely a tactic of ""denial and deception,"" aimed at portraying the site as still operational, despite the replacement radar's incompatibility with the existing defense system, the Economist report said.This quick substitution by Iran served multiple strategic purposes:Meanwhile, during a meeting with Iran's top military leaders, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran's supreme leader, downplayed the effectiveness of a significant drone-and-missile attack on Israel, subtly admitting that the assault didn't achieve its intended impact. Despite the substantial scale of the attack, Khamenei emphasized that the number of missiles that hit their targets was not a priority.Khamenei's remarks, which were broadcast on state television, came in the context of heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, particularly as conflicts continue in the Gaza Strip. He said, “Debates by the other party about how many missiles were fired, how many of them hit the target and how many didn’t, these are of secondary importance. The main issue is the emergence of the Iranian nation and Iranian military’s will in an important international arena.

Harvard protests mount as tensions spread over Israel-Hamas war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-protests-mount-as-tensions-spread-over-israel-hamas-war/articleshow/109578154.cms,"Students at Harvard University escalated their campus protests over the Israel-Hamas conflict , mirroring actions that have erupted at Columbia, Yale and NYU.Hundreds of Harvard affiliates gathered on Wednesday to demonstrate against the suspension of the Palestine Solidarity Committee, with some flooding into Harvard Yard from their dorms while cheering and putting up tents.The protests, spanning colleges from the University of Michigan to University of California at Berkeley, have centered on calls for the schools to sever financial ties with companies linked to Israel and for the US to end military aid, as well as demands that administrations stop pursuing disciplinary action against students.University officials have been trying to walk the tightrope between upholding free speech and maintaining order, with some resorting to arrests and the dismantling of protest encampments.On Wednesday, hundreds of University of Texas at Austin students walked out in protest but were met by dozens of state troopers in riot gear who demanded they disperse, according to the Dallas Morning News. The troopers were seen arresting some students. Princeton sent a note warning students that anyone involved in an encampment or occupation who refuses to stop will be “arrested and immediately barred from campus.”Columbia University has become a flashpoint in the disruptions facing higher education given the polarization on campuses over the Israel-Hamas war.The demonstrations follow President Minouche Shafik’s congressional testimony last week in which she defended actions she said the school was taking to protect Jewish students. US Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, criticized Shafik’s leadership of the university and called for her resignation. Meanwwhile, faculty and students were outraged after she sent in the police and more than 100 arrests were made.Lawmakers from both parties continue to focus on the strife. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson visited Columbia on Wednesday to meet with Jewish students and deliver remarks on what his office called the “troubling rise of virulent antisemitism on America’s college campuses.” Johnson, speaking while overlooking the Columbia encampment, said if threats continue it may be appropriate for President Joe Biden to call in the National Guard.“We can’t allow this kind of hatred and antisemitism to flourish and we must stop it in its tracks,” Johnson said, as some students booed and chanted pro-Palestinian slogans.In an April 23 statement, Shafik said she supports free speech and recognized that many students were protesting peacefully but warned she would have to consider “alternative options” for clearing the encampment if talks weren’t successful.With the end of the semester nearing and protests continuing, Columbia gave faculty the option to move classes to a hybrid format, allowing students to finish their courses remotely and avoid having to walk through parts of the campus where tensions are running high.Other schools have faced similar disruptions.At Yale, police arrested 60 people including 47 students Monday. President Peter Salovey cited “police reports identifying harmful acts and threatening language used against individuals at or near the protest sites.”Elsewhere in New York City, a group of about 350 New York University students and others gathered in Washington Square Park to protest Israel’s conduct of the war and the school’s handling of the protests. Police arrested more than 100 people this week camped out at a plaza near the university’s business school.A few blocks north, a group of about 50 people protested at the New School’s Greenwich Village campus, calling on the institution to divest its interests with ties to Israel.The protests, occurring around the Jewish holiday of Passover, have also drawn condemnation from the White House and university donors. They have also raised concerns about the use of hard-line tactics by schools against students, and threats against Jewish students by protesters.At some protests at schools, the debate has frequently devolved into harassment and threats, with some demonstrators at Columbia chanting “go back to Poland!” at Jewish students.At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Israel Alliance student group cited “significant fear among the Jewish community” given the events on other campuses, and moved the location of its traditional Passover Seder.Broadly, campus protesters say their goal is to draw attention to humanitarian concerns in Gaza after Hamas militants stormed into Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking scores of hostages, a move that sparked a counterattack by Israeli forces.About 34,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed as part of that response, according to the health ministry run by Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the US government.",Hundreds of Harvard affiliates gathered on Wednesday to demonstrate against the suspension of the Palestine Solidarity Committee.

""We have a draft law, which we are ready to consider immediately, on retaliatory measures.""""And the Europeans will lose more than we do,"" Matviyenko, who is a member of Russia's powerful Security Council, said.Matviyenko did not give specifics on what the response would be to the seizing of Russian assets which is still under discussion in the West.One option being discussed by the West is to confiscate the income on the underlying assets without taking the actual asset itself.Putin says the West unleashed what he casts as an economic war against Russia but has touted both the resilience of the Russian economy, which grew 3.6% last year, and the failure of sanctions of stop Russian trade.The Kremlin has repeatedly said that any seizure of its assets would go against all the principles of free markets which the West proclaims and that it would undermine confidence in the US dollar and euro while deterring global investment and undermining confidence in Western central banks.Russia has said it will challenge any confiscation of its assets in the courts.Some Russian officials have suggested that if Russian assets are confiscated then foreign investors' assets stuck in special so-called type ""C"" accounts in Russia could face the same fate.It is not clear exactly how much money is in these accounts.The speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said on Monday that Russia had grounds to seize Western assets after the move by the US House of Representatives.Volodin said that of the $280 billion of Russian assets frozen abroad, only $5 to $6 billion was in the United States while about 210 billion euros ($224 billion) was in the European Union.",Russia has drafted legislation to retaliate if nearly $300 billion of Russian assets were seized by the West and used to help Ukraine.

UK passes Rishi Sunak's ambitious Rwanda migrant bill after facing two years of challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-passes-rishi-sunaks-ambitious-rwanda-migrant-bill-after-facing-two-years-of-challenges/articleshow/109516070.cms,"NEW DELHI: The UK Parliament has recently approved a controversial bill that allows the government to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda for their asylum claims to be assessed in the East African nation, as per a report by CNN.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faced opposition in Parliament and legal challenges in British courts while trying to push through this bill, with lawmakers and activists raising concerns about human rights implications.The government's attempts to implement this policy have led to significant embarrassment, as millions of pounds have been sent to Rwanda for a program that has not yielded any results so far, as reported by CNN.The aim of the bill is to deter irregular migration into the UK, particularly targeting individuals who travel in unsafe small boats from France, often facilitated by criminal organizations. Under the legislation, individuals who reach the UK may be sent to Rwanda for their asylum claims to be processed. If their claim is accepted, they will remain in Rwanda. However, if their claim is rejected, the bill states that they cannot be deported from Rwanda to any country other than the UK, although the exact outcome in such scenarios remains unclear.The concept of this scheme was introduced in 2022 when Prime Minister Sunak made it a priority to halt these arrivals, aligning with a Conservative promise to ""stop the boats."" However, two years later, the absence of any deportations has been viewed as a significant setback for Sunak, according to CNN. Last year, the UK Supreme Court deemed the policy unlawful due to the risk that asylum seekers could face ill-treatment if returned to Rwanda, violating international human rights standards. The court highlighted previous concerns regarding human rights abuses in Rwanda, such as extrajudicial killings and torture.In response to these challenges, the UK government introduced the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill earlier this year, asserting that Rwanda is a safe country and overriding the judiciary's concerns. Home Secretary James Cleverly confirmed that the bill has been passed in Parliament and will soon become law, aiming to prevent misuse of human rights claims to obstruct deportations and reaffirming UK sovereignty over European court rulings, as per CNN.Despite the bill's approval, potential legal hurdles may arise in the European Court of Human Rights, given the UK's commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights. The European court has previously prohibited the UK from transferring asylum seekers to Rwanda. The bill has faced delays due to ongoing amendments in a process known as ""ping pong"" between the House of Commons and the House of Lords.In 2022, the migration observatory at the University of Oxford reported 45,744 arrivals via small boats, contributing to a total net migration of 745,000 for the year. These figures pose a challenge for Prime Minister Sunak and the Conservative Party , especially with an upcoming general election. Opposition parties, such as Labour, have expressed intentions to scrap the Rwanda relocation plans if they come into power. The general election is expected to take place later this year, setting the stage for a contentious debate on immigration policies, according to Al Jazeera.(With inputs from agencies)","UK Parliament has approved a bill that allows the government to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda for their asylum claims to be assessed.

College administrators and police at campuses ranging from California to Connecticut are grappling with how to handle the demonstrations , which have resulted in clashes with police and numerous arrests.Officials at Columbia and some other schools have been in discussions with student protesters who have resisted police and remained firm. Other schools have promptly resorted to law enforcement to extinguish demonstrations before they gain momentum. Following the emergence of a tent encampment on Thursday at Indiana University Bloomington, police officers with shields and batons forcefully pushed against protesters and apprehended 33 individuals. Later on at the University of Connecticut, police dismantled tents and detained one individual.The clock is ticking as May graduation ceremonies approach, increasing the pressure on schools to resolve protests. At Columbia, protesters boldly set up a tent camp where many students are scheduled to graduate in front of their families in a few weeks.Columbia officials mentioned that discussions were making progress as they approached the school's deadline of early Friday to come to an agreement on dismantling the encampment. However, two police buses were parked close by, and there was a visible presence of private security and police at the entrances to the campus .“We have our demands; they have theirs,” said Ben Chang, a spokesperson for Columbia University, adding that if the talks fail the university will have to consider other options.According to AP, a group of around thirty-six pro-Palestinian protesters distributed signs and began chanting outside the closed gates of Columbia University. Subsequently, they walked away while approximately forty police officers gathered close by.California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, has been in discussions with students who have barricaded themselves inside a campus building since Monday, rejecting an effort by the police to remove them. On Thursday, faculty members held discussions with protesters in an attempt to find a resolution as the campus will remain closed at least until the weekend.The protesters are establishing encampments at universities nationwide. They are demanding that schools sever financial connections with Israel and disinvest from companies they believe are fueling the conflict. Certain Jewish students claim that the protests have shifted towards antisemitism, causing fear for them to enter campus. This fear has contributed to the requests for police involvement.During the meeting with protesters, Jeff Crane, a dean at Cal Poly Humboldt, proposed that the university establish a committee involving students to thoroughly examine the school's investments. Crane also recommended that faculty and students should meet every 24 hours to maintain an open line of communication. Both parties have not yet announced an agreement.The senate of faculty and staff at the school demanded that the president of the university resign following a vote of no confidence on Thursday. They cited the decision to involve the police in removing the students who had barricaded themselves on Monday.The University of Southern California on the opposite side of the state declared the cancellation of the school's May 10 graduation ceremony. The announcement occurred one day following the arrest of over 90 protesters on campus. The university confirmed that it would continue to organize numerous commencement events, encompassing all the customary individual school commencement ceremonies.Tensions were already elevated following the cancellation of a scheduled graduation address by the university's valedictorian who supports Palestine, due to safety reasons.On Thursday, at the City College of New York, hundreds of students gathered on the lawn under the famous gothic buildings of the Harlem campus and cheered as a small group of police officers withdrew from the area. In one corner of the quad, a “security training” was held among students.The Los Angeles Police Department stated that 93 individuals were taken into custody on Wednesday night for reportedly trespassing during a campus protest. A single individual was apprehended for allegedly committing assault with a deadly weapon.108 people were arrested at an alleyway encampment at Emerson College in Boston by early Thursday. A video shows the police first warning students in an alleyway to leave. The students link arms to resist officers, who move forcefully through the crowd and throw some protesters to the ground.“As the night progressed, it got tenser and tenser. There were just more cops on all sides. It felt like we were being slowly pushed in and crushed,” said Ocean Muir, a sophomore.Muir said police lifted her by her arms and legs and carried her away. Together with other students, Muir received charges on Thursday for trespassing and disorderly conduct.Emerson College leaders had cautioned the students that the alley was a public right-of-way, and city authorities had issued a warning to take action if the protesters refused to leave. Emerson decided to cancel classes on Thursday, and Boston police reported that four officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the confrontation.The campus of the University of Texas at Austin was quieter on Thursday following the arrest and charging of 57 individuals for criminal trespass the day before. Officials from the university removed barricades and permitted protesters to enter the central square below the iconic clock tower of the school.On Thursday, students and some faculty protested against the war and the arrests that occurred on Wednesday. State troopers in riot gear and on horseback forcefully removed protesters, leading to hundreds of students being pushed off the school's main lawn.Local and state police arrived at Emory University in Atlanta to break down a camp. Several officers were armed with semiautomatic weapons, and footage captured officers using a stun gun on a protester who was restrained on the ground. The university said late Thursday in a statement that objects were thrown at officers and they deployed “chemical irritants” as a crowd control measure.Jail records indicated that 22 individuals who were arrested by Emory police faced charges of disorderly conduct. Emory stated that they were informed about the arrest of 28 individuals, which included 20 members of the university community, and some had been released by nighttime.The US Education Department has initiated civil rights inquiries into numerous universities and schools due to reports of antisemitism or Islamophobia following the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Many colleges, such as Harvard and Columbia, that are experiencing protests are being investigated.","Protesters at a camp at Columbia University, who sparked a series of pro- Palestinian protests nationwide, remained steadfast on their 10th day on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Pro-Palestine, anti-war protests have gained momentum across universities in the US leading to the arrest of hundreds of students at Columbia University among others.The University of Southern California on Thursday cancelled its graduation ceremony, and dozens more college students were detained on other campuses throughout the country.An Indian-origin student at Princeton University was also arrested and barred from the campus for staging pro-Palestine protests .The protesting students are asking that institutions cut their financial ties with Israel and divest from firms that they believe are aiding the Gaza conflict.Last week, pro-Palestinian student demonstrators set up a tent encampment at New York's Ivy League universities. Police attempted to evict the encampment on April 18, arresting over 100 demonstrators. However, the approach backfired, energizing students around the country and prompting demonstrators at Columbia to regroup.On Wednesday, university administrators announced that they were extending the time for demonstrators to clear out. They said the demonstrators had agreed to remove a large number of tents and that only students would remain at the encampment. They also decided to prohibit all racist language and harassing messages.An Indian-origin student at Princeton University was arrested and barred from the campus for staging pro-Palestine protests. Coimbatore-born Achinthya Sivalingan is facing disciplinary action, a university spokesperson said.Protesters put up tents for a student-led pro-Palestine encampment in McCosh Courtyard around 7am on Thursday. Following warnings from University officials, two Princeton students were arrested, while the remaining protestors packed up their camping gear and resumed the action as a sit-in, according to the Princeton Alumni Weekly.US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said on Friday that viewpoints should be expressed in a 'peaceful' manner, emphasizing that 'nobody should feel threatened'.""It's the moment, you know, having a lot of discord in the world. And we in America believe opinions should be expressed, but nobody should feel threatened. If anything goes over the line where somebody feels individually threatened.

In less than 48 hours, the Pakistani military had carried out retaliatory strikes in Iran on what it said were “hideouts used by terrorist organisations”.Raisi, the first Iranian president to visit Pakistan in eight years, met the country’s top leadership, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, President Asif Zardari and Army Chief General Asim Munir, during his trip. He also extended invitations to President Zardari and PM Sharif to make official visits to Iran.“They (Pakistan and Iran) reiterated the importance of cooperation in the energy domain, including trade in electricity, power transmission lines and Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project,” a joint Iranian-Pakistani statement said, recalling their aim to increase the volume of bilateral trade to $10 billion over the next five years from the current $2 billion.“There was consensus to fully operationalise barter trade mechanisms between the two sides to facilitate economic and commercial activity,” the handout read.The gas pipeline project has languished for more than a decade because of political turmoil and international sanctions.On Tuesday, the US state department had warned Islamabad of the risk of sanctions after it promised greater security and economic cooperation with Iran during President Raisi’s visit.“We advise anyone considering business deals with Iran to be aware of the potential risk of sanctions.

The visit is closely watched amid ongoing tensions with Israel, and US sanctions.“We are committed to strengthening relations at high levels. We have decided to increase economic, commercial, and cultural relations between Pakistan and Iran,” Raisi said.Sharif echoed the sentiment. “We have to keep this relationship strong despite the challenges we face,” he said, commending Iran for its firm stand on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and urging for an immediate cessation of hostilities.Pakistan and Iran share a 900km border, which is susceptible to unlawful crossings, smuggling, and militant infiltration. Both nations accuse each other of failing to prevent terrorist organisations from seeking refuge on their territory and conducting cross-border assaults.Last Jan, Iran launched missile strikes against anti-Iranian militant hideouts in Pakistan’s southwestern Baluchistan province, prompting Islamabad to retaliate with strikes on bases of anti-Pakistan militants operating from Iranian soil. The exchange of strikes raised concerns about larger conflicts and regional instability.The Iranian President is accompanied by his spouse, the foreign minister, cabinet members, and business representatives.Analysts said Raisi’s visit will also address financial and legal issues related to the construction of a gas pipeline between the two countries. Despite signing an agreement in June 2009 for the pipeline to export Iranian natural gas to Pakistan, construction on the Pakistani side has not started, possibly due to US pressure as Iran’s energy sector faces sanctions for its nuclear programme.

Iran president visits Sri Lanka without wanted minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/iran-president-visits-sri-lanka-without-wanted-minister/articleshow/109569123.cms,"COLOMBO : Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi inaugurated a power and irrigation project in Sri Lanka on Wednesday, but arrived in the country without his interior minister, who is wanted over a deadly 1994 bombing.Raisi flew in after a state visit to Pakistan he made alongside Ahmad Vahidi, accused by Argentina of orchestrating the 1994 attack on a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people.Interpol issued a red notice requesting police agencies worldwide to take Vahidi into custody, and Argentina had asked both Pakistan and Sri Lanka to arrest him.But the minister was not seen accompanying Raisi, who had arrived in Sri Lanka to inaugurate an Iran-backed power and irrigation project.Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Vahidi was back in Iran on Tuesday, where he attended a ceremony to induct a new provincial governor.An official from Sri Lanka's foreign ministry told AFP that the interior minister was not listed as part of the Iranian delegation.The 1994 assault has never been claimed or solved, but Argentina and Israel have long suspected the Iran-backed group Hezbollah carried it out at Iran's request.Prosecutors have charged top Iranian officials with ordering the attack, though Tehran has denied any involvement.The court also implicated Hezbollah and called the attack against the AMIA -- the deadliest in Argentina's history -- a ""crime against humanity.""- Dam project -Raisi's Airbus A340 aircraft first landed at an airport in southern Sri Lanka nearby the $514 million Uma Oya irrigation and hydro-electricity project.It was due to be commissioned in March 2014 but international sanctions against Iran saw the project mired in a decade of delays, Sri Lanka has said.Raisi told a public rally at the Uma Oya site that Western countries tried to convince others that they were the sole source of knowledge and technology, but ""skilful Iranian experts"" had developed their own capacities.""Our enemies did not favour development and progress for Iran, but the Iranian people were determined in order to realise it,"" he said.Sri Lanka funded most of the dam project after an initial investment of $50 million from the Export Development Bank of Iran in 2010, while construction was carried out by Iranian firm Farab.Raisi then flew to the capital Colombo and was accorded a 21-gun salute before talks with Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, whose office said the visit symbolised ""the cooperation between the two nations in this significant infrastructure endeavour"".The Uma Oya's two reservoirs are slated to irrigate 4,500 hectares (11,100 acres) of new land, while the hydro dam generators have a capacity of 120 megawatts.Iran is a key buyer of Sri Lanka's tea, the island's main export commodity.Sri Lanka is currently repaying a legacy debt of $215 million for Iranian oil by exporting tea. The country's only oil refinery was built by Iran in 1969.Raisi arrived in Sri Lanka after a three-day visit to Pakistan that followed tit-for-tat missile strikes in January in the region of Balochistan, which straddles the two nations' porous border.Tehran carried out the first strikes against an anti-Iran group inside Pakistan, with Islamabad retaliating by hitting ""militant targets"" inside Iran.Both nations have previously accused each other of harbouring militants on their respective sides of the border.","Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi arrives in Sri Lanka to inaugurate a power and irrigation project.

Despite the conflict's international ramifications, it has not garnered widespread attention.In recent months, resistance fighters in Myanmar's remote areas have been consistently defeating the ruling military junta , surprising analysts and raising the possibility of the junta's collapse.The war has become a human rights disaster , with Myanmar's economy in shambles since the 2021 military coup, plunging millions into extreme poverty. The country's reputation as a center for drugs, online scams, and money laundering is growing, and its instability has created strategic challenges for China, India, the United States, and other nations.The civil war has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 3 million others. The country is riddled with land mines, and extreme inflation has contributed to a significant reduction in the middle class, according to the United Nations . The health sector is in crisis, with childhood vaccinations essentially halted and a substantial increase in malaria cases. Experts are concerned about the spread of HIV and tuberculosis.The conflict has regional and international implications. According to the United Nations, Russia and other countries have sold the Myanmar army at least $1 billion in weapons since the 2021 coup. China sees threats to its infrastructure projects across the country, while India, which has long feared chaos in its borderlands, is deporting Myanmar refugees.Thailand is similarly concerned about the estimated 40,000 or more refugees that the United Nations predicts will cross the border this year. Bangladesh sees obstacles to its efforts to repatriate the Rohingya , and the United States has begun providing nonlethal aid to armed resistance groups.","The civil war has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 3 million others.

Police conducted raids in Central Sulawesi province between Tuesday and Thursday, said Agus Nugroho, the provincial police chief, adding that five suspects were arrested in the city of Palu , two in Sigi, and one in Poso which is a known extremist hotbed.Two laptops, several cellular phones and documents, including jihadist books were seized and suspects were being interrogated, Nugroho said.National Police spokesperson Trunoyudo Wisnu Andiko said the arrests were the result of information obtained from 59 suspected militants detained in October 2023.""(The eight) all actively participate in organisation activities, particularly in military-style training and collecting funds for alleged plans of terror acts,"" Andiko told reporters at the National Police headquarters in the capital, Jakarta. He added that convicted leaders of the group and veteran fighters in Afghanistan were recruiting and training new members.Jemaah Islamiyah is responsible for several attacks inside Indonesia, namely, the 2002 bombings on the resort island of Bali that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. A court banned the group in 2008 and constant counterterrorism crackdowns, supported by the United States and Australia, have weakened it further.Last year, police arrested a total of 142 suspected militants, including four women, and fatally shot two others on southern Sumatra island.Militant attacks on foreigners in Indonesia have been largely replaced in recent years by smaller, less deadly strikes targeting the government, mainly police and anti-terrorism forces, and people militants consider to be infidels, inspired by Islamic State group tactics abroad.","Police conducted raids in Central Sulawesi province between Tuesday and Thursday.
