Russia's secret weapon Tobol linked to jamming of planes' signals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russias-secret-weapon-tobol-linked-to-jamming-of-planes-signals/articleshow/109531879.cms,"NEW DELHI: The electronic attacks that commercial flights are experiencing while over the Baltic Sea may be the result of a secret weapon Tobol that Russia utilized to jam the signals, according to The Sun It reported that the weapon was formerly employed to jam ship signals on Nato's eastern flank.Reportedly installed at Kaliningrad, between Lithuania and Poland, Russia has around 10 such devices across its territory.According to experts, the devices may be used to shelter military installations from Nato's stockpile of satellite-guided missiles by creating an imperceptible shield above them.In the first few months of 2024, a disruption cycle associated with the electronic warfare system was observed extending through Poland and the Baltic nations, said Estonia’s military chief, as per The Sun.“What we have seen is a malfunctioning of GPS for ships and air traffic. And we really do not know if they [Russia] want to achieve something or just practise and test their equipment"", General Martin Harem said.“But definitely, nobody should behave like this, especially when you’re at war with a neighbouring country,” he added.According to Newsweek, a number of nations have reported GPS disruptions in recent months, including Finland, Poland, and Sweden. Lieutenant Colonel Joakim Paasikivi of Sweden discussed the matter with Swedish media, stating that ""Russian influence activities or so-called hybrid warfare"" are the cause of the meddling.","Tobol may be used to shelter military installations from Nato's stockpile of satellite-guided missiles by creating an imperceptible shield above them.

"'Policy trilemma': US think-tank's dire warning for Putin, Russia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/policy-trilemma-us-think-tanks-dire-warning-for-putin-russia/articleshow/109532244.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Russia's economy may only maintain its current strength for another 18 months before beginning to falter, according to insights from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The Washington DC-based think tank highlighted Russia's robust economic performance despite increased military expenditures and extensive Western trade sanctions related to its ongoing conflict in Ukraine.Despite these challenges, the International Monetary Fund has projected that Russia's economy will grow faster than all other developed economies this year, including the United States.This growth has been partly attributed to Russia's ability to circumvent sanctions by selling oil to allies and importing Western goods through third-party nations.""A paradoxical situation has emerged: Russia's economy is now stable both in spite of and as a result of Western sanctions ,"" said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. She further explained in her report that while Russia's economic stability appears solid, it is not sustainable indefinitely. ""But this hard-won stability is not eternal. In a best-case scenario, the current arrangement will likely begin to come apart within eighteen months owing to growing imbalances and possible social problems,"" Prokopenko cautioned.Russia is currently grappling with a policy ""trilemma,"" facing the challenge of funding its military operations, maintaining living standards for its citizens, and keeping the economy stable—goals that are becoming increasingly difficult to achieve simultaneously. The Kremlin's record spending on military efforts this year could exacerbate these challenges, as defense expenditure is generally seen as economically unproductive.Furthermore, living conditions in Russia are at risk of deteriorating. Inflation has spiked, forcing the central bank to hike interest rates to 16%. This measure, although aimed at controlling inflation, may reduce workers' real incomes and lead to broader economic contraction. The resulting financial strain could increase Russians' debt distress and heighten the risk of social discontent.Economists have also raised concerns about the long-term impacts of a shrinking workforce, declining productivity, and Russia's growing isolation from the global economy. ""In an economy subordinate to political imperatives, there are few incentives for sustainable development. Sooner or later, this will hurt the well-being of ordinary Russians,"" Prokopenko concluded, suggesting that temporary economic fixes might lead to significant political and economic challenges for the Kremlin.","Russia's economy may only maintain its current strength for another 18 months before beginning to falter.

Bavar-373: Iran unveils new weapon system to take on US stealth jets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/bavar-373-iran-unveils-new-weapon-system-to-take-on-us-stealth-jets/articleshow/109531632.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Amid ongoing conflict in the Middle East, Iran has introduced an advanced version of its Bavar-373 air defense system , which officials claim can intercept American stealth jet fighters. This new iteration was unveiled during a military parade on April 17, highlighting Iran's continuing enhancements to its defense capabilities.The Bavar-373 system, which initially entered service in 2019, has often been compared to Russia's S-300 and the US-made Patriot missile systems due to its capabilities.The latest version of the Bavar-373, however, is said to rival even Russia's more advanced S-400 system, according to Iranian officials. The claims about this upgraded system include its ability to engage and destroy fifth-generation fighter jets, such as the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning, which are designed to evade radar detection, a Newsweek report said.Special Operations Forces Report (SOFREP), a military news outlet, described the new Bavar-373 as a ""significant development for Iran's defense industry"" and noted it showcases Iran's ""growing self-sufficiency and aspirations for a more advanced air defense network."" The system reportedly has the capability to detect up to 100 aerial targets simultaneously and engage them with its Sayyad-4B missile armament.During the parade, the Bavar-373 was noted for its ""impressive"" range of over 186 miles and an altitude reach of up to 75 miles. However, SOFREP has emphasized that these capabilities have not yet been independently verified and that ""real-world testing"" is necessary to fully assess the effectiveness of the updated system.The unveiling of this advanced air defense system comes just days after Iran responded to an alleged Israeli strike on an Iranian embassy in Syria by launching drones and missiles toward Israel, which were largely intercepted.Iran's defense sector has reportedly matured significantly, driven by international sanctions that have forced the country to invest more in domestic weapons development. Additionally, strategic collaborations with countries like Russia and China have facilitated technology transfers that bolster Tehran's capabilities in missile technology and air defense systems.The presentation of the upgraded Bavar-373 not only underscores the advancements in Iran's military technology but also serves as a potent message of deterrence aimed at potential adversaries, amidst the complex geopolitical landscape of the Middle East.","Iran has introduced an advanced version of its Bavar-373 air defense system.

South Korean sentenced to 14 months in jail for killing 76 cats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/south-korean-sentenced-to-14-months-in-jail-for-killing-76-cats/articleshow/109530746.cms,"SEOUL: A South Korean man has been sentenced to 14 months in prison for killing 76 cats in one of the country's most gruesome cases of animal cruelty in recent years. The man, who is in his 20s, was convicted of violating South Korea's animal protection law last week, the Changwon District Court in southeastern South Korea said Tuesday. The court did not identify the man.The man went on a cat-killing spree between December 2022 and September 2023 due to a deep hatred of the animal that he began harbouring after other cats scratched his car, according to a court verdict seen by The Associated Press.He had caught stray cats and adopted others from online sites before strangling some to death and killing others with scissors, the court order said. He killed one cat by running it over with a car, the court said.The court ruled that the prison sentence was unavoidable because he repeatedly committed ""indescribably cruel"" crimes in a premeditated manner.It stressed that the sentence still reflected the fact that the man had no criminal records and repented his crimes, adding that the man's unspecified mental health status was found to be a motive for his crimes.The man appealed the ruling.""The sentence reflects Korean society's increasing concern for animal welfare and intolerance for senseless cruelty such as this,"" said Borami Seo, a director of the South Korea office of the Humane Society International.""This cruelty case also emphasizes the importance of passing the Civil Act amendment that will legally recognise animals as living beings and further strengthen their protection in law,"" Seo added.","A South Korean man has been sentenced to 14 months in prison for killing 76 cats.

Judge to consider gag order violations in Trump hush money trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-to-consider-gag-order-violations-in-trump-hush-money-trial/articleshow/109530418.cms,"NEW YORK: The judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will decide on Tuesday whether the former US president should be punished for violating a gag order that prevents him from criticizing witnesses and others involved in the case.Prosecutors are asking Justice Juan Merchan to fine Trump for criticizing porn star Stormy Daniels and his former lawyer Michael Cohen, both of whom are expected to testify.They also have highlighted Trump's claim last week that people were lying to get on the jury so they could convict him.Merchan could opt to fine Trump $1,000 for each of those violations, as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg 's office has requested.Prosecutors have asked Merchan to remind Trump at the 9:30 a.m. hearing (1330 GMT) he may face more severe consequences if he keeps violating the order. The law permits the judge to send Trump to jail for up to 30 days, in what would be a dramatic twist to the first criminal trial of a former US president.Trump says the partial gag order, which prevents him from publicly criticizing witnesses, court officials and their relatives, is a violation of free speech.Trump is charged with falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment before the 2016 election to buy Daniels' silence about a sexual encounter she says they had in 2006. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies an encounter took place.Prosecutors say it was part of a wider conspiracy to hide unflattering information from voters at a time when he was facing multiple accusations of sexual misbehavior.""It was election fraud , pure and simple,"" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said on Monday.In his opening statement on Monday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche said Trump did not commit any crimes. ""There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy,"" Blanche told jurors on Monday.He said Trump acted to protect his family and his reputation and accused Daniels of trying to profit from a false accusation that they had sex.On Tuesday, jurors are expected to hear more testimony starting at 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker , who prosecutors say participated in a ""catch and kill"" scheme to suppress unflattering stories about Trump and help him get elected.Pecker, 72, testified on Monday that his company paid for stories - an unusual practice in journalism.American Media, which published the National Enquirer, admitted in 2018 that it paid $150,000 to former Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal for her story about a months-long affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. American Media said it worked ""in concert"" with Trump's campaign, and it never published a story.The tabloid reached a similar deal to pay $30,000 to a doorman who was seeking to sell a story about Trump allegedly fathering a child out of wedlock, which turned out to be false, according to prosecutors.Trump has said the payments were personal and did not violate election law. He has also denied an affair with McDougal.The case may be the only one of the Republican Trump's four criminal prosecutions to go to trial before his Nov. 5 election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.A guilty verdict would not bar Trump from taking office but it could hurt his candidacy. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows that half of independent voters and one in four Republicans say they would not vote for Trump if he is convicted of a crime.","Donald Trump is charged with falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment before the 2016 election.

In recent elections, the pro-unification Nationalists won a narrow majority in the legislature, but their influence on foreign policy and other national issues remains limited.The Senate will vote Tuesday on $95 billion in war aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.The package covers a wide range of parts and services aimed at maintaining and and upgrading Taiwan's military hardware. Separately, Taiwan has signed billions in contracts with the US for latest-generation F-16V fighter jets, M1 Abrams main battle tanks and the HIMARS rocket system, which the us has also supplied to Ukraine.Taiwan has also been expanding its owndefense industry , building submarines and trainer jets. Next month it plans to commission its third and fourth domestically designed and built stealth corvettes to counter the Chinese navy. as part of a strategy of asymmetrical warfare in which a smaller force counters its larger opponent by using cutting edge or nonconventional tactics and weaponry.Lai, of the pro-independence ruling Democratic Progressive Party, won the January election handily and takes over next month from President Tsai Ing-wen, whom Beijing has sought to isolate for the past eight years.China is determined to annex the island, which it considers its own territory, by force if necessary and has been advertising that threat with daily incursions into waters and air space around Taiwan by navy ships and warplanes. It has also sought to pick away Taiwan's few remaining formal diplomatic partners.While Washington and Taipei have no formal diplomatic ties in deference to Beijing, McClain emphasized the need for the entire world to observe the strength of the relationship.“Peace is our goal. But to do that, we have to have relationships and we value your relationship. Not only militarily, but economically,” she said.Kildee said the timing of the visit was especially significant given the recent passage of the funding bill to “provide very important support to insure security in this region.”""It’s important for the people of Taiwan, it’s important for the people in the United States, it’s important for the entire world,” Kildee said.","$8 billion defense package approved by the US House of Representatives over the weekend will “strengthen the deterrence against authoritarianism in the West Pacific ally chain,” Taiwan ’s President-elect Lai Ching-te said Tuesday.

The visit is closely watched amid ongoing tensions with Israel, and US sanctions.“We are committed to strengthening relations at high levels. We have decided to increase economic, commercial, and cultural relations between Pakistan and Iran,” Raisi said.Sharif echoed the sentiment. “We have to keep this relationship strong despite the challenges we face,” he said, commending Iran for its firm stand on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and urging for an immediate cessation of hostilities.Pakistan and Iran share a 900km border, which is susceptible to unlawful crossings, smuggling, and militant infiltration. Both nations accuse each other of failing to prevent terrorist organisations from seeking refuge on their territory and conducting cross-border assaults.Last Jan, Iran launched missile strikes against anti-Iranian militant hideouts in Pakistan’s southwestern Baluchistan province, prompting Islamabad to retaliate with strikes on bases of anti-Pakistan militants operating from Iranian soil. The exchange of strikes raised concerns about larger conflicts and regional instability.The Iranian President is accompanied by his spouse, the foreign minister, cabinet members, and business representatives.Analysts said Raisi’s visit will also address financial and legal issues related to the construction of a gas pipeline between the two countries. Despite signing an agreement in June 2009 for the pipeline to export Iranian natural gas to Pakistan, construction on the Pakistani side has not started, possibly due to US pressure as Iran’s energy sector faces sanctions for its nuclear programme.

This has included private meetings and calls warning that Washington stands ready to implement sanctions against Chinese financial institutions that facilitate this trade.As per the WSJ report, the potential sanctions would target banks that handle significant transactions aiding Russia’s military-industrial base, potentially cutting them off from accessing the US dollar, a move described by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as exposing these banks to the ""risk of US sanctions.""These discussions and warnings come at a time when China and Russia have increased trade in the yuan instead of the dollar, a strategic shift that may protect them from potential escalation in U.S. sanctions. This financial maneuvering aims to fortify their economies against external pressures, especially from the West.The stakes are high, as the West, including figures like Blinken, has expressed concerns that Russia could potentially outlast Ukraine in a protracted conflict if it continues to receive such robust support from China. This situation has led to significant discussions among Western allies on how to effectively counteract this support.The implications of cutting major banks off from the global financial system are profound. Such actions are generally seen as a last resort due to their broad economic impacts, affecting not just the targeted institutions but also their customers and the broader financial stability of the country involved.China's response to the potential sanctions has been one of defiance, with its foreign ministry denouncing the US actions as ""economic coercion, unilateralism, and bullying.""","U.S. preparing sanctions that could sever some Chinese banks from the global financial system, aiming to halt Beijing's commercial backing of Russia's military enhancements.

Key takeaways from the opening statements in Donald Trump's hush money trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/key-takeaways-from-the-opening-statements-in-donald-trumps-hush-money-trial/articleshow/109515232.cms,"Election fraud vs 'Bookkeeping' case

Trump's defense comes into view

Prosecutors aim to put Trump at the center

Cohen's credibility in the spotlight

But up first: David Pecker

'The defendant' or 'President Trump'?

NEW YORK: Monday's opening statements in the first criminal trial of a former American president provided a clear roadmap of how prosecutors will try to make the case that Donald Trump broke the law, and how the defense plans to fight the charges on multiple fronts.Lawyers presented dueling narratives as jurors got their first glimpse into the prosecution accusing Trump of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to squelch negative stories about him during his 2016 presidential campaign .Still to come are weeks of what's likely to be dramatic and embarrassing testimony about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's personal life as he simultaneously campaigns to return to the White House in November.Here's a look at some key takeaways from opening statements:Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records. But prosecutors made clear they do not want jurors to view this as a routine paper case. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said the heart of the case is a scheme to ""corrupt"" the 2016 election by silencing people who were about to come forward with embarrassing stories Trump feared would hurt his campaign.""No politician wants bad press,"" Colangelo said. ""But the evidence at trial will show that this was not spin or communication strategy. This was a planned, coordinated, long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, to help Donald Trump get elected through illegal expenditures to silence people who had something bad to say about his behavior."" He added: ""It was election fraud, pure and simple.""The business records charges stem from things like invoices and checks that were deemed legal expenses in Trump Organization records when prosecutors say they were really reimbursements to former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels. Daniels was threatening to go public with claims she had an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump. He says it never happened.Prosecutors' characterizations appear designed to combat suggestions by some pundits that the case - perhaps the only one that will go to trial before the November election - isn't as serious as the other three prosecutions he's facing. Those cases accuse Trump of trying to overturn the 2020 election he lost to President Joe Biden and illegally retaining classified documents after he left the White House.Trump, meanwhile, sought to downplay the accusations while leaving the courtroom on Monday, calling it all a ""bookkeeping"" case and ""a very minor thing."" But he, too, has said it's all about an election - the one this November. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the case is part of a sweeping Democratic attempt to harm his chances at reclaiming the presidency.Trump's attorney used his opening statement to attack the case as baseless, saying the former president did nothing illegal.The attorney, Todd Blanche, challenged prosecutors' claim that Trump agreed to pay Daniels to aid his campaign, saying Trump was trying to ""protect his family, his reputation and his brand.""Blanche indicated the defense will argue that after all the very point of a presidential campaign is to try to influence an election.""It's called democracy,"" Blanche told jurors. ""They put something sinister on this idea, as if it was a crime. You'll learn it's not.""Blanche also portrayed the ledger entries at issue in the case as pro forma actions performed by a Trump Organization employee. Trump ""had nothing to do with"" the allegedly false business records, ""except that he signed the checks, in the White House, while he was running the country,"" Blanche said. And he argued that the records' references to legal expenses weren't false, since Cohen was Trump's personal lawyer at the time.The 34 counts in the indictment are related to the payment to Daniels. But prosecutors plan to introduce evidence about a payoff to another woman - former Playboy model Karen McDougal - who claimed a sexual encounter with Trump, as well as to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about Trump having a child out of wedlock. Trump says they were all lies.Prosecutors said they will show Trump was at the center of the scheme to silence the women, telling jurors they will hear Trump in his voice talking about the plan to pay McDougal. Cohen arranged for the publisher of the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid to pay McDougal $150,000 but not print the story in a practice known as ""catch-and-kill.""Colangelo told jurors that prosecutors will play for them a recording Cohen secretly made during a meeting with Trump weeks before the 2016 election. In the recording, which first became public in 2018, Trump is heard saying: ""What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?""Trump ""desperately did not want this information about Karen McDougal to become public because he was worried about its effect on the election,"" Colangelo said.The defense's opening statement previewed what will be a key strategy of the defense: trying to discredit Cohen, a Trump loyalist turned critic and expected star witness for the prosecution. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments in 2018 and and served prison time.Whether jurors believe Cohen, who says he arranged the payments to the women at Trump's direction, could make or break the case for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office.Trump's lawyer highlighted Cohen's criminal record, describing him as a serial liar who turned against Trump after he was not given a job in the administration and found himself in legal trouble. Blanche said Cohen's ""entire financial livelihood depends on President Trump's destruction,"" noting he hosts podcasts and has written books bashing his ex-boss.""He has a goal and an obsession with getting Trump,"" Blanche said. ""I submit to you that he cannot be trusted.""Anticipating the defense attacks on Cohen, the prosecution promised to be upfront about the ""mistakes"" the former Trump attorney has made. But Colangelo said ""you can credit Michael Cohen's testimony"" despite his past.""I suspect the defense will go to great lengths to get you to reject his testimony precisely because it is so damning,"" the prosecutor said.Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker is the first witness for prosecutors, who say that Trump's alleged scheme to conceal potentially damaging information from voters began with a 2015 Trump Tower meeting among the then-candidate, Pecker and Cohen. Pecker took the witness stand Monday before court broke for the day and his testimony is expected to continue Tuesday.At the meeting, Pecker - a longtime Trump friend - agreed to aid Trump's campaign by running favorable pieces about him, smearing his opponents, scouting unflattering stories about him and flagging them to Cohen for ""catch-and-kill"" deals. Those included the claims made by Daniels, McDougal and the former Trump Tower doorman, Dino Sajudin, prosecutors say. Trump says all were false.Pecker will likely be asked about all the alleged efforts made by the Enquirer's then-owner, American Media Inc, on Trump's behalf. Federal prosecutors agreed in 2018 not to prosecute American Media in exchange for its cooperation in a campaign finance investigation that led to Cohen's guilty plea, and the Federal Election Commission fined the company $187,500, calling the McDougal deal a ""prohibited corporate in-kind contribution.""Pecker's brief turn on the stand Monday was mainly just about his background and other basic facts, though he did say the Enquirer practiced ""checkbook journalism"" - paying for stories - and that he had the final say on any story about a famous person.The prosecutor referred to Trump during his opening statement as ""the defendant."" Trump's lawyer took a different tack, calling him ""President Trump.""""We will call him President Trump, out of respect for the office that he held,"" Blanche said. At the same time, Trump's lawyer sought to portray Trump as an everyman, describing him as a husband, father and fellow New Yorker.""He's, in some ways, larger than life. But he's also here in this courtroom, doing what any of us would do: defending himself,"" Blanche said.Trump sat quietly while listening to opening statements, occasionally passing notes to his lawyers and whispering in their ears. But outside of the courtroom, he continued his pattern of trying to capitalize politically on the case that will require him to spend his days in a courtroom rather than on the campaign trail.""This is what they're trying to take me off the trail for. Checks being paid to a lawyer,"" Trump said.","Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records.

Yale University officials could not be reached for comment.Protests at Yale, Columbia and other university campuses across the nation began in response to the latest escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which began on October 7 with a deadly cross-border raid by Hamas Islamist militants and Israel's fierce response in the Gaza enclave controlled by Hamas.Human rights advocates have pointed to a general rise in bias and hate against Jews, Arabs and Muslims since October 7. There was particular concern in recent days, with the Jewish holiday of Passover beginning on Monday.In a statement on Monday, Columbia President Nemat Minouche Shafik said the university was canceling in-person classes and again denounced antisemitic language and intimidating and harassing behavior that she said had occurred on campus recently.The decision to cancel classes on the New York campus followed the arrest of more than 100 protesters, some of whom set up dozens of tents in what the school said was an unauthorized demonstration that disrupted school activities.""These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas,"" said Shafik, who last week testified before a U.S. House of Representatives committee, defending the school's response to alleged antisemitism by protesters. ""We need a reset.""Similar pro-Palestinian encampments were also set up at Boston's Emerson College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in neighboring Cambridge.President Joe Biden said in a statement on Sunday that his administration has put the full force of the federal government behind protecting the Jewish community.""Even in recent days, we've seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous - and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country,"" he said.Elie Buechler, an Orthodox rabbi at Columbia University and its affiliate Barnard College, told students in an online message that campus and city police cannot guarantee the safety of Jewish students, according to local media.""It deeply pains me to say that I would strongly recommend you return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved,"" Buechler said in a WhatsApp message sent to hundreds before the start of Passover over the weekend.Student organizers from the Columbia University encampment responded to the White House claims of antisemitism in the pro-Palestinian protests on campus. They said they were being misidentified and that some ""inflammatory individuals"" did not represent their movement.""We are frustrated by media distractions focusing on inflammatory individuals who do not represent us,"" the anti-war Columbia protesters said in an emailed statement shared through a pro-Palestinian advocacy group called Institute of Middle East Understanding.The student activists said they are demanding the school divest from corporations that profit from Israel actions in Gaza, transparency of the school's financial investments and amnesty for students and faculty disciplined over their calls for Palestinian liberation.Columbia University officials could not be reached for comment.","Dozens of people were taken into custody during a pro-Palestinian demonstration at Yale University on Monday.

NEW YORK: A New York prosecutor on Monday told a jury that Donald Trump 's hush money payment to a porn star broke the law by deceiving voters shortly before the 2016 election, as the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president got under way.""This case is about conspiracy of fraud,"" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said. ""The defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election.""He told the jury that they would hear Trump working out the details of the scheme in his own voice on recorded conversations.Lawyers for the Republican presidential candidate will also make their opening statement in what may be the only one of Trump's four criminal prosecutions to go to trial before his Nov. 5 election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.Colangelo told jurors that Trump engaged in a ""catch and kill"" conspiracy with his former lawyer Michael Cohen and tabloid publisher David Pecker to cover up unflattering information about Trump and help him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.That included payments to women who said they had sexual encounters with Trump, including a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels , at a time when he was facing other revelations of sexual misbehavior, he said.As the trial opened, Justice Juan Merchan ruled that prosecutors would be able to ask Trump, if he testifies, about two other court cases: one that found he fraudulently misstated the value of his real estate assets, and another that found he defamed writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of rape.Merchan also said prosecutors would be able to show jurors a transcript of a tape from the 'Access Hollywood' TV show in which Trump makes vulgar comments about grabbing women's genitals, though jurors will not be allowed to see the tape itself.Wearing a blue tie and dark blue suit, Trump stared at the judge and occasionally spoke to his lawyer. A Secret Service agent wearing an earpiece sat directly behind him.Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsification of business records brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and denies having had a sexual encounter with Daniels.The case is seen by many legal experts as the least consequential of the Trump prosecutions. A guilty verdict would not bar him from taking office, but it could hurt his candidacy.Reuters/Ipsos polling shows half of independent voters and one in four Republicans say they would not vote for Trump if he is convicted of a crime.Colangelo said Trump disguised his reimbursements to Cohen as legal expenses through 11 falsified invoices, 12 falsified ledger entries, and 11 falsified checks.""Those were lies. There was no retainer agreement, Cohen was not being paid for legal services,"" Colangelo said. ""The defendant falsified those business records because he wanted to conceal his and others' criminal conduct.""Pecker is the first witness prosecutors plan to call after opening statements, the New York Times and CNN reported on Sunday. According to prosecutors, Pecker agreed during an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen to act as the campaign's ""eyes and ears"" by looking out for negative stories about Trump.""Pecker was not acting as a publisher, he was acting as a co-conspirator,"" Colangelo said.American Media, which published the National Enquirer, in 2018 admitted that it paid $150,000 to former Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal for rights to her story about a months-long affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. American Media said it worked ""in concert"" with Trump's campaign, and it never published a story.""The evidence will show that the defendant desperately did not want this info about Karen McDougal to become public because he was worried about its impact on the election,"" Colangelo said.The tabloid reached a similar deal to pay $30,000 to a doorman who was seeking to sell a story about Trump allegedly fathering a child out of wedlock, which turned out to be false, according to prosecutors.Trump has said the payments were personal and did not violate election law. He has also denied the affair with McDougal.In the New York trial, Trump is charged with falsely recording his 2017 reimbursement of Cohen for the Daniels payment as a legal expense in his real estate company's books. Prosecutors say he did so to conceal the fact that Cohen's payment exceeded the $2,700 limit on individual campaign contributions at the time.Testimony about those payments could help prosecutors establish that Cohen's payment to Daniels was part of a broader pattern.Prosecutors plan to call at least 20 witnesses total, according to Trump's defense team. The trial could last six to eight weeks.Before the trial began Monday, Trump called for supporters to protest peacefully at courthouses ""all over the Country,"" but few were on hand to greet him when he arrived at the downtown courthouse. Trump suggested tight security measures were responsible for the sparse turnout, but the streets surrounding the courthouse were open to the public.""Lower Manhattan surrounding the Courthouse, where I am heading now, is completely CLOSED DOWN. SO UNFAIR!!!"" he wrote on social media.Trump faces three other criminal indictments stemming from his efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat and his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House in 2021.Trump has pleaded not guilty in those cases, and he portrays all of them as a broad-based effort by Biden's Democratic allies to undercut his campaign.Merchan, who is overseeing the hush money trial, imposed a limited gag order on Trump after he criticized witnesses, prosecutors, the judge and his daughter. Prosecutors are pressing Merchan to penalize Trump for violating that order.","Donald Trump's first-ever criminal trial gets under way in New York. Prosecution: Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election. Trump is charged with falsely recording his reimbursement of the Stormy Daniels payment.

The warning came after Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (FSVPS) issued a notification regarding violations of international and Russian phytosanitary requirements over a shipment of rice imported from Pakistan.Dated April 2, the notification highlights the presence of a quarantine organism, ""Megaselia scalaris (Loew),"" in the rice consignment.Pakistan's trade representative at its embassy in Russia was asked to carry out an immediate investigation into the matter.The Russian authorities have written to the Pakistan embassy to prevent such violations and ensure all Pakistani rice exporters follow phytosanitary standards to ensure the safety of agricultural products traded between the two countries.The trade wing of the Pakistani embassy in Moscow, while forwarding the Russian authority's letter to the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) in the Ministry of Food Security and other relevant government offices, has warned of a possible ban on rice exports in future if more complaints were received from Russian authorities.Russia had previously imposed a ban on rice imports from Pakistan in 2019 because of health safety reasons.Similarly, in December 2006, Russia stopped the import of rice from Pakistan for not meeting food safety standards.Chairman of the Pakistan Rice Exporters Association, Chela Ram Kewlani, said that Pakistani rice exporters needed to be very careful in choosing and packaging all rice for export.He said that Pakistan had benefited from India banning exports of non-Basmati rice last year, given that India has a nearly 40 per cent share in the globally traded rice.Last year, India banned the export of white non-Basmati and parboiled rice.According to a leading Pakistani rice dealer, about 700,000 tonnes of rice were exported in December 2023 alone, the highest in a month for the fiscal year.He said Pakistan exported rice with an increase in higher production and demand and elevated global prices last year.The Rice Export Corporation is projecting a 60 per cent jump in exports of Basmati rice to over a million tonnes and a 36 per cent jump for non-Basmati rice to 4.25 million tonnes from Pakistan.It is eyeing exports of above five million metric tonnes of all rice in the fiscal year of 2023/2024, which would be much higher than last fiscal year's exports of 3.7 million tonnes.",Russia has warned Pakistan that it would ban rice imports again if Moscow's phytosanitary concerns are not addressed in future consignments.

Despite the conflict's international ramifications, it has not garnered widespread attention.In recent months, resistance fighters in Myanmar's remote areas have been consistently defeating the ruling military junta , surprising analysts and raising the possibility of the junta's collapse.The war has become a human rights disaster , with Myanmar's economy in shambles since the 2021 military coup, plunging millions into extreme poverty. The country's reputation as a center for drugs, online scams, and money laundering is growing, and its instability has created strategic challenges for China, India, the United States, and other nations.The civil war has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 3 million others. The country is riddled with land mines, and extreme inflation has contributed to a significant reduction in the middle class, according to the United Nations . The health sector is in crisis, with childhood vaccinations essentially halted and a substantial increase in malaria cases. Experts are concerned about the spread of HIV and tuberculosis.The conflict has regional and international implications. According to the United Nations, Russia and other countries have sold the Myanmar army at least $1 billion in weapons since the 2021 coup. China sees threats to its infrastructure projects across the country, while India, which has long feared chaos in its borderlands, is deporting Myanmar refugees.Thailand is similarly concerned about the estimated 40,000 or more refugees that the United Nations predicts will cross the border this year. Bangladesh sees obstacles to its efforts to repatriate the Rohingya , and the United States has begun providing nonlethal aid to armed resistance groups.","The civil war has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 3 million others.

Police conducted raids in Central Sulawesi province between Tuesday and Thursday, said Agus Nugroho, the provincial police chief, adding that five suspects were arrested in the city of Palu , two in Sigi, and one in Poso which is a known extremist hotbed.Two laptops, several cellular phones and documents, including jihadist books were seized and suspects were being interrogated, Nugroho said.National Police spokesperson Trunoyudo Wisnu Andiko said the arrests were the result of information obtained from 59 suspected militants detained in October 2023.""(The eight) all actively participate in organisation activities, particularly in military-style training and collecting funds for alleged plans of terror acts,"" Andiko told reporters at the National Police headquarters in the capital, Jakarta. He added that convicted leaders of the group and veteran fighters in Afghanistan were recruiting and training new members.Jemaah Islamiyah is responsible for several attacks inside Indonesia, namely, the 2002 bombings on the resort island of Bali that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. A court banned the group in 2008 and constant counterterrorism crackdowns, supported by the United States and Australia, have weakened it further.Last year, police arrested a total of 142 suspected militants, including four women, and fatally shot two others on southern Sumatra island.Militant attacks on foreigners in Indonesia have been largely replaced in recent years by smaller, less deadly strikes targeting the government, mainly police and anti-terrorism forces, and people militants consider to be infidels, inspired by Islamic State group tactics abroad.","Police conducted raids in Central Sulawesi province between Tuesday and Thursday.
