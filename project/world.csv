Climber Sandy Irvine’s remains found on Mount Everest after 100 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/climber-sandy-irvines-remains-found-on-mount-everest-after-100-years/articleshow/114188063.cms,"British Climber Sandy Irvine (Left) and apparently his foot (Right) (AP Images)

The mystery of Irvine , who vanished into clouds as mist swept over the Himalayan Summit, was finally solved after 100 years when the National Geographic team spotted a boot melting out of the ice on Mount Everest in September.Andrew ""Sandy"" Ivrine disappeared on Everest on June 8 1924 along with his partner George Mallory while attempting to become the first people to climb the world’s highest peak, the National Geographic said in a report.The team of National Geographic, in September, stumbled on a preserved boot, revealed by melting ice on a glacier. After examining the boot closely, they discovered a sock with ""a red label that has A.C. IRVINE stitched into it.""This discovery could provide further clues about the location of the team's personal effects and may help resolve the mystery of whether Irvine and Mallory ever reached the summit, nearly three decades before the first recognised summit by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.His partner Mallory’s remains were located in 1999, while the whereabouts of Irvine’s were unknown.“It's the first real evidence of where Sandy ended up,” National Geographic documentary director Jimmy Chin said. “A lot of theories have been put out there.” He hopes the discovery helps explain what happened on the mountain in 1924, and brings some closure to Irvine’s relatives who revere him still.“When someone disappears and there’s no evidence of what happened to them, it can be really challenging for families. And just having some definitive information of where Sandy might’ve ended up is certainly [helpful], and also a big clue for the climbing community as to what happened,” he added.Irvine's great-niece, Julie Summers, was moved to tears upon learning of the discovery, stating, ""It tells the whole story about what probably happened.""The Irvine family has offered to share DNA samples to confirm the identity of the remains. Irvine was only 22 years old when he went missing on June 8, 1924, during the final ascent to the summit with Mallory, according to National Geographic .Earlier this year, Mallory's final letter to his wife was digitized and published online by Cambridge University, revealing his doubts about their chances of reaching the summit.Irvine is believed to have been carrying a vest camera, the discovery of which could rewrite mountaineering history. Climb team member and National Geographic explorer Jimmy Chin did not disclose the exact location of the remains to discourage trophy hunters but “it certainly reduces the search area.”","Andrew ""Sandy"" Ivrine disappeared on Everest on June 8 1924 along with his partner George Mallory.

"Will US have peaceful elections? Trump warns of 'very bad, sick people'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-us-have-peaceful-elections-trump-warns-of-very-bad-sick-people/articleshow/114200756.cms,"Former US President and Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump raised eyebrows with his suggestion that military forces might be necessary to address what he termed “the enemy from within” on Election Day. In a discussion focused on potential election-related chaos, Trump expressed confidence that his supporters would not contribute to unrest.During a press interaction, a reporter pressed Trump on the possibility of disturbances, particularly from external agitators.“Are you expecting chaos on election day?” the reporter asked.“No, I don't think so. Not from the side that votes for Trump,” Trump replied, dismissing fears of violence stemming from his supporters.The conversation then shifted to potential threats from outside actors. Citing the presence of thousands of Chinese nationals and individuals on terrorist watchlists in the US, Trump was questioned whether these elements could spark violence, especially if Trump emerged victorious. President Joe Biden ’s remarks suggesting that the upcoming election might not be peaceful were also referenced.Trump, accusing Biden of ignorance, said, “Well, he does not have any idea what is happening as he spends most of his days sleeping. I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within. Not even people who come and destroy our country, by the way, totally destroying our country. The towns, villages, they're being inundated. But I don't know if there will be problems in terms of election day.”Trump insisted that any unrest should be addressed with decisive action, stating, “I think the bigger problem is the people from within. We have some very bad people. We've some sick people,radical left lunatics. And I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, the National Guard or, if really necessary, by the military because they can't let that happen.”Trump's remarks come as tensions rise ahead of the upcoming election, with both major parties gearing up for what many anticipate could be a contentious process.President Joe Biden had earlier expressed doubts about the likelihood of peaceful elections in November. He pointed to what he called ""inflammatory remarks"" made by Trump, the Republican candidate, who continues to deny the legitimacy of his loss in the 2020 presidential race. The 81-year-old president suggested that while he believes the election will be “free and fair,” he cannot guarantee it will be “peaceful.”","Former US President Donald Trump suggested that military forces might be necessary to address what he termed “the enemy from within” on Election Day.

United States representative James Clyburn has expressed concern over the possibility of Black men either voting for former US President Donald Trump or sitting out the upcoming election, raising alarms within the Democratic Party .“I am concerned about Black men staying home or voting for Trump,” Clyburn said during an appearance on CNN’s 'State of the Union' on Sunday.Despite his concerns, the congressman said it wouldn't affect his enthusiasm for the campaign, as reported by the Hill.Clyburn's comments follow former President Barack Obama 's recent call to action aimed at Black men, amid signs of declining support for vice president Kamala Harris among the demographic. Speaking in Pennsylvania, Obama addressed the issue directly: ""You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses... part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.""Recent polling has shown Trump gaining support among Black men, a trend worrying to some Democrats. Clyburn, who has been campaigning for Harris in Michigan, reported having ""very frank and direct discussions"" with Black leaders in the state, noting their desire to understand what a Harris administration would offer.Senator Raphael Warnock, however, downplayed concerns during the same programme, dismissing the notion that Black men would vote for Trump in large numbers, saying, ""It’s not going to happen.""",U.S. representative James Clyburn has expressed concern over the possibility of Black men either voting for former US President Donald Trump or sitting out the upcoming election.

Former US President Donald Trump 's running mate and GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance faced off against ABC News host Martha Raddatz during a heated interview on Sunday, discussing concerns about Venezuelan migrant gang members in Aurora, Colorado.The interview followed recent arrests connected to the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA), which were prompted by a viral surveillance video showing armed men breaking down an apartment door.Raddatz challenged Vance on statements made by Donald Trump at a rally in Aurora, where he claimed that migrant gangs were overrunning the city.“I’m going to stop you because I know exactly what happened. The incidents were limited to a handful of apartment complexes, and the mayor said our dedicated police officers have acted on those concerns,” Raddatz said, as she pressed Vance for clarification.Vance responded with frustration, saying, “Martha, do you hear yourself? Only a handful of apartment complexes in America were taken over by Venezuelan gangs, and Donald Trump is the problem and not Kamala Harris ’ open border?” He added that Americans were fed up with the situation, pointing out the need to make communities “safe” again.“When you let people in by the millions, most of whom are unvetted, most of whom you don’t know who they really are, you’re going to have problems like this,” he continued, blaming Harris’ policies for the rise in gang-related incidents.Raddatz countered, asserting, “Let’s just end that with they did not invade or take over the city as Donald Trump said.” Vance sarcastically remarked, “A few apartment complexes, no big deal"", as quoted by Fox News .Aurora mayor Mike Coffman, a Republican , responded to Trump’s claims, saying that concerns over Venezuelan gang activity had been exaggerated and that the city had not been “taken over” by migrant gangs.","Former US President Donald Trump's running mate and GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance faced off against ABC News host Martha Raddatz on Sunday.

A man armed with guns and fake passes was arrested on Saturday outside Donald Trump 's Coachella rally site at the last minute, reports said citing the local sheriff. The suspect was caught about a mile from the rally venue with a phony-entry pass, according to police. He was also carrying a loaded shotgun, handgun and high capacity magazine. “We probably stopped another assassination attempt,” Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said, as quoted by New York Post.The suspect has been identified as Vem Miller who was carrying a fake press card and entry pass.He is believed to be a member of a rightwing anti-government organization and was plotting to kill Trump, the Sheriff said. ""They were different enough to cause the deputies alarm,"" Bianco said.Miller is believed to be a member of a rightwing anti-government organization. A 49-year-old resident of Las Vegas, Miller was arrested at a checkpoint driving a black SUV. There have been two attempts on Trump's life and at the Coachella rally, Trump was speaking from behind the bulletproof glass.Miller is a registered Republican who holds a master’s degree from UCLA, and who ran for state assembly in Nevada in 2022, a report said.Bianco said Miller considers himself a so-called sovereign citizen, a group of people who do not believe they are subject to any government statutes unless they consent to them.He was released Saturday on $5,000 bail and is scheduled to appear at the Indio Larson Justice Center on Jan. 2, 2025, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department inmate database.The Secret Service put out a brief statement saying it was aware of the arrest. “The incident did not impact protective operations.

Pakistan prepares for SCO Summit amidst security concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-prepares-for-sco-summit-amidst-security-concerns/articleshow/114180796.cms,"Representative image.

Pakistan is gearing up to secure its capital, Islamabad, ahead of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The event, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, will see the attendance of key regional leaders, including India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and China's Premier Li Qiang.In preparation for the summit, Pakistan's government has implemented strict measures.These include strict enforcement against movements protesting ethnic nationalism and new laws that limit demonstrations in the capital. Authorities have also detained hundreds of supporters of opposition leader Imran Khan , who is currently jailed, following their attempt to march in Islamabad.Security concerns have been heightened by a recent attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers in Karachi, raising fears for the safety of foreign nationals amid ongoing separatist violence. The government has responded by authorizing troop deployments in the capital throughout the summit's duration.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst, emphasized the importance of the summit for Pakistan, stating, ""The government claims to have made elaborate security arrangements and understandably so because it has to make sure that the event passes off peacefully without any untoward incident.""The SCO, which includes China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and six other member states, is viewed by some as an alternative to Western alliances such as NATO. The agenda for the Islamabad summit focuses on trade, humanitarian, and cultural issues, though domestic issues in Pakistan may loom large.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, has threatened protests during the summit. Ahsan Iqbal Chaudhary, Pakistan's minister for planning, accused the PTI of trying to disrupt the event, stating, ""The PTI doesn't want to showcase the positive side of Pakistan to the world. Instead, they aim to present a picture of the country filled with tear gas and unrest.""To facilitate the summit, Islamabad and the neighboring city of Rawalpindi will observe a public holiday starting Monday, accompanied by road closures to reduce movement. The government quarter hosting the summit has been fortified and prepared for the visiting dignitaries.Pakistan, heavily reliant on Chinese investment for infrastructure projects, is keen to ensure the safety of its citizens and foreign guests, especially considering the broader uptick in militancy linked to the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan.The authorities aim for a peaceful summit to enhance the country's image amidst various internal and external challenges.","Pakistan is hosting a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.

Jet fighters can reach astonishing speeds and perform complex movements, making them a symbol of military power and technological prowess. These aircrafts are designed for precision and dominance in the skies, and some of the fastest jets ever built show remarkable feats of human engineering.From the iconic warplanes like the F-22 Raptor and to NASA’s cutting-edge experimental aircraft X-43, and even the famous F-14 Tomcat, which starred in the Tom Cruise movie Top Gun, these jets depict unbelievable speeds ranging from Mach 2.25 to an unbelievable Mach 9.6, making them a pinnacle of aviation technology.Each aircraft has left a lasting mark on history. Explore the list of ten of the fastest jets ever created in the world according to a BBC report.The F-22 Raptor is a single-seat stealth fighter with formidable capabilities, including a top speed of Mach 2.25 and exceptional long-range cruising ability. Loaded with advanced weaponry, it stands out as a powerful force in modern air combat. However, its cutting-edge stealth technology is so sensitive that the U.S. government prohibits its sale to other countries.Despite its speed and stealth, the F-22 has been outpaced in versatility by the slower F-35 Lightning II. Production of the F-22 was capped at just 187 aircraft, making it a rare sight in modern air fleets.Designed by the USSR to compete with the F-15 Eagle during the Cold War, the MiG-29 Fulcrum is a lightweight fighter with a top speed of Mach 2.3 and a range of 1,500 km on a single tank of fuel. It can also be refuelled mid-air, making it a combat favourite for many air forces.Renowned for its agility, the MiG-29 has seen extensive action over the years and can take off and land on rough runways. With continuous upgrades, it remains in service with numerous countries worldwide.The F-14 Tomcat is perhaps most famous for its starring role in the 1986 movie Top Gun. This two-seater fighter was launched from aircraft carriers, delivering some of the most iconic take-off and landing sequences in aviation history. Powered by two jet engines, it boasts a top speed of Mach 2.34.In service for over 30 years, the F-14 became one of the best-known jets in the world, recognized for its agility and versatile combat capabilities.The MiG-23 Flogger is easily recognizable due to its variable-sweep wing design, which contributes to its exceptional agility in dogfights. Capable of reaching speeds of Mach 2.35, this Soviet-era jet was a popular choice for many air forces, with over 5,000 units built over 18 years.Despite being nearly 60 years old, the MiG-23 is still in service in some nations due to its sturdy construction and high performance.Although the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker misses out on the top five, it is renowned for more than just speed, with a top speed of Mach 2.35. This versatile fighter jet features excellent manoeuvrability and a strong operational range, making it a highly valuable aircraft for a variety of missions.The Su-27's rapid ascent ability is legendary, reaching an altitude of 12 km in less than a minute. It remains in production today, over 40 years after its debut.The F-15 Eagle has been in service for nearly 50 years, yet it remains one of the fastest jets, with a top speed of Mach 2.5. Its combination of low weight and high wing area enables it to execute tight turns without losing speed, making it perfect for dogfights. The F-15 has earned its place as a staple at airshows and in combat missions around the world.The MiG-31 Foxhound is one of the oldest jets still in operation, designed as an improvement over the MiG-25 for stability at lower altitudes. Although not as agile as other jets, it compensates with formidable firepower, including long-range missiles, and can reach a top speed of Mach 2.83.Its continued service underscores the success of its design, though its radar detectability limits its stealth capabilities.First introduced nearly 60 years ago, the MiG-25 Foxbat remains one of the fastest fighter jets in existence, with a top speed of Mach 2.83. It was designed during the Cold War as a high-speed interceptor, and its capabilities have ensured its ongoing use in some countries, even though its design is now considered outdated. Over 1,200 MiG-25s were produced, marking it as one of the most successful jet fighters of all time.The SR-71 Blackbird, known for its incredible speed and stealth, was capable of outrunning missiles. When it entered service in 1966, it was a marvel of technology, with a top speed of Mach 3.3. Primarily used for reconnaissance missions during the Cold War, the SR-71 still holds the record for the highest sustained flight altitude at nearly 26 km.NASA was the last operator of the Blackbird, retiring it in 1999. Its rumoured successor, the SR-72, is expected to debut in 2025.NASA's X-43, an experimental scramjet that achieved an unprecedented speed of Mach 9.6, or 11,854 km/h. The X-43 was launched from a Boeing B-52 and only flew for 10 seconds before gliding for 10 minutes and intentionally crashing into the ocean.Despite its short flights, the X-43 remains the fastest jet ever built, showcasing the future of high-speed aircraft design.","The F-22 Raptor is a single-seat stealth fighter with formidable capabilities, including a top speed of Mach 2.25 and exceptional long-range cruising ability.

Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged.

They are more than just brushstrokes or oil on canvas.From the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa to the haunting Scream by Edvard Munch, and the ethereal beauty of Shakuntala by Raja Ravi Verma, each painting reveals deeper meanings, symbolising the artist’s emotions, societal changes, and the conflicts of their time.Discover the fascinating stories behind these iconic works that have made a solid impact on the world of art here.The enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa has fascinated viewers for centuries. Painted by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1506, it is believed to portray Lisa Gherardini, a merchant’s wife.

Painted in 1889 from the window of a mental asylum, it reflects his battle with mental illness. The painting’s vibrant brushstrokes and dreamlike quality make it one of the most iconic artworks ever.Painted between 1495 and 1498, The Last Supper portrays Jesus and his disciples during the moment of betrayal. Located in Milan’s Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, it showcases Da Vinci’s innovative use of perspective and human emotion. Restoration efforts over the centuries have struggled to preserve its original grandeur.Shakuntala depicts the beautiful heroine from Kalidasa’s epic, Abhijñānaśākuntalam. Raja Ravi Varma captures her essence with delicate brushwork, showcasing her deep emotional connection with nature and the divine. The painting conveys a poignant moment of longing, emphasising the themes of love, fate, and the transient nature of beauty.Created in 1931, The Persistence of Memory is known for its melting clocks, symbolising the fluidity of time. Dalí’s surrealist masterpiece explores themes of dreams and the subconscious. Its bizarre yet captivating imagery has made it one of the most recognizable works in modern art history.Often referred to as the ""Mona Lisa of the North,"" Girl with a Pearl Earring (1665) features a young girl in a turban with a luminous pearl earring. Painted by Dutch artist Vermeer, its simplicity, use of light, and the subject's gaze evoke intrigue and mystery, capturing timeless beauty.Guernica (1937) is Picasso's powerful anti-war statement, depicting the horrors of the Spanish Civil War. The monochromatic, chaotic composition was inspired by the bombing of the town of Guernica. The painting’s distorted figures and intense emotion make it one of the most famous political artworks of the 20th century.Edvard Munch’s The Scream (1893) embodies human anxiety and existential dread. Inspired by a panic attack the artist experienced, its swirling sky and distorted figure reflect inner turmoil.

This painting became a powerful symbol of the Indian independence movement.The Night Watch (1642) is Rembrandt’s grand depiction of a militia company, praised for its dynamic composition and use of light. Once considered a night scene due to dark varnish, later restorations revealed it as a daytime setting. Its scale and intricate details showcase Rembrandt’s mastery of portraiture.Bride’s Toilet portrays the intimate moment of an Indian bride’s preparation, capturing the beauty and vulnerability of the ritual. Painted in 1937, Sher-Gil’s uses rich colours and expressive forms to depict the emotions of anticipation and femininity.American Gothic (1930) by Grant Wood depicts a stern farmer and his daughter, set against a rural backdrop. It has become a symbol of American rural life, though its meaning is debated. Some interpret it as a critique of small-town life, while others see it as a celebration of Midwestern values.Painted in the 1480s, The Birth of Venus depicts the Roman goddess Venus emerging from the sea. Botticelli's delicate use of colour and graceful figures evoke beauty and myth. Commissioned by the powerful Medici family, this Renaissance masterpiece has become an enduring symbol of classical beauty and humanism.Horses showcases M.F. Husain’s fascination with these majestic animals, which he often used as metaphors for freedom and energy. The vibrant colours and dynamic brushstrokes convey a sense of movement and vitality. This artwork reflects Husain's modernist approach, blending traditional Indian themes with contemporary artistic expression.Three Pujarins exemplifies Jamini Roy's unique style, blending traditional Indian folk art with modern aesthetics.

'She didn't sign up for this': What JD Vance said about 'dragging' Hindu wife Usha to Church,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/she-didnt-sign-up-for-this-what-jd-vance-said-about-dragging-hindu-wife-usha-to-church/articleshow/114180849.cms,"New York Times

Ohio Senator and Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance has revealed he feels bad about bringing his wife, Usha Vance , to church every week, saying that ""she didn't sign up for this."" Vance said that Usha was raised in a Hindu household, has not converted to Catholicism despite attending Mass regularly.In an interview with the, Vance, admitted to feeling uncomfortable about how his religious journey has affected his wife.“I feel — felt — kind of bad,” he explained. “Like, ‘Oh, you didn’t sign up to marry a weekly churchgoer, and are you OK with this?’ And she was sort of more than OK with it, and that was a big part of the confirmation that this was the right thing for me.”Vance revealed that Usha encouraged him to explore Catholicism even though she did not follow the faith herself. “She thought that they were good for me, in a sort of good-for-your-soul kind of way,” he said. “I don’t think I would have ever done it without her support, because I felt kind of bad about it, right?”Reflecting on his spiritual growth, Vance shared his deeper motivations. “When I started to think about the big things, like, what do I actually care about in my life? I really want to be a good husband. I really want to be a good father. I really want to be a good member of the community. I wanted to be a virtuous human being, in other words.”Despite Usha's support, Vance acknowledged the pressures she faces. “I feel terrible for my wife because we go to church almost every Sunday, unless we’re on the road,” he said. He explained that although he helps with their children, Usha tends to feel the burden of keeping them quiet during the service. “Obviously, I help with the kids, but because I’m kind of the one going to church, she feels more responsibility to keep the kids quiet in the church.”Usha and JD Vance met at Yale Law School and married in Kentucky in 2014, with a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. They have three children. Usha has been pivotal in JD’s political career, helping him shape his thoughts on rural America’s social decline, which inspired his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. The book was adapted into a 2020 film by Ron Howard.","Ohio Senator and Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance has revealed he feels bad about bringing his wife, Usha Vance, to church every week.

Mysterious UFO drones are reportedly surveilling America’s sensitive military sites, leaving the Pentagon struggling to take action against these aerial intruders, according to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal .Over the past year, unidentified drones have been spotted flying over military installations in Virginia and Nevada, including the secret base for the Navy’s elite SEAL Team Six and Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval port in the world.However, federal laws prevent the military from shooting down these drones due to potential risks to troops and civilians.High-profile White House discussions have also ruled out jamming their signals, with concerns that such actions could disrupt emergency services, Wi-Fi networks, and commercial airliners, as reported by the New York Post.Former US Air Force general Mark Kelly was first alerted to drone sightings in December 2023, when Langley Air Force Base officials reported dozens of drones flying over the facility at night. These sightings continued for 17 days, prompting suspicions that Russian or Chinese agents might be involved.On January 6, 2024, a clue emerged when a Chinese student at the University of Minnesota, Fengyun Shi, was caught flying a drone near Langley. His drone, which had photographed Navy ships, was abandoned after getting stuck in a tree. Shi was arrested a week later as he prepared to board a flight to China and was charged with unlawfully photographing classified naval installations.While US officials have confirmed similar drone swarms near Edwards Air Force Base in Nevada, the Defence Department has yet to publicly identify those behind these apparent surveillance efforts.","Mysterious UFO drones are reportedly surveilling America’s sensitive military sites, leaving the Pentagon struggling to take action against these aerial intruders.

American actor Dennis Quaid , known for his role in the film ""Reagan,"" rallied for former US President Donald Trump in Coachella , California, on Saturday, addressing a crowd in the deep blue Democratic state which used to be vice president Kamala Harris 's stronghold, as reported by Fox News .“God bless you.

Are we going to be a nation of law and order? Or wide open borders? Which is it? Because it's time to pick a side.”Speaking in the desert city, Quaid noted his recent portrayal of President Ronald Reagan in a 2024 biopic. He compared the political situation during Reagan's election to the present day, mentioning similar problems like inflation and the country's decline.“It’s amazing how the issues of the 1980 election are very similar to what they are today,” he said, recounting the challenges America faced during Reagan's presidency. “Ronald Reagan came along and said, no, we're not a nation in decline. We're going there. And we followed him. The same with Trump.”Quaid shared a funny story about how he was kicked out of the ""hippies"" after voting for Reagan.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk could play a major role in a potential second Donald Trump administration, according to the former US president, who revealed plans for a unique position during a Fox News interview on Sunday.In a conversation with Maria Bartiromo on 'Sunday Morning Futures', Donald Trump praised Musk, calling him “a great business guy” and “a great cost-cutter.” He added, “He [Musk] said, ‘I could cut costs without affecting anybody.’”When asked if Musk would join his Cabinet should he return to office, Trump clarified, “He doesn’t want to be in the Cabinet.He just wants to be in charge of cost-cutting. We’ll have a new position: Secretary of Cost-Cutting.”Trump went on to highlight Musk's ambitious space ventures, saying, “He’s made me a promise to get to Mars before the end of my administration, which will be long before, hopefully, China or Russia.” Trump referenced Space Force , which he established in 2019, saying, “It’s now going to be one of our most important things.”Musk recently appeared on the Trump campaign trail, wearing a “Dark MAGA” hat and a t-shirt with the slogan “Occupy Mars.” His first appearance took place in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump narrowly escaped assassination in July. Musk used the platform to warn against a potential Kamala Harris presidency, claiming it would threaten free speech. “This is no ordinary election,” Musk told supporters. “The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech.”Trump mentioned that Musk has been actively campaigning for him in the key battleground state. “He’s actually campaigning because he says, ‘If we don’t win, we’re not going to have a country.’”The former president expressed his determination, saying, “We just have to win.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

The top American general who served during Donald Trump 's presidency says he is ""fascist to the core"" and the ""most dangerous person ever."" Trump's own niece Mary Trump says he has ""aways been for sale"" and billionaire tech-bro Elon Musk is the new owner. The actor Jeff Daniels, who's ""America is not great"" screed of US in a tv serial became a global viral hit, says Trump rallies are where people go to get away from their conscience.Outside the MAGA echo-chamber, Trump take-downs are relentless across America. Yet, not a vote seems to have moved in the US Presidential polls, with most credible surveys showing the two candidates virtually tied. There are marginal shifts in the lead in the seven battleground states, but every state is within a normal-sized polling error of 3.5 points and could swing either way. An NBC poll put them at 48-48 nationwide, with only a ""sliver of undecideds"" remaining to make up their mind.Beyond polling, the campaign has become even more mean and toxic, pandering to partisans with ever uglier swipes. In some of the most vicious language ever used by a presidential candidate, Trump reportedly called Kamala Harris ""retarded"" in a meeting with his donors, even as his MAGA mob yelled ""She's a Ho'"" at a rally in Coachella, California, where Trump replayed the dark, dystopian view of the US overrun by illegal immigrants.Liberal hacks meanwhile taunted Trump with memes about his purported incontinence, including a fake post where the former President contests videos in which a loud tooting sound is heard. Trump critics were in full flow this week with fetid stories about ""Diaper Don"" and his problem with incontinence, citing his former personal staff and associates on his show The Apprentice.Meanwhile, the movie The Apprentice centering on Trump opened in movieplexes across America to acclaim from movie critics but blistering criticism from the MAGA crowd, including threats of legal action by Trump lawyers for its negative portrayal of a young Trump. Among other things, the movie suggests Trump had a homo-erotic relationship with a sleazy lawyer named Ray Cohn who was his mentor and show him sexually assaulting his first wife Ivana Trump after she calls him fat and balding.None of this appears to be making the slightest dent in support for a man who once boasted that he could shoot someone in the middle of New York City's Fifth Avenue and still not lose any votes. If anything, the relentless trashing to Trump seems to be consolidating support for a candidate seen as fighting the ""establishment.""In fact, Trump supporters over the weekend unloaded on one of the country's top generals, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley , who is quoted as describing the former President as a ""total fascist"" in Bob Woodward 's new book. “I had suspicions when I talked to you about his mental decline and so forth, but now I realize he's a total fascist. He's now the most dangerous person to this country. A fascist to the core,” Milley tells Woodward.But the MAGA mob has now turned on Milley, calling him a traitor who should be tried by a military tribunal because, according to them, he withheld nuclear codes from Trump when he was the President and alerted China that he would give them a head's up if Trump decided to launch a war.In fact, revenge is a recurring theme among Trump supporters if he returns as president, a result they believe is inevitable. Trump himself has repeatedly said he will accept the results of the election only if he wins. A recent Pew survey in fact showed that 72% of voters say if Harris loses she will accept the results and acknowledge Trump’s victory. Virtually all Harris supporters (95%) and about half of Trump supporters (48%) expect Harris to concede. But just 24% say if Trump loses he will concede, while 74% say he will not. About half of Trump supporters (46%) and only 4% of Harris supporters expect Trump to acknowledge Harris as the election winner.","Donald Trump's campaign has become even more mean and toxic, pandering to partisans with ever uglier swipes.

NEW DELHI: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting, well in time for a welcome dinner that will be hosted by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif for the delegates.While both sides have ruled out any formal bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the SCO event, the minister as of now is expected to participate in the dinner and exchange pleasantries with host Shehbaz and counterpart Ishaq Dar, before the main summit on Wednesday.Even though it won’t be a fleeting visit as was previously thought, Jaishankar will likely spend not more than 24 hours in Pakistan before flying back to India.The minister will be in Pakistan on October 15-16 for what will be the first visit by any Indian foreign minister to the country in nearly a decade. However, a day after India confirmed his visit to Pakistan, Jaishankar said he wasn’t going to Islamabad to discuss India’s ties with Pakistan but to be a ``good member’’ of the SCO, which counts India and Pakistan apart from Russia, China, Iran and 4 Central Asian countries as member-states.India hasn’t allowed its differences with Pakistan on the issue of cross-border terrorism , or even the border tensions with China, to come in the way of its participation in the Eurasian bloc that is seen as playing an important role in ensuring regional security. Russia’s presence in the group has also been a motivating factor for India.While a structured bilateral meeting is ruled out, a quick pull aside, possibly behind the scenes, on the margins could still take place but India will expect Islamabad to propose any such meeting. India has continued to maintain that the onus for any forward movement in the relationship, which has not seen any substantive engagement between the 2 countries for the past 9 years, is on Pakistan. For any rapprochement, India sees as essential verifiable and irreversible action by Pakistan against terrorism, and also a review of its decision to downgrade ties after the Indian government revoked the special status of J&K.Pakistan, however, has remained focused on the issue of Kashmir with Dar saying Sunday Islamabad under Shehbaz hasn’t lost an opportunity to raise it along with the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza.Chinese Premier Li Qiang will also be present at the event but there’s no confirmation yet of any bilateral meeting between him and Jaishankar.In his SCO address, Jaishankar is expected to underscore India’s concerns about terrorism, the need to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity while undertaking connectivity and infrastructure initiatives and also to take up concerns of the Global South. The SCO Charter doesn’t allow any member-state to raise bilateral issues and it’s unlikely he will name Pakistan. The minister will represent PM Narendra Modi who had been invited by Shehbaz to participate in the meeting. However, Modi only participates in the heads of state summit and normally deputes the foreign minister to stand in for him at the heads of government meetings.",India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting. Both sides have ruled out any formal bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the event. The minister will represent PM Narendra Modi who had been invited by Shehbaz to participate in the meeting.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114196887,imgsize-18712,width-400,resizemode-4/114196887.jpg"

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: At least 11 people have been killed and eight more have sustained injuries in a clash between two tribes in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday, Al Jazeera reported.Tensions rose in the Kurram district of the province after two people were critically injured in a shooting incident between rival tribes in the northwestern part of the country.However, the reason for the clashes is not known.As the violence spread, vehicles were targeted in different areas of the district which led to many more casualties, as noted by senior official Javedullah Khan.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is known to be home to over 40 million people who come from various tribal groups and identities.Khan said the injured were taken to a hospital, and efforts were being made to secure travel routes and restore normalcy. The injured were taken to a hospital.Pir Haider Ali Shah, a former parliamentarian and member of a tribal council, said elders had arrived in Kurram to mediate a peace agreement between the tribes.""The recent firing incidents are regrettable and have hampered efforts for lasting peace,"" he said.Notably, tribal group meetings also known as 'Jirgas' are routinely held to ensure peace and stability in the region, as reported by Al Jazeera.In another incident last month, at least 25 people were killed in days of clashes between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both communities live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, according to Al Jazeera.Clashes in the area have seen an uptick as last month alone over 20 people were killed between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, Al Jazeera noted.Meanwhile, on Saturday, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for attacks at a coal mine in Balochistan which saw the death of over 20 individuals including Pakistani as well as Afghan nationals. The attack had involved the use of heavy weapons, rocket launchers and grenades.Such attacks have become common in Balochistan, the southern part of the country known to be home to key natural resources but whose benefits do not translate to uplifting the citizens' quality of life there.The outfits operating from Balochistan accuse the central government in Islamabad of exploiting the province's rich oil and mineral resources to the detriment of the local population in the country's largest and least-populated province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.These groups have also expressed their anger against foreign nationals coming in for resource extraction but deriving profits without benefiting the locals. Attacks on international convoys have thus become a key way for citizens to register protests.BLA gave a higher casualty figure of 30 dead and 18 injured in the incident. It also said that Pakistani security personnel were disguised as workers, without giving evidence.It threatened more assaults unless the military withdrew from the province.Balochistan has been a hotbed of armed movements, with the BLA most prominent among them.Last week, the BLA - designated a ""terrorist group"" by Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States - claimed responsibility for an attack targeting Chinese nationals near Pakistan's largest airport, Al Jazeera reported.The Chinese embassy in Pakistan said at least two of its citizens were killed and a third injured after their convoy was targeted with an improvised explosive device believed to have been detonated by a suicide bomber.At least 10 people were injured in total, with four cars destroyed in the explosion and 10 more vehicles damaged in the resulting fire, local media reported.",Tensions rose in the Kurram district of the province after two people were critically injured in a shooting incident.

Over 100 children die in Pakistan from diphtheria amid shortage of life-saving Antitoxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/over-100-children-die-in-pakistan-from-diphtheria-amid-shortage-of-life-saving-antitoxin/articleshow/114185488.cms,"Pakistan: Over 100 children die due to Diphtheria in Karachi amid lack of facilities

More than 100 children have died in Karachi , Pakistan , this year due to diphtheria, a preventable disease, largely because of the unavailability of Diphtheria Anti-Toxin (DAT), according to a report by Geo News. Despite the availability of vaccines, the shortage of the crucial antitoxin has led to these tragic deaths.Sindh health officials confirmed that 140 cases of diphtheria were recorded last year at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital, with 52 fatalities.Experts say that the lifesaving antitoxin needed to treat the disease is unavailable across Sindh, including Karachi, with treatment costs estimated at 250,000 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) per child.Diphtheria, caused by a bacterium that affects the respiratory tract and skin, produces a toxin that can damage the heart and nerves, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease is vaccine-preventable, but requires multiple doses and boosters to maintain immunity. Those who are unvaccinated or under-immunized are at the highest risk.Health experts in Pakistan have raised concerns about the lack of vaccine coverage and the dire need for intervention. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Director of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI), Muhammad Arif Khan, stressed the importance of timely vaccination to prevent diphtheria outbreaks, emphasizing that the disease can cause severe complications, including difficulty breathing and swallowing.WHO data shows that symptoms of diphtheria, such as sore throat, fever, and swollen neck glands, typically appear 2-5 days after exposure. Without proper treatment, the disease can be fatal in 30% of cases, with young children especially at risk.Global immunization rates have been disrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, further exacerbating the issue. In Pakistan, immunization coverage remains uneven, with some areas like Balochistan reporting rates as low as 38%, well below global standards. The World Bank notes that Pakistan’s immunization coverage ranks among the lowest compared to similarly wealthy countries in Eastern and Southern Asia.Efforts to improve vaccination rates and provide adequate medical resources remain critical to preventing more deaths from this preventable disease.","Sindh health officials confirmed that 140 cases of diphtheria were recorded last year at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital, with 52 fatalities.

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government on Saturday warned to use force if jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's party went ahead to hold a protest in Islamabad on the occasion of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) politic committee, comprising of its key members, decided to hold a protest at D-Chowk in the capital on Tuesday if the government failed to meet its demand to give the 72-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician access to his legal team and a physician, spokesman Zulfiqar Bukhari said.The authorities due to security concerns stopped all meetings with Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail , after the protest by the party over the last weekend.Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that the government would use ""full force"" to stop the PTI's planned protest on the occasion of the SCO summit .""The call for protest on October 15 is an attack on the integrity of the country. We will not allow [anyone] to damage the honour and reputation of the country. The state will use all of its power and resources to prevent the invasion of Islamabad,"" said Asif while speaking to the media in Sialkot.The politician also called for the courts to intervene and take notice of the matter. ""Do the courts not see what the PTI founder is doing with the integrity of the country? The actions of the judiciary today will determine their role in history,"" he said.Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal condemned the protest call by terming it "" political terrorism "" which is aimed at maligning the country. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, he expressed disappointment at the timing of the protest.""Now there is no doubt that terrorism in Karachi and political terrorism protest calls are similar,"" the minister said, adding that both aimed to destabilise the country.Iqbal said the PTI was destroying the economy of the country and urged the party supporters to see the harm caused by their actions.""The PTI is attempting to undermine the government's economic recovery efforts. It's crucial to acknowledge the damage caused by these actions and consider the consequences of supporting policies that hinder Pakistan's growth and development,"" he said.The minister also stated that the country cannot afford destructive politics. ""Just because the PTI's leader is jailed, doesn't justify chaos,"" he said.Separately, federal minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit Baltistan Amir Muqam also strongly rejected the PTI's protest call. ""It is proof of anti-nationalism. There is no doubt that PTI's agenda seems to be anti-Pakistan because the party has declared the protest on this important occasion,"" he said.However, the PTI was in no mood to back off and Bukhari said the party was not against any foreign visit but ""this illegitimate government"" was trying to create a false case of normality when ""a former prime minister and leader of the largest party is illegally in prison (according to the UN) along with his wife"".""And to top it off, he has been banned to meet his legal team, doctor or family, which is against all human rights conventions and our constitution.

The major event is expected to see high-level Chinese representation and will also be attended by Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Incessant violent incidents in Pakistan’s northwest and southwest have raised serious questions about the ability of its forces to protect high-profile events and foreigners in the country.The assailants, according to police, broke into the miners’ quarters in Balochistan’s Dukki district, gathered the workers together and opened indiscriminate fire. “A group of armed men attacked the Junaid coal company mines in Dukki area in the early hours using heavy weapons,” said Humayun Khan Nasir, in charge of Dukki police station. The victims belonged to various regions of Pakistan, as well as Afghanistan. “Most of the victims were from Pashtun-speaking regions within Balochistan. Three of the deceased and four of the injured are Afghan nationals,” Nasir added.Khairullah Nasir, the coal mine owner, said the attackers used hand grenades, rocket launchers, and other modern weapons in the attack. He added the attackers also set fire to “10 coal engines and machinery”.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which often targets civilians and security forces, accusing them of robbing Balochistan of its resources, including minerals and gas.The BLA had carried out multiple attacks in Aug that resulted in more than 50 killings, including that of 23 passengers, mostly from Punjab province, who were shot dead after being taken out of their vehicles. On Monday the group had claimed responsibility for a suicide bomber attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers near Karachi airport. Two Chinese citizens were killed in that attack.There are hundreds of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in projects linked to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

Amidst the deteriorating relationship, Pakistani border troops and Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in a clash while the former country's forces engaged in fence repair work.The incident occurred after the Afghan side launched an attack on a border post in the Naushki-Ghazni sector of the Pak-Afghan border , as reported by The Express Tribune. In response, the Pakistan Army launched a strong counterattack on the Afghan checkpoints, resulting in significant casualties for the Afghan Taliban.The Pakistani newspaper's sources suggested that Pakistan would continue to take robust measures to defend its borders, and its security forces reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the country's territorial integrity, delivering a decisive response to this aggression from Afghanistan.This incident was not an isolated case of unprovoked aggression from Afghan forces. In the previous month, the Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing using heavy weapons, targeting Pakistani check posts from the Afghan region of Plosin. The fighting that took place during the night between September 8 and 9 resulted in the death of at least 16 Afghan Taliban fighters and the injury of 27 others.The Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 2021, allegedly with the support of Pakistan, which had hoped that they would eliminate the threat of militancy emanating from their soil. However, for Pakistan, such hopes turned out to be an illusion as the Afghan Taliban failed to uproot the hideouts of Pakistan Taliban from their territory, leading to an increase in attacks against Pakistan and souring ties between Islamabad and Kabul.","Pakistani border troops and Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in a clash while the former country's forces engaged in fence repair work.

COLOMBO : Sri Lanka 's new government has ordered the police to reinvestigate some high-profile cases, including the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and the 2005 murder of a Tamil minority community journalist. The ruling National People's Power , which won the presidential election last month, pledged to reinvestigate past cases which had not been resolved.The ministry of public security took action to identify any lapses in investigations.""The ministry has asked the acting police chief that these cases should be reinvestigated,"" Police spokesman Nihal Thalduwa said on Saturday.The cases to be reinvestigated include the alleged scam in the issue of Central Bank bonds in 2015 blamed on the then government of Ranil Wickremesinghe , the former president, and the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks that killed over 270 people, including 11 Indians.The catholic church has been demanding stringent action on what they alleged was a politically motivated cover-up by previous governments on the attacks.Among the other cases that are to be investigated are the 2005 murder of Tamil minority community journalist D Sivaram and the 2006 abduction and disappearance of a Tamil minority academic who headed the Eastern University at the time.The 2011 disappearance of two political party activists in the northern capital of Jaffna is also on the list.","Sri Lanka's new government has ordered the police to reinvestigate some high- profile cases.

MACAO : Macao’s former top judge, Sam Hou Fai , was chosen as the Chinese casino hub ’s next leader in a largely ceremonial election on Sunday, setting him up to become the city’s first chief executive born in mainland China.Almost the entire election committee stacked with Beijing loyalists — 394 of 398 — voted for Sam, the sole candidate, in a departure from the long-standing custom of having chief executives who were born in the former Portuguese colony, typically from influential business families.The remaining four were blank votes.The shift in the city’s leadership to someone from the legal profession is likely to create expectations of a declining influence from business circles, which critics have often accused of colluding with officials, analysts say. They anticipate Beijing’s policy agenda for the city will take priority.Sam, 62, is widely seen to have Beijing’s blessings. During the nomination period, he had already secured endorsements from 386 election committee members who voted in batches in a conference hall on Sunday.Influential figures among the 400-strong committee were Shun Tak Holdings’ group executive chairperson Pansy Ho, daughter of late casino tycoon Stanley Ho, lawmaker Angela Leong, one of Ho's widows, and former chief executives Edmund Ho and Fernando Chui.Sam is expected to meet reporters later Sunday.Most of the territory’s 687,000 residents lack voting rights, leading to mixed sentiments about the election. Some hope Sam will heed public opinion and avoid prioritizing business interests, while others feel disconnected from an election process they can’t participate in.Still, political observers said many residents are comfortable with Sam’s non-local origin in a city that has been home to migrants for decades.With Sam’s victory guaranteed, the real challenges await in the governance hurdles that lie ahead.Macao is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Beijing has called for the city to diversify its gambling-reliant economy.Sam has promised to accelerate the current government’s plan to boost tourism and other sectors such as traditional Chinese medicine, finance, exhibitions and commerce. However, the city will still need to rely on the gambling industry for government revenues to support the city's welfare and accomplish other goals laid out by Beijing, analysts say.China wants Macao to develop into a world-class tourism and leisure center and play a bigger role as a bridge for trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.Small local businesses have been hurt by residents who spend money in the neighboring mainland city of Zhuhai, which offers a wider selection of items with good value for money. Chinese tourists are also now spending less than before.It remains to be seen whether Sam, with a lack of government leadership experience, can form a capable cabinet to tackle these pressing issues.Sam was born in neighboring Guangdong province in 1962. He graduated from the prestigious law school of Peking University in Beijing. He also studied the Portuguese language, culture and law at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, and once practiced law in mainland China.When Macao returned to Chinese rule in 1999, Sam was appointed the city’s top judge, a role in which he served for nearly 25 years before resigning in August to participate in the election.He handled some politically sensitive cases, including rejecting an appeal of a police ban on a vigil commemorating China’s bloody 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. His court also upheld a decision to bar pro-democracy figures from running in the 2021 legislative elections.",Sam Hou Fai was chosen as the Chinese casino hub ’s next leader in a largely ceremonial election on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Expressing serious concern over the attack on a Durga Puja mandap at the Tanti Bazar area in Dhaka and the theft at Jeshoreshwari Kali temple at Satkhira, the govt deplored the events, saying these follow a “systematic pattern” of desecration and damage to temples and deities that has been witnessed over several days now.“We call upon the govt of Bangladesh to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities and their places of worship, especially during this auspicious festival time,” the ministry of external affairs said in a statement.Indian govt, in a statement, called upon govt of Bangladesh to ensure safety of all minorites.
