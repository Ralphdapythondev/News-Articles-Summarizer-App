"'Very demure, very mindful' takes center stage as TikTok creator Jools Lebron tries to trademark viral phrase",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/very-demure-very-mindful-takes-center-stage-as-tiktok-creator-jools-lebron-tries-to-trademark-viral-phrase/articleshow/113077149.cms,"TikTok sensation Jools Lebron is making waves with a new move to secure her place in internet history. The creator, known for her catchphrase “very demure, very mindful,” has filed to trademark this now-viral expression, aiming to cover various entertainment and advertising services, including beauty product promotions.The buzz around “very demure, very mindful” began earlier this August when Lebron showcased her unique hair and makeup style on TikTok.Her distinctive delivery and the phrase itself quickly became a social media hit, with fans and celebrities alike jumping on the trend, using “mindful” and “cutesy” to describe everything from daily routines to extravagant events.Lebron’s viral success has not only brought her online fame but also provided financial support for her transition as a transgender woman. The trademark filings, submitted under her legal name, are now pending with the US Patent and Trademark Office. The goal? To safeguard her viral creation and potentially monetize the trend.However, the path to securing a trademark is far from straightforward. Several other parties have jumped into the fray, attempting to trademark demure-related phrases in a bid to capitalize on the trend, according to CBS News. This has sparked a race to claim ownership of the viral moment, with some filings pre-dating Lebron’s official submissions.The complexities of trademark law come into play here. Alexandra J Roberts, a law professor at Northeastern University, noted that trademarks must be tied to commercial use—meaning that it’s not enough to simply create aviral phrase . There must be a connection to the sale of specific goods or services. This requirement ensures that trademarks serve as clear indicators of origin for consumers, preventing confusion, reported CBS.Casey Fiesler, an associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, added that while Lebron’s phrase might be closely associated with her, trademarks are designed to avoid consumer confusion. Thus, if someone else were to start a business with a similar name, it could potentially mislead consumers into thinking it’s linked to Lebron’s brand.In the digital age, protecting intellectual property has become increasingly challenging. Content creators face the dual task of gaining recognition for their work and securing their rights amid a sea of online trends. Historically, creators from minoritized groups, particularly young women of color, have struggled to maintain control over their viral moments, often seeing their work appropriated by others with more resources.As for Lebron, her journey is just beginning. While her trademark filings are under review, she still has room to maneuver. She could negotiate with other applicants or challenge rival filings if they pose a threat to her brand. However, the trademark process can be lengthy, sometimes extending beyond the trend’s peak popularity.For now, Lebron has the freedom to continue promoting her “very demure, very mindful” merchandise. But turning these words into a protected brand will be a test of patience and legal savvy. As she navigates this complex landscape, the internet eagerly watches to see how the “very demure, very mindful” saga unfolds.","Jools Lebron has filed to trademark her now-viral phrase “very demure, very mindful.” The trademark filings, submitted under her legal name, are now pending with the US Patent and Trademark Office.

'Will not leave Gaza border until ...': Netanyahu sets conditions for permanent ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hl-will-not-leave-gaza-border-until-netanyahu-sets-conditions-for-permanent-ceasefire/articleshow/113077998.cms,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday set a condition for a permanent ceasefire , stating that Israel will not leave the Gaza border corridor until the border area between Gaza and Egypt is free from being used for the Islamist movement Hamas .""Until that happens, we're there,"" Netanyahu said in a news conference in Jerusalem.Netanyahu emphasised the need for guarantees that Gaza would be able to prevent becoming a route for smuggling weapons and supplies to Hamas.""Somebody has to be there,"" he said. ""Bring me anyone who will actually show - not on paper, not in words, not on a slide - but day after day, week after week, month after month, that they can actually prevent a recurrence of what happened there before,"" he said, referring to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.""We're open to consider it, but I don't see that happening right now.""Netanyahu’s comments came as the US is developing a new proposal for a cease-fire and hostage release, hoping to stop the 11-month-long war.The Israeli Prime Minister rejected the withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor, which runs along the southern edge of the Gaza Strip bordering Egypt, in the first phase of a deal.The corridor has been a major obstacle in reaching an agreement to halt the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.Netanyahu insisted on retaining control of the corridor, where Israeli troops have discovered numerous tunnels that officials claim have been used to supply Hamas with weapons and ammunition.Addressing a news conference, the Israeli PM also mentioned that Hamas had rejected all elements of a ceasefire proposal in Gaza that would facilitate the release of hostages.""Hamas has rejected everything... I hope that changes because I want those hostages out,"" Netanyahu told a news conference, casting doubt on the possibility of a breakthrough one day after the State Department said it was ""time to finalise that deal"".""We're trying to find some area to begin the negotiations,"" Netanyahu said and added, ""They (Hamas) refuse to do that...

In Georgia, Harris holds a slight edge over Trump, leading 48%-47%. According to the Post, with 35 electoral votes up for grabs in these two states, their outcome could be pivotal in the closely contested race.In the 2020 election, President Biden won Pennsylvania by a slim 1.2% and Georgia by an even narrower 0.23%, highlighting the significance of these states in the upcoming election.The poll also indicates Harris is leading Trump in Michigan (48%-43%) and Wisconsin (50%-44%), with both gaps exceeding the poll’s margin of error. In Michigan, independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who endorsed Trump last month, is drawing 4% support despite his campaign suspension and difficulties removing his name from the ballot.Trump maintains a lead in Arizona, where he garners 49% of likely voter support compared to Harris’ 44%. Meanwhile, Harris has a narrow lead in Nevada, leading Trump 48%-47%.The poll was conducted following the Democratic National Convention, which many saw as Harris' first major opportunity to make an impact. However, the results suggest she has yet to establish a clear advantage over Trump in these key states.The upcoming debate between Harris and Trump, scheduled for September 10 in Philadelphia, represents a crucial opportunity for either candidate to gain ground. The poll also highlights that between 11% and 15% of likely voters across states are still open to changing their vote.Republican groups are preparing to spend over $110 million on advertising in Pennsylvania and Georgia by the end of the year, the highest amount in any battleground state. Trump campaign adviser Brian Hughes expressed confidence in their prospects, stating, “In Pennsylvania and Georgia, we see polling averages showing President Trump leading close races in both. On the ground we feel a strong momentum building for the final stretch. With the GOP unified behind President Trump, and a broadening coalition of Democrats and Independents joining us, it’s clear that we are poised to win these crucial battleground states .”The CNN/SSRS poll sample sizes ranged from 676 likely voters in Arizona to 967 in Wisconsin, with margins of error between 4.4% and 4.9%.","Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are virtually tied in Pennsylvania, each receiving 47% support from likely voters.

Russian lawmakers denounce US sanctions against Russian state media network,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russian-lawmakers-denounce-us-sanctions-against-russian-state-media-network/articleshow/113077789.cms,"MOSCOW: Russian lawmakers denounced as an infringement of freedom of speech US punitive measures against state media group RT as part of what officials in Washington described as a campaign to influence the November presidential election.The US justice department on Wednesday filed money-laundering charges against two employees of Russian state media network RT for what was described as a scheme to hire a US company to produce online content to influence the election.Previous US intelligence assessments have found that Moscow tried to meddle in the 2016 and 2020 elections. Russian officials have suggested that the United States has also meddled in its domestic affairs.The Kremlin and the Russian Foreign Ministry have repeatedly said that Moscow has not meddled in the US election, but is watching it closely.Konstantin Kosachev, Deputy Chairman of Russia's upper house of parliament, told RIA news agency that the US moves were aimed at preventing alternative views from being made known.""Russian media in this sense have become increasingly popular and in demand,"" Kosachev told RIA.""That is the reason behind the rabid reaction of the US authorities, which is totally at odds with the principles of freedom of speech and defending the rights of journalists.""Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the State Duma lower house's foreign affairs committee, branded the sanctions ""a witch-hunt, pressure on freedom of speech and vulgar censorship"".""The agents of the 'empire of lies' are waging war on everyone who tells the truth about the policy of contemporary neo-colonialists,"" said Slutsky.There was no immediate Kremlin reaction to the sanctions.The Kremlin in June dismissed as absurd US intelligence assertions that Russia sought to meddle in the election and has said that US spies were intent on casting Russia as an enemy.President Vladimir Putin had suggested in the past that, for Russia, Joe Biden would have been preferable to Donald Trump, though he spoke with irony about Biden.Ahead of the announcement of the sanctions, Russian lawmaker Maria Butina said any suggestion of meddling in the election was nonsense. Moscow, she said, felt that the only winner of the election would be the US military-industrial complex.""The US claims were and are pure rubbish and a witch hunt,"" Butina, who spent 15 months in US prison for acting as an unregistered Russian agent and is now a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party, told Reuters.""Russia thinks it does not matter who wins the US elections – the only winner is the US private military-industrial complex. That is what matters – and nothing else,"" Butina said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published on Sunday that Russia saw US Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris as a more predictable opponent than Trump, but said there was no prospect of an improvement in relations with Washington anyway.","Russian lawmakers denounce as an infringement of freedom of speech US punitive measures against state media group RT.

"Tim Walz’s distant cousins rock ‘Nebraska Walz’s for Trump’ shirts, stirring family drama",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tim-walzs-distant-cousins-rock-nebraska-walzs-for-trump-shirts-stirring-family-drama-heres-what-is-going-down/articleshow/113077147.cms,"In a striking image, eight smiling individuals flaunt navy blue T-shirts with “Nebraska Walz’s for Trump” and stand beneath a bold “Trump 2024 — Take America Back” sign. Former President Trump, ever the social media enthusiast, reposted the photo on Truth Social, exclaiming, “It is a Great Honor to have your Endorsement. I look forward to meeting you soon!”The photo first appeared on X, shared by Charles Herbster, a former Nebraska gubernatorial candidate who had Trump’s endorsement in 2022.Herbster’s spokesperson, Rod Edwards, confirmed that the people in the photo are indeed related to Tim Walz , according to AP. “The family in the picture are the descendants of Francis Walz, who was the brother of Tim Walz’s grandfather,” Edwards said.In a twist of family drama , the Nebraska Walz clan confirmed their relation to Tim Walz. “Shortly after Governor Tim Walz was named the Democrat Party Vice Presidential nominee, our family had a get-together. We had t-shirts made to show support for President Trump and D Vance and took a group picture. That photo was shared with friends, and when we were asked for permission to post the picture, we agreed,” the written statement said as reported by AP. “The picture is real. The shirts are real. We are the Nebraska Walzs and we are related to Gov. Tim Walz, our grandfathers were brothers.”Sandy Dietrich, Walz’s sister from Alliance, Nebraska, seemed bemused by the attention. “I suspected it might be people from that branch of the family. We weren’t close with them. We didn’t know them,” she said. Dietrich and Walz’s father, James Walz, died of lung cancer in 1984 when the future congressman and Minnesota governor was just a teenager. His father had been the school superintendent in Valentine, Nebraska.Dietrich, a self-described “Democrat for Tim,” kept her focus on her own political choices, saying, “I know who I’m voting for. That’s all I can control.”Adding more spice to the story, Tim Walz’s older brother, Jeff Walz , has publicly aired his grievances. Jeff, now living in Freeport, Florida, has been vocal about his disapproval of his younger brother’s political ideology. The New York Post reported on Jeff’s Facebook comments, where he expressed, “The stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future.” Jeff even considered endorsing Trump himself!Jeff Walz later clarified to NewsNation that his comments were more about childhood memories than political bitterness. Jeff said he and the 60-year-old governor have not spoken since the funeral of their younger brother, Craig Walz, in 2016, aside from a brief phone call last month through their mother. “Nobody wanted to sit with him, because he had car sickness and would always throw up on us, that sort of thing,” Jeff said, adding, “There’s really nothing else hidden behind there. People are assuming something else. There’s other stories like that, but I think that probably gives you the gist of it.”As Tim Walz’s campaign for vice president continues, the viral photo and family squabbles add an extra layer of intrigue to the political landscape","Former President Trump endorsed Nebraska Gov.

A legacy of conservatism, now in question

Who is Liz Cheney?

From Trump ally to fierce critic

Endorsing Harris: A calculated decision

Former Rep. Liz Cheney , once a powerful figure within the Republican Party , made headlines with her unexpected endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris for the upcoming presidential election in US. Cheney, who served as the congresswoman from Wyoming from 2017 to 2023, announced her decision at a Duke University event, citing deep concerns over former President Donald Trump and the future of American democracy.Known for her staunch opposition to former President Donald Trump, Cheney said she would be casting her vote for Harris in November, a move she described as essential to safeguarding the Constitution.""I don't believe we have the luxury of writing in candidates' names, particularly in swing states,"" Cheney told the audience. ""As a conservative and someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.""This marks the first time Cheney has publicly endorsed a candidate in the 2024 race. Despite persistent outreach from the Harris campaign, which has been actively seeking support from Republicans, Cheney had remained silent until now, reported NYT. Her decision to endorse Harris just before the start of early voting was a calculated one, according to sources close to her.Liz Cheney’s roots in the Republican Party run deep. Born in 1966 in Madison, Wisconsin, she is the daughter of Lynne and Dick Cheney, the latter of whom served as Vice President under George W. Bush. Growing up amidst Washington’s political elite, Liz Cheney followed in her father’s footsteps, forging a career in law, government, and eventually politics. Her time in Congress saw her rise to the third-highest position in the House Republican leadership as the chair of the House Republican Conference.Cheney’s political journey took a sharp turn following the 2020 presidential election. Although she had previously aligned with many of Trump’s policies, the aftermath of the election and the January 6th Capitol attack marked a breaking point. Cheney became one of Trump’s most vocal critics, condemning his false claims of a stolen election and voting to impeach him. This stance, while lauded by some, alienated her from the majority of the Republican base and led to her being ousted from her leadership position and eventually losing her seat in the 2022 GOP primary.Despite the backlash, Cheney remained steadfast in her commitment to upholding the Constitution. Her endorsement of Kamala Harris marks a significant departure from traditional Republican politics, driven by what she sees as an existential threat posed by Trump’s continued influence.Cheney’s endorsement is particularly noteworthy given her deep Republican roots and the fact that this is her first public support for a candidate in the 2024 race. Her decision to endorse Harris, just before early voting begins, was a calculated move to ensure her voice would be heard, independent of the noise surrounding the Democratic National Convention.","Former Rep.

The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has called on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to remove Judge Aileen Cannon from overseeing the prominent case against former President Donald Trump concerning classified documents . CREW argues that Cannon has taken steps to ""undermine and derail"" the prosecution of the case.CREW President Noah Bookbinder stated that Judge Cannon has consistently shown ""apparant bias"" in favor of Donald Trump and dismissed the case on unprecedented grounds.CREW President Noah Bookbinder said: “She has at every stage made this case more difficult than the law mandated, and she then dismissed it on largely unprecedented grounds, delivering a significant win to Trump.""CREW’s brief highlights several controversial decisions made by Cannon that have raised concerns about her impartiality. Notably, Cannon recently dismissed the entire documents case, ruling that Special Counsel Jack Smith’s appointment was unlawful. This dismissal contradicted established statutory authority and Supreme Court precedents, prompting Smith to appeal the decision.The watchdog also criticizes Cannon for considering arguments that could undermine the government’s case, including spurious jury instructions that would have weakened the prosecution's position. Additionally, CREW highlights Cannon’s slow progress on the case over the past year, emphasizing her failure to move the proceedings forward in a timely manner.The case revolves around allegations that Trump unlawfully retained classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructed efforts by the FBI to retrieve them. Cannon’s recent dismissal of the case questioned the legitimacy of Smith’s role as special counsel, which has sparked significant legal and political debate, with the elections less than 2 months away.","Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has called on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to remove Judge Aileen Cannon from overseeing the prominent case against former President Donald Trump.

They were protesting against alleged immoral activities in the area, which they claimed were being facilitated by local police and officials. The protesters also forcibly shut down businesses and threatened traders with severe consequences.When police intervened and invoked Section 144 of the CrPC, which bans gatherings, the demonstrators responded with hostility, Dawn state in its report. They attacked police officers with batons and sticks, damaged official vehicles, and used weapons to enforce the closure of business centers.Jamia Hafsa is a conservative madrassa adjacent to the controversial Lal Masjid mosque in Islamabad.The Lal Masjid controversy in Pakistan is a complex and contentious episode that unfolded primarily in 2007, involving a prominent mosque in Islamabad known for its association with Islamist radicalism. The mosque had increasingly become a centre of militant activity and anti-government sentiment, Dawn stated.Per Dawn's report, in response to the mosque's growing defiance and the enforcement of its version of Sharia law in the surrounding areas, the Pakistani government, under President Pervez Musharraf , launched Operation Silence . This military operation aimed to reclaim control from the militants who had fortified themselves within the mosque.The operation, marked by intense fighting and heavy casualties, drew significant criticism from Islamic groups, who condemned the military's tactics and the resultant civilian suffering. The aftermath of the operation exacerbated anti-government sentiment and contributed to the rise of extremist militancy in Pakistan, highlighting the deep-seated tensions between religious extremism, state authority, and public sentiment, Dawn reported.","The charges were filed at the Lohi Bher police station under Section 11-X of the Anti-Terrorism Act and various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Furthermore, 150 people were injured in various incidents, with 88 of them being civilians.The majority of fatalities in Pakistan were attributed to 83 militant attacks , which resulted in the deaths of 175 individuals, including 92 civilians, 47 security personnel, and 36 militants. Additionally, 123 people were injured, with 88 civilians and 35 security personnel among them.

Anti-terror op turns sinister: Pakistani netizens being 'walled off' as army raises spectre of 'digital terrorism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terror-op-turns-sinister-pakistani-netizens-being-walled-off-as-army-raises-spectre-of-digital-terrorism/articleshow/112898501.cms,"Munir's repeated attacks on social media

Imran's ouster & rise of digital activism

National internet firewall

NEW DELHI: Pakistan 's ""whole-of-system approach"" to countering militancy is evolving and may be taking a turn to the sinister as its army's new anti-terror operation ' Azm-e-Istehkam ' (Resolve for Stability) is increasingly focusing on what it calls "" digital terrorism "".Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has over the past few months repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.He described the activities of ""inimical"" forces as a form of ""digital terrorism"" aimed at creating discord between the military and the public by spreading ""lies and fake news"".Launched in June, Azm-e-Istehkam is tackling not only traditional militancy, particularly in light of increasing attacks attributed to groups like the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but the evolving nature of threats in the digital landscape.The shift has sparked widespread concern with some analysts suggesting that the military is carrying out ""prejudiced online surveillance"" and curbing internet speeds across the country to battle the new ""digital threat"".The characterisation of digital terrorism in Munir's speeches have been notably vague, with rights activists noting that the term lacks a clear legal definition and could be weaponised against individuals who express criticism of the military or government policies online.In recent months, Munir has repeatedly voiced ""concerns"" regarding the impact of social media on national security and public discourse.In May -- just months before launching Azm-e-Istehkam -- Munir highlighted the issue of ""negative propaganda"" on social media, asserting that it poses threats to the integrity and security of Pakistan. He emphasised the military's readiness to counter any conspiracies and condemned the spread of disinformation, urging adherence to constitutional limits on freedom of expression, particularly as outlined in Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which restricts incitement to violence and undermining national security.In August, Munir reiterated these concerns, stating that social media is being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"" and warned against campaigns targeting the military. His remarks came in the context of rising tensions and comparisons being drawn to political instability in neighboring countries.On August 14, he again criticised the misuse of social media for spreading chaos and false information, attributing ""digital terrorism"" to foreign elements. He stressed the state's responsibility to protect citizens from the adverse effects of social media-driven hysteria and urged the public to remain vigilant against misinformation.He also warned that social media was being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"". His remarks that ""anarchy is spread through social media"" followed a condemnation by the army of social media campaigns to target the Pakistan Armed Forces.""Just as terrorists use weapons to get their demands met, digital terrorists use negative propaganda and fake news on social media platforms, mobiles and computers to create despondency to get their demands met,"" Pakistani military spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said.Chaudhry said the military had become the sole target of digital terrorists, and blamed a ""certain"" political party without naming ousted PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, which has a formidable social media presence.Imran Khan has repeatedly accused the military for orchestrating his removal from power in April 2022, and specifically named Munir as being responsible for his subsequent arrest in May 2023, claiming the Army chief harboured a ""personal grudge"" against him.Khan also alleged that Munir was behind the crackdown on his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), stating: ""It is personal. It's got nothing to do with national interest"". He also accused Munir of ""dismantling the future of this country [Pakistan] to protect himself"".Khan's arrest led to riots in May where protesters for the first time in the nation's history vented their anger on the military attacking several army installations.Digital activism in Pakistan spiked following Imran's ouster, whose party has relied heavily on social media to coordinate its activities. After TV channels were banned from covering PTI events, Khan gave several speeches online challenging the military's role in politics.These online events were often marred by internet blackouts or slowdown. Though authorities have said the drop in internet speed was due to technical issues, activists have claimed that the army is strategically using a national firewall and manipulating the country's internet infrastructure to curb any dissenting voices on the web.Pakistan has experienced a notable slowdown in internet speeds over the past few months, with reports indicating that up to 40% slower speeds have affected nearly half of the country's 241 million internet users.Users have reported difficulties in sending and receiving messages on platforms like WhatsApp and accessing social media sites, which are crucial for communication and information dissemination, especially among the youth and political activists.Information Technology minister Shiza Fatima Khawaja has confirmed that it was upgrading its ""web management system"" to cope with cybersecurity threats but did not link the development to slower internet speeds.TOI has reported that the Pakistan government tested its firewall on two occasions, once in July and a second time in mid-August. Pakistan has allocated more than $70 million for a Digital Infrastructure Development Initiative in the latest budget.The timing of these frequent slowdowns also coincides with the launch of operation Azm-e-Istehkam, raising questions about whether the internet disruptions are also linked to efforts to control information amid rising political tensions and protests against the military's actions.Technology experts have suggested that the newly implemented internet firewall could provide the government with enhanced capabilities to censor online content, drawing comparisons to China's stringent internet regulations.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.","Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.

Attacks in Balochistan bid to derail SCO summit in October: Pakistan govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/attacks-in-balochistan-bid-to-derail-sco-summit-in-october-pakistan-govt/articleshow/112974277.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A surge in daring militant attacks across Pakistan’s volatile provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has raised questions about the country’s internal security situation . Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.Amid heightened political polarisation in Pakistan, both Baloch separatists and Islamic militants, known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have intensified their attacks on security personnel and their facilities in the country’s southwest and northwest.The Baloch separatists also target people of Punjabi ethnicity in the province.On Aug 26, more than 70 people were killed in targeted killings and suicide bombings in different districts of Balochistan, while in Kulachi tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In a separate incident, a senior army officer, Lt Col Khalid Ameer, and three of his relatives, were kidnapped by TTP fighters when they were meeting people on their father’s death in Dera Ismail Khan. The army’s media wing, however, said on Sunday they have been released due to the role played by tribal elders.When the separatist militant outfit, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), bombed a railway bridge linking Balochistan to the rest of Pakistan, attacked police and military posts, and targeted buses and trucks on a major highway, Pakistan’s Army chief General Asim Munir was meeting General Li Qiaoming, Commander of the People’s Liberation Army, in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. The bombings and shootings on August 25-26 were the deadliest in years in Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.Former Balochistan chief minister, Abdul Malik Baloch, said disappointment is pushing people into insurgency. “Many Baloch are losing faith in Islamabad because of what they perceive to be its political intervention in the province. Political activists tell me that democracy here is a fraud. They feel we are wasting their time,” Baloch said.BLA’s coordinated attacks in Balochistan on Aug 25–26 demonstrated their growing strength. It is believed that US military hardware and weaponry have found their way into the hands of Pakistani militant organisations. Military equipment and weapons, worth billions of dollars, were left behind by the US and international forces following their withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. BLA’s acquisition of modern weapons, security experts believe, has enhanced its combat capabilities.Majority of BLA’s sophisticated strikes are thought to have been executed by the group’s suicide squad, known as Majeed Brigade.Islamabad blames Kabul for patronising Baloch separatists and the TTP.

Moreover, a brief knowledge about sanitation, nutrition and feeding habits among women and children should form the core focus of government-driven campaigns and policies.It is impossible to attain even a minimal reduction in undernutrition and malnutrition indicators without consistent funding and healthcare system improvements to close the wealth and poverty divides between rich and poor communities, as well as between rural and urban areas, Dawn stated citing the opinion piece.Earlier this month, the Pakistan government and the IMF staff concluded the ninth review of the $6.5 billion bailout package without a staff-level agreement. The Pakistan government had hoped that they would be able to convince the IMF about implementing the conditions in a gradual manner.However, Islamabad's hopes were dashed during the IMF mission's 10-day visit to Pakistan.","Pakistan's lawmakers cannot escape the fact that malnutrition is a major socioeconomic determinant of maternal health, gender empowerment, child marriage and education. 4 out of 10 children under five years of age are stunted, 17.7 per cent suffer from wasting, 28.9 per cent are underweight and 9.5 per cent in same age bracket are overweight.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112967135,imgsize-23132,width-400,resizemode-4/112967135.jpg"

The university deemed the degree invalid , claiming that they issue only one enrolment number per degree programme, making it impossible for a candidate to have multiple enrolment numbers, Dawn reported.Jahangiri had earlier complained to the Supreme Judicial Council about the Chief Justice and said that the Inter-Services Intelligence interfered in judicial affairs.

The coordinated strikes, perhaps more widespread than any such assault in the past, by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army ( BLA ), have again foregrounded Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources as the soft underbelly of Pakistan.The attacks, which saw BLA targeting police stations and taking control of major highways, coincided with the death anniversary of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, who was killed 18 years ago in one of then president Pervez Musharraf's counter-insurgency operations.","Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources.

It was a major gain for India as this completed fence infrastructure will further strengthen security along the India-Bangladesh boundary,"" said an officer who was part of these deliberations.The BSF guards the 4,096-km-long international Indian front with Bangladesh on the country's eastern side.While the sources said the forthcoming meeting will be held on the traditional issues and subjects related to ""comprehensive"" border management, curbing of cross-border crimes, mutual coordination in sharing of real-time intelligence along the front and the recent developments in Bangladesh ""may guide the contours"" of the meeting.India's BSF and Bangladesh's BGB have been sharing a ""great camaraderie and friendship"" for decades now and both sides are expected to deepen this bond.Since the recent crisis, when Sheikh Hasina's government fell and she had to hurriedly leave her country, the coordination between both forces has been excellent, the sources said.""Things were a little jittery for some time at the border after the August 5 developments but the BGB has been coordinating and cooperating well with the BSF to address and defuse incidents of infiltration or any other crime at this front,"" a senior officer said.The directions to the BSF are that they will ensure there is no illegal infiltration into India in the aftermath of the fall of the Hasina government and the protests and violence surrounding the development, another officer said.The BSF has asked its ground commanders to continue the policy of using non-lethal weapons (pump-action guns) first to check border crimes like cattle and goods smuggling.The troops have been asked to use lethal weapons only under grave or extreme threat to their lives while on duty or civilians, the other officer said.Five Indian nationals, who strayed into Bangladesh territory onboard their boats, have not been handed over to India despite a request in this regard. They have now been sent to jail. The incident took place weeks after the August 5 turmoil in the neighbouring country.These men were operating boats to check cattle smuggling on the directions of the BSF along the international border in West Bengal, the officer said.The proposed talks are expected to take into account all the developments that are taking place along the front after the Bangladesh crisis, he said.The scheduled time frame for these talks to be held in Delhi is for September-October but the meeting may also be postponed if top-level changes take place in the BGB and the home ministry of Bangladesh. The Indian side will extend all courtesies and welcome them like always, the first officer said.The DG-level border talks were held annually between 1975 and 1992 but they were made bi-annual in 1993 with either side alternately travelling to New Delhi and Dhaka.Over 230 people were killed in Bangladesh in the incidents of violence that erupted across the country following the fall of the Hasina government, taking the death toll to more than 600 since the massive protest by students.An interim government led by 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus is in charge of the country now.","Bangladesh may arrive in India next month for the traditional bi-annual border talks with their New Delhi counterparts. The talks between the two sides, led by the BSF director general (DG) and the DG of the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), will be the first meeting of senior officials.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113067813,imgsize-898169,width-400,resizemode-4/113067813.jpg"
Bangladesh Protests: Bangladesh launches drive to recover looted weapons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-launches-drive-to-recover-looted-weapons/articleshow/113059000.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladeshi security forces have launched an operation to recover thousands of guns, including those seized during deadly unrest that led to the ouster of autocratic leader Sheikh Hasina , police said on Wednesday.Weeks of student-led demonstrations escalated into mass protests, with Hasina fleeing by helicopter to neighbouring India on August 5 after 15 years in power.Police had tried to stem the protests with gunfire but protesters responded by storming and looting police stations, when weapons were seized.Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is now leading an interim government after Hasina's fall.More than 3,700 weapons of different types had been recovered during an amnesty to surrender guns that ended on Tuesday.However, more than 2,000 weapons, including rifles, are missing, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition and hundreds of tear gas canisters and stun grenades.""Those arms which have not been submitted to the police stations within the deadline... the looted arms will be considered illegal,"" senior police official Enamul Haque Sagor told AFP.The army and police, as well as other security force units including the paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and Ansar forces, are taking part in the weapons sweep.Two former top police officers have also been detained in connection to the violent suppression of the protests and have been placed on remand, Dhaka deputy police commissioner Obaidur Rahman said.Both men face accusations of murder, although formal charges have not yet been made.They include former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun, who quit a day after Hasina fled and has been taken into custody, Dhaka Metropolitan Police said in a statement late on Tuesday.Police said he had ""expressed his willingness to surrender -- due to a case against him -- while he was under army custody"".He was placed under remand for eight days on Wednesday, Rahman said.Another top officer, AKM Shahidul Haque, who had been police chief from 2014 to 2018, was detained on Tuesday and placed on remand for seven days, Rahman said.More than 600 people were killed in the weeks leading up to Hasina's ouster, according to the preliminary report of a United Nations rights team that said the toll was ""likely an underestimate"".Many of those killed were hit by police fire.","More than 3,700 weapons recovered during amnesty to surrender guns that ended on Tuesday.
