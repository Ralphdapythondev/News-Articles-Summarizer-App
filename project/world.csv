Israel-Iran tensions may send fares of Europe flights soaring,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-iran-tensions-may-send-fares-of-europe-flights-soaring/articleshow/109277035.cms,"NEW DELHI: Your flying time to and from Europe and UK will increase by anywhere upto an hour, likely sending airfares northward too.Air India , Vistara and foreign airlines have started avoiding overflying Iranian airspace due to the looming threat of Iran attacking Israel , which US President Joe Biden expects may happen ""sooner than later"". IndiGo, whose daily service between Mumbai/Delhi and Istanbul is operated on Turkish Airlines wet-lease aircraft, is also taking an alternative route.AI's Delhi-Tel Aviv flight operated Saturday and the airline is watching the station to decide in real-time whether to continue the four-times-a-week flight, say sources.AI had suspended this route after the Oct 7 attack on Israel and resumed them on March 3. India advised its citizens on Friday not to travel to Iran or Israel till further notice.Air India Flight 161, for instance, took off from Delhi at 4.30 am on Saturday but did not overfly Iran; instead, it took another route to London - instead of the usual India-Pakistan-Iran-Turkey-Black Sea route to Europe, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner followed a northern flight path. Thanks to AI still overflying Russia, this option is available to the airline for flights between Europe/UK and its main bases of Delhi and Mumbai. AI 161 had overflown Iran on Friday.An Air India spokesperson said: ""We are closely monitoring the developing situation in the Middle East. Presently, our aircraft will operate on alternate flight paths to and from India - according top priority to the safety of our passengers and crew.""Lufthansa's Frankfurt-Mumbai Friday flight took the Greece-Mediterranean Sea-Saudi Arabia-Persian Gulf-Arabian Sea route to Mumbai. Earlier it would take the Black Sea-Iran-Pakistan route to Mumbai. A spokesperson for German carrier told TOI: ""We have temporarily stopped overflying Iranian airspace till April 18. Security is our number one priority.""A Vistara spokesperson said: ""Due to the current situation affecting parts of the Middle East, we are making changes to flight paths of some of our flights. Contingency routes, which are kept available to ensure operational continuity during such eventualities, are being used instead. This may result in longer flight times on certain routes and associated delays. The situation is being monitored closely and further changes will be made if required."" Vistara operates between Delhi/Mumbai and London, Frankfurt and Paris.Increased geopolitical tensions have added to no-fly zones. Commercial airliners avoid Afghanistan ever since the country was taken over by the Taliban; Russia's war in Ukraine has made both the countries no-overflying zones for most Western airlines; US carriers have been avoiding Iran for some time now. The conflict zone lies on the crucial West-East route.","Air India, Vistara and foreign airlines have started avoiding overflying Iranian airspace.

Together we will win,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a tweet on Social media platform X, formerly Twitter.Hamas called the Iranian attack a ""natural right"".Iranian threat had led to worldwide diplomatic initiatives to thwart a possible further conflagration in the region already struggling with Israel's offensive in Gaza following a terror attack carried out by Hamas in its territory on October 7 and also regular exchange of fire between the Jewish state and Lebanese Shia faction Hezbollah, which joined the war in solidarity with Hamas.Houthis, considered Iran's proxy in Yemen, and other factions seen as close to Tehran have also from time to time carried out attacks against Israel and assets of other countries that seem to be supportive of the Jewish state, disrupting international waters and global trade routes.Some analysts believe that the United States, preparing for elections, will not be supportive of an Israeli retaliation as it can shake up the oil market and cause further economic turmoil that can adversely impact President Joe Biden's re-election bid.","Iran launched 330 missiles and drones on Israel on Saturday in retaliation to an alleged attack by Israel on a diplomatic installation of the Islamic Republic in Damascus.

Beyond Ukraine: How Russia is trying to extend its geopolitical reach across the globe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/beyond-ukraine-how-russia-is-trying-to-extend-its-geopolitical-reach-across-the-globe/articleshow/109290939.cms,"NEW DELHI: Even as the conflict in Ukraine continues, Russia is actively expanding its destabilizing campaigns globally, employing unconventional warfare tactics to assert its influence and challenge its adversaries.A recent report from Britain's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) outlines the multifaceted approach Russia is taking to extend its geopolitical reach, which includes covert operations in Europe, the deployment of mercenaries across Africa, and outreach to Muslim communities in Central Asia and Europe.The RUSI report illuminates the dual nature of Russia's military strategy. ""It is the conventional threat of escalation that deters retaliation against unconventional activity, thereby expanding the scope of what Russia can get away with,"" the report states. This strategy not only focuses on direct military engagements, as seen in Ukraine, but also on ""gray zone"" warfare, which includes a range of covert and indirect methods to destabilize regions and divert international attention and resources, a report in Insider said.According to RUSI, destabilizing Africa and shifting Western focus is deemed by the Kremlin as a strategic move that will ease its military campaigns in Ukraine. The tools of Russian influence extend to fostering political polarization, manipulating social factions, and potentially resorting to violence to escalate crises to the point of destabilization, the Insider report said.Historical attempts by Russian intelligence to influence political outcomes include the failed coup in Montenegro in 2016, intended to prevent the country from joining Nato, and efforts in 2022 to incite protests in Moldova. These actions illustrate Russia's long-standing tactic of attempting to sway political dynamics in favor of pro-Russian sentiments.Despite these ambitious efforts, Russia's track record has been checkered with failures, attributed to poor operational security and an overestimation of their influence within target countries. This has led to the exposure and disruption of their plans by domestic security services.In response to setbacks, Russia has reportedly revamped its unconventional warfare capabilities, now leveraging the Russian mafia and foreign students in Russia to build a support network for its agents in Europe. This shift comes as Russia seeks to create crises beyond its borders, particularly in the Balkans, where it sees opportunities to disrupt Western influence.In Africa and the Middle East, Russia’s state-sponsored mercenaries, notably from groups like Wagner, have been active in supporting dictators and warlords, furthering Moscow's interests against rival factions and Islamic rebels. Following the death of Wagner Group ’s leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, Russia has continued to offer what RUSI describes as a "" regime survival package "" to its clients, deepening their dependency on Russian support.RUSI's analysis suggests that while countering Russian disinformation is crucial, more significant is disrupting Russia's ability to manipulate political elites and its logistical support for these operations. This requires a strategic, intelligence-driven approach to avoid the pitfalls of overreaction and maintain a focus on concrete threats rather than speculative dangers, the Inside report said.","Russia is expanding its destabilizing campaigns globally, employing unconventional warfare tactics to assert its influence.

Is China recruiting 'sleeper cell' military members in the Philippines?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/is-china-recruiting-sleeper-cell-military-members-in-the-philippines/articleshow/109290936.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a revelation that has raised eyebrows and concerns, General Romeo Brawner , military chief of the Philippines, disclosed information regarding past and current Filipino military officers , including some generals, being approached to support China's territorial claims in the South China Sea . This assertion adds a new layer of intrigue to the ongoing territorial disputes in the region, notably within the area referred to as the West Philippine Sea by Manila, which lies within its exclusive economic zone.According to military intelligence reports highlighted by Brawner, there have been efforts by China to recruit Filipinos with military backgrounds to conduct espionage activities in the West Philippine Sea.The recruitment website implicated in these efforts was traced back to China, as reported by the Philippine Inquirer, stirring further investigation into these claims. Brawner mentioned that the verification of this information is ongoing, a South China Morning Post report said.The allegations have come under intensified scrutiny following queries from a Philippine senator regarding the issuance of special resident retiree visas to Chinese nationals of military age by the Philippine Retirement Authority. With Chinese nationals constituting 30,000 of the 78,000 foreign retirees holding special visas in the Philippines, the situation has prompted calls for a deeper examination of the matter.Sherwin Ona, a political analyst and associate professor at De La Salle University in the Philippines, expressed concern over the seriousness of these allegations, pointing out the potential risks to national security and the possible erosion of trust between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and its regional allies.In the wake of these allegations, military spokeswoman Colonel Francel Margareth Padilla announced that the website allegedly used for recruitment had been deactivated. The military, along with other government agencies, is currently investigating who was behind these efforts and whether any sensitive information was compromised.The revelation has sparked dialogue among security analysts, with retired US Air Force officer Ray Powell acknowledging the global scope of espionage activities, including those conducted by China. Meanwhile, Rommel Banlaoi, director of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence, and Terrorism Research, emphasized the need for actionable intelligence to substantiate the suspicions and guide further action.The disclosure comes amid a backdrop of heightened tensions in the South China Sea, with recent joint naval and air exercises conducted by the Philippines, the US, Australia, and Japan. These developments, along with the upcoming annual Balikatan joint military exercises between the US and the Philippines, underscore the strategic significance of the region and the complex dynamics at play.Banlaoi cautioned against the escalation of military actions, advocating for non-military means of dispute resolution to avoid exacerbating tensions and risking armed conflict in the South China Sea.As the situation unfolds, the international community remains watchful of the impact these developments may have on regional stability and the broader geopolitical landscape in the Asia-Pacific.",General Romeo Brawner disclosed information regarding past and current Filipino military officers being approached to support China's territorial claims in the South China Sea.

NEW DELHI: Israel foreign ministry issued a harshly worded rebuke of new Ireland Prime Minister Simon Harris, claiming that he referred to the war in Gaza in his first public speech but left out the mention of October 7 Hamas attack.""Even after the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, and even after the war crimes of the Hamas terrorists, there are those in Ireland who insist on being on the wrong side of history,"" said the ministry.The ministry also claimed that Harris aligns with Irish foreign minister Martin, who plans to provide further support to terrorism by issuing a legal opinion alongside 'legal arm of Hamas' South Africa.Israel's foreign ministry affirmed that the nation will continue to protect its citizens according to international law and persist in its efforts to secure the release of the 133 Israelis held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for the past six months, as well as to dismantle 'terrorist organisation Hamas so that October 7th never happens again.'The Irish government dismissed criticism from the Israeli foreign ministry regarding Harris' inaugural speech, saying that the Taoiseach has consistently maintained an impartial stance when addressing the conflict, including denouncing the abduction of the hostages and demanding their release.According to The Irish Times, Harris' spokesperson stated, ""By any fair analysis Ireland has always condemned the atrocity Hamas committed on October 7th and called for hostages to be released. The Taoiseach has repeatedly said it.""In his brief remarks about Gaza during his first speech as Taoiseach on Tuesday, Harris reportedly condemned the Hamas attack on October 7th, which claimed approximately 1,170 lives but also denounced Israel's disproportionate military response, which has resulted in over 33,000 fatalities.Harris in his speech said, ""In Gaza, we are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe and seeing innocent children, women and men being starved and slaughtered.

Fallout from Trump's bid to overturn election loss heads to Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fallout-from-trumps-bid-to-overturn-election-loss-heads-to-supreme-court/articleshow/109287527.cms,"IMMUNITY CLAIM

WASHINGTON: The actions of Donald Trump and his supporters following his 2020 election loss top the U.S. Supreme Court 's agenda in the next two weeks in cases involving his bid to avoid prosecution for trying to undo his defeat and an attempt by a man indicted in the Capitol attack to escape a charge that Trump also faces.The two cases assume even greater prominence as Trump campaigns to return to the White House as the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov.5 U.S. election.The justices on Tuesday hear arguments in an appeal by Joseph Fischer, who was indicted on seven charges following the Jan. 6 , 2021, Capitol riot including corruptly obstructing an official proceeding - congressional certification of Biden's victory over Trump. They then hear arguments on April 25 in Trump's assertion of presidential immunity from prosecution.""The court has not yet directly addressed issues related to Jan. 6,"" said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. ""But Fischer and Trump so clearly raise issues arising from Jan. 6.""Trump took numerous steps to try to reverse his 2020 loss. His false claims of widespread voting fraud helped fuel the attack on the Capitol as Congress met to certify Biden's victory. Trump and his allies also devised a plan to use false electors from key states to thwart certification.Federal prosecutors brought obstruction charges against about 350 of the roughly 1,400 people charged in the Capitol attack including Fischer and Trump. A Supreme Court ruling dismissing the charge against Fischer could make it more complicated - but not impossible - to make the charge stick against Trump, according to experts. The charge carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, though Jan. 6 defendants convicted of obstruction have received far lesser sentences.This is one of four criminal cases against Trump, whose first trial gets underway on Monday in New York on charges involving hush money paid to a porn star. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and called them politically motivated.The Supreme Court on March 4 reversed a ruling by Colorado's top court to exclude Trump from the state's ballot under a constitutional provision involving insurrection. But the justices did not address the lower court's finding that Trump had created ""an atmosphere of political violence"" before the Jan. 6 attack and ""engaged in insurrection.""Until Trump, no former president had faced criminal charges.Trump has asserted that he has ""absolute immunity"" because he was serving as president when he took the actions that triggered Smith's election subversion indictment. Smith has urged the Supreme Court to reject that claim on the principle that ""no person is above the law.""In August 2023, Smith brought four federal criminal counts against Trump in the election subversion case: conspiring to defraud the United States, corruptly obstructing an official proceeding and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against the right of Americans to vote.Fischer is awaiting trial on six criminal counts, including assaulting or impeding officers and civil disorder, while he challenges his obstruction charge at the Supreme Court.According to prosecutors, Fischer charged at police officers guarding a Capitol entrance during the attack. Fischer, at the time a member of the North Cornwall Township police in Pennsylvania, got inside and pressed up against an officer's riot shield as police attempted to clear rioters. He remained in the building for four minutes before police pushed him out.U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, dismissed Fischer's obstruction charge, ruling that it applies only to defendants who tampered with evidence. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed that decision, ruling that the law broadly covers ""all forms of corrupt obstruction of an official proceeding.""A Supreme Court decision favoring Fischer could mean that hundreds of other defendants who faced the same charge could seek to be re-sentenced, withdraw their guilty pleas or request new trials.""It may not make a lot of practical difference in most cases because if defendants were convicted of multiple charges the judge might decide not to alter the sentence even if the obstruction charge is gone,"" said Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at the George Washington University Law School.About two-thirds of the Jan. 6 defendants charged with obstruction also were charged with other felonies.Eliason said that a win for Fischer might not deter Smith from pursuing the obstruction charges against Trump, despite the higher bar that the Supreme Court might set.""The charges against Trump can probably survive because Smith will be able to argue that his case did involve evidence-based obstruction, based on the slates of phony electors,"" Eliason said.Legal experts have said the Supreme Court would need to rule by about June 1 for Trump's trial on the election-related charges to finish before Nov. 5. If Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself of any federal crimes. Trump has pledged to pardon Jan. 6 defendants.",U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases involving Donald Trump and his supporters following his 2020 election loss. The cases involve his bid to avoid prosecution for trying to undo his defeat and an attempt by a man indicted in the Capitol attack to escape a charge that Trump also faces. The two cases assume even greater prominence as Trump campaigns to return to the White House as the Republican candidate.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109287551,imgsize-41032,width-400,resizemode-4/109287551.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Amidst a horrifying stabbing spree that killed six people at a bustling shopping center in Sydney, an Indian-origin couple took refuge in a backroom, fortifying themselves with cardboard boxes alongside numerous others.Shoi Ghoshal , a resident of Sydney, recounted her and her husband Debashis Chakrabarty 's experience at the Westfield shopping center in Bondi Junction as the violence erupted, PTI reported citing BBC.Ghoshal, aged 36, described the moment they realized something was amiss while inside a store. ""We went into a backroom, a storeroom, and used boxes to barricade ourselves in,"" she explained, mentioning there were approximately 20 to 25 individuals seeking shelter.During their ordeal, Ghoshal recalled the distress of an elderly woman crying for her husband outside. Despite the chaos, the group managed to contact the authorities, who instructed them to remain calm and stay put.After being evacuated through the mall's emergency exit, they were met with a scene of police activity. Ghoshal expressed gratitude for their safety and extended condolences to those affected by the tragedy.Police confirmed the deaths of four women and one man at the scene, with another woman succumbing to her injuries in hospital. Eight individuals, including a nine-month-old infant undergoing surgery, are receiving treatment for injuries sustained in the attack.Authorities identified the suspect as a 40-year-old man, though formal identification is pending, and motives remain unclear.The assailant initially entered the shopping center around 3:10 PM local time before leaving briefly and returning to carry out the attacks, according to reports.Authorities believe the suspect acted alone and assured the public that there is no ongoing threat.An eyewitness described the police officer shooting the attacker to state broadcaster ABC.""If she did not shoot him, he would have kept going, he was on the rampage,"" said the man, who did not give his name. ""She went over and was giving him CPR. He had a nice big blade on him.

Named ""Tiantong,"" which translates to ""connecting with heaven,"" the initiative draws inspiration from the biblical story of the Tower of Babel, aiming to bridge communication gaps rather than create them.The Tiantong-1 satellite series, which began with its first launch on August 6, 2016, now includes three satellites in a geosynchronous orbit at 36,000km, covering the entire Asia-Pacific region.This breakthrough came to fruition when Huawei Technologies released the world’s first smartphone supporting satellite calls in September of the previous year, leading the way for other manufacturers like Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo to follow suit, a South China Morning Post report said.These technological advancements have proven invaluable, particularly in emergency situations where traditional communication networks are compromised. For instance, during the 6.2-magnitude earthquake in Gansu province on December 18, affected individuals could maintain contact with the outside world thanks to the satellite call function available on their smartphones.“Direct satellite connectivity for mobile phones has become a new development trend, and satellite communication will gradually become popular among the general public,” noted a team led by Cui Wanzhao from the China Academy of Space Technology. Their work, detailed in the Aerospace Science and Technology journal, highlights the overcoming of significant technical challenges related to passive intermodulation (PIM), which can degrade the quality of satellite calls.By addressing the PIM issue, the team has enabled exceptionally sensitive reception capabilities in the Tiantong satellites, allowing them to pick up signals from standard smartphones without the need for external antennas. This capability is critical, especially given the satellites' exposure to extreme temperature variations and their operation across multiple frequency bands.The idea for such a satellite came about after 2008, when Sichuan, a province in southwestern China, was struck by a devastating magnitude-8 earthquake, resulting in the tragic loss of over 80,000 lives.What made the situation far worse back then was the communication breakdowns in affected areas, which in turn severely hindered rescue operations, thus compounding the crisis.In response to this disaster, the Chinese government started the Tiantong Project, a satellite communication system. The purpose of the satellite is to provide universal access to communication services irrespective of socio-economic status.China's advancements in this field are securing its position as a leader in satellite communication technology globally, heralding a new era where geographic isolation no longer equates to communication isolation.","Chinese scientists have developed the world's first satellite capable of enabling smartphone calls directly.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: After an airstrike on its Damascus consulate, which resulted in the deaths of 16 people including a senior Quds Force commander, Iran has vowed retaliation against Israel , the alleged perpetrator. As tensions rise, the nature of Iran's response could significantly influence regional stability.Israel did not claim responsibility for the airstrike on April 1.But Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Israel ""must be punished and shall be"" for an operation he said was equivalent to an attack on Iranian soil.Meanwhile, during a press briefing on Friday, US President Joe Biden expressed his expectation of an imminent attack by Iran on Israel, cautioning Tehran against such actions. Responding to journalists' inquiries about his stance on Iran, Biden's message was concise yet firm. ""Don't,"" he advised Tehran, signaling a stern warning.Highlighting the United States' unwavering support for Israel, Biden reaffirmed the commitment to its defense. ""We are devoted to the defense of Israel. We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed,"" he asserted. This statement emphasizes the strong alliance between the United States and Israel and the US government's readiness to support Israel in the face of potential threats.In response to the volatile situation, several countries have issued travel advisories. Nations such as India, France, Poland, and Russia have cautioned their citizens against traveling to the region. Further emphasizing the seriousness of the situation, Germany urged its citizens on Friday to depart from Iran, indicating growing international concerns over safety in the area.According to reports, an individual with insights from the Iranian leadership revealed that although discussions about a potential attack are ongoing, a definitive decision has yet to be made.Utilizing its arsenal, Iran could launch missile or armed drone strikes against Israeli military sites or infrastructure. This approach would be a direct and visible form of retaliation but would also significantly raise the stakes, potentially drawing regional and international responses.Iran might target Israeli or even US diplomatic missions outside the region. This method would risk involving third countries and escalate tensions on an international scale.Iran might escalate its indirect conflict against Israel by activating its network of allied militant groups across the region. This includes Hezbollah in Lebanon, various militias in Syria, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. These groups could increase their attacks against Israeli interests, offering Iran plausible deniability and minimizing direct engagement.Iran has increasingly invested in its cyber capabilities. It could choose to disrupt Israeli critical infrastructure through cyber means, which could be seen as a less bloody form of retaliation but equally disruptive.Iran could leverage its influence to incite uprisings against Israeli control in Palestinian territories, hoping to destabilize internal Israeli security dynamics without direct military engagement.The United States is sending additional assets to the region to enhance regional deterrence efforts and increase force protection for US forces, according to a US defence official in Washington. The US already maintains a significant military presence in the Middle East and provides substantial military assistance to Israel.Following Iran's threats of retaliation, Israel has strengthened its air defences and suspended leave for combat units. US President Joe Biden dispatched General Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command, to Israel for discussions. After meeting with Kurilla on Friday, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant emphasized the strong bond between Israel and the United States.""Our enemies think that they can pull apart Israel and the United States, but the opposite is true -- they are bringing us together and strengthening our ties,"" Gallant said.","Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Israel ""must be punished and shall be"" for an operation he said was equivalent to an attack on Iranian soil.

They were 62.The twins, listed by Guinness World Records as the oldest living conjoined twins, died April 7 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, according to obituaries posted by Leibensperger Funeral Homes of Hamburg.The cause of death was not detailed.""When we were born, the doctors didn't think we'd make 30, but we proved them wrong,"" Lori said in an interview when they turned 50, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. George came out as transgender in 2007.The twins, born Sept. 18, 1961, in West Reading, Pennsylvania, had distinct brains but were joined at the skull. George, who had spina bifida and was 4 inches shorter, was wheeled around by Lori on an adaptive wheeled stool. Despite each having to go where the other went, it was ""very important"" to both ""to live as independently as possible,"" the obituary said.Both graduated from a public high school and took college classes. George went along for six years as Lori worked in a hospital laundry. Lori - ""a trophy-winning bowler,"" according to the obituary notice - gave up the job in 1996 so her sibling could launch a country music career.""Since the age of 24, they have maintained their own residence and have traveled extensively,"" the obituary notice said. Over the years, they appeared in many documentaries and talk shows, as well as in an episode of the FX medical drama ""Nip/Tuck.""The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Lori was once engaged to be married but that her fiance died in an automobile accident.""When I went on dates,"" Lori said, ""George would bring along books to read.""The twins said in a 1997 documentary that they had different bathing schedules and showered one at a time. George spoke of giving someone you love and respect ""the privacy and compromise in situations that you would want them to give you."" Lori said compromise meant ""you don't get everything you want right when you want it.""Conjoined twins occur once in every 50,000 to 60,000 births when identical twins from a single embryo fail to separate. About 70% are female, and most are stillborn. Only a small percentage are joined at the head, with nearly three-quarters joined at the chest and others at the abdomen or pelvis.Separation was deemed risky for the Schappell twins, but Lori Schappell told The Associated Press in a 2002 interview at the twins' apartment in a high-rise seniors complex that she didn't think such an operation was necessary in any case.""You don't mess with what God made, even if it means you enjoy both children for a shorter time,"" she said. In the 1997 documentary, George also strongly ruled out the idea of separation, saying, ""Why fix what is not broken?""It isn't immediately clear who will now take the title of oldest living conjoined twins. The oldest ever documented were Ronnie and Donnie Galyon, who died in 2020 at age 68. Eng and Chang Bunker, the 19th century ""Siamese Twins"" who gained fame as a circus act, lived to be 63.The Schappell twins' survivors include their father and six siblings.

'Shift in the wind: Major change in Americans’ political leanings ahead of 2024 presidential elections',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shift-in-the-wind-major-change-in-americans-political-leanings-ahead-of-2024-presidential-elections/articleshow/109274835.cms,"A new survey from the Pew Research Center shows a notable shift in voter party identification as the United States heads into the 2024 presidential election, highlighting one of the most evenly split electorates in recent decades.According to the Pew analysis, the American political landscape has seen significant changes since 1996. In 1994, 51% of Americans identified with the Republican Party, with 47% siding with the Democrats.This balance shifted by 2020, where Democrats held a 5% lead over Republicans. However, the latest 2023 data indicates a nearly balanced field, with 49% of voters identifying as Democrats or leaning Democratic and 48% as Republicans or leaning Republican.The study also revealed demographic shifts . Around 33% of respondents in 2023 identified as conservative or moderate, compared to 23% who identified as liberal Democrats or leaning liberal. Despite maintaining dominance among Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters, Democratic support among non-Hispanic White voters has declined from 77% in 1996 to 56% in 2023. Meanwhile, Republican support among Hispanic voters has notably increased, tripling from 3% to 9% over the past two decades, a Fox News report said.Polls also indicate that Democratic support among minority voters is decreasing. A recent Gallup poll highlighted that 19% of Black adults now identify as lean Republican or Republican, the lowest percentage recorded by Gallup since 1999, while 66% identify as Democrats or lean Democratic.The shift extends to age demographics as well, with Democrats predominantly preferred by younger voters and Republicans more favored by older voters. Geographically, rural voters have shown increased support for the GOP, with the party holding a 25-point advantage over Democrats, up significantly from an even split in 2008.This evolving voter landscape sets the stage for a competitive rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump in November. While Biden secured a win in the 2020 election, the shifting political affiliations reflected in Pew's data suggest a potentially different outcome in the upcoming election.","In 1994, 51% of Americans identified with the Republican Party, with 47% siding with the Democrats.

We struggle with these basic things that 20, 30 years ago weren't really a concern,"" he told AFP while on the campaign trial.""When I looked at American politics, I didn't feel like it was an accurate representation of not just me as an individual, but as America as a whole.""You cannot tell me that those two are the best that we can do.""Ebey, a middle-school math teacher, has policies on education, crime, health care and tax, but says he was really looking for a way to show the need ""to hit reset on American politics.""So he legally changed his name in court, and is collecting signatures in a longshot bid to get himself on the ballot.Last weekend, he arrived at a park in downtown Dallas, set up his table and diligently arranged pens and paper to gather signatures.Wearing a T-shirt promoting his campaign, he brandished his driver's licence to prove his name change is for real.Some people eye him with curiosity, others laugh and take photos. He tries to address them, though he's not always lucky.Once in a while, he converts an instant fan.""He's just a voice to say 'Yeah! We want anyone else besides these two.'

That's my take.""Vincent James, 68, retired, was more downbeat, saying ""I appreciate what he's doing but I don't think it's going be very effective.""In Texas, it takes more than 113,000 signatures from voters who have not taken part in party primaries to add a candidate to the presidential ballot.If he doesn't make the cut in Texas or elsewhere, it won't be for lack of trying. And there is a Plan B.Many US states let voters write the name of the person they want to elect onto the paper ballot.Then, conceivably, it is on to victory, the inauguration, and life in the White House.","Dustin Ebey legally changed his name to express his frustration over the 2024 White House rematch between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

NEW DELHI: Women and children in Pakistan belonging to religious minority communities are vulnerable to forced religious conversion and marriage, sexual violence and trafficking, the UN experts said on Thursday.The statement further called upon the Pakistani authorities to treat women including those belonging to ""Hindu and Christian"" communities without discrimination.“All women and girls must be treated without discrimination, including those belonging to the Christian and Hindu communities, or indeed other religions and beliefs,” they added.""Christian and Hindu girls remain particularly vulnerable to forced religious conversion, abduction, trafficking, child, early and forced marriage, domestic servitude and sexual violence"", the experts said in a statement.“The exposure of young women and girls belonging to religious minority communities to such heinous human rights violations and the impunity of such crimes can no longer be tolerated or justified,” the statement read.Taking on the religious laws that justify some of these crimes, the statement said, “Perpetrators often escape accountability, with police dismissing crimes under the guise of ‘love marriages’.”Stressing on the importance of a woman's right to choose, the UN experts said that child, early, and forced marriages cannot be justified on religious or cultural basis.“A woman’s right to choose a spouse and freely enter into marriage is central to her life, dignity and equality as a human being and must be protected and upheld by law,” the experts said.Highlighting that, under international law, consent is immaterial when the victim is a child under the age of 18, the experts stressed upon dissolving marriages contracted under coercion.Highlighting the case of Mishal Rasheed, a girl who was abducted, sexually assaulted and forced to marry her abductor, the UN experts called upon the Pakistani authorities to treat all women and girls without discrimination.The experts further urged the authorities to raise the age of marriage for girls to 18.“The Pakistani authorities must enact and rigorously enforce laws to ensure that marriages are contracted only with the free and full consent of the intended spouses, and that the minimum age for marriage is raised to 18, including for girls,” they said.","Women and children in Pakistan belonging to religious minority communities are vulnerable to forced religious conversion and marriage, sexual violence and trafficking, the UN experts said on Thursday.

Exodus to Thailand continues after fall of key Myanmar border town,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/exodus-to-thailand-continues-after-fall-of-key-myanmar-border-town/articleshow/109262970.cms,"Numbers double

MAE SOT: A stream of people, some fearing air strikes, queued at a border crossing to flee Myanmar early on Friday, a day after the strategically vital town of Myawaddy near Thailand fell to anti-junta resistance that is gaining strength.The loss of the town robs the junta, already grappling with an economy in free fall, of vital earnings from border trade while strengthening rebel groups such as the Karen National Union (KNU) that led the assault on Myawaddy, analysts say.""I am afraid of air strikes,"" said Moe Moe Thet San, a Myawaddy resident who crossed to Thailand with her son, who is about five years old.""They caused very loud noises that shook my house,"" added the 39-year-old mother, one of those gathered at the single fully-operational border crossing at Mae Sot, who said the sound of bombs drove them to leave home, fearing for their safety.""That's why I escaped here. They can't bomb Thailand,"" she added.Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara is set to visit Mae Sot, just across the Moei River from Myawaddy, on Friday to assess matters after Myanmar's embattled junta lost yet more territory in the latest round of fighting.Junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun told Myanmar media some of its troops had surrendered because they were accompanied by their families and talks with Thailand for their return were in progress.He did not respond to a telephone call from Reuters to seek comment.Myanmar has been in turmoil since 2021, when the powerful military deposed an elected civilian government, triggering widespread protests it sought to crush with brutal force.Simmering anger against the junta turned into a nationwide armed resistance movement that is now increasingly operating in coordination with established ethnic rebel groups to challenge the military across large parts of the Southeast Asian nation.About 200 Myanmar military personnel withdrew on Thursday to a bridge linking to Mae Sot after the KNU said it had taken control of Myawaddy.But the Myanmar military may still seek to mount a counter-attack, supported by its air force, to regain the town, said Dulyapak Preecharush, an associate professor of Southeast Asian Studies at Bangkok's Thammasat University.""So there is a question about possible intensification of fighting in the coming days,"" he told Reuters.As fighting in Myanmar intensified, the numbers crossing to Mae Sot from Myawaddy doubled this week to about 4,000 a day.On Thursday, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said the fighting in Myanmar should not spill into his country's airspace.In an interview with Reuters last week, Srettha said the Myanmar junta was ""losing strength"", as he pushes to open talks with the regime.Thailand, which says it is keeping neutral in the Myanmar conflict and can accept up to 100,000 people displaced by it, has pursued engagement, including aid deliveries, with its neighbour since Srettha came to power last August.Yet the junta could find itself stretched further after the Arakan Army rebel group warned it would renew an offensive in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine.Arakan Army chief Twan Mrat Naing warned residents of the Rakhine cities of Sittwe and Kyauk Phyu to relocate ahead of ""a decisive battle"", the group said in a statement.One of Myanmar's most powerful ethnic armed forces, the Arakan Army was part of Operation 1027, a major assault by three rebel groups last October that seized significant territory from the junta.","Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara is set to visit Mae Sot, just across the Moei River from Myawaddy.
