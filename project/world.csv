"Watch: Pastor asks congregation to stand during church service, Biden 'sits in trance'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-pastor-asks-congregation-to-stand-during-church-service-biden-sits-in-trance/articleshow/111565050.cms,"US President Joe Biden found himself in an awkward position after a video of him remaining seated in trance while the pastor asked the congregation to stand went viral. This latest gaffe comes amidst growing concerns about his candidacy for the 2024 presidential race The incident, which occurred during a recent campaign stop at a Philadelphia church, follows Biden's recent struggle during a presidential debate against Republican candidate Donald Trump, 78, where he appeared to freeze, misspeak, and stare blankly.The president's history of on-stage gaffes has been well-documented.Despite the mounting pressure from fellow Democrats worried about his ability to lead for another four years, Biden has vowed to continue his reelection bid . In a fundraising email on Saturday, he dismissed calls for him to drop out as ""nonsense.""On Sunday, the president received a warm reception at a Black church in Philadelphia and later attended an event with union members in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Black voters are a crucial part of Biden's support base, and recent polls have indicated a softening in their support for him.During a leadership call on Sunday, some House Democrats expressed their belief that Biden should withdraw from the presidential race.Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota, the first Democratic House member from a battleground district to do so, said, ""Given what I saw and heard from the President during last week's debate in Atlanta, coupled with the lack of a forceful response from the President himself following that debate, I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump."" Other lawmakers are expected to join the call for Biden to step aside, with two letters reportedly circulating among House Democrats.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia has invited fellow senators to a meeting on Monday to discuss Biden's campaign. However, Senator Bernie Sanders, 82, who has previously run for the Democratic nomination, firmly supports Biden, emphasizing that Democrats should focus on policy rather than treating the election as a ""beauty contest.""","US President Joe Biden appeared to freeze during a recent campaign stop at a Philadelphia church.

Political reactions

Public sentiment

(With inputs from agencies)

The final results of the high-stakes legislative elections in France, announced early Monday, revealed that a coalition of the French Left emerged victorious, securing the most seats in parliament. However, they fell short of achieving a majority, despite successfully fending off a surge from the far-right. This outcome has left France facing the alarming possibility of a hung parliament, which could lead to political paralysis in a country that is not only a cornerstone of the European Union but also the host of the upcoming Olympic Games.The potential consequences of this situation are far-reaching, as it may unsettle markets and the French economy, which is the second-largest in the EU.Moreover, it could have significant implications for the ongoing war in Ukraine, global diplomacy, and the economic stability of Europe as a whole.The results were also a blow for centrist President Emmanuel Macron , who called the snap election to clarify the political landscape after his ticket took a battering at the hands of the RN in European Parliament elections last month.Meanwhile, violence has erupted on the streets of France following the poll results. Disturbing videos depict hooded and masked demonstrators rampaging through the streets, igniting flares and setting parts of France on fire. The authorities had deployed 30,000 riot police nationwide in anticipation of heightened political tensions, a Daily Mail report said.Similar scenes unfolded in Nantes, where protesters clashed with law enforcement. Reports indicate that several demonstrators were arrested, and numerous injuries were sustained on both sides. The protest in Nantes mirrored the intensity and grievances seen in the capital, the Daily Mail report said.Political figures have weighed in on the situation. Marine Le Pen , leader of the National Rally party, commented on the protests, saying, ""The government's inability to address the people's concerns is evident in these violent clashes."" Her remarks have sparked further debate on the effectiveness of current government policies.Public sentiment remains divided, with some supporting the protesters' cause and others condemning the violence. A local resident in Paris shared, ""While I understand the frustration, resorting to violence is not the solution. It only leads to more harm and destruction.""Authorities are urging for calm and dialogue to resolve the issues at hand. As the situation develops, the government is expected to announce measures to address the protesters' demands and restore order.","A coalition of the French Left emerged victorious, securing the most seats in parliament.

France: Blow for Le Pen as voters give leftists most seats over far right,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/times-study-abroad/europe/france-blow-for-le-pen-as-voters-give-leftists-most-seats-over-far-right/articleshow/111564200.cms,"NEW DELHI: France is on course for a hung assembly as the exit polls on Sunday predicted leftist alliance unexpectedly securing the top spot ahead of the far-right , effectively preventing Marine Le Pen 's National Rally from forming the government.According to exit poll results based on early results from a sample of polling stations, which are generally reliable, the New Popular Front , a coalition of the hard left, Socialists, and Greens, who have historically been at odds, is expected to win between 172 and 215 out of 577 seats.The announcement of the estimates was met with cries of joy and tears of relief at the leftist alliance's gathering in Paris, while activists at the Greens' office screamed in joy and embraced each other. In contrast, the far-right party headquarters was marked by stunned silence, clenched jaws, and tears, as young National Rally (RN) members checked their phones in disbelief.The result is a humiliating blow for Macron, whose centrist alliance, which he founded to support his first presidential run in 2017, is projected to narrowly come in second, winning 150-180 seats. It is also a significant disappointment for Marine Le Pen's nationalist, eurosceptic National Rally, which had been projected to win the election for weeks but is now expected to secure only 115 to 155 seats.Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal also offered to submit his resignation to President Emmanuel Macron on Monday morning, adding that he will continue to carry out his functions as long as required.The political uncertainty in the country comes ahead of the Paris Olympics which are set to open in less than three weeks, and the country will be grappling with domestic instability when the eyes of the world are upon it.Unlike other countries in Europe that are more accustomed to coalition governments, France doesn’t have a tradition of lawmakers from rival political camps coming together to form a working majority.The timing of France’s leap into the political unknown could hardly be worse: With the Paris Olympics opening in less than three weeks, the country will be grappling with domestic instability when the eyes of the world are upon it.","France is on course for a hung assembly as exit polls predicted leftist alliance unexpectedly securing the top spot ahead of the far-right.

"Canada Gold Heist: Gold stolen in Canada's biggest ever heist ended up in India, Dubai: Police",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gold-stolen-in-canadas-biggest-ever-heist-ended-up-in-india-dubai-police/articleshow/111541856.cms,"Gold heist that belongs to Netflix series

Canada Police believes that the gold stolen last year in Canada's biggest-ever gold heist must have gone to India and Dubai gold markets. Over 6,500 gold bars disappeared overseas after being stolen from an airport, the department believes. ""We believe a large portion has gone overseas to markets that are flush with gold,"" lead investigator Det. Sgt. Mike Mavity said.""That would be Dubai, or India, where you can take gold with serial numbers on it, and they will still honor it and melt it down,"" the investigator said.Nine individuals were arrested in connection with the meticulously planned heist including a former Air Canada manager and a jewelry store owner. The suspects used a completed bill for a seafood pick-up to forge paperwork that was given to a warehouse attendant. A small amount of precious metal was probably melted down in the basement of a Mississauga jewelry store immediately after the heist. Only 90,000 Canadian dollars were recovered from the heist.Canada cops described the heist as Netflix material as a lot of daring planning went behind it. The robbery was staged in an Air Canada cargo facility within the Toronto Pearson International Airport.A man gained entry to an Air Canada cargo terminal with a duplicate waybill for a shipment of seafood and then drove off with a palette full of gold bars. The heist was busted a year later. India-origin men Parmpal Sidhu, Archit Grover, Amit Jalota were among the arrested.The gold container arrived on the Air Canada flight from Switzerland to Toronto. It had 22 million Canadian dollars in gold bars and foreign currency. A day after the cargo arrived, it was reported missing. Police said at least two former Air Canada employees assisted the theft.Parmpal Sidhu was working at the Air Canada Cargo terminal during the heist; Archit Grover is a longtime friend of Sidhu and Amit Jalota is Grover's cousin.","Over 6,500 gold bars disappeared overseas after being stolen from an airport.

LONDON: Only one Indian-origin MP , Lisa Nandy, has made it onto the new British prime minister ’s cabinet despite there being 19 PIO MPs in the Labour party now.This is a stark contrast to the cabinet Boris Johnson had formed in July 2019 which was the most diverse in British history. Meanwhile British Pakistani MP Shabana Mahmood, who has been strongly critical of the Indian govt over Kashmir, has been appointed justice secretary.Manchester-born half-Indian Lisa Nandy (44), a former leadership rival to Starmer, is now secretary of state for culture, media and sport. She has previously held several shadow cabinet roles, including shadow foreign secretary. In Sept 2023 Starmer had demoted her to shadow cabinet minister for international development. Her father is Dipak Nandy, a Kolkata-born academic who lives in the UK and helped draft Labour’s 1976 race relations bill. Her mother is Ann Luise Byers, daughter of the late life peer Lord Byers. She quit as a frontbencher when Jeremy Corbyn was Labour leader in June 2019, alongside many other shadow cabinet members, calling for him to step down as leader.Preet Kaur Gill, once the shadow international development secretary, is not in the new cabinet.Mahmood, who was shadow justice secretary in Opposition, made a speech at an Independence Day protest on Aug 15, 2019 outside the Indian high commission in London which turned violent and left the mission’s building severely damaged. She had signed a letter to Johnson in 2019 calling on him to “strongly condemn the actions of the Indian govt” and its allegedly “illegal and unconstitutional revocation of Article 370 to annex Kashmir”.was born in Birmingham and her parents were born in the village of Bab-e-yaam in Mirpur, PoK. She supports the right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination and has condemned India’s actions in Kashmir many times in tahe House of Commons. She has called for independent observers to be sent to the region.In July 2029 Johnson gave three cabinet positions to MPs of Indian origin — Priti Patel, Rishi Sunak and Alok Sharma. Other ethnic minorities in that cabinet included James Cleverly, Sajid Javid and Kwasi Kwarteng.Trupti Patel, president of the Hindu Forum of Britain, said: “I feel the cabinet should be appointed on merit. It is the work it carries out that matters. Rishi got the job as chancellor because he was the best person for the job. I don’t believe in positive discrimination.”Sunder Katwala, director of think tank British Future, said: “Keir Starmer has less ethnic diversity at the top table. Three of his Cabinet are black and Asian. This now seems low after the previous administration, though it is only a little behind the 14% of the electorate who are from visible minorities.”","Only one Indian-origin MP has made it onto the new British prime minister ’s cabinet.

"Reformist Pezeshkian wins Iran's presidential runoff election, besting hard-liner Jalili",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/irans-presidential-runoff-reformist-candidate-masoud-pezeshkian-wins-elections-headscarf-law/articleshow/111527887.cms,"Masoud Pezeshkian , a reformist candidate and heart surgeon, emerged victorious in Iran's runoff presidential election on Saturday. He secured the win by pledging to engage with the West and relax the enforcement of the country's compulsory headscarf law , following a period of sanctions and protests that have strained the Islamic Republic. Pezeshkian's opponent, hard-liner Saeed Jalili , was defeated in the electoral contest.Pezeshkian secured over 17 million votes, while Jalili obtained more than 13 million votes in an election where approximately 30 million votes were cast, according to Iran's election authority. The voter turnout for this election, which was at historic low level, stood at 49.8 percent.Throughout his campaign, Pezeshkian refrained from promising any drastic changes to Iran's Shiite theocracy. He has consistently recognized Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the ultimate authority in all matters concerning the state.However, Pezeshkian's modest objectives are likely to face challenges from an Iranian government that remains largely controlled by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip, and Western concerns about Tehran's enrichment of uranium to near-weapons-grade levels.In the early hours of the day, Pezeshkian's supporters, took to the streets in Tehran and other urban areas as his advantage over Jalili, a conservative former nuclear negotiator, continued to grow.The initial round of polling on June 28 experienced the poorest participation since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in the history of the Islamic Republic. The leadership in Iran has consistently stressed that the voter turnout is an indication of backing for the nation's Shiite theocracy, which has been under pressure following years of economic sanctions, widespread protests, and severe repression of all dissent.According to the vote count provided by the authorities, Pezeshkian secured 16.3 million votes, while Jalili received 13.5 million votes in Friday's election.The elections came after President Ebrahim Raisi, who was widely regarded as a close confidant and mentee of Khamenei, died in a helicopter accident in May. Many believed that Raisi was being groomed as a possible successor to the supreme leader position.Raisi's legacy was however, marred by his participation in the 1988 mass executions in Iran. Furthermore, he played a significant role in the violent suppression of protests that erupted following the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022 who had been arrested by the authorities for allegedly wearing her mandatory hijab improperly.","Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist candidate and heart surgeon, emerged victorious in Iran's runoff presidential election on Saturday.

A massive heat wave is set to bring a new set of record-breaking temperatures to the US West Coast , while millions of Americans endure a heat dome that is also affecting Arizona and Nevada.The national weather service reported on Sunday that around 36 million people, or about 10% of the nation's population, are under excessive heat warnings resulting from the heat dome centered over California.Research indicates that climate change is responsible for driving extreme heat waves worldwide and will persist in delivering hazardous weather for years to come.An additional 36 million people are under heat advisories, while approximately 1 million people face excessive heat watches, including areas in eastern Oregon, northeastern Nevada, and southwestern Idaho.According to NWS meteorologist Bryan Jackson, temperatures in locations such as Redding, a city in northern California that reached an all-time high of 119 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) on Saturday, are running up to 20 degrees above normal for this time of year.""We're expecting it to merely drift east through the early part of next week and basically persist through the week, so we've got a real expansive and extreme heat wave ongoing, and it's expected to continue this week,"" he said.In places like Washington state, Oregon, California, northern Arizona, and central Idaho, high temperatures are predicted to meet or surpass daily high records.Heat warnings indicate that conditions are imminent, which is different from watches that are issued when conditions are predicted in the upcoming days.Last week, the administration of US President Joe Biden proposed the first-ever safety standard aimed at protecting workers and communities from the effects of extreme heat.Earth experienced record-high temperatures for 13 consecutive months, with June 2024 marking the 12th straight month of global temperatures 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to Copernicus. This streak underscores the urgency of the Paris Agreement’s warming limit. Despite hopes that the record-setting heat may subside, climate disruptions will persist.The June global temperature averaged 62°F, the highest for any June, and the third hottest month recorded. Extreme heat affected regions like southeast Europe and the US The oceans have also been breaking heat records for 15 months. Long-term greenhouse gas emissions and factors like El Niño contribute to the rising temperatures. Scientists warn that the planet is on a path to 3°C warming unless emissions are curbed. This crisis highlights the growing impact of climate change, with more frequent and severe weather events, posing risks to both the wealthy and the poor.","Earth experienced record-high temperatures for 13 consecutive months, with June 2024 marking the 12th straight month of global temperatures 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

The storm could bring 85 mph (136 kph) winds and cause major flooding, including in suburbs around Houston.Acting Texas governor Dan Patrick urged people vacationing in coastal areas to leave before the storm's arrival, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and the need for preparation.Energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan shut down its West Clear Lake and Dayton natural gas storage facilities, as well as its Texas City natural gas processing facility, ahead of the storm, news agency Reuters reported. Freeport LNG's liquefaction trains and pre-treatment facility were proactively shutdown due to impacts associated with Beryl, but plant operators later restarted them to minimize flaring. Cheniere Energy's Corpus Christi facility was operating without interruptions, but nonessential personnel were released.Chemical maker Chemours Co, which has a production facility near Corpus Christi, escalated its hurricane preparedness plans to ensure safe staffing and secure equipment and assets. Enbridge Inc and Gibson Energy, both operating export facilities in the area, activated emergency plans and secured their facilities and docks following the port closures .Citgo Petroleum Corp was cutting production at its Corpus Christi refinery, planning to keep the plant in operation at minimum during Beryl's passage.

The banks are de-risking to meet financial regulations but the trend undermines the financial resilience of Pacific Island countries, according to experts.Nelson told those attending the meeting that the US recognised and is committed to addressing bank de-risking across the Pacific.""There is a lot to be gained by promoting financial integration around the world. But conversely, when correspondent banking relationships dwindle, the consequences can be substantial,"" he added.Nelson said data suggests that over the past decade the number of correspondent banking relationships in the Pacific had declined at twice the rate of the global average. The World Bank and Asia Development Bank is working on programmes to try and improving corresponding banking relations.Jane Yellen, US Treasury Secretary said in a virtual address to the meeting that the US focus was on supporting the Pacific region's economic resilience, including through strengthening access to correspondent banks.""The United States is committed to an Indo-Pacific that is free and open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient.

Las Vegas tied the record of 115 F (46 C), last reached in 2007, and Phoenix topped out at 114 F (45.5 C), just shy of the record of 116 F (46.7 C) dating to 1942.Marko Boscovich said the best way to beat the heat in Las Vegas is in a seat at a slot machine with a cold beer inside an air-conditioned casino.""But you know, after it hits triple digits it's about all the same to me,"" said Boscovich, who was visiting from Sparks, Nevada, to see a Dead & Company concert Saturday night at the Sphere.

On the more-humid East Coast, temperatures above 100 degrees were expected, though no excessive heat advisories were in effect for the region on Sunday.On Saturday, Raleigh, North Carolina, reached an all-time record high of 106 degrees F (41.1 C), with a maximum heat index of 118 F (47.7 C), he said.""Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors,"" read a National Weather Service advisory for the Baltimore area.

Well, high temperatures across (western Nevada and northeastern California) won't get below 100 degrees (37.8 C) until next weekend,"" the service posted online. ""And unfortunately, there won't be much relief overnight either.""Indeed, Reno hit a high of 104 F (40 C) on Saturday, smashing the old record of 101 F (38.3 C).More extreme highs are in the near forecast, including 129 F (53.8 C) for Sunday at Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley National Park, and then around 130 F (54.4 C) through Wednesday.The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, eastern California, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.Deaths are starting to mount In Arizona 's Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, there have been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, along with more than 160 other deaths suspected of being related to heat that are still under investigation, according to a recent report.That does not include the death of a 10-year-old boy last week in Phoenix who suffered a ""heat-related medical event"" while hiking with family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to police.California wildfires fanned by low humidity, high temperatures Firefighters dispatched aircraft and helicopters to drop water or retardant on a series of wildfires in California.In Santa Barbara County, northwest of Los Angeles, the Lake Fire has scorched more than 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of grass, brush and timber. Firefighters said the blaze was displaying ""extreme fire behavior"" and had the ""potential for large growth"" with high temperatures and low humidity.Festival revelers meet the heat with cold water and shade At the Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland, Oregon, music fans coped by drinking cold water, seeking shade or freshening up under water misters. Organizers of the weekend revelries also advertised free access to air conditioning in a nearby hotel.Angelica Quiroz, 31, kept her scarf and hat wet and applied sunscreen.""Definitely a difference between the shade and the sun,"" Quiroz said Friday.

Since stepping down as a senior member of the British royal family in 2020, Meghan tried her hand at a number of projects but the success that she was aiming at remained elusive. Her own lifestyle brand American Riviera Orchard which she recently launched also did not grab eyeballs.“Like her husband, she feels that people are unfairly picking on her – she cannot understand why people don’t admire her work,"" Quinn said.",Harry reportedly has a pre-Meghan and post-Megan world and the two worlds do not merge.

"Biden has to win 'overwhelmingly' or 'pass the torch', says US democrat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-has-to-win-overwhelmingly-or-pass-the-torch-says-us-democrat/articleshow/111559142.cms,"US democrat Adam Schiff expressed his concerns about President Biden's performance in the upcoming presidential election in a recent interview with NBC News. Schiff emphasised that given Biden's impressive record and Trump's criminal history, the President should be easily defeating his opponent. However, he attributed the close race to Biden's age.“Given Joe Biden’s incredible record, given Donald Trump’s terrible record, he should be mopping the floor with Donald Trump .Joe Biden is running against a criminal. It should not be even close,” Schiff said.Schiff's comments come amidst growing concerns about Biden's vitality following his recent debate against Trump. Despite calls from five House Democrats for Biden to withdraw from the race, the President has remained adamant about staying in the running, saying that only the ""Lord Almighty"" could persuade him otherwise.The stakes of the November 5th election have been further heightened by a recent Supreme Court decision granting sitting presidents absolute immunity for official acts. Schiff warned that this ruling could give the next occupant of the Oval Office ""nearly dictatorial power."" He stressed that Biden must either win overwhelmingly or pass the torch to someone who can.“Either he has to win overwhelmingly, or he has to pass the torch to someone who can,” Schiff said.While praising Biden's accomplishments as president, including job creation, strengthening Nato alliances, and tackling climate change, Schiff expressed concern over Biden's recent interview with ABC News.In the interview, Biden downplayed his debate performance and suggested that he would be content as long as he gave it his all. Schiff found this response troubling, emphasizing that the decision to run or pass the torch should not be based solely on effort.Schiff also highlighted the potential impact of Biden's performance on down-ballot races, noting that while Senate and House candidates are currently ahead, they can only run so far ahead of the President. Without explicitly stating what he believes Biden should do, Schiff urged the President to consult with others and keep an open mind, expressing confidence that Biden will ultimately make the right decision.Finally, Schiff praised Vice President Kamala Harris, describing her as a potential phenomenal president with the experience, judgment, and leadership ability to win overwhelmingly. Harris has remained supportive of Biden throughout the campaign.","Adam Schiff expressed his concerns about President Biden's performance in the upcoming presidential election in a recent interview with NBC News.

He got the chance at a church service at Mount Airy Church of God in Christ in northwest Philadelphia, where Biden entered the gold-chandeliered sanctuary to applause.Early in the service, Pastor Louis Felton asked churchgoers to lock arms before declaring, ""There is no election we can not win.""""There is no enemy we can not defeat,"" Felton said. ""We are together because we love our president.""The president was later heading to Harrisburg to speak at an organizing event with union members and local Democrats. On Sunday evening, he returns to Washington, where leaders from NATO countries will gather for a three-day summit beginning Tuesday to mark the military alliance's 75th anniversary.The focus could shift more to Russia's war in Ukraine than questions about Biden's reelection campaign, but the 81-year-old Biden's political situation remains precarious. FiveDemocratic lawmakers have called on him to abandon his reelection bid ahead of November, and more could do so in coming days, as Congress reconvenes.Meeting in person will give congressional Democrats a chance to discuss concerns about Biden's ability to withstand the remaining four months of the campaign - not to mention four more years in the White House - and true prospects of beating former Republican former President Donald Trump.Biden's campaign team is quietly bracing for the chorus of those calling for him to leave the race to grow in coming days holding the call with surrogates and calling and texting lawmakers to try and head off more potential defections. The president also got a weekend boost from other key Democrats who had raised previous questions but now have moved to support him, led by speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and representative James Clyburn of South Carolina.With the Democratic convention fast approaching, the short term is especially critical.Since his disastrous debate performance late last month donors, strategists, lawmakers and their constituents have urged Democrats to replace him at the top of the ticket before, they argue, it's too late. Biden's Friday interview with ABC has not convinced some who remain skeptical that he can resurrect his campaign.Biden has insisted he's not yielding to any other potential Democratic presidential candidate, arguing that he's still the party's best shot to beat Trump. His visiting a Black church, gives him a chance to energize African-American voters, who are Democrats' largest and most-loyal bloc of support. It could also send a message to members of the Congressional Black Caucus , whose endorsement the president will need as he works to quell potential rebellion on Capitol Hill.At the Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans on Saturday, Biden got enthusiastic support from four of the caucus' members, including Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, who told attendees ""don't get out there and turn your back on this president.""California Democratic representative Maxine Waters, who is 85, drew a standing ovation by declaring, ""People say Joe Biden's too old. Hell, I'm older than Biden!""""It ain't gonna be no other Democratic candidate,"" Waters said ""and we better know it.""Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN said that Biden ""needs to answer those questions that voters have"" but added, ""If he does that this week, I think he will be in a very good position and we can get back to what this campaign needs to be.""During his Friday interview, Biden rejected undergoing independent cognitive testing, arguing that the everyday rigors of the presidency were proof enough of his mental acuity. But California Democratic representative Adam Schiff told NBC on Sunday that he'd be ""happy if both the president and Donald Trump took a cognitive test.""Schiff added that the president opting to stay in the race ""is going to come down to what Joe Biden thinks is best"" and that he could ""run hard"" to beat Trump or ""if his decision is to pass the torch, then the president should do everything in his power to make that other candidate successful.""Schiff warned that Biden needs to consider how he risks dragging down Democrats down the ticket: ""Look, there are concerns with the impact on down ballot races if the president doesn't do well.""""You can only run so far ahead of the president,"" he said.As some Democrats have done, Schiff also seized on Biden suggesting during the ABC interview that losing to Trump would be acceptable ""as long as I give it my all.""""This is not just about whether he gave it the best college try,"" Schiff said ""but rather whether he made the right decision to run or to pass the torch.""","President Joe Biden attended a Black church and was rallying with union members on Sunday in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania.

Pakistan Public Sector Enterprises: Pakistan's public sector enterprises suffocate under mounting PKR 1.7 trillion debt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-public-sector-enterprises-suffocate-under-mounting-pkr-1-7-trillion-debt/articleshow/111564121.cms,"KARACHI: The Pakistan government's efforts to reform its public sector enterprises (PSEs) have been marred by persistent challenges, as highlighted by recent fiscal data and international funding initiatives, Dawn reported.Despite a substantial loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) aimed at bolstering reforms , the cumulative debt of PSEs has soared to PKR 1.7 trillion, with an additional borrowing exceeding Rs 43 billion in the fiscal year 2024.Economic priorities underscore the urgency of privatising PSEs to alleviate the strain on the national budget, a crucial step also mandated for securing future loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The allocation for PSEs in the 2024-25 budget saw a dramatic increase, reaching PKR 1.267 trillion, largely earmarked for subsidies and grants, marking a 104 per cent surge from the previous fiscal year.The State Bank of Pakistan 's latest report reveals a notable decrease in PSE borrowing during FY23, contrasting sharply with the PKR 43.5 billion borrowed in FY24 alone, adding to the existing debt burden. Despite receiving substantial funding from the ADB, which initiated the USD 300 million Public Sector Enterprises Reform Programme (PSERP) in 2016, aimed at enhancing corporate governance and operational efficiency, meaningful reforms have been elusive.Former finance minister Ishaq Dar, during his tenure, committed to improving PSE performance, particularly in sectors like railways, Pakistan Steel, and Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). However, the political sensitivity surrounding the privatisation of major PSEs, significant employers in a job-scarce economy, has hindered progress on critical economic reforms.""The ADB's support began with a USD 300 million loan for sub-programme one in June 2016, followed by an additional USD 300 million for sub-programme two in 2017, aimed at sustaining and expanding initial reform efforts,"" noted an ADB report. Despite these efforts, the transformation of loss-making entities such as PIA and Pakistan Steel remains a contentious issue, highlighting the challenges of balancing economic imperatives with political realities, according to Dawn.Many PSEs continue to rely heavily on government subsidies and credit guarantees to maintain operations, underscoring persistent governance and accountability deficiencies. The ADB's objectives included enhancing transparency, performance management, and revenue generation in PSEs, aligning their operations with commercial principles to improve service delivery and financial sustainability.The failure to implement comprehensive reforms has perpetuated the financial woes of PSEs, jeopardising fiscal stability and inhibiting broader economic development, Dawn reported.

That compares with $1.29 in Amsterdam, $1.23 in Paris, and $1.08 in Melbourne, according to data collected by Bloomberg.An 18% tax was applied to packaged milk as part of taxation changes approved in the national budget last week. Previously, it was tax-exempt.Before the impost, which resulted in retail prices increasing by as much as 25%, milk costs were comparable with developing countries such as Vietnam and Nigeria, said Muhammad Nasir, a spokesman for the local unit of Dutch dairy producer Royal FrieslandCampina NV.Costlier milk will add to rising inflation in the South Asian country, where wages have stagnated, eroding spending power. The increase may also worsen child health. About 40% of the nation lives in poverty.“It will deny nutrition from a population that is already suffering from malnutrition,” Nasir said in a text message. About 60% of Pakistani children under 5 years suffer anemia and 40% suffer from stunting.Pakistan raised taxes by 40%, the highest on record, in last week’s budget aimed at meeting conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for a new bailout.","Ultra-high temperature, or UHT, milk now costs 370 rupees ($1.33) a liter in supermarkets in Karachi.
