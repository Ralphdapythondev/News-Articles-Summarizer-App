The intense battles have forced at least one Ukrainian unit to withdraw in the Kharkiv region , capitulating more land to Russian forces in the so-called contested ""gray zone"" along Russian border.By Sunday afternoon, the town of Vovchansk, among the largest in the northeast with a pre-war population of 17,000, emerged as a focal point in the battle. Volodymyr Tymoshko, the head of the Kharkiv regional police, said Russian forces were in the outskirts of the town and approaching from three directions..At least 4,000 civilians have fled the Kharkiv region since Friday, when Moscow's forces launched the operation, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Heavy fighting raged Sunday along the northeast frontline, where Russian forces attacked 27 settlements in the past 24 hours, he said. Analysts say the Russian push is designed to exploit ammunition shortages before promised Western supplies can reach the frontline. It comes after Russia stepped up attacks in March targeting energy infrastructure and settlements.The Russian defence ministry said Sunday that its forces had captured four villages on the border along Ukraine's Kharkiv region, in addition to five villages reported to have been seized on Saturday.

Rafah is considered the last refuge in Gaza for over a million civilians as well as Hamas' last stronghold. Some 300,000 people have fled the city following evacuation orders from Israel , which says it must invade to dismantle Hamas.Neighbouring Egypt issued its strongest objection yet to the Rafah offensive, saying it intends to formally join South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice alleging Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, which Israel rejects.US secretary of state Antony Blinken reiterated opposition to a major military assault on Rafah, and told CBS that Israel would ""be left holding the bag on an enduring insurgency"" without an exit from Gaza and postwar governance plan. Gaza has been left without a functioning govt, leading to a breakdown in public order and allowing Hamas' armed wing to reconstitute itself.Palestinians reported heavy Israeli bombardment overnight in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp and other areas in northern Gaza, which has been largely isolated by Israeli forces for months. UN officials say there is a ""full-blown famine"" there. Residents said Israeli warplanes and artillery struck across the camp and the Zeitoun area east of Gaza City , where troops have battled militants for over a week.

KATHMANDU: Mount Everest saw a record-breaking day Sunday as Nepali climber Kami Rita Sherpa and Briton Kenton Cool reached the top of the world's highest mountain , extending their records for the most summits by a Nepali and a foreigner.Sherpa, 54, reached the peak for the 29th time and Cool, 50, made his 18th summit .""Kami Rita and Kenton Cool both reached the summit today, making records,"" Rakesh Gurung of Nepal's tourism department told AFP.A guide for more than two decades, Sherpa, also known as ""Everest Man"", first summited the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) peak in 1994 when working for a commercial expedition.He has since climbed Everest almost every year, guiding clients. It was not immediately clear whether he had a client with him on Sunday.""Back again for the 29th summit to the top of the world... One man's job, another man/woman's dream,"" Sherpa posted on his Instagram account from base camp last week.Sherpa climbed Everest twice last year to reclaim his record after another guide, Pasang Dawa Sherpa , equalled his number of ascents.Kami Rita Sherpa has previously said that he has been ""just working"" and did not plan on setting records.He has also conquered other challenging 8,000-metre peaks including the world's second-highest mountain, K2 in Pakistan.Cool, also a guide, was once told he would not walk unaided again after a rock-climbing accident in 1996 that broke both his heel bones, but his mountaineering career has confounded predictions.He told AFP in a 2022 interview after his 16th ascent that his Everest record was ""not that amazing"" in the context of Nepali climbers' achievements.""I'm really surprised by the interest... considering that so many of the Sherpas have so many more ascents,"" he said then.Nepal has issued 414 Everest permits to mountaineers for this year's spring climbing season, which runs from April to early June.Most Everest hopefuls are escorted by a Nepali guide, meaning more than 800 climbers will tread the path to the top of the world's highest peak in the coming weeks after a group of Nepali climbers opened the route to the summit on Friday.China also reopened the Tibetan route to foreigners this year for the first time since closing it in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic.Nepal is home to eight of the world's 10 highest peaks and welcomes hundreds of adventurers each spring, when temperatures are warm and winds are typically calm.A climbing boom has made mountaineering a lucrative business since Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgay made the first ascent in 1953.More than 600 climbers made it to the summit of Everest last year but it was also the deadliest season on the mountain, with 18 fatalities.","Nepali climber Kami Rita Sherpa and Briton Kenton Cool reach the top of Mount Everest.

Saudi crown prince postpones visit to Pak amid political crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/saudi-crown-prince-postpones-visit-to-pak-amid-political-crisis/articleshow/110060848.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman ( MBS ) has postponed his long-awaited visit to Pakistan yet again, with sources suggesting Sunday that the decision was made due to incessant political, social, financial, and administrative crises in the cash-starved country.The crown prince’s visit to Pakistan was expected before or after his scheduled visit to Japan from May 20 to 23.While authorities have kept mum over the postponement of the visit, the sources said the crown prince was quite upset with the political developments in Pakistan, particularly with statements of some politicians trying to drag Saudi Arabia into the country’s internal matters.“It appears the feedback of Saudi high-ups, who had made visits to Pakistan in recent weeks, has played a key part in cancellation of the visit. The Saudi ministers, seemingly, have convinced the crown prince that political situation in Pakistan is not stable, tensions run high between the military and jailed ex-PM Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), and it would be unwise for him to visit the country in the current situation,” said Shehbaz Gill , a PTI functionary and Imran’s former principal staff officer.Last month, PTI functionary Sher Afzal Marwat had alleged that Saudi Arabia was a “conduit” in the US-led operation to oust Imran’s govt in April 2022. Following his claim, PTI removed him from its core and political committee, also issuing a show-cause for trying to harm relations with Saudi Arabia.Recently, Marwat blamed the “Saudi influence” for his party dropping his name for chairmanship of public accounts committee (PAC) of parliament.While foreign ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said the revised schedule of the visit is still being worked out, govt sources maintained that there were some points on the economic front that still needed to be cleared between both sides before MBS finalised his tour.They said Saudi investors and businessmen, who recently toured Pakistan, are interested in some projects but the terms of the agreement have not yet been finalised.PM Shehbaz Sharif had extended an invitation to the crown prince to visit Pakistan during his official tour to Saudi Arabia. The two sides were expected to sign a number of MoUs during the visit, as Pakistan is hoping for a huge investment package from the oil-rich kingdom.MBS had earlier cancelled his visit to Pakistan in Nov 2022.

According to an official IAEA measurement, if the existing nuclear material is further enriched, it would be adequate for producing two nuclear weapons.","Kamal Kharrazi, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted as saying.

NEW DELHI: One police officer was killed and over 100 individuals, primarily law enforcement personnel, sustained injuries during intense confrontations between security forces and demonstrators protesting against the elevated costs of wheat flour and electricity in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir , according to media reports on Sunday. The disputed territory experienced clashes on Saturday between the police and activists of a rights movement, coinciding with a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across the region, as reported by the Dawn newspaper.Mirpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kamran Ali informed Dawn.com that sub-inspector Adnan Qureshi succumbed to a gunshot wound in the chest while deployed with other police personnel in the town of Islamgarh to prevent a rally headed towards Muzaffarabad via Kotli and Poonch districts, organized by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC).In the days leading up to the planned long march towards Muzaffarabad on Saturday, around 70 JAAC activists were arrested by police during raids at their residences and those of their relatives in Muzaffarabad and Mirpur divisions, sparking serious clashes in Dadyal on Thursday. The committee subsequently called for a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike on Friday.Amidst a crippling strike on Friday, violent clashes erupted between police and protesters in various areas of Muzaffarabad, the capital of PoK.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urgently appealed for military aid as Ukrainian troops engage in counterattacks to thwart Russian advances.Moscow's defense ministry announced the ""liberation"" of five villages in Kharkiv near the Russian border, along with the seizure of one village in the Donetsk region.This offensive follows Russia's reported incursion into the Kharkiv region, marking small advancements into a border zone from which it had been repelled nearly two years ago.President Zelenskyy, in a televised address, emphasized the imperative of disrupting Russian offensive plans, labeling it as the country's top priority. Heavy fighting has been reported in the border area, prompting the evacuation of 1,775 individuals. Tragically, two men were killed and two others wounded by guided aerial bomb attacks in the town of Vovchansk.Despite assurances from Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov that there is currently no imminent ground operation threat to the city of Kharkiv, residents from border areas have fled in fear. Evacuees, many of whom are elderly, have sought refuge at reception centers near Kharkiv, receiving essential assistance.The situation remains precarious, with aid workers highlighting the challenges of evacuating residents amid ongoing troop movements and heightened danger. Zelenskyy reiterated the urgent need for international support, stressing the importance of timely arms deliveries to bolster Ukrainian defenses.Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks inside Russia and Russia-held territories, targeting energy infrastructure. In a retaliatory strike, a missile hit a restaurant in the Russian-held city of Donetsk, claiming three lives and injuring several others.Analysts speculate that Russia's ground operation aims to establish a buffer zone near its Belgorod region or divert Ukrainian resources from the Donetsk region. Despite Washington's announcement of a $400 million military aid package for Ukraine and assurances of its capability to repel fresh Russian campaigns, the situation on the ground remains volatile.","Moscow's defense ministry announced the ""liberation"" of five villages in Kharkiv near the Russian border.

At least 18 others are injured. We are also still searching for 16 other people,"" West Sumatra disaster agency spokesman Ilham Wahab told AFP.The rescue operation, comprising local responders, law enforcement, military personnel, and volunteers, is tirelessly ongoing.The flash floods and cold lava flow hit Agam and Tanah Datar districts around 10:30 pm (1530 GMT) on Saturday, as reported by Basarnas search and rescue agency. Cold lava, or lahar, composed of volcanic ash, sand, and stones, descended the slopes of Mount Marapi due to the heavy rain.Earlier reports from Basarnas had accounted for 12 fatalities, including children. Ilham mentioned that reports of missing individuals are continuously coming in from concerned relatives.Damage assessment reveals mosques, residences, and public infrastructure wrecked by the disaster. In Tanah Datar, a tourist hotspot named Lembah Anai witnessed severe road damage, cutting off access between Padang and Bukittinggi.

Pro-Palestinian protests dwindle to tiny numbers and subtle defiant acts at US college graduations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pro-palestinian-protests-dwindle-to-tiny-numbers-and-subtle-defiant-acts-at-us-college-graduations/articleshow/110065368.cms,"A tiny contingent of Duke University graduates opposed pro-Israel comedian Jerry Seinfeld speaking at their commencement in North Carolina Sunday, with about 30 of the 7,000 students leaving their seats and chanting “free Palestine” amid a mix of boos and cheers.Some waved the red, green, black and white Palestinian flag. Seinfeld, whose decade-long namesake show became one of the most popular in U.S.television history and who continues to draw legions of fans to his Netflix specials and TV appearances such as “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,” was there to receive an honorary doctorate from the university.“After spending four years at what is considered one of the finest institutions of higher education in the world, they apparently feel that perhaps some light entertainment will get you all to the final realization, ‘You know, I think I’ve really had enough of this place,’” Seinfeld said.The stand-up turned actor and recent star, director and co-writer of the movie “Unfrosted,” has publicly supported Israel since it invaded Gaza to dismantle Hamas after the organization attacked the country and killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel on Oct. 7. The ensuing war has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants.Students at campuses across the U.S. responded this spring by setting up encampments and calling for their schools to cut ties with Israel and businesses that support it. Students and others on campuses whom law enforcement authorities have identified as outside agitators have taken part in the protests from Columbia University in New York City to UCLA.At the University of California, Berkeley, on Saturday, a small group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators waved flags and chanted during commencement and were escorted to the back of the stadium, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. There were no major counterprotests, but some attendees voiced frustration.“I feel like they’re ruining it for those of us who paid for tickets and came to show our pride for our graduates,” said Annie Ramos, whose daughter is a student. “There’s a time and a place, and this is not it.”The small student protest Sunday at Duke's graduation in Durham, North Carolina, was emblematic of campus events across the U.S. Sunday after weeks of student protests roiled U.S. campuses in recent weeks and resulted in nearly 2,900 arrests at 57 colleges and universities.This weekend's commencement events remained largely peaceful.At Emerson College in Boston, some students took off their graduation robes and left them on stage. Others emblazoned “free Palestine” on their mortar boards. One woman, staring at a camera broadcasting a livestream to the public, unzipped her robe to show a kaffiyeh, the black and white checkered scarf commonly worn by Palestinians, and flashed a watermelon painted on her hand. Both are symbols of solidarity with those living in the occupied territories.Others displayed messages for a camera situated on stage, but the livestream quickly shifted to a different view, preventing them from being seen for long. Chants during some of the speeches were difficult to decipher.Protests at Columbia University, where student uprisings inspired others at campuses across the country, led the school to cancel its main graduation ceremony in favor of smaller gatherings.The University of Southern California told its valedictorian, who publicly backed Palestinians, that she could not deliver her keynote speech at its graduation ceremony because of security concerns. It later canceled its main graduation ceremony.At Depaul University in Chicago, graduation is more than a month away. But as the academic year closes, school leaders said they had reached an “impasse” with the school's pro-Palestinian protesters, leaving the future of their encampment on the Chicago campus unclear.The student-led DePaul Divestment Coalition, which is calling on the university to divest from economic interests tied to Israel, set up the encampment nearly two weeks ago. The group alleged university officials walked away from talks and tried to force students into signing an agreement, according to a student statement late Saturday.","About 30 of the 7,000 students left their seats and chanted 'free Palestine' amid a mix of boos and cheers.

He was 98.Corman died Thursday at his home in Santa Monica, California, according to a statement released Saturday by his wife and daughters.""He was generous, open-hearted and kind to all those who knew him,"" the statement said. ""When asked how he would like to be remembered, he said, 'I was a filmmaker, just that.'""Starting in 1955, Corman helped create hundreds of B-movies as a producer and director, among them ""Black Scorpion,"" ""Bucket of Blood"" and ""Bloody Mama."" A remarkable judge of talent, he hired such aspiring filmmakers as Francis Ford Coppola , Ron Howard , James Cameron and Martin Scorsese . In 2009, Corman received an honorary Academy Award.""There are many constraints connected with working on a low budget, but at the same time there are certain opportunities,"" Corman said in a 2007 documentary about Val Lewton, the 1940s director of ""Cat People"" and other underground classics.""You can gamble a little bit more. You can experiment. You have to find a more creative way to solve a problem or to present a concept,"" he said.The roots of Hollywood's golden age in the 1970s can be found in Corman's films.Jack Nicholson made his film debut as the title character in a 1958 Corman quickie, ""The Cry Baby Killer,"" and stayed with the company for biker, horror and action films, writing and producing some of them. Other actors whose careers began in Corman movies included Robert De Niro, Bruce Dern and Ellen Burstyn.Peter Fonda's appearance in ""The Wild Angels"" was a precursor to his own landmark biker movie, ""Easy Rider,"" co-starring Nicholson and fellow Corman alumnus Dennis Hopper. ""Boxcar Bertha,"" starring Barbara Hershey and David Carradine, was an early film by Scorsese.Corman's B-movie directors were given minuscule budgets and often told to finish their films in as little as five days. When Howard, who would go on to win a best director Oscar for ""A Beautiful Mind,"" pleaded for an extra half day to reshoot a scene in 1977 for ""Grand Theft Auto,"" Corman told him, ""Ron, you can come back if you want, but nobody else will be there.""""Roger Corman was my very first boss, my lifetime mentor and my hero. Roger was one of the greatest visionaries in the history of cinema,"" Gale Ann Hurd, whose notable producing credits include the ""Terminator"" film franchise, ""The Abyss"" and ""The Walking Dead"" television series, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.Initially only drive-ins and specialty theaters would book Corman films, but as teenagers began turning out, national chains gave in. Corman's pictures were open for their time about sex and drugs, such as his 1967 release ""The Trip,"" an explicit story about LSD written by Nicholson and starring Fonda and Hopper.Meanwhile, he discovered a lucrative sideline releasing prestige foreign films in the United States, among them Ingmar Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers,"" Federico Fellini's ""Amarcord"" and Volker Schlondorff's ""The Tin Drum."" The latter two won Oscars for best foreign language film.Corman got his start as a messenger boy for Twentieth Century-Fox, eventually graduating to story analyst. After quitting the business briefly to study English literature for a term at Oxford University, he returned to Hollywood and launched his career as a movie producer and director.Despite his penny-pinching ways, Corman retained good relations with his directors, boasting that he never fired one because ""I wouldn't want to inflict that humiliation.""Some of his former underlings repaid his kindness years later. Coppola cast him in ""The Godfather, Part II,"" Jonathan Demme included him in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Philadelphia"" and Howard gave him a part in ""Apollo 13.""Most of Corman's movies were quickly forgotten by all but die-hard fans. A rare exception was 1960's ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" which starred a bloodthirsty plant that feasted on humans and featured Nicholson in a small but memorable role as a pain-loving dental patient. It inspired a long-lasting stage musical and a 1986 musical adaptation starring Steve Martin, Bill Murray and John Candy.In 1963, Corman initiated a series of films based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe. The most notable was ""The Raven,"" which teamed Nicholson with veteran horror stars Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre and Basil Rathbone. Directed by Corman on a rare three-week schedule, the horror spoof won good reviews, a rarity for his films. Another Poe adaptation, ""House of Usher,"" was deemed worthy of preservation by the Library of Congress.""It was my privilege to know him. He was a great friend. He shaped my childhood with science fiction movies and Edgar Allen Poe epics,"" John Carpenter, director of ""Halloween,"" ""The Thing"" and other classic horror and action films, said on X. ""I'll miss you, Roger.""Near the end of his life, Karloff starred in another Corman-backed effort, the 1968 thriller ""Targets,"" which marked Peter Bogdanovich's directorial debut.Corman's success prompted offers from major studios, and he directed ""The St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" and ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" on normal budgets. Both were disappointments, however, and he blamed their failure on front-office interference.Roger William Corman was born in Detroit and raised in Beverly Hills, but ""not in the affluent section,"" he once said. He attended Stanford University, earning a degree in engineering, and arrived in Hollywood after three years in the Navy.After his stint at Oxford, he worked as a television stagehand and literary agent before finding his life's work.In 1964 he married Julie Halloran, a UCLA graduate who also became a producer.He is survived by his wife, Julie, and children Catherine, Roger, Brian and Mary.","Corman helped create hundreds of B-movies as a producer and director.

In a pair of TV interviews, Blinken underscored that the United States believes Israeli forces should ""get out of Gaza"", but also is waiting to see credible plans from Israel for security and governance in the territory after the war.Hamas has reemerged in parts of Gaza, Blinken said, and that ""heavy action"" by Israeli forces in the southern city of Rafah risks leaving America's closest Mideast ally ""holding the bag on an enduring insurgency"".He said the United States has worked with Arab countries and others for weeks on developing ""credible plans for security, for governance, for rebuilding"" in Gaza, but ""we haven't seen that come from Israel...We need to see that, too"".Blinken also said that as Israel pushes deeper in Rafah in the south, where Israel says Hamas has four battalions and where more than 1 million civilians have massed, a military operation may ""have some initial success"" but risks ""terrible harm"" to the population without solving a problem ""that both of us want to solve, which is making sure Hamas cannot again govern Gaza"".Israel's conduct of the war, he said, has put the country ""on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy, and probably refilled by Hamas. We've been talking to them about a much better way of getting an enduring result, enduring security"".Blinken also echoed for the first time publicly by a US official the findings of a new Biden administration report to Congress on Friday that said Israel's use of US-provided weapons in Gaza likely violated international humanitarian law. The report also said wartime conditions prevented American officials from determining that for certain in specific airstrikes.""When it comes to the use of weapons, concerns about incidents where given the totality of the damage that's been done to children, women, men, it was reasonable to assess that, in certain instances, Israel acted in ways that are not consistent with international humanitarian law,"" Blinken said. He cited ""the horrible loss of life of innocent civilians"".The war began on Oct 7 after an attack against Israel by Hamas that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. About 250 people were taken hostage. Israel's offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza.US and UN officials say Israeli restrictions on food shipments since Oct 7 have brought on full-fledged famine in northern Gaza.Tensions between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about how the war, as well as domestic tensions about US support for Israel with protests on US college campuses and many Republican lawmakers saying that Biden needs to give Israel whatever it needs. The issue could play a major role in the outcome of November's presidential election.Biden said in an interview last week with CNN that his administration would not provide weapons that Israel could use for an all-out assault in Rafah.Blinken appeared on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" and NBC's ""Meet the Press"".","Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered some of the Biden administration's strongest public criticism yet of Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza.

Baltimore bridge collapse: Crews prepare for controlled demolition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-crews-prepare-for-controlled-demolition/articleshow/110049362.cms,"NEW DELHI: After weeks of preparation, crews have scheduled a controlled demolition for Sunday to dismantle the largest remaining section of the collapsed Francis Scott key bridge in Maryland . The bridge crashed down under the force of a massive container ship on March 26.The steel span came crashing down after the Dali lost power and collided with one of the bridge's support columns shortly after leaving Baltimore.Since then, the vessel has remained trapped amidst the debris, leading to the closure of Baltimore's bustling port for most maritime traffic.The collapse tragically claimed the lives of six members of a roadwork crew, who plunged to their deaths. The recovery of the last body from the underwater wreckage occurred earlier this week. All the victims were Latino immigrants who had sought job opportunities in the US. They were diligently filling potholes during an overnight shift when the bridge met its destruction.The planned controlled demolition aims to facilitate the refloating of the Dali, enabling its safe return to the Port of Baltimore . Once the ship is extracted, maritime traffic can gradually resume, offering much-needed relief to thousands of longshoremen, truckers, and small business owners whose livelihoods have been affected by the prolonged closure.The 21-member crew of the Dali will remain sheltered aboard the ship during the detonation of the explosives.William Marks, a spokesperson for the crew, stated in an email that they would shelter ""in a designated safe place"" during the demolition. He emphasised, ""All precautions are being taken to ensure everyone's safety.""In a videographic released this week, authorities explained that engineers are employing precision cuts to manage the breakdown of the trusses. They highlighted that this method ensures ""surgical precision"" and is one of the safest and most efficient ways to dismantle steel under significant tension. According to the videographic, the steel structure will be ""thrust away from the Dali"" when the explosives cause it to tumble into the water.Once demolished, hydraulic grabbers will hoist the resulting sections of steel onto barges.""It's important to note that this controlled demolition is not like what you would see in a movie,"" the video explains, emphasizing that from a distance, it will resemble fireworks or loud thunder and emit puffs of smoke.Officials had previously aimed to remove the Dali by May 10 and reopen the port's 50-foot (15.2-meter) main channel by the end of May.The crew members of the Dali haven't been permitted to depart the grounded vessel since the disaster. Officials said that they've been occupied with maintaining the ship and aiding investigators. Among the crew, 20 are from India and one is from Sri Lanka.The National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI are conducting investigations into the bridge collapse .The Danish shipping giant Maersk chartered the Dali for a scheduled journey from Baltimore to Sri Lanka, but the vessel's journey was abruptly halted. The crew issued a distress call, reporting a loss of power and inability to control the steering system. Shortly after, the ship collided with the bridge.Officials have indicated that the safety board investigation will center on the ship's electrical system.(With inputs from agencies)","Crews have scheduled a controlled demolition for Sunday to dismantle the largest remaining section of the collapsed Francis Scott key bridge in Maryland.

Yawns and shock: Trump's odd mix of song recitals and cannibal praise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/yawns-and-shock-trumps-odd-mix-of-song-recitals-and-cannibal-praise/articleshow/110048537.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Former US president Donald Trump surprised his supporters at a rally in New Jersey on Saturday by reciting the entire 1963 soul song ""The Snake"" and referring to a fictional cannibal as ""great."" During his speech, which lasted over 90 minutes, Trump used the Oscar Brown song to draw a comparison with "" illegal immigration and how stupid it is what we're doing right now.""""We're letting people come into our country that we will only be trouble,"" he said.Trump expressed his concern about allowing people into the country who he believes will only cause trouble. He recited the song, which tells the story of a tenderhearted woman who helps a half-frozen snake, only to be bitten by the snake instead of being thanked. Trump has used this song multiple times to highlight his anti-migrant stance, despite reported objections from Brown's family.The crowd's reaction to the lengthy recitation was subdued, with some looking puzzled and others leaving the rally. Trump awkwardly remarked, ""Did everybody enjoy it? Don't enjoy, you should be -- you should be scared!"" speaking off-the-cuff after reading from a crib sheet in his jacket pocket.Trump's rhetoric surrounding the migrant crisis has become increasingly violent, with him claiming just months ago that migrants were ""poisoning the blood"" of the United States, sparking a fierce backlash. Biden's campaign accused him of imitating Hitler's language, and during his first presidential campaign in 2016, Trump shocked observers with his language about ""rapist"" illegal migrants, reported AFP.Trump also made a rambling reference to cannibalism, saying, ""The late, great Hannibal Lecter is a wonderful man,"" referencing the 1991 film ""Silence of the Lambs."" He then grinned and rehashed a well-worn joke about the infamous cannibal character before returning to the topic of migration, stating, ""But Hannibal Lecter. Congratulations, the late, great Hannibal Lecter. We have people that are being released into our country that we don't want in our country.""","Former US president Donald Trump surprised his supporters at a rally in New Jersey.

"How is Pakistan buying fighter jets, submarines despite the economic crisis?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/how-is-pakistan-buying-fighter-jets-submarines-despite-the-economic-crisis/articleshow/110059597.cms,"Despite facing a dire economic situation with a foreign debt totaling $124.5 billion, equivalent to 42% of its GDP, Pakistan is persistently expanding its military capabilities, notably through substantial arms imports and collaborations with China. A report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) indicates that between 2019 and 2023, China accounted for 82% of Pakistan’s arms imports, reflecting a deepening military relationship between the two nations.""China is strongly contributing to the strengthening of Pakistan’s military by providing fighter jets, warships, missile technology, drones, etc.This is part of China’s strategy to counter the influence and power of Quad-4 (that includes India) and the West’s other regional alliances,"" an opinion piece in the EurAsian Times said.During President Xi Jinping’s 2015 visit to Pakistan, a significant agreement was forged for China to construct eight Hangor-class submarines for Pakistan, enhancing its naval power. ""The submarines will play a pivotal role in maintaining peace and stability in the region. It would add a new dimension to the ever-tested Pakistan-China friendship,” said Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Pakistani Chief of Naval Staff. This deal is part of China's broader strategy to counterbalance the influence of the Quad alliance and Western powers in the region.Amidst this backdrop of military enhancement, Pakistan grapples with an acute economic crisis , exacerbated by last year's devastating floods which led to a severe reduction in the GDP growth projection from 5% to 0.29%. The financial strain is further highlighted by a comment from the Business Standard, noting, ""Pakistan has no food for its people but purchases weapons."" The national budget reflects a 15.4% increase in defense spending, totaling 1804 billion rupees, even as the nation contends with skyrocketing inflation and widespread poverty.The economic hardships have led to public discontent, with Pakistani media reporting severe shortages of basic necessities such as food and medicines. Many believe that the real power in Pakistan lies with the military, which commands a significant portion of the national budget and operates vast revenue-generating enterprises. This perception is reinforced by international discussions, such as those held by the IMF, which highlight the disproportionate allocation of resources to the military at the expense of civil needs, the EurAsian Times report said.Adding to the controversy, recent reports from the BBC and other media outlets have suggested that despite Pakistan’s official stance of neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, there have been covert operations involving the supply of arms to Ukraine. These reports allege that under American pressure, Pakistan engaged in secret deals that not only violated its declared neutrality but also provided substantial profits from arms sales.","Pakistan is persistently expanding its military capabilities, notably through substantial arms imports and collaborations with China.

IMF doubts Pakistan's ability to repay debts as support team arrives in Islamabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-doubts-pakistans-ability-to-repay-debts-as-support-team-arrives-in-islamabad/articleshow/110028404.cms,"NEW DELHI: International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed serious concerns about Pakistan's ability to repay its debts, particularly to the global lender itself. The IMF 's assessment came as its support team arrived in Pakistan on Friday to discuss a new bailout package under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), following Islamabad's request.The IMF staff report, issued earlier this month, stated that ""Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund is subject to significant risks and remains critically dependent on policy implementation and timely external financing."" The report further highlighted the exceptionally high risks that could jeopardize policy implementation and erode repayment capacity and debt sustainability, including delayed adoption of reforms, high public debt and gross financing needs, low gross reserves, the State Bank of Pakistan's net FX derivative position, a decline in inflows, and sociopolitical factors.The report emphasized that restoring external viability is crucial for ensuring Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund, which depends on strong policy implementation, including external asset accumulation and exchange rate flexibility. Geopolitical instability was also mentioned as an additional source of risk, despite some reduction in uncertainty surrounding global financial conditions since the last review.According to the IMF, Pakistan requires gross financing of USD 123 billion over the next five years, with the country expected to seek USD 21 billion in fiscal year 2024-25, USD 23 billion in 2025-26, USD 22 billion in 2026-27, USD 29 billion in 2027-28, and USD 28 billion in 2028-29.Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the IMF support team will discuss the first phase of the next long-term loan programme with Pakistan's financial team, focusing on data collection from various departments and discussions on the upcoming budget for the fiscal year 2025 (FY2025) with the Ministry of Finance officials. The team is expected to stay in Pakistan for over 10 days.Pakistan has decided to seek a rollover of around USD 12 billion in debt from key allies like China in the 2024-25 fiscal year to address the USD 23 billion gap in its external financing. The Finance Ministry insiders stated that USD 5 billion from Saudi Arabia, USD 3 billion from the UAE, and USD 4 billion from China will be rolled over, with estimates of further new financing from China to be included in the next financial year's budget.The country is expected to receive more than USD 1 billion from the IMF under the fresh loan programme, along with new financing from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. The federal government aims to achieve budget targets before the anticipated arrival of the IMF review mission in Pakistan, with negotiations for a new loan programme expected to commence in mid-May, ahead of the budget presentation in June.Despite narrowly avoiding default last summer and experiencing some economic stabilization, Pakistan continues to face high fiscal shortfalls and stagnating growth, with the external account deficit being controlled through import control mechanisms at the expense of economic growth, which is expected to be around 2 per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","IMF has expressed serious concerns about Pakistan's ability to repay its debts, particularly to the global lender itself.

The HRCP demanded economic justice and protection of civil rights and stressed the importance of upholding democratic principles and the rule of law.In its annual report, 'State of Human Rights 2023', released on Wednesday, the HRCP noted with concern that irreparable political divisions led to public acts of arson and violence on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan.""What followed was flagrant disregard for the Constitution as unelected forces tightened their grip on the country's democratic structures and civic spaces shrank to an all-time low,"" the report read, according to Dawn.According to the report, the state's response to the May 9 riots was to quell dissent by resurrecting military courts to try civilians, perpetrating enforced disappearances, ordering mass arrests and allegedly orchestrating public disassociation from the PTI among many senior party leaders.The report noted that the right to freedom of expression and assembly took a particular hit during the year. According to the report, the rule of law was poor, with six-year high in fatalities related to terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations.

The report noted that young Baloch women held a long march from Turbat to Islamabad to protest against alleged extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.The report said that religious minorities reported an increasing climate of fear, particularly following the attack in Jaranwala, in which scores of churches and homes were torched and looted by mobs after allegations of blasphemy against a Christian man.The report said that Afghan nationals were rounded up in police raids and sent to deportation centres. Speaking at the launch of the report, HRCP secretary-general Harris Khalique said the economic crisis in 2023 had 'pushed tens of millions of ordinary citizens to the brink of desperation.'Speaking on incidents of enforced disappearances, Harris Khalique condemned the role and performance of the Commission of Inquiry of Enforced Disappearances and termed it 'disgraceful,' Dawn reported.HRCP chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt called it critical for the state to fulfil people's rights to education, livelihood and health. He also expressed concern over the low rate of trade unionisation. HRCP Islamabad Vice-Chair Nasreen Azhar said religion continued to be 'weaponized for political purposes'.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed concerns over increasing political polarisation in the country.
