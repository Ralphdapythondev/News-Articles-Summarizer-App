Pakistan: Human Rights body raises concern about situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-human-rights-body-raises-concern-about-situation-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/articleshow/110925261.cms,"PESHAWAR: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in its annual report, highlighted the precarious situation of human rights, law and order , and issues faced by the people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.HRCP said in a press statement that in the absence of any subsequent provincial election, the citizens in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained ""unrepresented"" throughout the year, with not a single piece of legislation enacted in 2023.Following this, the Peshawar High Court struck down the order to suspend local bodies till the holding of provincial elections . This allowed elected local representatives to continue the provision of services to their electorate. The local elections were subsequently held in August 2023 for 72 key positions in 21 districts.Commenting on the law and order situation in the province, the rights body alleged that over 160 policemen, 70 military personnel, 60 civilians, and more than 170 alleged militants were killed in dozens of targeted militant attacks and security operations in 2023.Attempting to address the situation, Pakistan forcibly deported over 1.5 million documented and 0.7 million undocumented Afghan refugees and migrants from the province following an announcement by the federal caretaker government.Shedding light on the financial issues faced by people, the rights body stated that hundreds of teachers, doctors, health workers, and sanitation workers protested against delays in payment of salaries and other dues in separate demonstrations across the province in 2023.The report also addressed the status of Public health and environmental crises which has been a major issue of concern to the citizens. The HRCP report stated, that at least 11 per cent of the population suffers from drug abuse, and around 40 fatalities from rains, flash floods, and dust storms occur in several districts.Persons with disabilities also remained deprived of essential accessibility measures in most buildings despite court orders, and 4.7 million children, 66 per cent of which included girls, remained out of school in 2023, the report added.According to HRCP's media monitoring for 2023, there were at least 20 cases of domestic violence, 72 cases of sexual violence, 49 'honour' killings, and 246 femicide-related murders that reportedly took place in the province.HRCP cited a report from the Digital Rights Foundation, which stated that 112 complaints related to cyber harassment and gender-based violence were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In January, women councilors from the Khyber district elected in the 2021 local government polls protested the denial of functional authority and development funds to help female constituents of their areas.While over 100 women contested in the polls and several were elected, they had neither been provided offices nor resources, unlike their male counterparts, thereby lowering their status in people's perceptions, the report added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in its annual report, highlighted the precarious situation of human rights, law and order.

US judge strikes down Florida ban on gender-affirming healthcare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-strikes-down-florida-ban-on-gender-affirming-healthcare/articleshow/110924075.cms,"A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that parts of Florida's ban of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender children and restrictions on gender-affirming healthcare for adults are unconstitutional and ordered that it not be enforced.Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed the restrictions into law in 2023, banning people under the age of 18 from receiving puberty blockers or hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria, though the law allowed children who had begun receiving gender-affirming care before May 17, 2023, to continue to do so with new restrictions.The law, part of a slew of restrictive legislation in recent years advanced by Republicans to regulate the lives of transgender people, also imposed new restrictions on adults receiving gender-affirming healthcare.US District Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee ruled that all those elements violated the US Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law, noting that some Florida legislators ""plainly acted from old-fashioned discriminatory animus.""""Gender identity is real,"" he wrote in his order, ruling that it was unconstitutional to discriminate against transgender people. ""In time, discrimination against transgender individuals will diminish, just as racism and misogyny have diminished.""A spokesperson for DeSantis, who signed the ban into law shortly before announcing his failed bid to become the Republican nominee for the US presidential election, said the state would appeal the ruling and referred to gender-affirming healthcare as an aspect of ""radical, new age 'gender ideology.'""""These procedures do permanent, life-altering damage to children, and history will look back on this fad in horror,"" the spokesperson, Julia Friedland, said in a statement.The judge noted that doctors who treat transgender patients, multiple medical associations and the US Department of Health have widely accepted that the therapies banned by Florida are ""well-established standards of care for treatment of gender dysphoria.""Several parents of transgender children, who were plaintiffs in the lawsuit, gave testimony to the court that gender-affirming healthcare was allowing their children to flourish and be happy. A transgender man, another plaintiff, testified that Florida's new restrictions had interrupted his taking of testosterone when his prescription lapsed, causing distress, anxiety and depression.Because the law allowed healthcare providers to continue providing puberty blockers or hormone therapy to children and adults who are not transgender, Hinkle ruled that the law unconstitutionally discriminated on the basis of sex.Doctors who violated the law faced up to five years in prison.The judge noted that Florida lawmakers and Governor DeSantis, in passing the law, spoke openly about their moral disapproval of transgender people. This hindered the state's lawyers from successfully arguing that the law was a good-faith effort to regulate healthcare and not motivated by unconstitutional discriminatory animus.""The statute and the rules were an exercise in politics, not good medicine,"" the judge wrote. ""The great weight of medical authority supports these treatments.""","A federal judge ruled that parts of Florida's ban of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender children are unconstitutional.

"49 feared dead, 140 missing after a migrant boat sinks off Yemen, says UN",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/49-feared-dead-140-missing-after-a-migrant-boat-sinks-off-yemen-says-un/articleshow/110923902.cms,"CAIRO: A boat carrying migrants sank off the coast of Yemen, leaving at least 49 dead and 140 missing, the UN's International Organization for Migration said Tuesday.

The boat was carrying some 260 Somalis and Ethiopians from the northern coast of Somalia on the 320-kilometer (200-mile) journey across the Gulf of Aden when it sank Monday off Yemen's southern coast, the IOM said in a statement.

It said search efforts were continuing and so far 71 had been rescued. Among the dead were 31 women and six children, it said.

Yemen is a major route for migrants from the East Africa and the Horn of Africa trying to reach Gulf countries for work. Despite a nearly decadelong civil war in Yemen, the number of migrants arriving annually tripled from 2021 to 2023, soaring from about 27,000 to over 90,000, the IOM said last month. Around 380,000 migrants are currently in Yemen, according to the agency.

To reach Yemen, migrants are taken by smugglers on often dangerous, overcrowded boats across the Red Sea or Gulf of Aden. In April, at least 62 people died in two shipwrecks off the coast of Djibouti as they tried to reach Yemen. The IOM said at least 1,860 people have died or disappeared along the route, including 480 who drowned.

Monday's sinking ""is another reminder of the urgent need to work together to address urgent migration challenges and ensure the safety and security of migrants along migration routes,"" said IOM spokesperson Mohammedali Abunajela.

Imran Khan has given green signal for talks with government: PTI chairman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-has-given-green-signal-for-talks-with-govt-pti-chairman/articleshow/110923875.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan has given a green signal for talks with the government and is ""ready to forgive"" what has happened to him, his party's chairman Gohar Khan said on Tuesday. ""We told the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) founder that dialogue is necessary, as the distance is widening. He agreed with us (on this),"" Gohar told the media outside the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi.According to Gohar, Khan, 71, wants the avenues of dialogue to be opened. He told journalists that Khan is ""ready to forgive what has happened to him for reconciliation.""""The PTI founder has said many times that 'I am ready to forgive what happened to me',"" Gohar was quoted as saying by Geo TV.The cricketer-turned-politician has been lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail at Rawalpindi since his arrest 10 months ago for his involvement in multiple cases, some of which have resulted in conviction.When asked if the negotiations will take place at the behest of the Supreme Court's advice, Gohar said: ""The option given by the apex court is also under consideration.""However, he emphasised that it is PTI's ""own decision"" to negotiate.""PTI founder did not write any letter to the SC for negotiation. PTI will also respond to its negotiation option.""Gohar said that the party will begin its negotiations after talking to Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai.He said there is an alliance with Achakzai and other parties, and that his party will take them into confidence.""Negotiations can also be held at the alliance level. PTI can also initiate itself,"" said the party's chief, reiterating that there is no option but negotiation.""We have never refused to negotiate. The ice is breaking. We want things to improve,"" said Gohar, insisting that his party's negotiation offer should not be interpreted as a deal.His comment comes days after Khan decided to step back from his rigid stance, ordering his party leaders to establish contacts both inside and outside the Parliament to ease the ongoing political tension, sources told Geo News.The sources said that the party's leadership was directed to hold talks with various political parties outside the Parliament, while its lawmakers were also asked to enhance its relations with parties in the ruling coalition government.Gohar told journalists that the party's founder met with lawyers today and informed them about not being allowed to talk to his sons.Khan's decision came after his interaction with Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa when he appeared for a hearing before the Supreme Court.During the hearing pertaining to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) law amendments, CJP Isa suggested that Khan go to the Parliament to help resolve Pakistan's problems ""as the country needs to move forward"".The former prime minister has given his party's three-member committee the authority to establish contact with the establishment, said the sources.Last week, Khan had said that dialogue would be held only with those who wield real power in the country.""We will talk with those who have power. They (parties in the government) do not have power,"" he said.When pointed out by a journalist that the Supreme Court has also now asked him to talk to other political parties, Khan said he did not even negotiate with (Prime Minister) Shaukat Aziz during the Musharraf era. ""I only spoke to Musharraf's representative,"" he said.Khan said that at the request of former Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, his party negotiated with other political parties on the issue of elections. He said the elections were to be held in 90 days, and alleged that Bandial came under pressure and could not enforce the polls on time.","Imran Khan is ""ready to forgive"" what has happened to him, his party's chairman Gohar Khan says.

4 Israeli soldiers killed in Rafah in apparent ambush,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/4-israeli-soldiers-killed-in-rafah-in-apparent-ambush/articleshow/110923826.cms,"The Israeli military said Tuesday that four Israeli soldiers had been killed and several more wounded after militants blew up a building where the troops were operating in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah .Some of the soldiers were in critical condition after the attack Monday, the military said. Kan, Israel's public broadcaster, said that five soldiers had been hospitalized, and that two were in intensive care.The Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, said in a statement that it had booby-trapped the building where the soldiers were operating. ""Our fighters were able to blow up a house rigged with explosives where Zionist forces had fortified themselves inside,"" it said.The apparent ambush targeted an Israeli reconnaissance unit that was scouting what the soldiers thought was a tunnel shaft inside a three-story building, according to Kan. Israeli forces in Gaza have been focusing on destroying tunnels used by Hamas militants.After the explosives were detonated, Hamas forces attacked with mortar fire as Israeli forces tried to evacuate the dead and wounded, according to both the militant group and the Israeli military.Fighting in Rafah has raged on and off since early May, when Israeli soldiers moved into the southern city despite strong opposition from the international community. For months, Rafah had housed more than half the residents of Gaza. Israeli forces had directed people to take shelter there from fighting elsewhere in the territory.Since the Israeli incursion into Rafah, many displaced Palestinians have fled to central Gaza, which in turn has seen clashes and heavy bombardment since Israel announced new military operations there last week. On Saturday, more than 200 residents of Gaza were killed, according to health authorities, in the central city of Nuseirat during an Israeli military operation that freed four Israeli hostages.In the eight months since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks, a total of 298 of its soldiers have been killed, according to the Israeli military. The toll has been many times higher for residents of Gaza: Local health authorities say more than 36,000 people have been killed, a tally that does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.","Some of the soldiers were in critical condition after the attack, the military says.

"French PM tried to dissuade Macron from polls, offered to resign: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/french-pm-tried-to-dissuade-macron-from-polls-offered-to-resign-report/articleshow/110923785.cms,"No certainty

PARIS: When French President Emmanuel Macron told his young prime minister of his decision to call a snap election just hours before announcing it on television, Gabriel Attal tried to dissuade his boss, asking him to accept his resignation instead, according to sources.""I can be the fall guy,"" Attal implored Macron, after his efforts at dissuasion went nowhere, according to a minister and another government source who spoke on condition of anonymity.Macron declined Attal's offer, and a few hours later, as exit polls showed Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) trouncing his ticket, he dissolved parliament.The resignation bid by Attal, initialy reported by Le Monde newspaper and other French media, underlines how Macron's shock decision to bet the house on snap elections was not universally applauded by his camp and threatened to prematurely curtail their political project. Attal's office did not respond to a request for comment.The 34-year-old Attal, France's youngest ever prime minister when he took office in January, has been mooted as a potential Macron successor in 2027, but now risks losing his job to the RN's 28-year-old party president Jordan Bardella.Attal was unaware of Macron's plans, which he had kept from all but a tiny circle of advisors, the sources said.Among them was Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, another potential successor and snap vote advocate, and Bruno Roger-Petit, an ex-journalist-turned-strategist who has masterminded Macron's rightward shift over the last few years.Macron's calculation, which he had arrived at with close advisors over several weeks before Sunday's announcement, was that it was better to blindside his opponents with an immediate election than wait for inevitable conservative no-confidence motions later in the year when he would be weaker.At a hastily convened cabinet meeting on Sunday night, shortly after announcing the snap vote, stunned ministers listened in silence as Macron said he wanted to give the French people a chance to ""take back control"" of their parliament, and reinstate order in an increasingly chaotic chamber, sources said.""There was surprise, a bit of perplexity, some combativeness from those who were favourable to the option, such as Gerald,"" one source present at the Elysee palace meeting said.Attal, meanwhile, has been tasked by Macron with leading his ticket in the lightening, three-week campaign, the two sources said.Attal has yet to make any public comment since tendering his resignation, although he told lawmakers behind closed doors on Tuesday that the ""die was not cast"" and that he would do everything to ""avoid the worst.""There was also wide concern across Europe.""The problem is what his decision will mean for the rest of us,"" one EU diplomat said.Macron has long been frustrated by the fractious lower house that resulted from the previous parliamentary elections in 2022, when he lost his governing majority, with hard-left lawmakers in particular often using spectacular filibustering tactics.His entourage said the president made his decision after last week's 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, when he met people out and about who said they were tired of endless political infighting in parliament. But the plan came into sharper focus as it became clear Le Pen would inflict a humiliating defeat in Sunday's vote.One source with knowledge of Macron's battle plan said he is convinced he can win, betting that the short campaign - the minimum allowed by the constitution - will wrongfoot his foes.The source said Macron also expects the left to fail to unite this time round, unlike in 2022 when Greens, Socialists and the radical left France Unbowed agreed on a common platform that did well in the two-round voting system.Another source close to Macron said the possibility of giving the RN a platform to display incompetence ahead of the 2027 presidential election for which Le Pen is the frontrunner was also on his mind.""He has no certainty, but he looks at probabilities,"" the source said. ""The top one is that the RN doesn't win. And there is also the possibility the RN wins a simple majority, in which case yes...a show of incompetence.""However, among the Macronistas in the empty corridors of the now-dissolved National Assembly, there was little excitement.""It's never pleasant to campaign,"" said Emmanuel Pellerin, a lawmaker in Macron's camp. ""The times are tough. I can't say we're having fun.""","Gabriel Attal tried to dissuade his boss, asking him to accept his resignation instead.

Missing woman found inside python after 3 days of being eaten alive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/missing-woman-found-inside-python-after-3-days-of-being-eaten-alive/articleshow/110831156.cms,"Image/Lexica.art

NEW DELHI: In a tragic incident, a 45-year-old woman named Farida has been found dead inside the stomach of a reticulated python in Kalempang village , South Sulawesi province, central Indonesia .

The snake, measuring approximately five metres (16 feet) in length, had swallowed her whole, according to village head Suardi Rosi.

Farida, a mother of four, had gone missing on Thursday night and did not return home. Her husband became suspicious after finding her belongings and alerted the villagers, who then initiated a search effort.

They soon located a python with a noticeably large belly. ""They agreed to cut open the python's stomach. As soon as they did, Farida's head was immediately visible,"" said Suardi, a villager. Farida was found fully clothed inside the snake.

Although such occurrences are considered extremely rare, several people in Indonesia have lost their lives in recent years after being swallowed whole by pythons.

In 2022, residents of Tinanggea district in Southeast Sulawesi killed an eight-metre python that was found strangling and consuming one of the local farmers.

Similarly, in 2018, a 54-year-old woman was discovered dead inside a seven-metre python in Muna town, Southeast Sulawesi. The previous year, a farmer in West Sulawesi went missing and was later found to have been eaten alive by a four-metre python at a palm oil plantation.

NEW DELHI: Donald Trump underwent a mandatory presentencing interview on Monday, which concluded after less than 30 minutes of questioning. Trump was interviewed by a New York City probation officer to prepare a report for Judge Juan M Merchan ahead of Trump's July 11 sentencing in his hush money criminal case .This report will assist the judge in determining Trump's punishment following his May 30 felony conviction for falsifying business records related to a potential sex scandal. The judge has a range of options for punishment, from probation and community service to up to four years in prison.Trump, who did not testify during his trial, attended the probation interview via video conference from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. His lawyer, Todd Blanche, was present during the interview. This arrangement has led to complaints of special treatment, but city officials maintain that it is not unusual.Typically, convicted individuals in New York must meet probation officials in person for their presentence interviews and are not allowed to have their lawyers present. However, after Blanche's objections, Judge Merchan allowed him to attend Trump's interview.Public defenders in the city have criticized the special arrangements made for Trump and have called for equal treatment for all convicted individuals. They argued that all defendants should be allowed counsel during their probation interviews, not just those with significant financial resources.Presentence reports include a defendant’s personal history, criminal record, employment details, and any family obligations. These reports, prepared by probation officers, social workers, or psychologists, also offer defendants a chance to explain why they believe they deserve a lighter sentence.Trump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records stems from efforts to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.Trump, who is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, plans to appeal his conviction but must wait until after sentencing.

He will need to navigate these challenges while also addressing the concerns of the French people and the rise of the far-right.

NEW DELHI: France has called for snap parliamentary elections in response to the far-right National Rally party's victory in the recent European Union elections.President Emmanuel Macron's centrist coalition suffered a heavy defeat, securing just 15.2% of the votes compared to the National Rally's 33%.Macron described the decision as ""serious and heavy"" but necessary to maintain faith in France's democracy and give the French people a voice. He expressed deep concern over the progress of far-right parties across Europe and said he ""cannot act as if nothing had happened"" after the National Rally's historic result.The snap elections , scheduled for June 30 and July 7, will determine the political landscape of France just a month before it is set to host the 2024 Olympics.Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Monday said she had been ""stunned"" to hear Macron's decision, describing it as ""unsettling"". ""Like a lot of people I was stunned to hear the president decide to do a dissolution ... such a move just before the Games, it's really something that is extremely unsettling.""Macron's move represents a significant risk, as his party currently lacks a majority in the French parliament.

NEW DELHI: Malawi mourns the loss of its Vice President Saulos Chilima and nine others following a fatal plane crash , confirmed by President Lazarus Chakwera on Tuesday.The wreckage of the military aircraft transporting Vice President Chilima was discovered in a rugged mountainous area in the northern region of the country after an extensive search spanning more than a day. Regrettably, there were no survivors, President Chakwera announced in a somber live address broadcast on state television.The tragic incident unfolded as the aircraft, carrying Vice President Chilima and former first lady Shanil Dzimbiri, among others, vanished from radar during its scheduled 45-minute flight from the capital city, Lilongwe, to Mzuzu in the north.Air traffic controllers redirected the plane away from Mzuzu's airport due to adverse weather conditions and poor visibility, instructing it to return to Lilongwe. However, contact with the aircraft was abruptly lost thereafter, leaving authorities grappling with the unfolding crisis.The aircraft, identified as a small, propeller-driven plane operated by the Malawian armed forces, was carrying seven passengers and three military crew members, according to President Chakwera. The search and rescue operation, spanning a vast forest plantation in the Viphya Mountains near Mzuzu, involved approximately 600 personnel, comprising soldiers, police officers, forest rangers, and volunteers from organizations like the Malawi Red Cross.General Valentino Phiri, commander of the Malawian armed forces, described the challenging terrain and dense forest cover as formidable obstacles impeding search efforts. Despite the daunting conditions, authorities remained resolute in their commitment to locating the wreckage and any possible survivors.President Chakwera expressed gratitude for the international support extended by the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Israel, who offered specialized technologies to aid in the search operation. Assistance from neighboring Zambia and Tanzania was also enlisted, with additional helicopters and drones dispatched to bolster search efforts.Chilima was serving his second term as vice president. He was also in the role from 2014-2019 under former President Peter Mutharika. He was a candidate in the 2019 Malawian presidential election and finished third, behind the incumbent, Mutharika, and Chakwera. The vote was later annulled by Malawi’s Constitutional Court because of irregularities.Chilima then joined Chakwera’s campaign as his running mate in an historic election rerun in 2020, when Chakwera was elected president. It was the first time in Africa that an election result that was overturned by a court resulted in a defeat for the sitting president.Chilima had previously been facing corruption charges over allegations that he received money in return for influencing the awarding of government procurement contracts for the Malawi armed forces and the police, but prosecutors dropped the charges last month. He had denied the allegations, but the case led to criticism that Chakwera’s administration was not taking a hard enough stance against graft.","Malawi mourns the loss of its Vice President Saulos Chilima and nine others following a fatal plane crash.

The dark side of host clubs: Hundreds of women in Japan coerced into sex,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-dark-side-of-host-clubs-hundreds-of-women-in-japan-coerced-into-sex/articleshow/110881740.cms,"NEW DELHI: Japan ’s host clubs , renowned for their glamorous male hosts who entertain female clients, are facing increasing scrutiny over allegations of debt and exploitation . The industry, which thrives on the allure of companionship and luxury, has come under fire as former hosts and clients reveal troubling practices behind the scenes.

As per a CNN report, several ex-hosts described a work environment where debt is often used as a tool of control. One former host, Tatsuya, recounted how he was lured by the promise of high earnings but quickly found himself trapped in a cycle of debt. “They told me I could make a lot of money, but I ended up owing the club more than I made,” Tatsuya said. The pressure to meet sales quotas led many hosts to spend their own money to buy expensive drinks for clients, further deepening their financial woes.

Clients, too, have fallen victim to these practices. Many women, enticed by the attention and affection of hosts, spend exorbitant amounts of money to maintain these relationships. Some end up in significant debt, forced to take on multiple jobs or even engage in sex work to pay off what they owe. “I felt special and wanted, but it came at a huge cost,” said one former client who wished to remain anonymous.

The darker side of the host club industry extends beyond financial exploitation . Reports have emerged of emotional manipulation, where hosts use affection and psychological tactics to encourage clients to spend more. Former host Ryo explained, “We were trained to make clients feel valued and loved, but it was all a strategy to get them to spend more money.”

These revelations have sparked a public outcry and calls for regulatory action. Critics argue that the host club industry preys on vulnerable individuals and perpetuates cycles of debt and exploitation. Advocacy groups are urging the Japanese government to implement stricter regulations to protect both hosts and clients from these predatory practices.

In response to the growing controversy, some host clubs have pledged to reform their business practices. However, many believe that more comprehensive measures are needed to address the systemic issues within the industry. Until then, the glamorous facade of Japan’s host clubs will continue to mask a much grimmer reality for those ensnared in its web.",Japan’s host clubs are facing increasing scrutiny over allegations of debt and exploitation.

""We must always maintain our vigilance and cannot rule out the possibility of taking countermeasures.""In March, two Taiwanese fishermen strayed into Chinese waters near the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen islands, which sit next to China's coast.

US NSA to visit India on June 18 for iCET review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-nsa-to-visit-india-on-june-18-for-icet-review/articleshow/110919711.cms,"This will also be the first meeting between NSAs since the US indicted an Indian national for planning a hit on a Khalistan separatist

NEW DELHI: US NSA Jake Sullivan is likely to visit India next week for a meeting with his counterpart Ajit Doval in which they will undertake a comprehensive review of cooperation under the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET). The meeting was supposed to take place early this year but had to be postponed twice because of Sullivan's preoccupation with the conflict in Gaza.

Sullivan is likely to meet Indian officials on June 18 in what will be the first high-level engagement between the 2 governments after the return of the NDA government under PM Narendra Modi. Indian officials are waiting for the US to formally announce the visit in a few days.

This will also be the first meeting between the NSAs since the US indicted an Indian national for planning a hit on a Khalistan separatist - a US national - claiming he did so at the behest of an Indian government official. The Washington Post revealed the identity of the official in a report last month.

Biden and Modi had launched iCET in May 2022 to expand strategic technology partnership, with focus on co-production and co-development, and defence industrial cooperation between the 2 countries. The meeting will see talks on plans under the same initiative to address regulatory barriers and develop a new defence industrial roadmap for joint development and production, including of jet engines. Talks are also expected on the progress in implementing the GE-HAL jet engine technology deal which is expected to see unprecedented transfer of technology from the US to India. The deal was announced during Modi’s state visit to the US last year.

However, Sullivan’s meetings here will also be closely followed for what he has to say on Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun foiled murder-for-hire plot which can potentially turn into a major irritant in the relationship. The US is pressing India for action against the Indian official who allegedly masterminded the plot to eliminate Pannun, a US and Canadian national.

The 2 sides are expected to discuss progress in the probe that India is carrying out into the case since November last year, after having received information from the US. The Indian government maintains that it is investigating the leads shared by the US because these have a bearing on India’s own security. The US has also been pushing India to join the Canadian probe into the killing of another Sikh separatist last year near Vancouver.

A White House readout of President Joe Biden's call with Modi last week had said they also discussed Sullivan’s upcoming travel to New Delhi to engage the new government on ""shared US-India priorities, including the trusted, strategic technology partnership"".

US military to introduce new uncrewed aircraft for vertical take-off and landing operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-military-to-introduce-new-uncrewed-aircraft-for-vertical-take-off-and-landing-operations/articleshow/110917384.cms,"NEW DELHI: The US military is set to introduce new uncrewed aircraft capable of carrying weapons and performing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) operations. These experimental vehicles, known as X-planes , could be ready for test flights as early as 2026, according to the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ).DARPA's Advanced Aircraft Infrastructure-less Launch And Recovery ( ANCILLARY ) program is entering a new testing phase, where proposed designs will undergo risk assessment and efficiency analysis. The project aims to develop X-planes that can operate from aircraft carriers without the need for runways, supporting ground crew, or infrastructure, enabling them to function in a wider range of battlefield environments.""X-plane"" is a classifier used by the US department of defence (DOD) for experimental aircraft. Past X-planes include the Bell X-1 — the first crewed vehicle to break the sound barrier in conventional flight — and the X-15, which broke records in aerospace such as previously unachievable airspeeds and the successful use of novel propulsion techniques.Several defence and aerospace contractors, including AeroVironment, Griffon Aerospace, Karem Aircraft, Method Aeronautics, Northrop Grumman, and Sikorsky (a Lockheed Martin subsidiary), are bidding for the project.Each company has proposed unique designs for achieving VTOL capabilities, such as Sikorsky's battery-powered craft that props itself on its tail and takes off like a helicopter, and Karem Aircraft's heavy-fuel-driven vehicle that uses a tilting rotor for vertical take-off and hovering.DARPA's goal is to increase its use of uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) threefold in the coming years. The small size and low weight of ANCILLARY X-planes would allow the Navy to store more of these vehicles aboard ships compared to helicopters, launching them directly from the deck without the need for specialized equipment.""Our performers are searching for innovative ways to increase payload weight and range/endurance of small, ship-launched UAS by means of novel configurations, propulsion, and controls while also removing the need for special infrastructure,"" said Steve Komadina, DARPA program manager for ANCILLARY, in DARPA's press release.The ANCILLARY program is currently in phase 1b, with testing scheduled to run for 10 months from June 2024 to spring 2025. During this period, DARPA will evaluate the manufacturers' designs based on system safety and hover tests.The project will then progress to phase 2, where participants will propose details for X-plane design, construction, and test plans. Flight tests for the most promising designs are expected to begin in early 2026. Komadina also noted that future improvements to ANCILLARY systems could be achieved through advancements in sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and autonomous vehicle technology.","US military is set to introduce new uncrewed aircraft capable of carrying weapons and performing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) operations.

US President Joe Biden's son Hunter convicted of all three felony charges in gun trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hunter-biden-convicted-on-all-three-felony-charges-in-gun-trial/articleshow/110916748.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hunter Biden has been convicted of all three felony charges related to his 2018 purchase of a revolver. Prosecutors argued that the president’s son lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs. The jury found him guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application, and illegally possessing the firearm for 11 days.Facing up to 25 years in prison, Biden will be sentenced by Judge Maryellen Noreika. However, first-time offenders typically do not receive the maximum sentence, and it is uncertain if he will serve any prison time.Reacting to the conviction, Hunter Biden said that he's grateful for support from family and friends but 'disappointed' by the verdict.The Hunter Biden case, brought by US Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss—a Trump appointee—includes charges of three felony and six misdemeanor tax offenses in California. Weiss also alleges that Hunter Biden failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019, while spending millions on drugs, escorts, exotic cars, and other high-ticket items.The trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Trump, marking the first time a former US president was found guilty of a felony. Trump, the Republican challenger, is set to face Democrat Joe Biden in the November 5 election.President Joe Biden has avoided the Delaware courtroom where his son was tried and has commented little on the case, conscious of not appearing to interfere in a matter prosecuted by his own Justice Department. Democratic allies are concerned about the emotional toll on the 81-year-old president, who has long worried about his son’s health and sobriety.Hunter Biden and Trump both claim they are victims of politically motivated prosecutions. While Trump insisted the verdict against him was rigged, President Biden reacted to the conviction he will accept the verdict and will not seek to pardon his son.President Biden issued a statement affirming his unwavering support for his son, alongside First Lady Jill Biden but emphasized his commitment to respecting the judicial process and indicated his readiness to accept the outcome, while also noting Hunter's consideration of an appeal.Expressing their enduring love and support, President Biden underscored their pride in the person Hunter has become, despite the challenges he has faced. He acknowledged the struggles many families endure with loved ones battling addiction, drawing attention to the shared sense of pride in witnessing their strength and resilience in recovery. “So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,"" said Biden.Hunter Biden's legal troubles are not over. He faces a September trial in California for failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes, and congressional Republicans plan to continue their impeachment efforts against President Biden. The president has not been accused of any wrongdoing in these investigations.During the trial, the prosecution emphasized the severity of Hunter Biden's drug addiction, presenting personal testimonies and embarrassing evidence. Jurors heard from his ex-wife and a former girlfriend about his habitual crack cocaine use and saw images and videos depicting his addiction. Although Hunter Biden did not testify, prosecutors played excerpts from his 2021 memoir ""Beautiful Things,"" where he describes his struggle with addiction.The prosecution argued that this evidence was crucial to show Hunter Biden was addicted when he purchased the gun, making his denial on the form a lie. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell contended that Hunter's state of mind was different at the time of the purchase and that he did not consider himself addicted then. Lowell suggested that Hunter might have acknowledged a drinking problem but not a drug problem, and alcohol abuse does not disqualify one from purchasing a firearm.Hunter Biden had hoped to resolve the federal investigation with a plea deal last year, avoiding a trial close to the 2024 election. The deal, which included pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and avoiding prosecution for the gun charge if he remained out of trouble for two years, fell apart after Judge Noreika raised concerns about its unusual terms. Subsequently, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Delaware’s US Attorney David Weiss as a special counsel, leading to Hunter Biden’s indictment in August.Hunter Biden claims that the charges were a result of the Justice Department yielding to Republican pressure, alleging he received special treatment. The investigation into the revolver began when Hallie Biden, Beau’s widow, found it unloaded in Hunter's truck and disposed of it in a garbage can, where it was later discovered by a man who retrieved it inadvertently. Hallie, who had a romantic relationship with Hunter after Beau's death, eventually called the police. The case was initially closed due to Hunter’s lack of cooperation, where he was considered the victim.(With inputs from agencies)","Hunter Biden found guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application, and illegally possessing the firearm for 11 days.

Blinken welcomes UN vote in favor of Gaza cease-fire plan and again calls on Hamas to accept it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-welcomes-un-vote-in-favor-of-gaza-cease-fire-plan-and-again-calls-on-hamas-to-accept-it/articleshow/110902598.cms,"TEL AVIV: Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that the U.N. Security Council’s vote in favor of a U.S.-backed proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza made it “as clear as it possibly could be” that the world supports the plan, as he again called on Hamas to accept it.“Everyone’s vote is in, except for one vote, and that’s Hamas,” Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv after meeting with Israeli officials. Blinken said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had “reaffirmed his commitment to the proposal” when they met late Monday.Blinken's latest visit to the region — his eighth since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack ignited the war — is focused on rallying support for the cease-fire proposal, boosting the entry of humanitarian aid and advancing postwar plans for Gaza's governance. He is traveling on to Jordan as well as Qatar, which along with Egypt has served as a key mediator with Hamas.The proposal, announced by President Joe Biden last month, calls for a three-phased plan in which Hamas would release the rest of the hostages in exchange for a lasting cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The group is still holding around 120 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead.Biden presented it as an Israeli proposal, but Netanyahu has publicly disputed key aspects of it, saying Israel won’t end the war without destroying Hamas and returning all the hostages.Hamas has not yet formally responded to the proposal. The militant group welcomed the U.N. resolution and supports the broad outline of the agreement but has demanded assurances it will be implemented. The militant group embraced a similar proposal last month that was rejected by Israel.“Efforts are continuing to study and clarify some matters to ensure implementation by the Israeli side,” Hamas spokesman Jihad Taha said Tuesday. Israel “has not given clear approval or commitments to implementation that would lead to ending the aggression,” he said.On Monday, the U.N. Security Council voted overwhelmingly to approve the proposal, with 14 of the 15 members voting in favor and Russia abstaining. The resolution calls on Israel and Hamas “to fully implement its terms without delay and without condition.”The proposal has raised hopes of ending an 8-month war that has killed over 37,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, and driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Israeli restrictions and ongoing fighting have hindered efforts to bring humanitarian aid to the isolated coastal enclave, fueling widespread hunger.The war began when Hamas and other militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Over 100 hostages were released during a weeklong cease-fire last year in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.Biden’s May 31 announcement of the new proposal said it would begin with an initial six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes.Phase one also requires the safe distribution of humanitarian assistance “at scale throughout the Gaza Strip,” which Biden said would lead to 600 trucks with aid entering Gaza every day.In phase two, the resolution says that with the agreement of Israel and Hamas, “a permanent end to hostilities, in exchange for the release of all other hostages still in Gaza, and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza” will take place.Phase three would launch “a major multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of the remains of any deceased hostages still in Gaza to their families.”The conflicting signals from Netanayahu appear to reflect his political dilemma. His far-right coalition allies have rejected the proposal and have threatened to bring down his government if he ends the war without destroying Hamas. A lasting cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza would likely allow Hamas to retain control of the territory and rebuild its military capabilities.But Netanyahu is also under mounting pressure to accept a deal to bring the hostages back. Thousands of Israelis, including families of the hostages, have demonstrated in favor of the U.S.-backed plan.The transition from the first to the second phase appears to be a sticking point. Hamas wants assurances that Israel will not resume the war, and Israel wants to ensure that protracted negotiations over the second phase do not prolong the cease-fire indefinitely while leaving hostages in captivity.Blinken said the proposal would bring an immediate cease-fire and commit the parties to negotiate an enduring one. “The cease-fire that would take place immediately would remain in place, which is manifestly good for for everyone. And then we’ll have to see,” Blinken said.",Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the U.N. Security Council’s vote in favor of a U.S.-backed proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza made it “as clear as it possibly could be” Blinken is on his eighth visit to the region since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack ignited the war.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110902576,imgsize-51936,width-400,resizemode-4/110902576.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A dog helped his owner get rescued after a car accident in the mountains of northeastern Oregon in US. Brandon Garrett was traveling with his four dogs on a secluded US Forest Service road on June 2, when his vehicle veered off the path and crashed into a deep ravine, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a news release on Facebook.One of the dogs named Blue, managed to make its way to the campsite where the man's family was staying, covering a distance of nearly four miles, which alerted them that something was wrong.""Blue's appearance prompted Brandon Garrett's family and friends to search for him during the night of June 2 and the next morning,"" the Baker County Sheriff's Office said.The following day, the family located the Brandon's car but was unable to reach it due to the treacherous terrain and promptly called 911 for assistance.Upon arriving at the scene, authorities heard the man's cries for help and discovered him approximately 100 yards (91 metres) from the wrecked vehicle. Despite his injuries, Brandon had managed to crawl out of the car after the crash.To reach the stranded individual, US Forest Service personnel used chainsaws to clear a path through the dense vegetation, allowing search and rescue teams to set up an intricate rope system that spanned the width of the ravine.Once the rescue team reached the man, they secured him in a rescue stretcher and attached it to the ropes. The ropes were then utilised as a pulley system to safely transport Brandon across the ravine, with a raging stream flowing beneath them.The sheriff's office shared photos documenting the complex rescue operation. The man was then airlifted to a regional hospital for medical treatment, while his three other dogs were found alive at the crash site.","A dog named Blue helped his owner get rescued after a car accident in the mountains of northeastern Oregon in US.

The correlation study hints at the risk of Bitcoin being tossed around in the Treasury market’s wake.Bitcoin wobbled on Tuesday, sliding as much as 2.8% to a one-week low and hovering at $67,840 as of 2:18 p.m. in Singapore. Smaller tokens such as Ether and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin also nursed losses.Bitcoin hit a record of $73,798 in mid-March, lifted by inflows into dedicated US exchange-traded funds. But it struggled for new highs in the past three months. For Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty, Bitcoin’s recent failed attempts to crack all-time peaks rings “alarm bells.”‘Lack’ of Progress“The lack of upside progress in recent weeks is concerning given the significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs recently which have thus far failed to turn the dial,” Sycamore said. “The next 36 hours is going to be crucial.”A net $15.6 billion has poured into the ETFs since their January launch. On Monday, $65 million was pulled from the products, snapping a run of 19 straight days of subscriptions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The inflation data are expected to show price pressures running well ahead of the US central bank’s comfort zone. At the turn of the year, investors were wagering on a slew of Fed rate reductions, but now the debate is whether future easing will amount to only a smallish tweak of policy.An outlook of higher for longer borrowing costs could be a challenging backdrop for a speculative asset like Bitcoin, which has already more than quadrupled since the start of 2023 in a comeback from a deep bear market.Fairlead Strategies LLC technical analyst Katie Stockton in a research note flagged “neutral” short-term momentum for the digital token based on chart patterns, while adding that long-term prospects are more positive.The crypto market “is like a junkie that constantly needs bullish news to stay up,” said Anand Gomes, co-founder of Paradigm, a derivatives platform. “So when there is none, the path of least resistance is lower.”","A 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and the US 10-year Treasury yield is at minus 53.

"No matter who wins, both Biden and Trump can likely agree on one thing: doing less in the Middle East",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-matter-who-wins-both-biden-and-trump-can-likely-agree-on-one-thing-doing-less-in-the-middle-east/articleshow/110896266.cms,"SYDNEY: Prior to the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel , US national security adviser Jake Sullivan posited that the Middle East had been ""quieter than it has been for decades"".This is obviously no longer the case. On the contrary, the heart wrenching state of the region has inflamed tensions and inspired generation defining protests across the world.This unrest has led many to wonder if the Biden administration's Middle East policies will ultimately undermine the president's re-election campaign against former president Donald Trump in November.It ultimately may. But even if the occupant of the White House changes, US policy toward the region largely will not. This is because Biden and Trump will both do everything possible to attain what Sullivan had hoped for an ultimately quieter Middle East.No single US initiative will be more crucial to securing a quieter Middle East than the boosting of ties between regional partners. The groundwork has already been laid through the Abraham Accords, the Arab-Israeli normalisation agreements initiated by the Trump administration and embraced by the Biden administration.The fruits of such efforts became apparent when a diverse coalition featuring the US, France, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates,Saudi Arabia , Jordan and Israel worked together to down 300 Iranian projectiles launched at Israel on April 13. It was the first direct attack by Tehran against Israel in their decades long shadow war.The coalition's joint response marked dramatic progress towards a long-term and bipartisan US goal for the Middle East: a level of regional co-operation and stabilisation that will finally allow for a decreased US footprint.As much as Trump may not have appreciated certain US alliances as much as his predecessors, it is safe to assume that whoever occupies the White House next year will likely seek to build on these regional alliances. There are a number of reasons for this.First, the scope and severity of Iran 's destabilising conduct in the region has only increased.Iranian proxy militant groups across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Gaza have displayed unprecedented levels of aggression in recent years. It's debatable whether Iran was fully aware of Hamas' attack on October 7, but Tehran undeniably continues to financially support the group.Iran has been no less aggressive in its own conduct. In addition to its unprecedented attack on Israel in April, this has included:1. Alleged plots to assassinate former senior US government officials2. Further increasing its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons grade levels3. Extensive international hostage-taking4. Ever-closer alignment with Russia, North Korea and China.Second, Iran's conduct has undoubtedly contributed to stronger ties between Israel and the Arab world. Such ties have persisted albeit more quietly since the start of the war in Gaza.Jordan's King Hussein, who rules over a mostly Palestinian population, may be a vociferous critic of Israel's conduct in Gaza, but he nonetheless benefits from record levels of Israeli gas and desalinised water going to his energy poor and water scarce country.The Egyptian economy is so reliant on Israeli energy that Egyptians endured rolling blackouts when Israel briefly cut gas exports at the start of the war.The UAE and Israel have only deepened their commercial, political and military links after their new Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement went into effect last year.While the UAE has repeatedly condemned Israel for its actions in Gaza, bilateral trade actually increased by 7 percent in the first quarter of 2024.Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, both republicans and democrats agree on the need to shift US attention and resources to the Indo-Pacific region .This is not lost on US partners in the Middle East.This is why the Biden administration both endorsed and continued two of the Trump administration's top diplomatic initiatives in the region the Abraham Accords and the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.The reason is the longstanding, bipartisan sentiment that the US should not expend further resources or, even worse, lose more US lives in the Middle East.On Gaza, Trump has urged Israel to wrap up its operations, saying: ""Israel has to be very careful, because you're losing a lot of the world, you're losing a lot of support.""The Biden administration's public and private urgings for Israeli restraint in Gaza make clear it also has little interest in being further enmeshed in the Middle East.No matter who wins in November, both Trump and Biden would be vexed if Israel and Hamas' war continued in January 2025. They would also be equally concerned if Hamas resumed attacks on Israel. But neither wants to expend any more than the bare minimum of political capital to resolve the situation.In an era in which the US is producing more of its own energy and US fears of terrorism are decreasing, American citizens and politicians alike would much prefer its allies in the Middle East take care of their own security. The US role in the region remains integralDespite this desire for the US to pull back from the region, the next president still has a critical role to play.The normalisation of Saudi-Israeli relations, for example, is undoubtedly the most important goal of the Abraham Accords. And this will prove challenging without a binding US security guarantee for Saudi Arabia, a Saudi-US civil nuclear agreement, and increased US support for an independent Palestinian state.The US military presence in the region will also continue to prove integral to uniting the diverse coalition of countries countering Iran's increasing influence. After all, it was the US Central Command's extensive co-ordination that enabled the international response to Iran's April 13 attack on Israel.A future US role in the region could perhaps best be described as ""leading from behind"" though no US president has said or likely ever will say that explicitly.Instead, the winner of November's election will publicly champion regional ""stability"". And on this front, bolstering a regional coalition will remain the primary strategy and could, ultimately, be the foundation for peace.","No single US initiative will be more crucial to securing a quieter Middle East than the boosting of ties between regional partners.

Republican contenders for Mitt Romney's open US Senate seat clash over support for Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/republican-contenders-for-mitt-romneys-open-us-senate-seat-clash-over-support-for-trump/articleshow/110893581.cms,"SALT LAKE CITY: Three of the four Utah republicans vying for the seat of retiring US Sen. Mitt Romney sought to portray themselves as the most loyal to former president Donald Trump during Monday's primary debate , while the likely frontrunner stood out as someone willing to challenge party leadership .The state's marquee race is expected to test Trump's broad influence in Utah, one of the few red states that has been hesitant to embrace him. The former president's day-off endorsement of a little-known mayor helped the local official to win the party nomination over nearly a dozen contenders at the April convention, but may carry less weight with voters statewide.Romney has long been the face of the party's moderate wing, and his retirement from the senate opens a door for more conservative candidates. Observers are closely watching whether voters select a successor whose politics align more with Romney's or with Utah's other US senator, Trump ally Mike Lee.While moderate US Rep. John Curtis is considered the favourite going into the June 25 primary, convention victor Trent Staggs and former Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson, another Trump supporter, could push Utah politics further right in the post-Romney era.Curtis, Wilson and businessman Jason Walton had already qualified for the primary ballot through signature gathering before the convention and joined Staggs on the debate stage Monday night.Staggs, 49, repeatedly touted Trump's endorsement and argued the former president was a victim of ""political persecution."" Last month, Trump became the first former American president to be convicted of felony crimes when a New York jury found him guilty of all 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor.Staggs criticized Curtis for being the only candidate who had not endorsed Trump's reelection bid and gave him an opportunity to do so. The congressman responded that he had already pledged to support the party nominee, which is now Trump, but offered no real endorsement.""Serving with him is a degree of difficultly of a 10,"" Curtis said. ""When president Trump is doing anything that I consider aligned with Utah values, and I can check off a pretty good list, I'm wind at his back. But I'm not going to give him an unconditional yes to anything he wants.""All four men described their style of conservatism similarly, sharing a desire to reduce government spending and limit federal overreach.Wilson, who is endorsed by Gov. Spencer Cox and other top state officials, insisted he's already had the greatest impact on Utah residents as a state legislative leader. As House speaker, he oversaw years of tax cuts and budget negotiations that he said will help him fight federal overspending.The 55-year-old from Kaysville also touted plans to soften federal regulations that he said stand in the way of local officials detaining immigrants who are living in the US illegally. He stressed a need to finish Trump's border wall between the US and Mexico, and dug up a 2017 interview in which Curtis had said the construction project ""carries all of this pent-up racism.""Curtis said the comment was taken out of context and clarified his support for securing the border.He has been compared to Romney for pushing back against hardliners in his party, particularly on climate change, but has distanced himself from the retiring senator while campaigning for his seat. The 64-year-old republican congressman and former mayor of Provo began his political career as a county-level Democratic Party official. He's now the longest-serving member of Utah's US House delegation and has pitched himself as the only candidate who already understands the inner workings of Capitol Hill.Staggs, on the other hand, built his base by calling state GOP delegates and courting the endorsements of Trump and many of his allies nationwide. The mayor of Riverton, a suburb south of Salt Lake City, was the first candidate to enter the senate race, even before Romney announced he was not seeking reelection. However, his convention victory might not translate to success at the ballot box, as Republican Party nominations historically have had little bearing on the decisions of Utah voters.The winner of the republican senate primary will face democrat Caroline Gleich, a mountaineer and environmental activist, in November. Utah has not elected a democrat to the US Senate since 1970.Earlier Monday, US Rep. Celeste Maloy, who is seeking her first full term representing Utah's 2nd District after winning a special election last fall, defended her brief congressional tenure in a debate with challenger Colby Jenkins, who tried to paint her willingness to work across the aisle as kowtowing to democrats.Jenkins, a retired US army officer and telecommunications specialist, beat Maloy at the party convention this year after receiving Lee's endorsement, but not by a wide enough margin to bypass the primary. He used his time on the debate stage Monday to call for Trump's return to the White House, while Maloy justified her votes for several bipartisan spending packages. The winner of the competitive primary will face democratic nominee Nathaniel Woodward, a family law attorney, in November.Republican candidates for governor, attorney general and Curtis' open US House seat will face off in debates on Tuesday and Wednesday.","Three of the four Utah republicans vying for the seat of retiring US Sen.

2 Bronx men plead guilty to drug charges in fentanyl poisoning of toddler who died at daycare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/2-bronx-men-plead-guilty-to-drug-charges-in-fentanyl-poisoning-of-toddler-who-died-at-daycare/articleshow/110889797.cms,"(Phot credit: AP)

NEW YORK: Two men connected to a toddler 's fatal opioid overdose at a New York City daycare have pleaded guilty to drug charges and causing bodily harm, prosecutors said.

The men admitted to storing fentanyl in the floorboards of a Bronx daycare's playroom, prosecutors said.

Felix Herrera Garcia, 35 pleaded guilty Monday to three felony drug trafficking charges, including narcotics possession with intent to distribute resulting in serious bodily injury. Prosecutors said they secured a guilty plea from Parras Paredes, 38, on one similar count. Both men are from the Bronx.

One 22-month-old child, Nicholas Dominici, died from ingesting fentanyl at the Divino Nino daycare in September. Three other children survived after medics administered the overdose-reversing drug Narcan.

Herrera fled the US after the overdoses and was on the run in Mexico for about two weeks before he was arrested. Herrera's wife, allegedly the operator of the daycare, along with one other person, were charged separately with murder, narcotics possession, and assault.

Herrera and Paredes face a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison, prosecutors said.

Baltimore shipping channel fully reopens after bridge collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimore-shipping-channel-fully-reopens-after-bridge-collapse/articleshow/110888632.cms,"BALTIMORE: The main shipping channel into Baltimore’s port has fully reopened to its original depth and width following the March 26 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge , which blocked most maritime traffic into the harbor.Officials announced the full reopening in a news release Monday evening. It comes after a massive cleanup effort as crews removed an estimated 50,000 tons of steel and concrete from the Patapsco River.The channel was blocked by wreckage of the fallen bridge, which collapsed after a container ship lost power and crashed into one of its supporting columns, sending six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths. All of the victims were Latino immigrants working an overnight shift to fill potholes on the bridge.The Port of Baltimore , which processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country, was effectively closed for several weeks while the wreckage was removed. Crews were able to reopen portions of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks.On May 20, the wayward cargo ship Dali was refloated and guided back to port. The vessel had been stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow.After the Dali was moved, crews opened a channel that was 50 feet (15 meters) deep and 400 feet (122 meters) wide. The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet (213 meters) wide, which means two-way traffic can resume, officials said. They said other additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width.Thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their jobs impacted by the collapse, prompting local and state officials to prioritize reopening the port and restoring its traffic to normal capacity in hopes of easing the economic ripple effects .The announcement Monday means the commerce that depends on the busy port can begin ramping back up.Officials said a total of 56 federal, state and local agencies participated in the salvage operations, including about 500 specialists from around the world who operated a fleet of 18 barges, 22 tugboats, 13 floating cranes, 10 excavators and four survey boats.“I cannot overstate how proud I am of our team,” said Col. Estee Pinchasin, Baltimore district commander for the Army Corps of Engineers. “It was incredible seeing so many people from different parts of our government, from around our country and all over the world, come together in the Unified Command and accomplish so much in this amount of time.”In a statement Monday, Pinchasin also acknowledged the loss of the victims’ families.“Not a day went by that we didn’t think about all of them, and that kept us going,” she said.The Dali lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka in the early hours of March 26. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation found it experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the collapse.Officials have said they hope to rebuild the bridge by 2028.","The main shipping channel into Baltimore’s port has fully reopened to its original depth and width.

NEW DELHI: Baltimore's main shipping channel has reopened to its original depth and width following the March 26 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge . The reopening follows an extensive cleanup effort , during which crews removed an estimated 50,000 tons of steel and concrete from the Patapsco River.

The US Army Corps of Engineers certified the riverbed as safe for transit on Monday, confirming that the Fort McHenry Federal Channel has been restored to its original dimensions of 700 feet wide and 50 feet deep. This allows for two-way traffic and removes the additional safety requirements that had been in place due to the temporarily reduced channel width.

The channel had been obstructed by the wreckage of the bridge, which collapsed after a container ship, the Dali , lost power and crashed into one of bridge's supporting columns. The incident resulted in the deaths of six members of a roadwork crew, all of whom were Latino immigrants working an overnight shift to fill potholes on the bridge.

The operation involved more than 1,500 individual responders and 500 specialists from around the world, utilizing a fleet of boats. The effort included 56 federal, state, and local agencies. Surveying and removal of steel at and below the 50-foot mud-line will continue to ensure future dredging operations are not impacted, with wreckage transported to Sparrows Point for further processing.

In April, the FBI opened a criminal investigation into the collapse. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the Dali had lost electrical power several times before the crash, including experiencing a blackout during in-port maintenance and shortly before the collision. Maryland estimates it will cost $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion to rebuild the bridge, with completion anticipated by fall 2028.

Jurors in Hunter Biden’s gun trial begin deliberating whether he’s guilty of federal firearm charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jurors-in-hunter-bidens-gun-trial-begin-deliberating-whether-hes-guilty-of-federal-firearm-charges/articleshow/110887170.cms,"WILMINGTON: Jurors in Hunter Biden ’s gun trial began deliberating Monday whether the president’s son is guilty of federal firearms charges over a revolver he bought in 2018 when prosecutors say he was addicted to crack cocaine.He's charged with three felonies in the case that has laid bare some of the darkest moments of his drug-fueled past. Prosecutors have used testimony from former romantic partners, personal text messages and photos of Hunter Biden with drug paraphernalia or partially clothed to make the case that he broke the law.“No one is above the law,” prosecutor Leo Wise told jurors in his closing argument as first lady Jill Biden watched from the front row of the Wilmington, Delaware, courtroom.Jurors deliberated for less than an hour before leaving the courthouse for the day. Deliberations were to resume Tuesday morning.President Joe Biden's son has publicly detailed his struggle with a crack cocaine addiction before getting sober more than five years ago. But the defense sought to show that that he did not consider himself an “addict” when he bought the gun and checked “no” on the form that asked whether he was “an unlawful user"" of drugs or addicted to them.The case has pitted Hunter Biden against his father's Justice Department in the midst of the Democratic president's reelection campaign. The charges were brought by special counsel David Weiss, who was nominated by Republican former President Donald Trump to be U.S. attorney for Delaware and led the yearslong investigation.Before the case went to the jury, the prosecutor urged jurors to focus on the “overwhelming” evidence against Hunter Biden and pay no mind to members of the president's family sitting in the courtroom.“All of this is not evidence,” Wise said, extending his hand and directing the jury to look at the gallery. “People sitting in the gallery are not evidence.”Jill Biden and other family members left the courthouse shortly after deliberations began. The first lady sat through most of the trial, missing only one day last week to attend D-Day anniversary events with the president in France. At one point Monday, Hunter Biden leaned over a railing to whisper in his mother’s ear.Defense attorney Abbe Lowell told jurors in his closing argument that prosecutors had failed to prove their case. Lowell said the his client may have a famous last name, but he is still presumed innocent until proven guilty like any other defendant.“With my last breath in this case, I ask for the only verdict that will hold the prosecutors to what the law requires of them"" — a verdict of not guilty, Lowell said.Hunter Biden's lawyers have suggested he was trying to turn his life around at the time of the gun purchase, having completed a detoxification and rehabilitation program at the end of August 2018. The defense called three witnesses, including Hunter's daughter Naomi, who told jurors that her father seemed be improving in the weeks before he bought the gun.Closing arguments came shortly after the defense rested its case without calling Hunter Biden to the witness stand. Biden didn't elaborate on his decision when he told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika that he was waiving his right to testify , according to a transcript of the sidebar discussion at the bench.Hunter Biden smiled as he chatted with members of his defense team and flashed a thumbs-up sign to a supporter in the gallery after the final witness — an FBI agent called by prosecutors in their rebuttal case.The trial has put a spotlight on a turbulent time in Hunter Biden's life after the 2015 death of his brother, Beau, from brain cancer. The proceedings have played out in the president’s home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington, and Beau Biden was the state's attorney general.Hunter Biden's ex-wife and two former girlfriends testified for prosecutors about his habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean. One woman, who met Hunter Biden in 2017 at a strip club where she worked, described him smoking crack every 20 minutes or so while she stayed with him at a hotel.Jurors have also heard him describe at length his descent into addiction through audio excerpts played in court of his 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things."" The book, written after he got sober, covers the period he had the gun but doesn’t mention it specifically.A key witness for prosecutors was Beau’s widow, Hallie, who had a brief, troubled relationship with Hunter after his brother's death. She found the unloaded gun in Hunter’s truck on Oct. 23, 2018, panicked and tossed it into a garbage can at a grocery store in Wilmington, where a man seeking recyclables inadvertently fished it out of the trash.The prosecutor pointed to text messages he said show Hunter trying to make drug deals in the days around the gun purchase. In one message, Hunter told Hallie he was smoking crack. “That’s my truth,” Hunter wrote.“Take the defendant’s word for it. That’s his truth,” Wise said. He urged jurors to reject the defense's suggestion that Hunter did not really mean what he was texting at the time and was simply trying to avoid being with Hallie.“You don’t leave your common sense behind when you come into that jury box,” Wise said.The defense told jurors that there was no actual witness to drug use by Hunter during the 11 days that he had the gun. Lowell also sought to discredit testimony from Hallie and another ex-girlfriend. He told jurors to consider their testimony “with great care and caution,” noting that they were given immunity agreements in exchange for taking the witness stand for prosecutors.Joe Biden said last week that he would accept the jury’s verdict and ruled out a presidential pardon for his son. After flying back from France, the president was at his home in Wilmington for the day and was expected in Washington in the evening for a Juneteenth concert. He was scheduled to travel to Italy later this week for the Group of Seven leaders conference.Last summer, it looked as if Hunter Biden would avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether, but a deal with prosecutors imploded after the judge, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, raised concerns about it. Hunter Biden also faces a trial scheduled for September on felony charges alleging he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.If convicted in the gun case, he faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.","Hunter Biden is charged with three felonies in the case that has laid bare some of the darkest moments of his drug-fueled past.

Pak PM says his China trip was successful,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-pm-says-his-china-trip-was-successful/articleshow/110919451.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that his trip to China last week was successful, while the opposition parties took him head-on, describing the tour as one that focused mainly on the security of Chinese people in Pakistan.Sharif’s visit came as Islamabad is seeking more foreign investment and looking to boost exports in a time of economic crisis and security concerns .Accompanied by the powerful army chief, General Asim Munir, Sharif took more than 100 Pakistani businessmen with him.Apprising cabinet members of his visit, PM Sharif said that despite the security issue highlighted during engagements with the Chinese leadership and business community, his five-day visit concluded on a “positive note”.“During the conversation with the Chinese ambassador at the banquet hosted by the Communist Party secretary during my visit to Shanxi province, I got a deep feeling that the visit remained very successful,” Sharif remarked, adding that a high-powered Chinese delegation would visit Pakistan soon.A joint statement issued at the end of the visit had stated that China and Pakistan had signed 23 agreements and MoUs in different fields. The joint declaration, however, noted that Beijing would not push businesses to take unwarranted risks or make concessions to Pakistani companies. Instead, the statement said, Beijing would support businesses to invest in Pakistan in line with market and commercial principles.Observers, however, pointed out that obstacles still stand in the way of strengthening Beijing-Islamabad economic collaboration, primarily as a result of Pakistan’s misguided policies.Pakistan is currently experiencing a debt crisis and looking for new loans to pay off previous debt.The total debt that Pakistan owes just to power (electricity) plants established under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) stands at around $7.5 billion. Islamabad also owes nearly $2 billion in circular debt, or unpaid bills, to Chinese electricity producers.During Sharif’s visit, no public statement was issued on restructuring debt but experts believe the issue is crucial and cannot be ignored.Pakistan’s current foreign debt, media reports suggest, is close to $130 billion, and Chinese officials say around 13% of it is owed to China.During the visit, Sharif, along with Gen Munir, also held talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping for more than three hours, indicating that the security of its nationals in Pakistan is a key concern for Beijing. Five Chinese workers were killed in a suicide attack in Pakistan’s northwestern Bisham region in March. Pakistan had blamed Afghanistan-based terrorists for the attack. The ruling Afghan Taliban had rejected Pakistan’s claim, saying Islamabad was trying to sour Kabul’s relations with Beijing.In the joint statement, both sides urged Afghanistan to “firmly combat terrorism, including not allowing its territory to be used for terrorist acts”.","Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that his trip to China last week was successful. Opposition parties took him head-on, describing the tour as one that focused mainly on the security of Chinese people in Pakistan.Sharif’s visit came as Islamabad is seeking more foreign investment and looking to boost exports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110919549,imgsize-22306,width-400,resizemode-4/110919549.jpg"

Modi expressed appreciation for the message, saying the people of India have always stood for peace, security and progressive ideas.“Advancing the well-being and security of our people shall always remain our priority,” said Modi, who did not invite Pakistan for the inauguration of his third term. Modi’s emphasis on security is in line with his government’s long held position that Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism is not conducive for dialogue.Nawaz had just before the election outcome too reached out to India’s incoming government by reiterating his position that it was Pakistan which had violated his 1999 peace agreement with India in the form of the Lahore Declaration through its Kargil offensive. However, his remarks now constitute the first direct peace outreach to India since the coalition government in Pakistan took power earlier this year.Nawaz said Modi’s success in elections reflects the confidence of the people in his leadership. “Let us replace hate with hope and seize the opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia,” said Nawaz, who was recently re-elected president of his party, in a post on X.Coming from the most powerful civilian leader in Pakistan, and one who is known to share a close rapport with Modi himself, the remarks are particularly significant. Modi thanked Shehbaz for his message.It was under Modi and Nawaz - in 2015 when then foreign minister Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad - that the 2 sides had their last substantive bilateral engagement. That dialogue saw India and Pakistan relaunching the dialogue process under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. This was followed by Modi’s famous drop by, and only visit to Pakistan as PM, in Lahore on Nawaz’s birthday but that initiative also quickly fizzled out because of the Pathankot terror attack and later the Uri attack.India has refused to have any diplomatic engagement ever since, except for the Indus Waters Treaty talks, and Pakistan itself decided to downgrade ties by recalling its high commissioner in 2019 after India revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K.The 2 countries will have an opportunity to attempt a reset in ties next month when both PMs travel to Kazakhstan for the SCO summit. However, it’s unlikely India will propose any meeting, given the understanding in the government that Pakistan is yet to act decisively against cross-border terrorism. Official sources also maintain Pakistan has to review its decision to downgrade ties before nursing any thought of forward movement in the relationship.Nawaz’s call for working together also doesn’t sit well with Pakistan’s official position that India must reverse its “unilateral and illegal” measures in J&K for talks to take place. With the Supreme Court upholding the revocation of the special status, the Indian government believes Pakistan cannot have any say in how the internal affairs of J&K are run.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time.

Pakistan installs social media firewall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-installs-social-media-firewall/articleshow/110883200.cms,"Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms (AP photo)

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has started installing a nationwide firewall system to regulate social media platforms and stop the spread of undesirable content. Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms like Facebook, YouTube and X.

The firewall, a senior official said, seeks to identify sources of propaganda material, examine data from various internet protocol addresses and limit the content’s visibility. One of the system’s primary functions is keyword filtering, which identifies and hides offensive content .

Additionally, protocols are being developed to oversee Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which many have employed to evade limitations placed on X, formerly Twitter. Initial restrictions on VPNs drew criticism from the corporate sector, which led the govt to temporarily suspend its implementation.

The X blockade has brought its usage in Pakistan to almost half, from 4.5 million to 2.4 million users. It seems the management of X is gradually adhering to govt directives to block accounts that disseminate fake news, allow conversations on sensitive subjects or circulate contentious ideas.

In April, the home ministry had provided the Islamabad high court a detailed report outlining the rationale for X’s prohibition. The report brought attention to X’s non-registration and its disregard for Pakistani legal requirements.

The report claimed that X’s refusal to comply with Pakistani regulations was the reason for its blocking. It argued that the action did not infringe on fundamental rights.

Nations in West Asia and elsewhere have also reached out to them.Recently, Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan had a meeting in Kabul with Taliban home minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, who also heads the Haqqani network, a powerful faction within the governing group.Kabul had approached New Delhi, through its deputy foreign minister Sher Muhammad Abbas Stanikzai, soon after the formation of the interim govt in Afghanistan in 2021. The correspondence between the two sides had opened a window for communication, which culminated into formal contacts.On the contrary, the ties between Islamabad and Kabul are growing more hostile every day. Kabul’s refusal to curb the alleged activities of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants on its soil has seriously dented relations between the two countries. Travel restrictions on Afghan nationals and the expulsion of Afghan refugees from Pakistan further worsened the ties.Experts suggest that Kabul’s diplomatic efforts will not yield any results until they focus on solving problems such as human rights, women's education and employment.Sweden-based Afghan analyst Nur Rehman Sherzad said that since coming to power in August 2021, the Taliban govt has not formulated any foreign policy.According to him, a govt that is not officially recognised by any country does not have diplomatic and legal status in its relations with the international community and neighbouring countries.“The representatives of the Taliban govt are now gradually realising that the policies of the last three years are not bringing any significant results,” Sherzad said, adding that officials of the international community and other countries in the region visit Afghanistan also to inform Kabul about their security concerns.Describing the acceleration in the Taliban's diplomatic efforts, Arif Yusufzai, an expert on Afghan affairs, told TOI that these types of contacts help build mutual intelligence ties. According to him, the Taliban are making many claims on their own, but they are not doing what the international community is asking them to do. “They are not changing their behaviour at all,” he added.Afghan journalist Abdul Haq Omari believes that Taliban currently face two challenges for the survival of their power. One is to establish formal relations with foreign countries and the other is to maintain their religious narrative internally under which they had fought for two decades.“The survival of the religious narrative is important for the Taliban because if they withdraw suddenly, Taliban's rival groups in Afghanistan, Islamic State or Daesh Khorasan, may strengthen the anti-Taliban narrative,” he added.","Afghan Taliban has intensified its efforts to open different channels of communication with the regional and neighbouring countries.

Additionally, the deeply conservative culture makes it difficult to be openly gay.As a result, the man was transferred to the Sarhad hospital for psychiatric diseases in Peshawar on May 9. He faced significant abuse for his application from local citizens and politicians alike.As per the Telegraph report, the leader of the Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI) party, a conservative religious group, claimed that the applicant's attempt to set up the club followed a recent return from the UK. A local MP from the far-Right Pakistan Awami Tehreek party expressed extreme opposition, stating he would have doused the club with petrol and set it alight, while the party leader, Naseer Khan Nazir, warned of ""very severe consequences"" if the club was allowed to open.Friends of the man, who were also unnamed, expressed fear for his well-being and reported being blocked from visiting him or obtaining any information about him. ""Everyone is afraid that talking about it will put them in danger,"" one friend said. ""I do not know about his well-being for many days,"" they added, noting their unsuccessful attempts to gather information about him.Before his hospitalization, he told the paper, ""I talk about human rights and I want everyone's human rights to be defended."" He emphasized his commitment to advocating for the rights of the most neglected community in Pakistan, saying, ""If the authorities refuse, then I will approach the court, and I hope that like the Indian court, the Pakistani court will rule in favor of gay people.""His application clearly said that there would be ""no gay (or non-gay) sex (other than kissing)"" at the club, with a notice on the wall warning, ""no sex on premises.""

Pakistan and IMF disagree over new income tax rates that will burden salaried class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-and-imf-disagree-over-new-income-tax-rates-that-will-burden-salaried-class/articleshow/110836835.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons and the imposition of a standard 18 per cent sales tax on agriculture and health sector goods, according to a media report on Sunday.On Friday, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) authorities discussed the outstanding issues related to taxation and the energy sector.Citing sources, the Express Tribune newspaper reported that both sides could not resolve their differences on the income tax threshold, the merger of salaried and non-salaried rates and the maximum income tax rate for individuals.Discussions are revolving around whether to charge a new backbreaking 45 per cent income tax from salaried and non-salaried individuals on a monthly income of just over Pakistani Rs 4,67,000, sources said.At present, the maximum rate of 35 per cent applies to a monthly income of over Pakistani Rs 5,00,000.However, both sides have converged on the issue of increasing the income tax burden on exporters in the next budget who paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 86 billion this year, which is 280 per cent less than the taxes paid by the salaried people.Pakistan also showed a willingness to tax pensions beyond a certain income threshold.In the latest talks, the international money lender insisted on merging the slabs related to salaried, non-salaried and other incomes.On the government's proposal of increasing the annual threshold of taxable income to Pakistani Rs 9,00,000, the IMF is asking for the maximum income tax rate to be increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent.However, the government is unwilling to increase the maximum rate for salaried individuals to 45 per cent but showed flexibility to keep the taxable income threshold at the current Pakistani Rs 6,00,000.It is also asking to keep the salaried and non-salaried slabs separate but is willing to increase the highest tax rate for non-salaried persons to 45 per cent, said the sources.The non-salaried business individuals pay tax after excluding expenses while the salaried persons pay tax on their gross income without excluding the expenses.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is until now unwilling to increase the burden on the salaried class .According to a proposal, if the taxable income threshold is increased to Pakistani Rs 900,000 per annum, the income tax rate can be up to 7.5 per cent on a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 100,000. The current rate is 2.5 per cent for this category.For the next slab, if the monthly income is up to Pakistani Rs 133,000, the under-discussion tax rate is 20 per cent. The current rate is 12.5 per cent, that too for up to a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 200,000.The IMF wants a higher rate at the lower income level. This slab will directly hit Pakistan's middle-income group.At present, on an income of over Pakistani Rs 500,000, a 35 per cent tax rate is charged. The salaried class has until now paid Pakistani Rs 325 billion in income tax in 11 months, which is expected to rise to around Pakistani Rs 360 billion at the end of the current fiscal year.If the revised income tax rates are accepted, the tax contribution of the salaried class will jump to Pakistani Rs 540 billion in the next fiscal year, said the sources. To absorb this increase in the tax rates, even a 30 per cent pay hike will not be sufficient.Sources said that the IMF had asked Pakistan to share alternative proposals, in case it was unwilling to increase the tax burden on the salaried class. Another round of discussions is expected soon.Sources said that an understanding had been reached between Pakistan and the IMF on changing the tax regime for the richest exporters.As against the existing one per cent final income tax on exporters, it has been proposed that from the next fiscal year, the one per cent rate should be treated as a minimum, according to government sources.Pakistan's taxation system promotes inequality and puts a higher burden on people who have little capacity to bear it. The IMF has asked Pakistan to end all special tax regimes, like the low-income tax on gains made by investing in the stock market and bank deposits.The global lender has recommended treating these gains as part of normal income. The IMF is pushing Pakistan to increase the burden on the salaried class until the country recovers higher taxes from the non-salaried business individuals.During the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the exporters paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 85.5 billion in taxes, which was Pakistani Rs 241 billion, or 280 per cent, less than the amount paid by the salaried class.During July-May FY24, the salaried class paid Pakistani Rs 326 billion in taxes, higher by 40 per cent, or Pakistani Rs 93 billion, compared to the same period last year.The record Pakistani Rs 326 billion in tax payments by the salaried class is also 223 per cent more than the combined tax paid by the rich exporters and influential retailers.Sources said that there was also no consensus on slapping the standard 18 per cent sales tax on fertiliser, pesticides and seeds – the crucial inputs for the agriculture sector.The government was also unwilling to impose an 18 per cent sales tax on medicines, solar panels and medical and surgical equipment. In case, the 18 per cent tax is imposed on medicines, there will be an additional collection of Pakistani Rs 130 billion in the next fiscal year.Similarly, taxing the medical and health-related supplies will generate another Pakistani Rs 100 billion, according to the paper.Pakistan urgently needs a new loan from the IMF to keep the fear of default at bay. The government is eager to ink the agreement before the end of June when the fiscal year ends.","Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons. The IMF is asking for the maximum income tax rate to be increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent. However, the government is unwilling to increase the maximum rate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110839031,imgsize-60334,width-400,resizemode-4/110839031.jpg"
