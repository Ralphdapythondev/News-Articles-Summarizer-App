'I was sick': Joe Biden looks for excuses in first interview after terrible debate performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-was-sick-joe-biden-looks-for-excuses-in-first-interview-after-terrible-debate-performance/articleshow/111527610.cms,"Joe Biden announced on Friday his decision to remain in the presidential race, attributing his poor debate performance against Donald Trump to a severe cold . This declaration came during a high-stakes interview with ABC network, aimed at reviving his troubled reelection campaign amidst growing concerns among Democratic voters , lawmakers, and donors.""I was sick, I was feeling terrible... We were trying to figure out what's wrong,"" Biden explained in an excerpt from his first television interview since the debate. ""They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold.""Biden's raspy voice and wandering responses in the clip were unlikely to allay the fears of his party. The Trump campaign swiftly mocked him on X, stating, ""Biden sounds great!""The interview came following Biden's terrible debate performance in Atlanta, which sparked panic within his party and led to demands for him to exit the race. In a bid to counter these demands, the Biden campaign released an intensive travel schedule for July, just hours before the ABC interview.Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, Biden delivered a spirited speech, declaring, ""I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump.""As supporters cheered, Biden also attacked his rival, reading from teleprompters. ""Let's focus on what really matters,"" he said. ""We're running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat... to our democracy in American history -- that's not hyperbole.""Recent polls have shown a growing lead in Trump's favor, leading at least three Democratic members of Congress and several major newspapers to call for Biden to step aside. Prominent Democratic donor Abigail Disney voiced her concerns on CNBC, stating she would withhold donations to the party unless Biden drops out, arguing that ""if Biden does not step down the Democrats will lose"" in November.""This is realism, not disrespect,"" she said.Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has urged Biden to participate in more significant interviews. ""It is essential,"" she emphasized.In response, the White House has announced that Biden will hold a press conference during the Nato summit in Washington next Thursday, although details on the format and length are yet to be disclosed.Meanwhile, Trump has challenged Biden to another debate, promising an ""all-on discussion"" and saying he was ready ""anytime, anywhere, any place.""With speculation about a potential change in the Democratic ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris has been thrust into the spotlight. The 59-year-old former prosecutor has publicly supported Biden but remains a leading alternative if he steps down.","Biden's raspy voice and wandering responses in the clip were unlikely to allay the fears of his party.

"Elon Musk argues delay in disclosing Twitter stake was 'unintentional mistake, not fraud'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-argues-delay-in-disclosing-twitter-stake-was-unintentional-mistake-not-fraud/articleshow/111527730.cms,"In a recent filing in Manhattan federal court , X chairman Elon Musk has requested for the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by former Twitter shareholders who allege that Musk delayed revealing his substantial ownership stake in the social media company in early 2022.Musk argued that ""all indications"" point to his delay being an unintentional mistake rather than an attempt to defraud shareholders.The proposed class action lawsuit claims that Musk and his wealth manager, Jared Birchall, were aware of the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rule requiring Musk to disclose his 5% stake in Twitter by March 24, 2022. However, they waited an additional 11 days to do so.The investors argued that this delay allowed Musk to purchase more shares at lower prices, resulting in savings of over $200 million. Following Musk's disclosure of his 9.2% stake on April 4, 2022, Twitter's stock price surged by 27%.In his defense, Musk said that he had planned to disclose his Twitter stake at the end of 2022 but promptly revealed it upon realizing he had misinterpreted the SEC disclosure rule.""This is not a scheme to defraud,"" Musk said. ""All indications--including those in the pleadings--point to mistake.""Musk also refuted the investors' claim that an unnamed Morgan Stanley banker assisted in developing a trading strategy to accumulate Twitter shares without alerting the broader market.Last September, US District Judge Andrew Carter declined to dismiss an earlier version of the lawsuit, citing evidence that Musk understood the SEC disclosure and had testified about it under oath. The case, titled Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System v Musk et al, is being heard in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.","X chairman Elon Musk has requested for the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by former Twitter shareholders.

'I'm still in good shape': Biden rejects calls for independent medical review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-still-in-good-shape-biden-rejects-calls-for-independent-medical-review/articleshow/111527009.cms,"(With agency inputs)

President Joe Biden addressed concerns about his age and fitness for another term in office, rejecting the idea of an independent medical evaluation in a recent ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos. The 81-year-old president insisted that he undergoes daily cognitive tests through the rigorous tasks he faces in his job.""Look, I have a cognitive test every single day.Every day, I have that test. Everything I do. You know, not only am I campaigning, but I'm running the world"", Biden said.During the interview, Biden maintained that he is not more frail than earlier in his presidency, citing ongoing assessments by his personal doctors who would not hesitate to inform him of any issues. He acknowledged his limitations, saying, ""Can I run the 100 in 10 flat? No. But I'm still in good shape."" Regarding his debate performance, Biden admitted to not listening to his instincts in terms of preparation and allowing Trump's disruptions to distract him.Despite completing the 22-minute interview without major blunders, it remains uncertain whether Biden's performance will fully alleviate concerns about his ability to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming November election.The drawn-out spectacle surrounding Biden's candidacy could benefit his efforts to remain in the race by limiting the party's options to replace him, but it may also distract from crucial efforts to frame the 2024 race as a referendum on Trump.At times, Biden's responses during the interview were rambling, veering from topic to topic. When asked how he might turn the race around, he highlighted the importance of large and energetic rallies, like the one he held in Wisconsin. Biden also insisted that he is the ""most qualified"" to lead Democrats against Trump, whom he accused of being a ""pathological liar"" and failing to create jobs or benefit anyone but himself.The interview, along with weekend campaigns in battleground states, is part of Biden's effort to course-correct from his rocky debate performance. However, internal party frustrations continue to simmer, with some Democrats quietly discussing alternative options if the president drops out or the implications of him staying in the race. One influential Democratic senator is reportedly working on a nascent push to encourage Biden to exit the race.Despite the private angst among Democratic lawmakers, donors, and strategists, most in the party have refrained from public criticism as they wait to see if the president can restore confidence through his weekend travel and handling of the interview. The top Democrats on House committees are planning a virtual meeting to discuss the situation, while at least four House Democrats have called for Biden to step down as the nominee.In the interview, Biden laughed off the idea of being persuaded to leave the race, saying, ""If the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that."" However, there were a few signs of discontent at his campaign rally, with one person waving a sign reading ""Pass the torch Joe"" and a few people urging him to move on.The question of Biden's fitness for another term remains a contentious issue within the Democratic party as the 2024 election approaches. While some supporters find his energy reassuring, others are deeply frustrated and split on whether he should stay or go.",President Joe Biden addressed concerns about his age and fitness for another term in office.

Reformist faces ultraconservative as Iran votes for president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/reformist-faces-ultraconservative-as-iran-votes-for-president/articleshow/111521349.cms,"Low turnout

'Fed up'

TEHRAN: Iranians voted Friday in a presidential election runoff between a reformist advocating improved ties with the West and an ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator.The election, called early after the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, follows a first round marked by a historically low turnout last week.The runoff between reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili comes amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, Iran's nuclear standoff with the West and widespread economic discontent exacerbated by Western sanctions.Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all state matters in Iran, cast his ballot when polls opened.""I heard that the enthusiasm and interest of the people is more than before, praise to God that it will be like this, and if it is like this, it will be gratifying,"" he said.State television showed voters queueing in Saveh in central Iran and Kerman in the south, but AFP correspondents said polling stations appeared less busy in Tehran.In last week's first round, Pezeshkian, who was the only reformist permitted to stand, won the largest number of votes, around 42 percent, while Jalili came second with 39 percent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority.Only 40 percent of Iran's 61 million eligible voters took part -- the lowest turnout in any presidential election since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.In past elections, authorities have extended polling hours to give voters the maximum time to turn out and the interior ministry announced that they would again be extended on Friday, until 10:00 pm (1830 GMT).Khamenei called for a higher turnout in the runoff, emphasising the importance of the election.He said the first round turnout was lower than expected, but added that it was not an act ""against the system"".The election was originally scheduled for 2025 but was brought forward by Raisi's death in a helicopter crash in May.Pezeshkian and Jalili have taken part in two televised debates during which they discussed the low turnout, as well as Iran's economic woes, international relations and internet restrictions.Pezeshkian vowed to ""fully"" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory headscarf for women, a high-profile issue since the death in police custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini.The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been detained for an alleged breach of the dress code and her death sparked months of nationwide unrest.Following the unrest, women increasingly flouted the code but police have again stepped up checks in recent months.At a Tehran polling station, 48-year-old Fatemeh said she voted for the reformist whose ""priorities include women and young people's rights.""The candidacy of Pezeshkian, a relative unknown until recently, has raised the hopes of Iran's reformists after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps.Jalili, noted for his uncompromising anti-Western position, mobilised a substantial base of hardline support and received backing from other ultraconservative candidates.While campaigning, the 58-year-old criticised moderates for having signed the 2015 deal which promised Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.Jalili said the accord, which the United States withdrew from in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump, ""did not benefit Iran at all"".""I voted for Jalili because the next president should not repeat the previous mistake and sign a new agreement with the West,"" said Ali, a 38-year-old university professor, at a polling station in central Tehran.""They deceived us once and that's enough. Their promises cannot be trusted,"" said Ali, who gave only his first name.Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon, has called for ""constructive relations"" with Western countries to revive the nuclear deal in order to ""get Iran out of its isolation"".Pezeshkian voted at a school west of Tehran where he was accompanied by former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who helped clinch the 2015 deal.A member of parliament representing the northwestern city of Tabriz since 2008, he has earned the support of Iran's reformists, with former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani backing his candidacy.Casting his ballot on Friday, Khatami urged Iranians to vote ""for the future and good of the country"".Pezeshkian said people were ""fed up with their living conditions... and dissatisfied with the government's management of affairs.""Jalili has held several senior positions, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.He is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.","Iranians vote in presidential runoff between reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili. runoff comes amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, Iran's nuclear standoff with the West and widespread economic discontent.

"Kansas' top court rejects 2 anti-abortion laws, bolstering a state right to abortion access",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kansas-top-court-rejects-2-anti-abortion-laws-bolstering-a-state-right-to-abortion-access/articleshow/111519697.cms,"TOPEKA: Kansas ' highest court on Friday struck down state laws regulating abortion providers more strictly than other health care professionals and a ban on a common second-trimester procedure, reaffirming its stance that the state constitution protects abortion access.""We stand by our conclusion that section 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights protects a fundamental right to personal autonomy, which includes a pregnant person's right to terminate a pregnancy,"" Justice Eric Rosen wrote for the majority in overturning the ban on a certain type of dilation and evacuation, also known as D&E.In striking down the law on clinic regulations, the panel found that the state had failed to meet ""its evidentiary burden to show the Challenged Laws further its interests in protection of maternal health and regulation of the medical profession as it relates to maternal health.""The Kansas Supreme Court 's 5-1 rulings in two separate cases signal that the state's Republican-controlled Legislature faces stricter limits on regulating abortion than GOP lawmakers thought and suggests other restrictions could fall. Lawsuits in lower state courts already are challenging restrictions on medication abortions, a ban on doctors using teleconferences to meet with patients, rules for what doctors must tell patients before an abortion and a requirement that patients wait 24 hours after receiving information about a procedure to terminate their pregnancies.Justice K.J. Wall did not participate in either ruling on Friday while Justice Caleb Stegall was the lone dissenter.In his dissenting opinion in the clinic regulations case, Stegall said the majority's actions will damage the court's legitimacy ""for years to come."" He said that the declaration that the state constitution protects a right to bodily autonomy could affect a ""massive swath"" of health and safety regulations outside abortion, including licensing requirements for barbers.""Surely the government does not have a compelling interest in who trims my beard?"" Stegall wrote. ""Let the lawsuits commence in this new target-rich environment. The majority has - perhaps unwittingly - put the entire administrative state on the chopping block of strict scrutiny.""Stegall, who was appointed by conservative Republican Gov Sam Brownback, is widely regarded as the court's most conservative member.Kansas' top court declared in a 2019 decision that abortion access is a matter of bodily autonomy and a ""fundamental"" right under the state constitution. Voters in August 2022 also decisively rejected a proposed amendment that would have explicitly declared abortion not a fundamental right and allowed state lawmakers to greatly restrict or ban it.Lawyers for the state had urged the justices to walk back the 2019 ruling and uphold the two laws, which hadn't yet been enforced because of the legal battles over them. The state's solicitor general, appointed by Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach, had argued the 2022 vote didn't matter in determining whether the laws could stand.The court disagreed and handed abortion-rights supporters a big legal victory.Kansas has become an outlier among states with Republican-controlled Legislatures since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its Dobbs decision in June 2022, allowing states to ban abortion completely. That's led to an influx of patients from states with more restrictive laws, particularly Oklahoma and Texas. The Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, projected last month that about 20,000 abortions were performed in Kansas in 2023 or 152% more than in 2020.Kansas doesn't ban most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy, but it requires minors obtain the written consent of their parents or a guardian. Other requirements, including the 24-hour waiting period and what a provider must tell patients, have been put on hold. A lower court is considering a challenge to them by providers.Abortion opponents argued ahead of the August 2022 vote that failing to change the state constitution would doom long-standing restrictions enacted under past GOP governors. Kansas saw a flurry of new restrictions under former Republican Gov Sam Brownback from 2011 through 2018.The health and safety rules aimed specifically at abortion providers were enacted in 2011. Supporters said they would protect women's health - though there was no evidence provided then documenting that such rules in other states led to better health outcomes. Providers said the real goal was to force them out of business.The ban on a certain type of D&E procedure performed during the second trimester was the first of its kind when it was enacted in 2015.According to state health department statistics, about 600 D&E procedures were done in Kansas in 2022, accounting for 5% of the state's total abortions. About 88% of the state's abortions occurred in the first trimester. The state has yet to release statistics for 2023.The procedure ban would have forced providers to use alternative methods that the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion-rights advocacy group, has said are riskier for the patient and more expensive.The 2019 ruling came in the early stages of the lawsuit over the 2015 ban. The justices kept the law on hold but sent the case back to the trial court to examine the ban further. A trial judge said the law could not stand.Three of the court's seven justices joined the court since the 2019 decision. All three were appointed by Democratic Gov Laura Kelly, a strong abortion-rights supporter, but one of the three - Wall - removed himself from the cases.","The Kansas Supreme Court's 5-1 rulings in two separate cases signal that the state's Republican-controlled Legislature faces stricter limits on regulating abortion than GOP lawmakers thought.

2024 United Kingdom elections: What do the exit polls say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/2024-united-kingdom-elections-what-do-the-exit-polls-say/articleshow/111496405.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Keir Starmer's Labour Party is poised to win a historic victory in the UK general election, ending 14 years of Conservative rule , according to exit polls released shortly after voting ended on Thursday.Labour is projected to secure 410 seats in the 650-seat parliament, while Rishi Sunak 's Conservatives are forecast to win only 131 seats, down from 346 previously.The Liberal Democrats are predicted to capture 61 seats, and Nigel Farage's Reform UK party is expected to win 13 seats. The exit poll represents a significant turnaround for Labour, which faced an existential crisis just three years ago.Voters appear to have punished the Conservatives for the cost-of-living crisis, years of instability, and in-fighting that has seen five different prime ministers since 2016. Sunak's campaign was plagued by gaffes, including getting drenched by rain while announcing the election and leaving D-Day commemorations early for a TV interview.While polls suggest there is no great enthusiasm for Starmer, his message of change seems to have resonated with voters.

Nathan'S Hotdog Eating Contest: Nathan's Hotdog Eating Contest winner is Miki Sudo with 51 dogs in 10 minutes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nathans-hotdog-eating-contest-winner-is-miki-sudo-with-51-dogs-in-10-minutes/articleshow/111494307.cms,"Defending champion Miki Sudo retained the women's title at the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating contest Thursday with a record-breaking 51 dogs in a 10 minutes. Mayoi Ebihara, of Tokyo, Japan, came in second with 37 dogs, while Arizona’s Michelle Lesco finished third with 23.5 wieners.Sudo, a Florida native, beat her beef-eating competitors by a mile at the July 4 tradition.Her 28-year-old rival, Mayoi Ebihara, of Japan, came in second with 37 dogs, while Arizona’s Michelle Lesco, 40, finished third with 23.5 wieners.Miki Sudo has been the reigning queen since 2014 except in 2021 when she took a break for pregnancy. Last year, she managed a winning 39-and-a-half hot dogs in 10 minutes.Sudo’s previous personal best came in 2020 when she chowed down on a whopping 48.5 dogs in the beef-eating competition.With the event's biggest star —- Joey “Jaws” Chestnut — out of the contest this year, Sudo’s result set up a possible scenario in which the women’s champ out-eats the men’s winner. Geoffrey Esper, who came second last year, also has a personal best of 51, but only ate 49 last year.Chestnut, who won 16 out of the previous 17 contests, isn't attending the competition over a sponsorship tiff. Instead, he'll compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day. That leaves the traditional Brooklyn event wide open for a new winner in the men's division, with eaters from around the world competing on America's Independence Day to see how many hot dogs they can eat in 10 minutes.Thousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan’s location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture. ESPN is broadcasting the contest live. The men’s will begin at approximately 12:20 p.m.Competitors are coming from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.“There's going to be a new champion,” Australian James Webb, who holds a world record for eating 70 doughnuts in eight minutes, said at a preview event in New York on Wednesday.Last year Chestnut, of Indiana, chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.“I'm going to be pushing myself,” Sudo said Wednesday. Her rival Mayoi Ebihara, from Japan, said through a translator that she would eat until she passes out, with a goal of downing 50 hot dogs.Chestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes.Major League Eating, which organizes the Nathan’s Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.Chestnut said he wouldn’t return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.(With agency inputs)","Miki Sudo, a Florida native, beat her beef-eating competitors by a mile at the July 4 tradition.

Ra'Ad: Pakistan Arms JF-17 Jets with Ra'ad-I Nuclear Missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-arming-jf-17-jets-with-raad-nuke-missiles/articleshow/111454243.cms,"A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft. The photograph depicts a JF-17 carrying what appears to be a Ra'ad air-launched cruise missile (ALCM), marking the first public observation of this configuration.Analyzing images of a JF-17 Thunder Block II from the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade rehearsals, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) confirmed that the fighter jet was equipped with a Ra'ad-I nuclear missile.""Notably, this was the first time such a configuration had been observed in public,"" the FAS said in its report.To determine the specific type of Ra'ad missile in the image, comparisons were made with Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II missiles displayed in previous Pakistan Day Parades. While the Ra'ad-II, first unveiled in 2017, was presented as having nearly double the range capability of the Ra'ad-I, external features did not clearly distinguish the two versions until 2022. The latest Ra'ad-II, displayed in 2022 and 2024, features a distinct 'x-shaped' tail fin configuration, while the missile photographed on the JF-17 more closely resembles the 'twin-tail' configuration of the Ra'ad-I, the FAS report said.Using Photoshop's Vanishing Point feature and reference measurements from the vehicles carrying the missiles, the lengths of the Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II were estimated to be around 4.9 meters each. The missile on the JF-17 was also measured using the aircraft's length as a reference, resulting in a similar 4.9-meter estimate. These measurements, along with the tail fin configuration, suggest that the missile observed on the JF-17 is likely the Ra'ad-I ALCM rather than the newer Ra'ad-II or the conventional anti-ship variant, Taimoor, the FAS report by Eliana Johns said.The image provides evidence that Pakistan has made significant progress in equipping its JF-17s with the capability to supplement or replace the nuclear strike role of the ageing Mirage III/Vs. However, questions remain about the deployment status of the Ra'ad systems and whether Pakistan will continue to retain a nuclear gravity bomb capability or transition to stand-off cruise missiles exclusively.These developments occur amidst an ongoing nuclear arms competition in the region, with Pakistan, India, and China pursuing advanced technologies such as multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). The heightened tensions and the development of short-range, lower-yield nuclear-capable systems by Pakistan have raised concerns about accelerated arms racing and escalation risks in a potential conflict between India and Pakistan.",A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft.

He evidently mixed up his time as Obama's vice-president and Kamala Harris ' vice-presidency under him.At a separate Fourth of July White House event, Biden began talking about his predecessor not honouring military veterans, referring to Trump as ""one of our colleagues, the former president"" before lamely veering off with, ""probably shouldn't say, at any rate"" and moving on to other matters.He also continued to undercut his own case by telling Democratic governors at a White House meeting that he needs to sleep more and not work after 8 pm, which raised eyebrows in the current situation. Even a joke to the governors - ""I'm fine - I don't know about my brain, though"" - caused some supporters to grind their teeth.There is growing fear in the party that he can't take on the role and should quit the race.

ABC interview

A defiant US President Biden reassured supporters on Friday that he is staying in the race and expressed confidence that he will beat Donald Trump , come what may. Biden, who expects to put a strong front and recover from last week's disastrous debate performance, said he would ""get back up"" and not let the 90-minute debate overshadow his accomplishments of the last three and a half years.Ahead of the crucial interview, Biden in the key battleground state of Wisconsin said, ""You probably heard that I had a rough debate last week.Can't say it was my best performance, but since then, there's been a lot of speculation: 'What's Joe going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out?' Well, here's my answer: I am running and I am going to win again.""Biden said that he was going to defeat Donald Trump despite attempts being made to ""push him out"" of the race.President Biden, who made headlines more often than not for his gaffes over the past week, initially misspoke by saying he would beat Trump again in 2020, but then corrected himself, saying, ""We're going to do it again in 2024 .""""I learned long ago, when you get knocked down, you get back up,"" he said, emphasizing that he wouldn't let a 90-minute debate erase his accomplishments over the last three and a half years.In his speech, Biden mocked Trump's verbal gaffes, referencing an incident where Trump claimed Revolutionary War armies took over airports. Biden quipped, ""They talk about me misspeaking—airports and the British in 1776. It’s true, he is a stable genius.""Democratic allies are urging Biden to step up his campaign or drop out of the 2024 race, stressing on the need to demonstrate his readiness for a second term.Apart from the Texas Congressman, who became the first democrat to announce his reservation against Biden running again, Massachusetts Governor on Friday Maura Healey joined the clamor by issuing a statement urging President Joe Biden to “carefully evaluate” whether he remains the Democratic Party’s best hope to defeat Donald Trump in the 2024 election. Evaluations of Biden's fitness for office, including his upcoming speech and ABC interview, are expected to be closely scrutinized against a backdrop of growing clamor from outside and also within.In this context, Biden's ABC interview is expected to be both fair and challenging, focusing on his age and mental acuity. Potential missteps in this unscripted format could impact his reelection prospects, with some Democratic operatives critical of his decision to continue running. For Biden, the interview and the forthcoming campaigns will be key to setting the narrative right and more importantly rewriting the wrong from the debate that went awry.However, earlier on Thursday, Biden's campaign faced setbacks as he stumbled in a radio interview, mistakenly suggesting he was ""the first Black woman to serve with a Black president,"" confusing his tenure as vice president under Obama with Kamala Harris' role.At a separate event on Fourth of July celebrations, Biden stumbled through a brief speech at a White House barbecue, briefly claiming highway congestion was a thing of the past and nearly referring to Donald Trump as his ""colleague.""

Prosecutors revealed that Fogle frequently hired escorts to facilitate access to minors as young as 14 to 15 years old.In August 2015, Fogle pleaded guilty to charges of child pornography and paying for sex with an underage girl after traveling from Indiana to New York City. He was sentenced to 15 years and 8 months in prison.In a 2021 handwritten letter obtained by the Post, Fogle admitted responsibility for his imprisonment.“I really royally screwed up to wind up where I am,” wrote the father of two. “I was selfish and entitled… All I can do is learn from my mistakes to be a better man when I get released in a few years.”Currently, Fogle is indigent, spending less than $300 a month at the prison commissary. No longer represented by his costly legal team, he spends most of his time watching TV, writing letters, or sending emails through the prison’s messaging system, according to former inmates.Over the past eight years, Fogle has held various jobs, including janitorial and groundskeeping roles.Fogle has repeatedly tried to have his sentence reduced, but his attempts have been unsuccessful. He must serve at least 85% of his sentence. The earliest he can be released is March 24, 2029, according to Federal Bureau of Prisons records.","Jared Fogle was sentenced to 15 years and 8 months in prison for soliciting sex from a minor and possessing child pornography.

US says troops are leaving Niger bases this weekend and in August after coup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-says-troops-are-leaving-niger-bases-this-weekend-and-in-august-after-coup/articleshow/111519831.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US will remove all its forces and equipment from a small base in Niger this weekend and fewer than 500 remaining troops will leave a critical drone base in the West African country in August, ahead of a September 15 deadline set in an agreement with the new ruling junta, the American commander there said Friday.Air Force Major General Kenneth Ekman said in an interview that a number of small teams of 10-20 US troops, including special operations forces, have moved to other countries in West Africa.But the bulk of the forces will go, at least initially, to Europe.Niger's ouster of American troops following a coup last year has broad ramifications for the US because it is forcing troops to abandon the critical drone base that was used for counterterrorism missions in the Sahel.Ekman and other US military leaders have said other West African nations want to work with the US and may be open to an expanded American presence. He did not detail the locations, but other US officials have pointed to the Ivory Coast and Ghana as examples.Ekman, who serves as the director for strategy at US Africa Command, is leading the US military withdrawal from the small base at the airport in Niger's capital of Niamey and from the larger counterterrorism base in the city of Agadez. He said there will be a ceremony Sunday marking the completed pullout from the airport base, then those final 100 troops and the last C-17 transport aircraft will depart.Speaking to reporters from The Associated Press and Reuters from the US embassy in Niamey, Ekman said that while portable buildings and vehicles that are no longer useful will be left behind, a lot of larger equipment will be pulled out. For example, he said 18 4,000-pound (1,800-kilograms) generators worth more than $1 million each will be taken out of Agadez.Unlike the withdrawal from Afghanistan, he said the US is not destroying equipment or facilities as it leaves.""Our goal in the execution is, leave things in as good a state as possible,"" he said. ""If we went out and left it a wreck or we went out spitefully, or if we destroyed things as we went, we'd be foreclosing options"" for future security relations.Niger's ruling junta ordered US forces out of the country in the wake of last July's ouster of the country's democratically elected president by mutinous soldiers. French forces had also been asked to leave as the junta turned to the Russian mercenary group Wagner for security assistance.Washington officially designated the military takeover as a coup in October, triggering US laws restricting the military support and aid.","Niger's ouster of American troops following a coup last year has broad ramifications for the US because it is forcing troops to abandon the critical drone base.

'Would blow everything away': Trump dares Biden for a no holds barred debate to prove 'competence',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-rules-no-moderators-trumps-new-dare-to-biden-for-no-holds-barred-debate-to-prove-competence/articleshow/111519098.cms,"Why Trump wants a 'no holds barred' debate

Growing pressure on Biden

As US President Joe Biden prepares to put up a brave front and convince his supporters in a TV interview with ABC on Friday evening (local time), former President Donald Trump has issued a new debate challenge, unlike the previous format, which the ex-president claimed would test Biden's competence . Trump, who got the better of Biden in their first debate, proposed a debate with no rules and no moderators .In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump, 78, called for a “no holds barred” debate to let Biden, 81, prove his “competence or lack thereof.” He suggested a direct, unmoderated discussion, claiming it would ""blow everything away"" and attract higher ratings than their previous debate, which drew 47.9 million viewers.“I have the answer to the crooked Joe Biden incompetence puzzle. Let’s do another Debate, but this time, no holds barred,” Trump stated in his post.“An all-on discussion, with just the two of us on stage, talking about the future of our Country,” he added.The first debate, moderated by CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, limited responses to two minutes per answer and one minute for rebuttals, with microphones muted for overtime or interruptions. Trump argued his format would give Biden a chance to justify controversial policies on open borders, sports inclusion, electric vehicles, and inflation, suggesting this would test Biden's competence.During their first debate on June 27, Biden froze at one point and made confusing statements. The president later acknowledged his below-par performance, attributing his disorientation to extensive foreign travel and jet lag.Trump, riding high since then, claimed this format would allow Biden to explain the policies he has enacted during his first term, which Trump argues have been detrimental to the American people.“Let Joe explain why he wants open borders, with millions of people, and many violent criminals from parts unknown, pouring into our once great nation, or why he wants men playing in women’s sports,” Trump said.“Or demand all electric vehicles within five years, or why he allowed inflation to run rampant, destroying the people of our country, and so much more.“It would also, under great pressure, prove his ‘competence,’ or lack thereof,” Trump asserted, a dig at the growing calls for Biden to drop out of the race following his poor performance in the first debate.After his debate fiasco, Biden has faced criticism not only from his opponents but also from lawmakers within his own party. Some Democratic lawmakers have publicly urged Biden to step down, with a notable call coming from a Democratic lawmaker from Texas.Facing mounting pressure, Biden convened Democratic governors at the White House on Wednesday to rally support. However, his remarks about needing more rest and fewer late events, aligning with earlier claims that he operates best between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., have further drawn criticism, reminiscent of his comment about ""almost falling asleep"" on debate night due to extensive travel.Trump's debate proposal also coincides with several gaffes Biden made during his Fourth of July speech. Trump expressed enthusiasm for a straightforward debate, claiming it would test both candidates. A second debate is already scheduled for September 10, with Biden committed to participating.In a leaked video, Trump was seen discussing Biden's possible withdrawal from the race, referring to him as a “broken-down pile of crap,” while sitting in a golf cart with his son, Barron.Although the president and the White House have dismissed any reports of Biden withdrawing from the race, the second debate agreed upon by both campaigns and scheduled for September 10 will be keenly watched to see what unfolds going forward.","Former President Donald Trump has called for a direct, unmoderated debate with no rules and no moderators.

Imran Khan to go on hunger strike over lack of confidence in chief justice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-to-go-on-hunger-strike-over-lack-of-confidence-in-chief-justice/articleshow/111522851.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to go on hunger strike over his lack of confidence in the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Qazi Faez Isa , and if the ill-treatment meted out to him in prison continues, said Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians who met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Friday.Speaking to media after meeting Khan, the PTI politicians warned that if the injustice continues the party's founder will go on hunger strike.“If the party’s founder goes on a hunger strike in jail, it will trigger a nationwide hunger strike,” said Shamim Naqvi, a PTI politician from Karachi.Imran cited ongoing concerns over Justice Isa’s involvement in benches handling PTI cases and his personal cases. He emphasised the concerns expressed by his legal team about the CJ’s infrequent attendance, reflecting a growing sentiment in his camp that justice might not be administered fairly in these circumstances.Imran also expressed disappointment over a cancelled meeting with his legal and political teams. The superintendent, allegedly at the request of a jailed colonel, denied Khan’s team access, citing operational reasons.“They (Pakistan’s powerful military authorities) are mistaken; they think my party will weaken. They don't realize that the party with the strongest voter base remains strong,” Imran said while asserting his party’s resilience.He emphasised that the IMF cannot solve the country’s issues and that the solution lies in fair and transparent elections. “The entire nation states that the biggest fraud (Feb 2024 national and provincial polls) occurred, yet the chief justice is defending the election commission. The electoral watchdog has committed the greatest fraud in the country. We are seeking justice. If investigations proceed, the chief election commissioner will face Article 6 (guilty of high treason).”“I will never succumb to the tyranny of time; I am prepared to die in jail. As long as I live, I will wage this battle,” Imran remarked.About national security, he highlighted the necessity of a strong relationship with Afghanistan. “Why did Bilawal Bhutto and our foreign minister not visit Afghanistan? Without support from the Afghan govt, we cannot win this war (against TTP) across a 2,500-km-long border,” he added.","Imran cites ongoing concerns over Justice Isa’s involvement in benches handling PTI cases and his personal cases.

"Pakistan slams UN body report calling Imran’s arrest 'arbitrary, politically motivated'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-slams-un-body-report-calling-imrans-arrest-arbitrary-politically-motivated/articleshow/111440399.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday denounced a UN report that termed the detention of former prime minister Imran Khan as “arbitrary and in violation of international law”, asserting that the arrest of the cricketer-turned-politician and the cases against him were an “internal matter” of the country.Imran, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, has been in jail since August last year following his conviction in a Toshakhana case.The Election Commission of Pakistan subsequently disqualified him for five years, ahead of the national elections in Feb. He is also facing prosecution in the cipher and Iddat cases.In an opinion released on Monday, the Geneva-based UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Imran’s detention had no legal basis, and appeared to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office. “…From the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose,” it stated, adding that Imran’s legal woes were part of a “much larger campaign of repression” against him and his party.In the run-up to the 2024 general election, the working group report stated, PTI members were arrested and tortured and their rallies were disrupted. It also alleged “widespread fraud on the election day”.The “appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Khan immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law”, the UN working group said.Imran and his party have always maintained that the charges against him are politically motivated and aimed at thwarting his return to power.In recent months, courts have suspended Imran’s sentence in some cases and also overturned his conviction on charges of leaking state secrets. However, he has remained behind bars following his conviction in the Iddat case, with a trial court ruling that Imran’s 2018 marriage had violated Islamic law. Khan also faces a trial under anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence in May last year.Responding to the UN report, Pakistan’s law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said, “As a sovereign state, the constitution and prevailing laws are enforced by courts in Pakistan. PTI founder has all rights as per the national constitution and law and international norms. He is in jail as a convicted prisoner.”In his statement, Tarar said court relief to the PTI founder in some of the cases was “a reflection of a transparent and fair trial and judicial system”. “Any demand beyond the constitution, law and international norms will be called discriminatory, biased and unfair,” he added.Last Friday, Pakistan’s parliament had denounced a US congressional resolution that called for an independent investigation into allegations that the country’s elections were rigged.",Imran Khan has been in jail since August last year following his conviction in a Toshakhana case.

Coral bleachings devastate Bali reefs as sea temperatures rise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/coral-bleachings-devastate-bali-reefs-as-sea-temperatures-rise/articleshow/111505111.cms,"BONDALEM: Indonesian conservationist Nyoman Sugiar to has been working for 16 years to preserve coral on the reefs of Bali, but the frequency of mass coral bleachings he says is now devastating.Ninety percent of the corals Sugiarto had nurtured on the reefs near his village in Bondalem, in northern shore of Bali, lost their colour last December.""It was all white.We were shocked and of course, it also negatively affected the coral we planted. It's not just the natural ones,"" 51-year-old Sugiarto told Reuters.When Sugiarto began coral conservation projects in 2008 he was told that coral could retain the living algae which gives it colour for 10 to 20 years.Yet, the coral reefs off Bondalem were bleached in less than 10 years, he says, blaming warmer sea temperatures triggered by climate change.Coral bleaching occurs when coral expels the colourful algae living in its tissues. Without the algae the coral becomes pale and vulnerable to starvation, disease or death.In April, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said more than 54% of the reef areas in the world's oceans are experiencing bleaching-level heat stress, the fourth global bleaching event in the last three decades.Indonesia has roughly 5.1 million hectares of coral reefs and accounts for 18% of the world's total, data from the country's tourism ministry showed.Coral bleaching in Bali in late 2023 was mainly caused by rising sea temperatures caused by the El Nino phenomenon that hit Indonesia, said Marthen Welly, a marine conservation adviser at the Coral Triangle Center.Indonesia experienced the most severe dry season last year since 2019 due to the El Nino.While Indonesia's corals are more resilient and tend to recover faster, Marthen said it will not be enough to withstand the rising ocean temperature.""It's predicted that the coral bleaching will occur more often, between one or two years with the current temperature,"" he said, quoting the latest research by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.However, Sugiarto says he is determined to continue his campaign to conserve corals, and is advocating coral conservation to younger Indonesians and seeking funds to establish a village community to monitor illegal fishing.""We feel that we have the obligation to guard the sustainability of underwater life especially corals,"" he said.",Indonesia has roughly 5.1 million hectares of coral reefs and accounts for 18% of the world's total.
