Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he was ‘pressured’ by Joe Biden to pull Covid content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-says-he-was-pressured-by-joe-biden-to-pull-covid-content/articleshow/112822884.cms,"Meta Platforms Inc Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg alleged that Facebook was “pressured” by the US government to censor content related to Covid-19 during the global pandemic and that he regrets the company’s decision to accede to the demands.“In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain Covid-19 content, including humor and satire,” Zuckerberg wrote in a letter to the Committee on the Judiciary of the US House of Representatives.And while it was Meta’s decision whether to remove content, he continues, “the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it.”During the pandemic, Facebook officials drew ire from critics of lockdowns, vaccines and masking mandates because it removed certain posts, saying they contained misinformation related to the virus or otherwise went against its policies. In all, Facebook took down more than 20 million pieces of content in just over a year. Zuckerberg joins other social media executives, including Jack Dorsey, former CEO of blogging platform Twitter, in lamenting past instances of content moderation that, in their view, went too far.There’s a growing global debate over how far social media companies should go in policing the comments, images and other content posted by their users. Some platforms believe they should be hands off when it comes to telling users what they can and can’t say online, while some governments say that an overly laissez-faire stance can beget criminal behavior. French officials arrested Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov during the weekend, alleging that the company failed to adequately combat crime on the messaging app, including the spread of child sexual abuse material.On the eve of the US presidential election, pitting Vice President Kamala Harris against former president Donald Trump, Zuckerberg is also taking pains to appear non-partisan. “My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another — or to even appear to be playing a role,” Zuckerberg wrote in the letter, the contents of which were posted to the Facebook page of the House Judiciary Committee and confirmed by Meta. He was writing in reference to contributions made in the last presidential cycle to support electoral infrastructure.","Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook was pressured to censor content related to Covid-19 during the global pandemic.

Australia announces cap on international student enrolment for 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-announces-cap-on-international-student-enrolment-for-2025/articleshow/112821971.cms,"Australia has announced a cap on international student enrolment at 270,000 for 2025, as part of the government 's efforts to manage record migration levels that have contributed to a surge in home rental prices.This decision follows a series of measures implemented since last year to end Covid-era concessions for foreign students and workers in Australia.These concessions had previously helped businesses recruit staff locally while strict border controls prevented overseas workers from entering the country.Education minister Jason Clare said in a press conference, ""There's about 10 per cent more international students in our universities today than before the pandemic and about 50 per cent more in our private vocational and training providers."" Clare said that the reforms aim to make the international student sector better and fairer, setting it up on a more sustainable footing for the future.International education is a significant export industry for Australia, contributing A$36.4 billion ($24.7 billion) to the economy in the financial year 2022-2023. However, polls have indicated that voters are concerned about large influxes of foreign students and workers putting excessive pressure on the housing market, making immigration a potential major battleground in the upcoming election, which is less than a year away.Net immigration in Australia reached a record high in the year ending September 30, 2023, increasing by 60 per cent to 548,800. This surge in migration, driven by students from India, China, and the Philippines, has expanded the labour supply and restrained wage pressures, but it has also exacerbated an already tight housing market.To contain the surge in migration, the government recently more than doubled the visa fee for foreign students and pledged to close loopholes in rules that allowed them to continuously extend their stay.","Australia has announced a cap on international student enrolment at 270,000 for 2025.

Germany on Monday announced that it would donate 100,000 doses of mpox vaccine to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other African nations in hopes of getting an outbreak of the disease under control.The gift will all but wipe out the German military's reserve of roughly 118,000 doses.Berlin will also lend financial support to its effort, providing funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as supporting partners in Africa through the Gavi Vaccine Alliance.Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Berlin's aim is, ""to support in solidarity the international efforts to contain mpox on the African continent.""Hebestreit, noting that these were immediate-term measures, added that Berlin would also work alongside the African Union (AU) to foster local vaccine production.The World Health Organization (WHO) this month declared a recent mpox outbreak in the DRC a global public health emergency when cases began showing up outside the country.The WHO claims the disease ""can be stopped"" but notes that this will require a comprehensive and expensive global effort.France last week announced that it would donate 100,000 doses and the US, too, will donate 50,000.Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, has been around for decades, yet a new, more virulent strain is thought to be behind its recent spread.Deadly and communicable, the Clade 1b strain has killed more than 570 people this year. The disease has spread across the DRC, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. The first European fatality was registered in Sweden.The mpox virus can spread from animals to humans but also between humans through close physical contact, most often through kissing or sexual contact.","Germany will donate 100,000 doses of mpox vaccine to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other African nations.

Tropical Storm Hone: Hawaii faces flooding and road closures as three Cyclones stir in Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hawaii-faces-flooding-and-road-closures-as-three-cyclones-stir-in-pacific/articleshow/112821416.cms,"Tropical storm Hone brings heavy rain to Hawaii

Impact on Big Island

Precautions against future fires amid Tropical Storm Hone

Hurricane Gilma and Tropical Storm Hector gain strength

Three tropical cyclones were active in the Pacific Ocean on Monday, bringing varied effects to different regions. Tropical Storm Hone caused significant rainfall and flash floods in Hawaii , while Hurricane Gilma and Tropical Storm Hector were gaining strength and moving eastward.The impacts of these storms led to road closures and power outages to potential future flooding concerns.Tropical Storm Hone, pronounced ""hoe-NEH,"" caused road closures, downed power lines, and damaged trees in parts of the Big Island , according to William Ahue, a forecaster at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. As of midday Monday, Hone was located 280 miles west-southwest of Honolulu, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph, moving west at 13 mph.""No major damage that we know of yet,"" news agency AP quoted Big Island mayor Mitch Roth as saying. ""No injuries that we know of at this point.""One family had to be evacuated on Sunday due to flooding, Roth added. Additionally, four schools on the Big Island were closed because of power outages and flooded roads. Hawaiian Electric reported that the utility restored power to most customers who had experienced outages. State transportation officials warned thatHilo airport might experience increased traffic due to added flights to compensate for weekend cancellations.Julia Neal, owner of a bed-and-breakfast on a former sugar plantation in Pahala on the Big Island, described her experience. ""We were experiencing tropical storm winds and heavy pounding rain through the night."" She noted that while the storm was disruptive, it was also beneficial for the area. ""Hone was also a gift in a way because we have been experiencing a lot of drought .""On Sunday, floods closed Highway 11 between Kona and Hilo, as well as an alternative higher-altitude route, the Cane Road, isolating properties such as the Aikane Plantation Coffee Co. Phil Becker, the owner of the coffee plantation, recounted the extent of the flooding.""We've got quite a lot of flood damage, the gulches are running full speed ahead and they're overflowing the bridges, so we're trapped down here, we can't get in or out,"" he said.Becker, who runs his plantation off the grid with solar-powered batteries, emphasised that his family was safe and had no need to evacuate. He also mentioned the potential benefits of the rainfall. ""We've been in a drought situation so the coffee is probably loving all this rain,"" he said.Hone, whose name means ""sweet and soft"" in Hawaiian, reminded residents of last year's devastating wildfires on Maui. The fires, fueled by hurricane-force winds, ravaged the historic town of Lahaina, resulting in 102 deaths. The Maui blaze, which occurred on August 8, 2023, became the deadliest US wildfire in over a century. Dry and overgrown grasses, coupled with drought conditions, significantly contributed to the spread of the fire.The cause of the Lahaina blaze is still under investigation, but one possible factor is the ignition by bare electrical wires and leaning power poles that toppled in strong winds.In response to Tropical Storm Hone, Hawaiian Electric and the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative prepared to shut off power if necessary to prevent live, damaged power lines from starting fires. However, they later determined that such safety measures would not be needed as Hone moved past the islands.Meanwhile, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Hurricane Gilma intensified into a strong Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph. As of Monday, Gilma was located approximately 1,160 miles east of Hilo, Hawaii, and was moving west at 8 mph. The National Hurricane Center forecasted that Gilma would increase in forward speed but decrease in intensity as it approached the central Pacific basin on Tuesday.Farther to the east, Tropical Storm Hector also gained strength on Monday. Hector's top sustained winds reached 50 mph and the storm was centred about 1,125 miles west-southwest of Mexico's Baja peninsula, moving west-northwest at 10 mph.Despite these developments, Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth advised residents to remain vigilant. With the ground already saturated from recent rainfall, additional rain could pose further challenges.""It's never too early to start protecting your house,"" Roth said to AP.",Tropical Storm Hone caused significant rainfall and flash floods in Hawaii. Hurricane Gilma and Tropical Storm Hector were gaining strength and moving eastward.

Such points were first opened in the fall of 2022, when Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure with weekly barrages.In neighboring Poland, the military said Polish and Nato air defenses were activated in the eastern part of the country as a result of the attack.In Russia, meanwhile, officials reported a Ukrainian drone attack overnight.Four people were injured in the central region of Saratov, where drones hit residential buildings in two cities.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) manages the construction and maintenance of India’s extensive road network. National Highways play a crucial role in the country's infrastructure development, connecting various regions from north to south and east to west. India is home to numerous national highways, which link different parts of the country and facilitate efficient transportation.National Highway 44 (NH 44), formerly known as National Highway 7, is the longest national highway in India.Spanning 3,745 kilometres, NH 44 traverses the North-South Corridor of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP). It stretches from Srinagar in the north to Kanyakumari in the south. NH 44 was created by consolidating several major highways, including NH 1A, NH 1, NH 2, NH 3, NH 75, NH 26, and NH 7.: Runs from Srinagar to Kanyakumari, covering 3,745 kilometres.Connects Porbandar in Gujarat to Silchar in Assam, with a length of 3,507 kilometres.: Stretches from Delhi to Chennai, totaling 2,807 kilometres.Links Sangrur in Punjab to Ankola in Karnataka, spanning 2,317 kilometres.Extends from Sitarganj in Uttarakhand to Ibrahimpatnam in Andhra Pradesh, measuring 2,040 kilometres.Connects Jorabat in Meghalaya to Selling in Mizoram, with a length of 1,873 kilometres.Links Hajira in Gujarat to Pradip Port in Odisha, covering 1,781 kilometres.Runs from the east coast of West Bengal to Chennai in Tamil Nadu, totaling 1,711 kilometres.Connects Panvel to Kanyakumari, spanning 1,622 kilometres.Stretches from Delhi to Kolkata, covering 1,435 kilometres.Links Gangotri Dham in Uttarakhand to Lakhnadon in Madhya Pradesh, with a length of 1,426 kilometres.The Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) is a major national highway network that connects four key metro cities in India: Delhi (north), Kolkata (east), Mumbai (west), and Chennai (south). It serves as a vital link between India's major industrial, agricultural, and cultural centres.India boasts the second-largest road network in the world.There are over 200 national highways with a cumulative length of 101,011 kilometres. State highways add up to 131,899 kilometres.National highways typically have two-digit numbers, while three-digit numbered highways are branches of the main highways (e.g., NH 144 is a branch of NH 44).Although national highways make up only 1.8% of all roads in India, they handle 40% of the country's road traffic.National Highways: State HighwaysCity Highways","India boasts the second-largest road network in the world.

The 14-time Grammy winner, known for her influential presence and previous support of the Democratic Party, is expected to announce her backing of Harris about four to six weeks before the US election on November 5.Swift, who has a history of mobilizing her fans to vote, could have a significant impact on the election outcome, reported the US Sun.Her 2020 'go vote' campaign was credited with increasing youth voter turnout, making her endorsement a highly anticipated event. The Biden campaign, and more recently Harris’s, have both sought her support, while Trump’s camp has expressed confusion over Swift's potential alignment with Democrats.According to a source close to Swift’s entourage, the singer is “excited” about Harris’s presidential run. “Taylor was thrilled when Kamala Harris was named Vice President in 2020. It was a monumental moment for her to see a woman in such a high political position,” the insider was quoted as saying by the US Sun. “Now that Harris is running for president, Taylor is even more enthusiastic about the possibility of Harris becoming the first female President of the United States.”Swift’s endorsement is expected to be a significant boost for Harris’s campaign. The singer's influence, combined with her substantial fan base, could play a crucial role as the election approaches. Social media has been buzzing with speculation about Swift's endorsement, with both Harris and Trump supporters campaigning for her backing. While Trump has garnered support from tech elites and prominent business figures, Harris has seen increasing backing from Hollywood and Silicon Valley.As the election draws near, Swift's potential endorsement of Harris highlights her commitment to supporting a strong, unifying leader in the race for the presidency.","The 14-time Grammy winner is expected to announce her backing of Harris about four to six weeks before the US election on November 5.

While entirely free healthcare is rare, most developed nations provide government-funded universal health care to their citizens and residents.The UK’s National Healthcare Service (NHS) offers free, universal healthcare, known for its accessibility and efficient primary care. The NHS is regionally structured and funded by government taxation, ensuring that all citizens and residents have access to free healthcare, including hospital care, doctor visits, medical consultations, maternity care, prescriptions, mental health services, and more.Canada's universal healthcare system , Medicare, is publicly funded and managed by individual provinces and territories. Free healthcare services are available to Canadian citizens and residents, covering doctor visits, lab tests, hospital care, and prescription medications.Australia’s Medicare, funded through general taxation, provides free healthcare to local citizens and permanent residents. Services include basic medical care, hospital services, doctor appointments, prescriptions, and diagnostic tests. Expats may need to pay out-of-pocket for specialised care, so securing private health insurance is advisable.France’s universal healthcare system is recognized for its accessibility, quality care, and efficiency. Both French citizens and legal residents have access to free healthcare services such as hospital care, doctor visits, and prescription medications. Visitors staying in France for over three months can also benefit from these services.Germany’s universal healthcare is based on a government-run “sickness fund,” requiring all citizens to have health insurance. Funded through taxes, social insurance contributions, and copayments, Germany’s healthcare system ensures that both citizens and legal residents receive comprehensive, high-quality medical care, including preventative and long-term services.Norway’s universal healthcare system, financed by taxation and social security contributions, is known for short waiting times, patient-focused care, and the quality of healthcare services. All residents can access free hospital care, prescription medications, and medical consultations.Sweden’s government-funded healthcare is available to citizens and legal residents, offering services such as hospital care, maternity care, primary care, specialist consultations, and dental care for children and young adults.Brazil’s universal healthcare system is government-funded and accessible to citizens, legal residents, tourists, refugees, and immigrants. Patients receive free hospital care, outpatient services, vaccinations, surgeries, and preventative care at the point of service.Denmark’s government-funded healthcare offers free services like prescription medications, doctor visits, and hospital care to all residents. The Danish healthcare system is praised for its patient-centric approach, preventative care, and timely access to comprehensive medical services.","In 2024, notable countries with free healthcare systems include Canada, Australia, and the UK.

They have been sleeping on the floor as they await entry into Brazil, according to the Public Defender's Office as reported by news agency Reuters.The migrants are confined to a restricted area where access to showers is unavailable, and their movements are restricted, making it challenging for them to obtain food and water.Moreover, they are facing the winter cold without blankets, as reported by the official.A 39-year-old migrant from Ghana passed away two weeks ago due to unknown causes, as reported by a spokesman for the office. It remains unclear whether the individual died while being held at the airport or during transport to the hospital.The Public Defender's Office has called for urgent improvements to the migrants' conditions while their status is being resolved as they say that their human rights are being violated, and their health is deteriorating.In a statement, they urged authorities to adhere to Brazil's legislation, which is based on the humanitarian principle of accepting refugees and not returning them to their country of origin.Meanwhile, the Brazil government plans to tighten entry rules on Monday, aiming to curb the influx of foreigners using Brazil as a transit point to reach the United States and Canada further complicating the situation.Foreign travelerswithout a Brazilian visa who are transiting through the country to another destination will be required to proceed directly to their final destination or return to their country of origin starting Monday, according to a statement by Brazil's public security ministry on Wednesday.The ministry reported that Brazil has witnessed a significant increase in foreign travelers, especially from Asia, who land in the country claiming to be on a layover en route to North America. These passengers request refugee status upon arrival, citing persecution and threats in their home countries.Under the new regulations, passengers arriving in Sao Paulo without a visa will no longer be permitted to remain in Brazil, as stated by the ministry. It remains unclear whether these rules will be applicable to migrants currently at the Sao Paulo airport or only to those arriving after the implementation of the new policy.Immigration experts have raised concerns that the proposed rules may be in conflict with the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, which Brazil has signed. The convention requires countries to accept individuals at risk in their home country, even if they lack proper documentation.","Hundreds of migrants from India, Nepal, and Vietnam have been stranded without visas at Brazil's Guarulhos Airport.

In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts that have devastated their populations and infrastructure.To explore and understand which countries face the highest levels of danger, we turn to the Global Peace Index (GPI) compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace.The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations, highlighting those most impacted by war, violence, and unrest. This non-profit organization annually evaluates 163 countries across 23 indicators, including internal conflicts, societal safety, and levels of militarization, providing a comprehensive assessment of global peace and security.The GPI provides invaluable insights into global peace and security, helping to identify the most dangerous countries while also shedding light on the root causes of instability. By understanding these factors, policymakers, researchers, and global citizens can work towards promoting peace and mitigating conflict. Here’s the list of the most dangerous countries in the world.With a 2024 GPI score of 3.397, Yemen continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. Since the onset of civil conflict in 2015, the nation has been plunged into chaos, with widespread famine, disease, and infrastructure collapse exacerbating the situation.The conflict, which started as an internal struggle, has been prolonged and intensified by the involvement of neighbouring countries, each backing different factions. This has only deepened the suffering of the Yemeni people, who face unimaginable hardships daily.Sudan remains one of the most dangerous countries globally, primarily due to ongoing conflicts in regions like Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. In 2024, these conflicts resulted in over 3,000 deaths and displaced nearly 2 million people.The humanitarian crisis is severe, with frequent attacks on civilians by government forces, opposition groups, and militias. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 14 million people in Sudan are in dire need of humanitarian aid.South Sudan, with a GPI score of 3.324, remains one of the world's most perilous countries due to ongoing civil conflict, ethnic violence, and political instability. Since gaining independence in 2011, the country has struggled to maintain peace and stability, with its citizens facing continuous threats from internal strife and external pressures.Afghanistan, with a 2024 GPI score of 3.294, continues to be one of the most dangerous countries worldwide. Decades of conflict, compounded by the Taliban's seizure of power in 2021, have left the nation in a state of constant instability.The risks of terrorism, kidnappings, and widespread violence remain high, making Afghanistan a focal point of international concern.Ukraine has witnessed a significant decline in safety and stability, particularly since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. By 2024, the conflict has claimed over 150,000 lives, with millions more displaced both internally and externally.The destruction of cities and critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals, has created a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions.The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer from one of the deadliest conflicts in African history. The ongoing violence, which has spanned more than four and a half years, has resulted in more lives lost than any other conflict since World War II, according to the International Rescue Committee. The DRC remains a highly dangerous place, with widespread violence and instability threatening the lives of millions.In 2024, Russia's GPI score of 3.249 reflects the nation's increasing danger, exacerbated by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Internally, Russia faces significant challenges, including organized crime and corruption, which undermine law and order.Additionally, environmental concerns, such as industrial accidents and pollution, pose substantial health risks to the population.Since the onset of its civil war in 2011, Syria has been one of the world's most dangerous countries. The conflict has devastated infrastructure, leaving buildings, roads, hospitals, and schools in ruins.The humanitarian situation is dire, with over 13 million Syrians in need of assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced. Food insecurity is rampant, and the healthcare system is in disarray, with many hospitals destroyed or operating at minimal capacity.Mali has been embroiled in armed conflict since January 2012, when Tuareg rebels seized control of the northern territory, declaring the independent nation of Azawad by April of that year. The situation escalated further with a military coup in March 2012, deepening the turmoil in the region. Today, Mali remains one of the most dangerous countries, with ongoing violence and instability threatening the safety of its citizens","In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous.

Judge in Texas orders pause on Biden program that offers legal status to spouses of US citizens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-in-texas-orders-pause-on-biden-program-that-offers-legal-status-to-spouses-of-us-citizens/articleshow/112821117.cms,"McALLEN: A federal judge in Texas on Monday paused a Biden administration policy that would give spouses of U.S. citizens legal status without having to first leave the country, dealing at least a temporary setback to one of the biggest presidential actions to ease a path to citizenship in years.The administrative stay issued by U.S. District Judge J.Campbell Barker comes just days after 16 states, led by Republican attorneys general, challenged the program that could benefit an estimated 500,000 immigrants in the country, plus about 50,000 of their children. The states accused the administration of bypassing Congress for ""blatant political purposes.""One of the states leading the challenge is Texas, which in the lawsuit claimed the state has had to pay tens of millions of dollars annually from health care to law enforcement because of immigrants living in the state without legal status.President Joe Biden announced the program in June. The court order, which lasts for two weeks but could be extended, comes one week after the Department of Homeland Security began accepting applications.""The claims are substantial and warrant closer consideration than the court has been able to afford to date,"" Barker wrote.Barker was appointed by former President Donald Trump in 2019 as a judge in Tyler, Texas, which lies in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a favored venue for advocates pushing conservative arguments.The judge laid out a timetable that could produce a decision shortly before the presidential electionNov. 5 or before a newly elected president takes office in January. Barker gave both sides until Oct. 10 to file briefs in the case.The policy offers spouses of U.S. citizens without legal status, who meet certain criteria, a path to citizenship by applying for a green card and staying in the U.S. while undergoing the process. Traditionally, the process could include a years-long wait outside of the U.S., causing what advocates equate to ""family separation.""The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return an email seeking comment on the order.""The court's decision tonight to halt the federal government from providing relief is devastating to the thousands of Texas families that could have benefited from this program,"" Jessica Cisneros, an attorney for the advocacy organization the Texas Immigration Law Council, said Monday.Several families were notified of the receipt of their applications, according to attorneys advocating for eligible families who filed a motion to intervene earlier Monday.""Texas should not be able to decide the fate of hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens and their immigrant spouses without confronting their reality,"" Karen Tumlin, the founder and director of Justice Action Center, said during the press conference before the order was issued.The program has been particularly contentious in an election year where immigration is one of the biggest issues, with many Republicans attacking the policy and contending it is essentially a form of amnesty for people who broke the law.Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton cheered the order.""This is just the first step. We are going to keep fighting for Texas, our country, and the rule of law,"" Paxton posted on the social media platform X.To be eligible for the program, immigrants must have lived continuously in the U.S. for at least 10 years, not pose a security threat or have a disqualifying criminal history, and have been married to a citizen by June 17 - the day before the program was announced.They must pay a $580 fee to apply and fill out a lengthy application, including an explanation of why they deserve humanitarian parole and a long list of supporting documents proving how long they have been in the country.If approved, applicants have three years to seek permanent residency. During that period, they can get work authorization.Before this program, it was complicated for people who were in the U.S. illegally to get a green card after marrying an American citizen. They can be required to return to their home country - often for years - and they always face the risk they may not be allowed back in.","The administrative stay issued by U.S. District Judge J.Campbell Barker comes just days after 16 states, led by Republican attorneys general, challenged the program. The states accused the administration of bypassing Congress for ""blatant political purposes"" The program could benefit an estimated 500,000 immigrants in the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112821191,imgsize-1233360,width-400,resizemode-4/112821191.jpg"
Large Indian-American turnout at Democratic convention in support of Kamala Harris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/large-indian-american-turnout-at-democratic-convention-in-support-of-kamala-harris/articleshow/112821009.cms,"At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week, to celebrate US Vice President Kamala Harris as the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party , members of the Indian American community, including elected representatives of government, delegates who represented their states or districts and guests, were very visible and engaged.“There are over 700,000 eligible Indian Americans in the seven battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.President Joe Biden won six of these seven states by a total of 325,000 votes in 2020. So, clearly Indian American voters matter,” Shekar Narasimhan, a 2024 DNC Virginia delegate and founder and chairman, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Victory Fund, told the Times of India. He added that the Indian American community was well represented at the convention on the main stage every day, with over 30 delegates and 40 elected officials. “And the number of new convention attendees was remarkable especially second generation and younger,” Narasimhan said.Ajay Bhutoria, an Indian American community leader who is deeply engaged in the political and public advocacy space, feels that the involvement of the Indian diaspora in Kamala Harris’s campaign, as evident at the DNC, has been incredibly inspiring and impactful. “At the DNC, I witnessed a strong sense of pride and commitment among Indian Americans, who see Vice President Harris not just as a first Indian American presidential candidate but as a symbol of the American dream. From fundraising to organising voter outreach efforts, members of our community are playing critical roles in driving her campaign forward,” he told TOI. For him, the most memorable moment at the convention was congratulating Vice President Harris on her nomination right after her acceptance speech.The large presence of Indian Americans at the DNC is testament to the growing political engagement within the community, Bhutoria feels. “This presence reflects the widespread support for Harris's campaign among Indian Americans, who see her as a leader who understands the challenges and aspirations of immigrant communities. The enthusiasm at the convention was palpable, and it reinforced the belief that our community will be a decisive force in the upcoming election,” he said. Elected Indian American officials who were seen at the DNC included Congressional representatives Shri Thanedar and Raja Krishnamoorthy; Maryland’s Lt Governor Aruna Miller; Montgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija, North Carolina State Senator Jay Chaudhuri; Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, Illinois State Senator Ram Villivalam and many others.A large number of Indian American community members, especially second and third generation, were actively involved the Democratic convention this year and many of them are seen as playing an important role in Harris’s presidential campaign. Some of visible community members at DNC were Praveen Meyyan, an Asian American community leader who is chair of the Democratic Asians Americans of Virginia (AAPI Caucus of the Democratic Party of Virginia); Shyamali Roy Hauth, an US Air Force veteran who serves on the 11th Congressional district Democratic committee; Deepa Sharma, a lawyer and DNC delegate from California who has served on the executive board of the California Democratic Party’s Asian/ Pacific Islander caucus; Shivanthi Sathanandan, second vice chair, Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, and the battleground states director of SouthAsians for Harris and Harini Krishnan, co-national director of South Asians for Harris and delegate from California at DNC.“The number of DNC delegates and volunteers from the Indian American community has grown significantly, which reflects our community’s increasing political participation. This year, there was a concerted effort to engage and mobilise Indian American voters, and that was evident in the number of community members actively involved in the convention. Their presence and contributions are crucial as we work to ensure that our voices are heard and that we play a key role in shaping the future of our nation,” Bhutoria said.Chintan Patel, executive director of Indian American Impact Fund, an organisation dedicated to promoting and elevating the voices of Indian and South Asian Americans in the political and civic life of the United States, who attended DNC, said that his organisation looks forward to mobilising South Asian Americans in unprecedented numbers for Harris’s campaign. “We are confident that our community will help deliver the White House to Kamala Harris this November,” he said in a statement after the DNC.","The Indian American community was well represented at the convention on the main stage every day.

And Kennedy Jr is in the news for suspending his campaign as the independent presidential candidate and then endorsing former president Donald Trump. With both the father-daughter in news, the Internet found out the most gruesome story where Kick described how during a childhood trip top Hyannis Port, her father beheaded a dead whale so that he could study at home.The incident took place in the mid-1990s when Kick was six year old and the family was holidaying.But as he got to know that a whale carcass had washed ashore on Squaw Island, Kennedy Jr got all excited and went to the beach with a chainsaw in hand. He beheaded it right then and then strapped the whale's head to the family minivan to bring it home for his further study.“Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet,” Kick told the Town & Country magazine in 2012.“We all had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out, and people on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us.”Kennedy Jr had weird things going on with dead animals and he has been surprisingly candid about all these. Once he found a fatally hit bear cub early one morning. “So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van, because I was gonna skin the bear. It was in very good condition and I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator,"" Kennedy said. But then he got distracted by his friends who suggested that they should get rid of the bear. Kennedy Jr actually dropped the dead bear cub in New York's Central Park.

The endorsement comes days after Donald Trump got the support from the former independent candidate RFK Jr. Earlier it was reported that Donald Trump's campaign was roping in Tulsi for Trump's debate preparation.Gabbard served as the Democratic representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district from 2013 to 2021 and then exited the party in 2022. Her point of disagreement with the Democrats was war as she denounced the party she served as an elitist cabal of warmongers.Tulsi Gabbard ran in the 2019 Democratic presidential primary against Kamala Harris.As Donald Trump welcomed Tulsi, he called her a true American patriot. ""A 17-year veteran of the Hawaii Army National Guard, a four-term Democrat Congress woman, very very popular...She was a very good candidate. Every time she ran, she did very good. She decided to leave because she could not take it anymore but she is very special. I didn't know she is Lt Colonel. That's not bad. Lt Colonel. I didn't know that. just found out and I said put it down. This is better than all other stuff I have read. But no, she is a special person. She's got a great common sense, great spirit, she loves the country, the people in the room. Tulsi Gabbard,"" Donald Trump introduced her.In her endorsement speech, Tulsi said she's committed to doing all she can to send Trump back to the White house to serve as the commander-in-chief because his first task will be to take America back from the brink of war. ""We can't be prosperous unless we are at peace and we can't be free as long as we have a government that is retaliating against its political opponents and undermining our civil liberties weaponizing our very institutions against those they deem as threat. Kamala Harris has done this in the last three years. She won't hesitate to do this if she's elected,"" Tulsi said.Tulsi joined Trump earlier in the day in paying respect to the soldiers martyred in the Abbey Gate Attack in Kabul.In his presidency, Trump did not start any war and took steps to de-escalate and prevent wars, Tulsi Gabbard said adding that he exercised the courage expected from the commander-in-chief. The same can't be said about Kamala Harris as the incumbent administration has America facing multiple wars and closer to the brink of a nuclear war.Tulsi Gabbard is often mistaken as an Indian-origin woman because of her first name but she did not have any connection with India.

US Presidential Elections: Trump's X-treme comeback: A two-hour rant with capital letters and catchy insults,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-x-treme-comeback-a-two-hour-rant-with-capital-letters-and-catchy-insults/articleshow/112815709.cms,"Former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has returned to his glory by going on his longest post spree on X (formerly Twitter ) since January 6, 2021.In his dramatic return to X, Trump made six posts in just under two hours on Sunday, attacking the Democratic Party and its 2024 election candidate Vice President Kamala Harris on a range of issues.Trump was banned from the platform on January 6, 2021, following the Capitol riot for violating the app's terms and conditions after he posted 13 times in 10 hours, three of which he later deleted.However, when billionaire Elon Musk purchased the platform and rebranded it as X in 2022, Trump’s account was restored. Despite this, Trump has largely stayed away, preferring to communicate with his followers via his own platform, Truth Social—until now.Trump was posting campaign material on the site on August 12, but his Sunday posts were a return to his signature style.The first post appeared at 11:57 am ET, where Trump took aim at President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris over their handling of the escalating tensions in the Middle East. ""Who is negotiating for us in the Middle East?"" Trump asked. ""Bombs are dropping all over the place! Sleepy Joe is sleeping on a Beach in California, viciously Exiled by the Democrats, and Comrade Kamala is doing a campaign bus tour with Tampon Tim, her really bad V.P. Pick. Let's not have World War III, because that's where we're heading!""Trump followed up with a bold declaration just 11 minutes later: ""NOVEMBER 5TH WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA!"" Clearly, he's all in on the 2024 election.At 1:06 pm, he went on the attack again accusing Harris of being a communist, ""There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris, because she will take us into a Nuclear World War III! She will never be respected by the Tyrants of the World!""Trump's posts reflected a familiar theme: his belief that global respect for the United States has waned since he left office. He has often boasted that his leadership kept adversaries like Russia in check, claiming that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he were still president.His admiration for authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un has also been well documented, with Trump famously stating that he and Kim ""fell in love"" through their letter exchanges.Trump's attacks on Harris were not limited to foreign policy or political blame. He wrote ""Kamala and her 'handlers' are trying to make it sound like I am the Incumbent President, so that they can blame me for the failure of the past four years. No, it was their failure! It is one of the worst Presidencies in History, and she is definitely the Worst Vice President.""While Harris has spent most of her term as a relatively unpopular vice president, Trump's presidency was rated the worst in history by historians at the Presidential Greatness Project in 2024.At 1:51 pm, he claimed that Harris would decimate social security and Medicare, giving it away to ""Millions of Illegal Immigrants who are infiltrating our Country!""Minutes later, he warned that a Harris presidency would be disastrous for the economy, leading to Soviet-style price controls and crippling taxes. ""If you think things are expensive now, they will get 100 times WORSE if Kamala gets four years as President,"" Trump warned. ""If you want more CASH and less TAX, VOTE TRUMP!!!""In true Trump fashion, his posts were full of capital letters, catchy insults, and exaggerated claims. It looks like the former president is back to doing what he does best—riling up his supporters and taking shots at his rivals, one post at a time.","Trump was banned from the platform on January 6, 2021, following the Capitol riot for violating the app's terms and conditions. However, when billionaire Elon Musk purchased the platform and rebranded it as X in 2022, Trump’s account was restored. Despite this, Trump has largely stayed away, preferring to communicate with his followers via his own platform, Truth Social.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112815708,imgsize-90870,width-400,resizemode-4/112815708.jpg"
Trump threatens to torpedo debate amid taunts of chickening out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-threatens-to-torpedo-debate-amid-taunts-of-chickening-out/articleshow/112815348.cms,"WASHINGTON: The first and only scheduled Presidential debate on September 10 between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is in jeopardy after Trump cast doubts on the integrity of ABC News , the network assigned to carry it, and the Harris campaign sought an ""open mic"" engagement.Surrogates of both candidates scorched the opposite side in statements and on social media, with the former President himself triggering the spat by suggesting he may bail out of the debate because in his view the network is anti-Trump and the engagement would be rigged to favor Harris.“Will panelist Donna Brazil give the questions to the Marxist Candidate like she did for Crooked Hillary Clinton? Will Kamala’s best friend, who heads up ABC, do likewise. Where is Liddle’ George Slopadopolus hanging out now? Will he be involved. They’ve got a lot of questions to answer!!!"" Trump said in one of trademark rants on ""Truth Social,"" his own platform.""I ask, why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network? ... Why did Harris turn down Fox, NBC, CBS, and even CNN? Stay tuned!!!” he added. Trump had initially agreed to debate Biden on ABC News, but sought to shift the engagement to Fox News, which favors him, when Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee.Harris supporters meanwhile taunted Trump with numerous memes portraying him as a chicken, even as her aides sought a rule change to keep mics open and live during the debate.In the Trump-Biden debate that resulted in a debacle for the President, the Biden campaign wanted the mic of one candidate to be muted when the other spoke, ostensibly to prevent Trump from interrupting the President. That arrangement, which the Trump camp agreed to reluctantly, eventually worked out to Trump's advantage since he perforce had to be more restrained, and in the eyes of many observers, looked Presidential for a change.The Harris campaign now wants an open mic arrangement since they believe their candidate can manage Trump's interruptions and he (Trump) will self-destruct if he is allowed to speak unhindered.“We have told ABC and other networks seeking to host a possible October debate that we believe both candidates’ mics should be live throughout the full broadcast,” the Harris campaign said in a statement, adding, “Our understanding is that Trump’s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own.”The Harris campaign and it partisans on the liberal spectrum believe Trump is a trainwreck if he allowed to speak unfettered. But Trump himself believes his style -- which disdains policy and details in favor of virulent ad hominem attacks full of falsehoods and distortions -- works for him. He has blown off senior Republican grandees who have urged him to focus on policy and who have argued that what will win him the elections.Still, Trump managed to upstage Democrats on Monday with what his supporters portrayed as a very presidential act of visiting the Arlington National Cemetery to honor 13 service members who died in the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal three years ago today.Trump has often blamed the Biden-Harris dispensation for the debacle, although it was during his Presidency that the Taliban was invited to Camp David and accorded recognition, undermining the then Ashraf Ghani government in Kabul and setting the stage for the US rout.Trump supporters accused Biden and Harris of ignoring the sacrifices of the US military while their supporters said the former President had consistently desecrated US military personnel by calling those who lost their lives ""suckers"" and ""losers,"" allegations Trump has denied.At least three senior US generals who worked with Trump during his time in the White House eventually parted ways with him saying he was unfit to be president. They are among more than three dozen Trump White House officials, including then vice-president Mike Pence, who have not endorsed him for the 2024 presidential elections.","The first and only scheduled Presidential debate on September 10 between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is in jeopardy.

NYT Donald Trump Kamala Harris: Columnist Rich Lowry slammed for his 'how to go after Kamala Harris' suggestion in NYT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columnist-rich-lowry-slammed-for-his-how-to-go-after-kamala-harris-suggestion-on-nyt/articleshow/112814629.cms,"'Kamala Harris is weak and phony'

Rich Lowry came under Dem attack Monday for his New York Times column in which he said that Donald Trump can win on character as in not character assassination but what he has been doing so far -- questioning the ability.""Presidential races are won and lost on character as much as the issues, and often the issues are proxies for character. Not character in the sense of a candidate’s personal life, but the attributes that play into the question of whether someone is suited to the presidency — is he or she qualified, trustworthy and strong, and does he or she care about average Americans?"" Rich Lowry, the editor-in-chief of National Review wrote.Rich wrote that presidential races are deeply personal and it involved disqualifying the opponent more than convincing voters that the opponent's platform is not right. He cited the example of how the Obama team hammered Mitt Romney calling him 'heartless' 'out-of-touch capitalist' and all policy debates basically went back to this.Defending his argument, Rich wrote that Trump won't be going to beat Harris in debate over border or price controls. ""Everything has to be connected to the deeper case that Ms. Harris is weak, a phony, and doesn’t truly care about the country or the middle class. The scattershot Trump attacks on Harris need to be refocused on these character attributes,"" he wrote.""To wit: Ms. Harris was too weak to win the Democratic primary contest this year. She was too weak to keep from telling the left practically everything it wanted to hear when she ran in 2019. She is too weak to hold open town-hall events or do extensive — or, at the moment, any — sit-down media interviews.""There is plenty that Trump campaign can work to attack Kamala Harris not doing anything as the vice president, not addressing a press conference etc, Rich wrote making a case in point.""Of course, Mr. Trump doesn’t need much convincing to launch personal attacks. He said earlier this month that he feels “entitled” to them. But calling Ms. Harris dumb or questioning her racial identity does more to undermine him than her. The point isn’t to be gratuitously insulting, but to make a root-and-branch argument that she shouldn’t be — can’t be — president,"" he wrote.Commentator Keith Olbermann called Rich Lowry a piece of s****. ""People are hammering that Rich Lowry piece for the headline on ""Trump Can Win on Character,"" but it's even worse than you think: He means Trump can win by being Trumpy about Harris's character, and he thinks that's a good idea that would work and not shameful at all,"" another wrote.","Rich Lowry, the editor-in-chief of National Review wrote that presidential races are deeply personal and it involved disqualifying the opponent more than convincing voters that the opponent's platform is not right.

Venkataramani stressed on the need for responsible tourism. He emphasized that India would continue to play a role in building a cohesive and peaceful world, wherein tourism would be a key factor.""India is beginning to build a world of togetherness. So, how do we therefore build a world of togetherness in which all of us have equal regard. Each country, each community, each faith have equal regard for each and every one of us. And from that equal regard what we get is equal reward for our relationships. It can be equal reward in terms of market, in terms of commerce, industry. So I think India stands for equal regard and equal reward principle and I think tourism is probably one umbrella where we can talk more and more about it. And to project India's position in it.""""I think it's important for us to spread this message of goodwill and togetherness. What else can be a better package than a tourism package? I think all of us can build into it, weave into it and be part of India's global journey towards a higher level of togetherness at the global level.""Speaking at the programme, Lalit Bhasin, Immediate Past National President of IACC outlined his association with the tourism and hospitality space. ""My association with tourism, hospitality was nearly 6 decades, when I started practicing law,"" he said.In a panel discussion on ""Outbound Tourism, India to USA"", Suman Billa, Additional Secretary, Union Ministry of Tourism highlighted the strong bilateral partnership and the growth in travel between the two countries, there is significant headroom for progress in this space.""So there's a lot that is happening based in India and I think it is a little bit surprising even though the numbers are good. If you look at from a tourism perspective, we really have not capitalized on the potential that we have. I think judging by the potential of what we have, there is probably much more headroom for us to capture,"" Billa said, adding that the growth in the Indian economy is unlikely to slow down adding all the more potential for growth in outbound tourism.""India has been the fastest growing of the lot. And nothing in the market seems to suggest that it is going to slow down. So I think our natural affinity to the US will draw us closer and will open more pathways for us to explore and I think tourism should be one of those pathways which will open the doors for the possibility, but to build more understanding between the people of India and the United States,"" he added.He noted that although a US visa is valid for 10 years, not requiring any frequent updates by a visa holder, the process of getting the visa for the world's largest economy is a cumbersome and tiresome process. He also stressed on the need for more direct flights between India and the US.Jonathan M Heimer, minister Counsellor for Commercial Affairs, India US Commercial Service, however, noted that over the past one year, the pace of visa application processing has gained momentum leading to record visa issuances. ""On the backend for the application processing, we've been able to process something like 60% more visas with more or less the same resources. And also we have issued more than 1.1 million visas in the last year, which for us, is a record and that's just going to continue to go up that number,"" Heimer added.In his response to the issue of the visa application process, Rajesh Magow, Co-Founder & Group CEO, MakeMyTrip Limited suggested the introduction of short term visas for tourists.""There are many other countries which have done it, maybe short-term tourist visas can be quick, maybe that could be one potential innovation that can happen as well,"" he said. Speaking in favour of boosting international tourism he said that international travel is not growing at the cost of domestic travel.Talking on the revival of air travel from the Covid-induced slowdown, Harvinder Singh, Director India & Middle East, United Airlines noted that all the three key segments of air travel -- business, students and leisure -- have picked up and gained momentum.""What we see in terms of the segmentation is business, there is the student along with the leisure part and what we have really observed is all these segments are actually going,"" he said. Singh also stressed on the need for better customer experience with the help of newer technologies and other resources.",India and the US have a lot of unexploited potential in the tourism and hospitality space. More direct flights between the two countries and swifter visa application process is the need of the hour to boost the segment.

Trump highlighted what he believes is bias within ABC News and raised issues over various aspects of the debate.In a social media post on Sunday night, Trump expressed frustration over what he described as a ""ridiculous and biased interview"" of Senator Tom Cotton by ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, and criticised the network's panel, which he believes is against him.Initially, Trump had agreed to face off against President Joe Biden on ABC News. However, following Biden's decision to end his campaign and Harris assuming the role of the Democratic nominee, Trump attempted to move the debate to Fox News but was eventually compelled to stick with the original arrangement. Despite some back-and-forth, Trump conceded to maintain the previously agreed-upon plan.In a social media post on Sunday, Trump questioned whether he should participate in the debate on ABC. He also took aim at Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, misspelling her name and accusing her of potentially favouring Harris, as well as using a disparaging nickname for ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos.Trump wrote, ""Will panelist Donna Brazil give the questions to the Marxist Candidate like she did for Crooked Hillary Clinton? Will Kamala's best friend, who heads up ABC, do likewise. Where is Liddle' George Slopadopolus hanging out now? Will he be involved?""Trump's criticism extended to the network choice, wondering why Harris declined debates on other major networks such as Fox News, NBC, CBS, and CNN.The debate negotiations have been contentious, with both campaigns clashing over dates, venues, and rules. Traditionally, the Commission on Presidential Debates has organised these forums in a standardised, nonpartisan manner. This year’s debates were arranged directly with the networks. The first debate between Trump and Biden was held on CNN on June 27, with the second scheduled on ABC News for September 10.Earlier, Trump briefly pulled out from the ABC debate but returned after Harris refused to move the event to Fox News. Currently, the Harris campaign is pushing for modifications to the debate rules. Initially, Biden had requested muted microphones when it wasn't a candidate's turn to speak. Yet, the Harris campaign is now advocating for microphones to remain live throughout the entire debate.Brian Fallon, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, articulated that Trump's team preferred muted microphones because they were worried about his ability to sustain a presidential demeanor for the full duration of 90 minutes.""ABC offered the exact same debate rules as CNN, and we accepted -- as did the Harris camp,"" said Trump spokesperson Jason Miller. ""Now, after the Harris campaign has begun debate prep, they're clearly concerned about what they're seeing from Harris' performance and want a whole host of rules changes.""Despite Trump's objections, the debate moderators have been confirmed as ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis.","Former President Donald Trump has expressed concerns regarding his upcoming debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.

His arrest is part of a preliminary investigation focusing on the platform's alleged role in enabling criminal activity due to insufficient content moderation.Durov, who has long been a proponent of free speech and privacy, has faced scrutiny for Telegram's use in disseminating illegal content, which some argue poses significant challenges for law enforcement.Despite his recent arrest, he asserted that he has ""nothing to hide,"" and critics of the action argue that holding him accountable for the platform's content is misplaced. Telegram has grown remarkably since its launch, boasting over one billion users, and has become an important communication tool for various groups.Durov, who relocated from Russia in 2014 after clashing with authorities over user data privacy, now holds dual citizenship in the UAE and France. His legal troubles could have ramifications not just for Telegram but also for the way governments worldwide manage and regulate online platforms amid growing concerns over misinformation and misuse. The outcome of Durov's case may influence the operational practices of technology companies and their approach to user content.The circumstances of Durov's arrest have raised broader discussions about free speech, digital privacy, and the responsibilities of tech companies in moderating content. The arrest of the tech mogul, aged 39, led to a stern message from Moscow to Paris on Sunday, emphasizing the necessity of respecting his rights. Elon Musk , the proprietor of X, also expressed his disapproval, asserting that ""free speech in Europe was under attack.""But can Musk himself be arrested?Retired Lt Col Alexander Vindman issued a stark warning to Elon Musk on Sunday, suggesting that the tech billionaire should be ""nervous"" following the arrest of Telegram CEO .Vindman, a key witness in the impeachment trial against former President Donald Trump, took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice his support for the French authorities, stating, ""There’s a growing intolerance for platforming disinfo & malign influence & a growing appetite for accountability. Musk should be nervous.""Musk, on his part, has responded by defending Durov and expressing concern over what he perceives as government overreach, labeling the situation as ""dangerous times"" and promoting the hashtag #FreePavel.Prominent figures also weighed in on Durov’s arrest. RFK Jr condemned the French government's actions, saying, ""The need to protect free speech has never been more urgent."" Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski and conservative commentator Ian Miles Cheong echoed these sentiments, arguing that the arrest is an attack on free speech and a move to control information.Writing in the Hill, Douglas MacKinnon , an opinion contributor, has expressed apprehension that Musk might be arrested.""As someone who pays close attention to the politics and the media in the United Kingdom and Europe, I began to notice a shocking narrative emanating from a growing number on the left there calling for the arrest of Elon Musk as well as the cancellation of X, the social media site he owns.

In several 'coordinated' attacks on Monday, at least 39 people were killed by militants in the troubled southwestern region of Pakistan .Armed assailants targeted and killed 23 passengers in the Musakhail district of Balochistan province after forcibly removing them from buses, vehicles, and trucks, according to police and news agency AP quoted official sources as saying.Gunmen shot at passengers after checking their identities.The attack, which ranks among the most lethal in the area, took place during the night in the Kusakhail district of Balochistan province. The perpetrators set fire to at least 10 vehicles before making their escape from the crime scene.In a separate incident, gunmen targeted individuals in the Qalat district, also in Balochistan, resulting in the loss of at least 10 lives. Among the victims were police officers and also civilians who were passing by when the attack occurred.In yet another incident, a rail line between Pakistan and Iran and a railway bridge connecting Quetta to the rest of the country were damaged in recent attacks involving explosives.Police said they had found six bodies that have yet to be identified, near the attack on the railway bridge.""We have confirmed 39 people killed in several coordinated attacks carried out by the BLA terrorists,"" Shahid Rind, a spokesman for the Balochistan provincial government was quoted as saying by AFP.The southwestern province faced more violence as insurgents carried out a series of attacks across different districts.Mohsin Naqvi, the interior minister of Pakistan, strongly condemned the attack, describing it as ""barbaric"" and assured that those responsible would face the full force of the law and not evade justice.The attacks came after separatist group Baluch Liberation Army warned people to stay away from highways, as they launched attacks on security forces in various parts of the province.Baloch seperatist elements in Baluchistan have a history of targeting workers and individuals from the eastern Punjab province, as part of their efforts to pressure them into leaving the region. Balochistan has been grappling with a low-intensity insurgency for many years.The majority of such previous killings have been attributed to the banned Baluchistan Liberation Army and other organizations seeking independence from the central government in Islamabad.
