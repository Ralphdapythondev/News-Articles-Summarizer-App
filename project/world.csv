"Pro-Palestine protests: Fresh stir in US college campuses, over 2,300 arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pro-palestine-protests-fresh-stir-in-us-college-campuses-over-2000-arrested/articleshow/109801954.cms,"NEW DELHI: Police ordered pro-Palestinian protesters to abandon a tent encampment at New York University early Friday, following weeks of demonstrations and police crackdowns at college campuses nationwide that have resulted in more than 2,300 arrests.About a dozen protesters who refused police orders to leave were arrested and about 30 more left voluntarily, according to NYU spokesperson John Beckman.The school asked the New York Police Department to intervene “to minimize the likelihood of injury"" and disruption, Beckman said.Classes will proceed as scheduled on Friday, he said. A larger NYU encampment was dismantled on April 22, when more than 130 protesters were arrested.The protests and arrests have taken place in nearly every part of the country, but in the last 24 hours, the University of California, Los Angeles has been the center of attention, where tumultuous scenes unfolded early Thursday as officers in riot gear clashed with protesters.At UCLA, hundreds of demonstrators refused to comply with orders to disperse, with some creating human chains as police used flash-bangs to disperse the crowds.Later on Thursday morning, workers cleared the protesters' fortified encampment, removing barricades and using bulldozers to collect trash and tents. Some buildings were covered with graffiti.The protests began at Columbia University on April 17, with students demanding an end to the Israel-Hamas conflict, which has claimed the lives of more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the health ministry there. Israel initiated its offensive in Gaza after Hamas militants killed approximately 1,200 people, primarily civilians, and took around 250 hostages in an attack on southern Israel on Oct 7.UCLA Chancellor Gene Block stated on Thursday that the encampment had become ""a focal point for serious violence as well as a huge disruption,"" endangering people on campus, preventing students from attending classes, forcing building closures, and leading to class cancellations.California Highway Patrol officers arrived at the UCLA campus in large numbers early Thursday, wearing protective gear and using batons to separate themselves from protesters, who were equipped with helmets and gas masks and chanted, ""You want peace. We want justice.""Officers warned protesters for hours that they would be arrested if they did not disperse, and there were scuffles and shoving between protesters and police. Police helicopters circled overhead, and the sound of flash-bangs filled the air. As arrests were made, police removed protesters' helmets and goggles.The law enforcement response and ongoing warnings contrasted with the events of Tuesday night, when counter-demonstrators attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, throwing objects, using pepper spray, and tearing down barriers. The fighting continued for hours before police intervened, resulting in no arrests but at least 15 injured protesters. The lukewarm response from authorities drew criticism from various groups and leaders.By Wednesday afternoon, a small city sprang up inside the reenforced encampment, with hundreds of people and tents on the quad. Demonstrators rebuilt the makeshift barriers around their tents while state and campus police watched.Some protesters said Muslim prayers as the sun set, while others chanted “we’re not leaving” or passed out goggles and surgical masks. They wore helmets and headscarves, and discussed the best ways to handle pepper spray or tear gas.Israel has branded the protests antisemitic, while Israel’s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers — some of whom are Jewish — call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war.US President Joe Biden on Thursday defended the students’ right to peaceful protest but decried the disorder of recent days.Meanwhile, a Police officer fired the gun while clearing protesters from Columbia University administration building earlier this week.More than 100 protesters were taken into custody during Columbia's crackdown on Tuesday. They are part of more than 2,000 people who have been arrested during pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses across the United States in recent weeks.Columbia's demonstrators had seized Hamilton Hall early on Tuesday, ramping up their presence on the campus from a tent encampment that had been there since April 17. The encampment was one of the earliest on college campuses.Despite more than 100 arrests on April 18 and the clearing of the tents, the protesters defied threats of suspension to return to the encampment. Then they escalated their demonstration by occupying Hamilton Hall, an administration building that was similarly seized in 1968 by students protesting racism and the Vietnam War.(With inputs from agencies)","Police ordered pro-Palestinian protesters to abandon a tent encampment at New York University early Friday.

Hundreds rescued from flooding in Texas as waters continue rising in Houston,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hundreds-rescued-from-flooding-in-texas-as-waters-continue-rising-in-houston/articleshow/109849496.cms,"HOUSTON: High waters flooded neighborhoods around Houston on Saturday following heavy rains that have already resulted in crews rescuing more than 400 people from homes, rooftops and roads engulfed in murky water. Others prepared to evacuate their property.A wide region was swamped from Houston to rural East Texas, where game wardens rode airboats through waist-high waters rescuing both people and pets who did not evacuate in time.One crew brought a family and three dogs aboard as rising waters surrounded their cars and home.A flood watch was in effect through Sunday afternoon, as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night and the likelihood of major flooding.""It’s going to keep rising this way,” said Miguel Flores Jr., of the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood. “We don’t know how much more. We’re just preparing for the worst.”Husband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.Water could be seen flowing into parts of the couple’s subdivision, but Aron Brown said he wasn’t worried because their home is at a higher elevation than others in the neighborhood.Brown, who had driven from his home in a golf cart, said the flooding wasn’t as bad as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He pointed to nearby power lines and said that flooding during Harvey had reached the top of the lines.RESIDENTS IN LOW-LYING AREAS ASKED TO EVACUATEFriday's fierce storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes. Officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.“A lull in heavy rain is expected through (Saturday) evening,” according to the National Weather Service. “The next round of heavy rainfall is expected late (Saturday) into Sunday.”Up to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of additional rain was expected, with up to 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) possible in isolated areas.Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said more rain was expected Sunday, and if it’s a lot, it could be problematic. Hidalgo is the top elected official in the nation’s third-largest county.ONGOING RAIN HAS LEFT PARTS OF TEXAS DRENCHED, RESIDENTS TRAPPEDMost weekends, Miguel Flores Sr. is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre (1-hectare) lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family were loading several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.Water from the San Jacinto River had already swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise — what was about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday measured about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day.“It’s sad, but what can I do,” Flores said. He added that he has flood insurance.For weeks, drenching rains in Texas and parts of Louisiana have filled reservoirs and saturated the ground. Floodwaters partially submerged cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, reaching the roofs of some homes.More than 21 inches (53 centimeters) fell over a five-day period through Friday in Liberty County near the city of Splendora, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Houston, according to the National Weather Service.Hidalgo said Saturday that 178 people and 122 pets have been rescued so far in the county. Scores of rescues took place in neighboring Montgomery County. In Polk County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Houston, officials said they have done over 100 water rescues in the past few days.HOUSTON IS ONE OF THE MOST FLOOD-PRONE METRO AREAS IN THE USAuthorities in Houston have not reported any deaths or injuries. The city of more than 2 million people is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country and has long experience dealing with devastating weather.Hurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.Of particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.The weather service reported that the river was at nearly 74 feet (22.6 meters) late Saturday morning after reaching nearly 78 feet (23.7 meters). The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near flood stage of 58 feet (17.6 meters) by Thursday.Most of Houston’s city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week’s time.The greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers) — a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous that drain into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.The system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city’s growth and bigger storms.","A flood watch was in effect through Sunday afternoon, as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night and the likelihood of major flooding.

Supporting the crew at an altitude of 700 km above Earth, the newly developed Extravehicular Activity (EVA) suit will provide vital aid during the historic first-ever commercial astronaut spacewalk .During the five days mission, the crew will conduct SpaceX 's inaugural Extravehicular Activity (EVA) from the Dragon spacecraft , making it the first commercial astronaut spacewalk.This historic event will also be the first instance of four astronauts being exposed to the vacuum of space at the same time.""In a post on X, formerly known as twitter, SpaceX shared a video and said, The SpaceX Extravehicular Activity (EVA) suit--- At ~700 km above Earth, the EVA suit will support the Polaris Program ’s Polaris Dawn crew in the vacuum of space during the first-ever commercial astronaut spacewalk.""This suit, an advancement from the current Intra Vehicular Activity (IVA) suit worn aboard Dragon human spaceflight missions, ensures the crew's safety and functionality in the vacuum of space.The EVA suit has been designed with a focus on mobility, incorporating new materials, fabrication processes, and innovative joint designs to enhance flexibility for astronauts in pressurized scenarios while maintaining comfort in unpressurized situations.The 3D-printed helmet incorporates a new visor to reduce glare during the EVA in addition to the new Heads-Up Display (HUD) and camera that provide information on the suit’s pressure, temperature, and relative humidity.The suit includes upgrades for improved reliability and redundancy during spacewalks, featuring added seals and pressure valves to maintain pressurization and ensure the crew's safety.The EVA suit has evolved from the Intra Vehicular Activity (IVA) suit and includes improved mobility, an advanced helmet Heads-Up Display (HUD) and camera, new thermal management textiles, and materials borrowed from Falcon's interstage and Dragon's trunk.The Polaris Program, announced by Jared Isaacman and SpaceX in February 2022, aims to rapidly advance human spaceflight capabilities while supporting important causes on Earth.The development of the EVA suit and the execution of the spacewalk are crucial steps towards creating a scalable design for spacesuits that can be used on future long-duration missions as humanity expands its presence beyond Earth.The enhancements to the EVA suit are part of a scalable design that allows teams to produce and adapt the suit to different body types, promoting greater accessibility to space for all of humanity.While the Polaris Dawn mission will be the first time the EVA suit is used in low-Earth orbit, its ultimate purpose is to support the construction of a base on the Moon and a city on Mars, which will require millions of spacesuits.In its first mission, Polaris Dawn, Isaacman, the commander, will fly a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft alongside Sarah Gillis, Anna Menon and Scott Poteet. Polaris's second launch will also employ a Dragon, but the third aims to be the first crewed mission for SpaceX's next-generation Starship spacecraft .","The Polaris Dawn mission, the first of the program's three human spaceflight missions, is set to launch in mid-2024.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: In the serene pastures of rural America, a seemingly whimsical activity has gained popularity: cow cuddling . This unique form of agritourism, where visitors pay to spend time with cattle, offers more than just a novel experience; it has become a crucial economic activity for many small farmers . These interactions, often highlighted on social media, not only provide city dwellers with a taste of country life but also offer therapeutic benefits to participants.""Agritourism has become a significant economic boon for small farmers who have carved out a niche for themselves,"" said Curt Covington, Senior Director of Institution Credit at AgAmerica Lending.Farmer Luz Klotz straightened the brightly striped hair bow on Reba, a 1,600-pound heifer lounging on the ground under twinkling fairy lights. Teenager Joey Pachl, hoping to impress his girlfriend with an invitation to the high school prom, had paid $75 for an hour-long cow cuddling session at the farm.Pachl successfully wowed animal loving girlfriend Emma. For Luz and husband Dan Klotz, such visitors have become key to covering the feed bills and keeping their small farm running.However, the pastoral tranquility of such farms is currently under threat from an unexpected source—the outbreak of bird flu in dairy herds across several US states. The presence of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, in dairy cattle poses significant risks not only to the livestock but also potentially to human health. This development has prompted urgent responses from both state and federal agricultural departments, urging farmers to limit public access to their farms to control the spread of the disease.In Michigan, the state's agriculture department responded swiftly with an emergency order to implement new sanitation measures and limit public access to farms. ""Now is not a good time to cuddle cows,"" said Tim Boring, the department's director, emphasizing the need to protect both animal and human health.The restrictions, while necessary, pose significant economic risks to small family farms that depend on agritourism. For places like the De Vor Dairy Farm and Creamery in northern Michigan, where bookings are made weeks in advance, the financial implications are particularly severe. As the industry navigates these challenging times, the resilience of these small enterprises and the adaptability of agritourism will be critically tested.","Cow cuddling is a unique form of agritourism where visitors pay to spend time with cattle.

NEW DELHI: Anti-war demonstrations stopped this week at a few US universities after university officials made agreements with pro-Palestinian protesters to prevent any disruptions of final exams and graduation ceremonies.The agreements at schools such as Brown, Northwestern, and Rutgers are among the few universities that witnessed over 2,400 arrests on 46 campuses across the country since April 17.Deals include commitments made by universities to review their investments in Israel or even consider calls to stop doing business with the long-time US ally.""I think for some universities, it might be just a delaying tactic to diffuse the protests,"" AP quoted Ralph Young, a history professor who studies American dissent at Temple University in Philadelphia.""The end of the semester is happening now. And maybe by the time the next semester begins, there is a cease-fire in Gaza.""Protesters at the University of Vermont achieved success when the university administration declared on Friday that the commencement speaker, the US ambassador to the United Nations, would no longer deliver a speech to the graduating students at the end of this month.The demonstrators, who set up a camp on Sunday, had requested that Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield's speech be excluded from the upcoming ceremony due to her involvement in the US vetoing several UN cease-fire resolutions.Israel has accused the protests of being anti-Semitic; critics claim that the country employs such accusations to suppress dissent. While a few demonstrators were reported making anti-Semitic comments or threats of violence, the organizers of the protest - including some who are Jewish - have described it as a peaceful campaign to support Palestinian rights and oppose the war.Administrators at the University of California, Riverside, made an announcement on Friday that they reached an agreement with protesters to shut down their campus encampment. The deal included the formation of a task force to explore removing Riverside's endowment from the broader UC system's management and investing those funds ""in a manner that will be financially and ethically sound for the university with consideration to the companies involved in arms manufacturing and delivery.""The announcement marked an apparent split with the policy of the 10-campus UC system, which last week said it opposes ""calls for boycott against and divestment from Israel.""""While the University affirms the right of our community members to express diverse viewpoints, a boycott of this sort impinges on the academic freedom of our students and faculty and the unfettered exchange of ideas on our campuses,"" the system said in a statement.""UC tuition and fees are the primary funding sources for the University's core operations. None of these funds are used for investment purposes.""Demonstrators at Rutgers University, where finals were paused due to the protests on its New Brunswick campus, also packed up their tents on Thursday afternoon. The state university agreed to establish an Arab Cultural Center and not to retaliate against any students involved in the camp.Chancellor Francine Conway mentioned the protesters' demand to stop investing in companies that have business dealings with Israel and to end Rutgers' connections with Tel Aviv University. She said the the request is under review, but ""such decisions fall outside of our administrative scope.""Protesters at Brown University in Rhode Island agreed to take down their camp on Tuesday. School officials mentioned that students have the opportunity to make a case for removing Brown's investment from companies involved in and benefiting from the conflict in Gaza.In addition, President Christina Paxson of Brown University will request an advisory committee to provide a suggestion on divestment by September 30. This recommendation will then be presented to the university's governing corporation for a vote in October.Northwestern's Deering Meadow in suburban Chicago also became quiet after reaching an agreement on Monday. The agreement reduced protest actions in exchange for bringing back an advisory committee on university investments and other obligations.The arrangement received criticism from both sides. Some pro-Palestinian protesters condemned it as a failure to stick to their original demands, while some supporters of Israel said it represented ""cowardly' capitulation.Seven of 18 members subsequently resigned from a university committee that advises the administration on addressing antisemitism, Islamophobia and expressions of hatred on campus, saying they couldn't continue to serve ""with antisemitism so present at Northwestern in public view for the past week.""Michael Simon, who is the executive director of an organization for Jewish students called Northwestern Hillel, mentioned that he resigned because he believed that the committee would not be able to reach its objectives.Faculty at Pomona College in California voted in favor of divesting from companies they said are funding Israel's war in Gaza, a group of faculty and students said Friday.The vote on Thursday does not have a binding effect on the liberal arts school, which has almost 1,800 students located to the east of Los Angeles. However, supporters expressed their hope that this vote would motivate the board to cease investing in these companies and to begin disclosing the locations of its investments.""This nonbinding faculty statement does not represent any official position of Pomona College,"" the school said in a statement. ""We will continue to encourage further dialogue within in our community, including consideration of counterarguments.""The movement started on April 17 at Columbia, where student protesters constructed a camp to demand an end to the Israel-Hamas conflict.Late Tuesday, the police arrested over 100 individuals when they disbanded the Columbia encampment. According to the NYPD, an officer unintentionally fired his weapon inside Hamilton Hall during the operation on late Thursday.According to the health ministry in Gaza Strip, more than 34,000 Palestinians have lost their lives in the conflict. Following the incident on October 7, where Hamas militants caused the death of approximately 1,200 individuals, mainly civilians, and held around 250 hostages in southern Israel, Israel initiated its offensive.","Protesters at Brown, Northwestern, and Rutgers are among the few universities that witnessed over 2,400 arrests on 46 campuses across the country since April 17.

You are behaving like [government's] B-team against PTI.""Khan highlighted the unresolved issues regarding PTI's electoral symbol, alleged rigging during general elections and the status of PTI's petitions , behind his allegations of PTI being denied level playing field.He criticized the judiciary for what he perceived as coerced decisions and urged Supreme Court judges to emulate the stance of high court judges in rejecting wrongful decisions.Expressing a willingness to engage in dialogue, Khan conditioned it upon the return of what he claimed was a 'stolen mandate' and the release of imprisoned party workers.

They are constructed in cubic shape, often weigh no more than a few kg, and are deployed in space for various purposes.Weighing around 7 kg, the iCUBE-Q orbiter carries two cameras to take images of the lunar surface and has other sensors and apparatus for deep-space communication, altitude control, and other functions.The primary criteria for mission success, officials said, will be achieved with the successful separation of the iCUBE-Q from the Chang’e-6 Orbiter. Following separation, the secondary criteria will involve the satellite receiving a beacon signal that will confirm that the orbiter is working satisfactorily.Finally, the orbiter will take pictures of the Earth, and Moon and try to take pictures of at least two objects together (Earth, Moon, and the orbiter).As part of data collection, authorities said, iCUBE-Q will also collect data on the lunar magnetic field, establish a lunar magnetic field model, and lay the groundwork for future missions and international lunar cooperation.Dr Khurram Khurshid, a senior member associated with Pakistan’s space programme, said the satellite will reach the lunar orbit in five days and will circle the moon for three to six months.He added that different pictures of the surface of the moon will be taken with the orbiter’s help, after which Pakistan will have its own satellite images of the Moon for research.","Pakistan launched its first-ever lunar mission, iCube-Qamar, on Friday. The satellite will orbit the moon as part of Beijing’s Chang’e-6 space mission. The launch of the satellite was shown live on Pakistani TV stations and Chinese state television.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109825220,imgsize-16354,width-400,resizemode-4/109825220.jpg"
All that is left for Pak Army is to 'murder me': Imran Khan writes from prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/all-that-is-left-for-pak-army-is-to-murder-me-imran-khan-writes-from-prison/articleshow/109821286.cms,"LONDON/ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country where political leaders like him languish in jail and said all that is left for the powerful military leadership was to ""murder"" him.In a column for the UK's ‘Daily Telegraph' newspaper, penned from the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi where he is being held for disputed corruption charges, the 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician reiterated his previous assertion that if anything happens to him or his wife, General Asim Munir – the Chief of Army Staff, will be responsible.The founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said the cash-strapped country was at a “dangerous crossroads”, with the government a “laughing stock”.“The military establishment has done all they could against me. All that is left for them is to now murder me,” writes Khan.“I have stated publicly that if anything happens to me or my wife (Bushra Bibi), Gen. Asim Munir will be responsible. But I am not afraid because my faith is strong. I would prefer death over slavery,” he says.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy. However, the military has denied meddling in the country's politics.Khan warned that the state was treading the same path it trod in 1971, when it lost East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.“At the same time, it is seeing an upsurge in terrorism and a growing alienation in Balochistan where the issue of enforced disappearances is growing in severity. On Pakistan's borders, India has already admitted to undertaking assassinations inside of Pakistan and the international border with Afghanistan remains volatile,” he notes.Khan notes the military establishment's expectation of “unquestioning support” from the US, in return for the provision of access to airspace and related facilities to the US for military purposes, has been punctured after the publication of the latest US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which highlights the many human rights violations in Pakistan.“With an economy in crisis, spiralling prices and a people politically angry at having their electoral mandate stolen and being economically beleaguered, the state stands isolated,” he writes.Khan hailed the “democratic revenge” of the February 8 general election, during which people came out and “voted overwhelmingly” for candidates supported by his party.“Unfortunately, instead of accepting the people's mandate, the military establishment went into a fit of rage and electoral results were manipulated to bring into power the losers. The same vote tampering was seen in the recent by-elections,” he notes.The PTI founder also praised the six “brave judges” of the Islamabad High Court who have written a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan highlighting instances of harassment and blackmail including of their families by intelligence agencies.“This is unprecedented in our history – although, informally, many knew what was happening to the senior judiciary but for such a letter to have come from these judges shows the level of despair, anger and frustration,” he writes.","Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country.

According to Pakistan’s Institute Of Space Technology (IST), the moon-bound spacecraft is a lunar cubesat , designated ICube Qamar ( ICUBE-Q ), with a three-month mission span.The mission is a collaborative effort of IST’s faculty and students, Pakistan’s national space agency Suparco and China’s Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).In 2022, China National Space Agency (CNSA) had offered member-states a unique opportunity through Asia Pacific Space Cooperation Organisation (APSCO) to send a student-built payload to the moon on board the Change’6 mission. Pakistan’s ICUBE-Q was selected.According to IST, ICUBE-Q weighs approximately 7kg and is equipped with two optical cameras to capture the lunar surface. It features systems for attitude control, thermal management and deep-space communication.IST lists the main mission objectives as follows -- successful separation of ICUBE-Q CubeSat into lunar orbit from Change’6 Orbiter; use of Orbiter camera to record the release process of ICUBE-Q; successful reception of beacon signal from ICUBE-Q, confirming successful operation of CubeSat.Pictures will also be taken of the orbiter, earth and the moon, apart from two to three objects (moon, earth and orbiter) together, IST said.Change’6 will land on the far side of the moon, collect up to 2000 grams of lunar material and return to earth in a first-of-its-kind mission.","Pakistan is set to embark Friday on its maiden lunar mission on board China’s Change’6 orbiter.

Pakistan is now eyeing a new, longer and larger economic bailout package, but economists cautioned against the country’s continued reliance on overseas financial assistance, warning of potential dire consequences.IMF approved the immediate release of the tranche following a key meeting of the global lender’s executive board in Washington late Monday night.All board members favoured releasing the funds, except India, which abstained.Pakistan has been reeling from a severe economic crisis for more than two years, with its inflation at one point shooting up to nearly 38% and its foreign currency reserves depleted to $3bn in Feb 2023, enough to cover less than five weeks of imports.Last year, the global lender had approved a nine-month standby arrangement with Pakistan “to support its economic stabilisation programme”. The approval had allowed for an immediate disbursement of $1.2bn, with the rest phased over the programme’s duration — subject to two quarterly reviews.The IMF bailout proved important to save the country from default, the state broadcaster quoted PM Sharif as saying.Leading economist Qaiser Bengali expressed scepticism about the perceived stability, highlighting the temporary nature of the current situation and underscoring the necessity of meaningful reforms to address long-term economic challenges.“If the so-called stability was due to a rise in exports or better inflow of dollars, that would have been meaningful, but that is not happening,” Bengali said, adding that the economy cannot run on a policy of getting new loans to pay past loans.Pakistan’s external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.","PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country.
