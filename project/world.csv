Elon Musk labels Australia's government 'fascists' over proposed misinformation fines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-labels-australias-government-fascists-over-proposed-misinformation-fines/articleshow/113307591.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk labeled Australia 's center-left government as "" fascists "" after Canberra threatened to impose fines on internet platforms, including X , to curb the spread of misinformation online.On Thursday, the Labor government announced it would fine internet platforms up to 5% of their global revenue for failing to prevent the dissemination of misinformation.With this new legislation, Australia has joined global efforts to regulate borderless tech giants, Reuters reported.Under the proposed law, online platforms would be required to establish codes of conduct to prevent the spread of dangerous falsehoods and obtain approval from a regulator. If a platform fails to comply, the regulator will set its own standards and impose fines for non-compliance.Musk responded to a post by an X user linking the Reuters story about the misinformation law with a single word: ""Fascists.""A spokesperson for communications minister Michelle Rowland stated via email that companies operating in Australia must adhere to Australian laws.""This bill improves the transparency and accountability of platforms for users and the Australian people,"" Rowland said.Musk's comment on the push against misinformation drew criticism and ridicule from other lawmakers.""Elon Musk has had more positions on free speech than the Kama Sutra. When it's in his commercial interests, he is the champion of free speech, and when he doesn't like it... he's going to shut it all down,"" government services minister Bill Shorten told Channel Nine's breakfast show, according to Reuters.Assistant treasurer Stephen Jones told ABC television that social media platforms should not publish scam content, deepfake materials, or livestream violence under the guise of free speech.In a previous clash with the Australian government, X challenged a cyber regulator's order to remove posts about the stabbing of a bishop in Sydney in court in April, prompting Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to call Musk an ""arrogant billionaire.""The regulator later dropped its challenge against X after a setback in federal court.X had blocked Australian users from viewing the posts about the stabbing but refused to remove them globally, arguing that one country's rules should not dictate internet content.","Australia's government announced it would fine internet platforms up to 5% of their global revenue for failing to prevent the dissemination of misinformation.

Greenland landslide causes 9-day earthquake-like tremors: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/greenland-landslide-causes-9-day-earthquake-like-tremors-study/articleshow/113307227.cms,"A strange seismic signal detected last September did not resemble a typical earthquake but rather a slow tremor that reverberated for an additional three days. This anomaly prompted scientists to investigate its source.Initially, some scientists thought it was an “unidentified seismic object” because it did not appear to be an earthquake, according to Dr.Stephen Hicks from UCL, a member of the team involved, as reported by the BBC.Hicks noted that the signal continued every 90 seconds for nine days, sparking curiosity among the scientists and leading them to explore the true cause.The team used seismic data to trace the signal’s origin to Dickson Fjord in East Greenland. They gathered additional clues, including satellite imagery and photographs of the fjord taken by the Danish Navy just before the signal appeared.A satellite image revealed a cloud of dust in a gully within the fjord. Comparing photographs taken before and after the event showed that a mountain had collapsed, sending part of a glacier into the water.After extensive analysis, the scientists determined that 25 million cubic meters of rock had crashed into the water, triggering a massive landslide in the Greenland fjord. This landslide caused a 200-meter-high “mega-tsunami” that “shook the Earth” for nine days.The wave was “trapped” in the narrow fjord, moving back and forth for nine days and generating the vibrations.Typically, tsunamis, which are usually caused by underwater earthquakes, dissipate within hours in the open ocean. However, this wave remained trapped, according to the BBC.“This landslide happened about 200 kilometers inland from the open ocean,” Dr. Hicks explained. “These fjord systems are complex, so the wave couldn't dissipate its energy.”Scientists attribute the landslide to rising temperatures in Greenland, which have melted the glacier at the base of the mountain.The study concluded, ""Climate change drives feedback among the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and mass wasting events, and signals such as the one the authors observed may provide a new way of understanding these interactions.""","A seismic signal detected last September did not resemble a typical earthquake but rather a slow tremor that reverberated for an additional three days.

"Trump extends pet-eating claims: After cats and dogs, Haitian immigrants allegedly stealing geese too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-extends-pet-theft-claims-after-cats-and-dogs-haitian-immigrants-allegedly-stealing-geese-too/articleshow/113306988.cms,"In a striking escalation of his pet-eating conspiracy theories, former President Donald Trump has introduced a new twist to his debunked claims about Haitian immigrants . During a rally in Arizona on Thursday, Trump not only reiterated his false accusations that immigrants are stealing and consuming pets but also added geese to the mix.“Haitian immigrants have descended upon Springfield, Ohio, and are destroying their way of life,” Trump told the crowd.“A recording of 911 calls shows residents reporting that the migrants are walking off with the town’s geese. They’re taking the geese. You know where the geese are? In the park, in the lake. And even walking off with their pets.”However, the actual disruption in Springfield came from a bomb threat at City Hall, which led to early school closures and evacuations. According to The Haitian Times, the local Haitian community is facing property damage and heightened safety concerns, unrelated to Trump's sensational claims.Contrary to Trump's narrative, a local Springfield CEO recently praised Haitian immigrants as hard-working and reliable. The narrative about geese, based on a single 911 call, has been widely discredited.Trump’s rally speech also took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris, suggesting without evidence that her events draw “zero” attendees. This claim came as Harris spoke to a crowd of about 17,000 in North Carolina’s Greensboro Coliseum, according to her campaign.Additionally, Trump made an unusual pivot to discussing voter demographics, hinting that he might blame older voters if he loses the election. “My audiences, they’ve gotten younger and younger,” he observed. “Don’t worry, I still like the old people the best. I don’t care!” He added that he remains loyal to his longtime supporters despite the shifting crowd dynamics.","Former President Donald Trump claimed that Haitian immigrants are stealing and eating geese in Springfield, Ohio.

Debate fallout: Trump accuses ABC News of bias as Harris campaign pushes for rematch; Mark Penn calls for investigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/debate-fallout-trump-accuses-abc-news-of-bias-as-harris-campaign-pushes-for-rematch-mark-penn-calls-for-investigation/articleshow/113306638.cms,"In the wake of a contentious debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, controversy has erupted. Critics from Trump's camp are alleging bias on the part of ABC News , suggesting that Harris may have received debate questions in advance. Moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, the debate has faced scrutiny from Trump and his allies, who argue that the moderators were unfairly critical of the former president and showed favoritism towards Harris.Mark Penn , former advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton, has also called for an internal investigation by ABC News into the perceived bias of the debate moderators.Penn suggested an independent review of the moderators' texts and emails to determine if there was any effort to ""rig the outcome"" of the debate. He criticised the media coverage as ""laughable"" and highlighted the need for impartiality in future debates.Further scrutiny has been directed at the relationship between Harris and ABC News. ABC News journalist Linsey Davis, a co-moderator and member of the same sorority as Harris, has faced criticism for potential bias. Additionally, connections between Harris and Dana Walden, co-chairman of Disney (which oversees ABC News), have raised questions about impartiality. The New York Times reported that Walden and Harris are neighbors and that Walden has donated to Harris’s political campaigns.The drama intensified with claims from a MAGA supporter on X (formerly Twitter), who alleged an ABC whistleblower would reveal an affidavit about the debate. Conservative accounts, boasting over a million followers combined, echoed these claims, accusing the Harris campaign of having prior knowledge of the questions and the moderators of promising to ""fact-check"" Trump.In response, Harris' campaign has challenged Trump to a rematch, with Fox News offering to host. Trump has declined, asserting in a Truth Social post that Harris' push for another debate signifies his victory in their first encounter. Harris, however, emphasized the importance of another debate, stating, “I believe we owe it to voters to meet again.”Political commentators, including Doug Schoen and Noah Pollak, have criticized the moderators for their handling of the debate, with accusations of one-sided fact-checking and bias. Despite the fallout, Trump's reluctance to agree to another debate suggests that the initial confrontation may be the only opportunity for voters to see the candidates face off before the November election.The debate, drawing over 67 million viewers, was the first face-to-face encounter between Trump and Harris. It followed a tumultuous period for Trump, whose previous debate against Biden had led to calls for his exit from the race. With Biden's withdrawal and Harris's endorsement as his successor, the stakes were high.","Critics from Trump's camp are alleging bias on the part of ABC News.

Case against British Indian woman for Hindu prayers on beach collapses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/case-against-british-indian-woman-for-hindu-prayers-on-beach-collapses/articleshow/113240340.cms,"BRIGHTON: An Indian-origin woman and her husband are celebrating after charges that would have criminalised her Hindu prayers on the beach were thrown out of court.Sheila Jacklin (61), a British Telugu designer born to parents from Andhra Pradesh, was charged with harassment for chanting Sanskrit mantras and performing mudra gestures on the beach near her home in Normans Bay, a remote hamlet near Brighton, after neighbours who bought a second home next to them in 2014 said the gestures were offensive and made around 100 complaints to police.Sheila’s husband Nigel Jacklin (62), a statistician, was charged with assault and harassment. A three-day trial was scheduled to start on Tuesday at Brighton magistrates’ court.However, on the first day the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) applied to get the case adjourned. This was refused by the magistrates. The prosecution then offered no evidence and the trial collapsed. The couple were told by the magistrates they were ""free to go.""It was the second time a harassment case against Sheila over her Hindu prayers on the beach had reached court. The trial had collapsed the first time in 2019 too. On both occasions complaints were made by Stephane Duckett and his American partner Norinne Betjemann, who converted a workshop next to the Jacklins in 2014.The couple were charged this time with pursuing a course of conduct amounting to harassment against Betjemann by staring into her property, loitering, and intimidating behaviour which caused distress. They both denied all the charges against them.“I have been praying on the beach all over the world since the 1980s. I am a hippy. I am not interested in looking at my neighbour’s house,” Sheila told TOI outside court.She said she had been doing Hindu prayers on the beach for 22 years before the couple moved next door, pointing out there was no temple nearby and it was common to do Hindu prayers in the open air. She said it was important to practice in the same “ashram”. “To conflate one of the many mudras with an offensive gesture is a serious insult to Hinduism,” she said, referring to one complaint that her Aakash mudra was an “offensive” V-sign.“I should have the right to practise my religion freely in the UK. The idea I was going to be taken to court for harassment for praying is absurd,” she said.Nigel added: “We feel this is racist and Hinduphobic.”A CPS spokesperson said: “We requested an adjournment in this case in order to discharge our disclosure obligations following late submissions by the defence. Unfortunately, this request was refused by the court and we were regrettably left with no option but to offer no evidence.”However Nigel said the defence submissions were submitted on time and were not late.A Sussex Police spokesperson said they “conducted a thorough, impartial investigation into multiple reports of harassment, and one reported assault”. It said “enquiries were conducted without prejudice” and both suspects were interviewed. “Evidence was submitted to the CPS, which approved charges of harassment and assault by battery, before no evidence was offered after magistrates declined a request for adjournment from the CPS,”Sussex police said, adding it would continue to do all it could “to protect our communities and secure justice for victims of crime”.","Sheila Jacklin was charged with harassment for chanting Sanskrit mantras and performing mudra gestures on the beach near her home in Normans Bay, a remote hamlet near Brighton.

Time travel: A persistent mystery

A seemingly ordinary photograph from 1941 has sparked an online frenzy, with many speculating that it could be proof of time travel . The image, captured by Edwin Rosskam on Chicago's South Side, shows a group of children queuing to enter a cinema. However, one particular detail in the photo has ignited debate.The photo, first shared on Reddit, features a young boy at the far right of the group.Social media users have focused on what the boy appears to be holding, which resembles a modern-day Apple iPad. This has raised eyebrows, considering the first iPad was only released in 2010, nearly 70 years after the photo was taken. One Redditor enthusiastically noted, “iPad-carrying movie-goer, all the way to the right,” suggesting the possibility of time travel. Another user added, “How is the first kid in line holding an Apple iPad in 1941?”While the time travel theory gained attention, not everyone is convinced. Some users argue that the object in the boy's hand is more likely a book or notepad. One commenter dismissed the theory, stating, “Looks like a book to me,” and suggesting that the object might be a notebook. Adding historical context, another user pointed out, “Back in the early film days, ushers checked for pens and notepads to prevent bootleg recordings of the film.” This implies that the boy could simply be holding a notebook.As the debate over the ‘iPad’ continued, many users took the opportunity to reflect on the fashion of the era. The children’s attire, dressed in their finest for a trip to the cinema, was admired by many. The Redditor commented, “They all are dressed so nicely. To wear your Sunday best to see the movies must have been a fantastic treat.” Another agreed, expressing a wish for a return to such formal dressing for everyday activities, noting, “The little men’s hats are so adorable.”This isn’t the first instance where old photographs have sparked time travel theories. Enthusiasts have previously pointed to images where modern technology appears out of place. A notable example is a 1943 beach photo from Cornwall, where a man seemingly holds a mobile phone, though sceptics later suggested it was a cigarette. Similarly, a 1940s photo from Reykjavik shows a man who appears to be using a mobile phone. More recently, an ancient Greek tombstone was thought to depict a laptop, fueling further speculation.Despite ongoing discussions and debates, no concrete evidence has emerged to prove that time travel is possible. While quantum physics has explored non-linear time theories, scientists have yet to confirm if these could permit travel into the past or future. For now, it appears that what we’re seeing in the photograph is likely a case of mistaken identity—a notebook or Bible held by a young boy dressed up for a cinema outing. As fascinating as these discussions are, time travel remains firmly within the realm of science fiction.","A photo from 1941 has sparked an online frenzy, with many speculating that it could be proof of time travel.

When asked about the camera, she explained that her father installed it to monitor her movements and ensure her safety.She further stated that, while it might seem extreme to some, she had no objections to her father's decision.This remarkable act of protection, according to the daughter, was sparked by a recent tragedy in Karachi, where another woman lost her life in a violent incident. Her parents, deeply concerned about her safety, devised this innovative idea as a preventive measure.In the video, the daughter referred to her father as her personal ""security guard,"" noting that he will monitor her closely using the camera. She acknowledged that the risk of violence is real, especially following the incident in Karachi, and said her family wanted to do everything possible to protect her.The clip, captioned ""next level security,"" got huge views from social media users sharing their reactions. While some praised the father's dedication, others responded with humour, questioning the practicality of such an extreme measure.One user sarcastically commented, "" Itna digital bhi nahi hona tha "" (There was no need to be this digital).Another remarked, "" Piche se marega to nahi dikhega "" (It won’t help if someone attacks from behind).","The unusual protective measure has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread discussion and debate.

Rare 12th-century picture stone discovered in Germany featuring Christian imagery; read on to find out more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rare-12th-century-picture-stone-discovered-in-germany-featuring-christian-imagery-read-on-to-find-out-more/articleshow/113250765.cms,"Picture stone: Key features and historical significance



Purpose and future of the picture stone



Also Read |

In a remarkable archaeological discovery, a homeowner in Klotzow, Germany, has unearthed a rare 12th-century "" picture stone "" while conducting construction work. This ancient artefact, known as a ""bildstein,"" is a valuable addition to the limited number of such stones found along the Baltic coast of Germany and Poland, with only about 20 having been discovered to date.The intricately carved stone features a detailed depiction of a figure believed to be Otto of Bamberg , a prominent bishop known for his role in spreading Christianity throughout the Pomerania region.Otto, who lived from 1060 to 1139, was instrumental in the Christianization of what is now modern-day Germany and Poland and, and was noted for his diplomatic and religious influence in the area.The carving on the stone includes a figure dressed in a cap, shawl, and robe, and holding what appears to be a banner. A distinctive cross etched onto the shawl suggests that the figure could be a high-ranking religious official. This detail aligns with historical records indicating that Otto of Bamberg was known to have worn a pallium—a special garment granted to archbishops and bishops—when he received one from Pope Paschal II in 1111. The pallium’s presence in the carving supports the theory that the stone depicts Otto.The precise purpose of these mediaeval picture stones remains a topic of scholarly debate. They might have served as memorials or tombstones commemorating important individuals of the time. Given the religious symbolism of the cross on this particular stone, it is likely that it was intended to honour a significant figure in the Christianization of the region.Following further analysis, the stone is set to be permanently displayed in Klotzow, providing the local community and visitors with an opportunity to explore this important piece of mediaeval history. The discovery not only enhances the understanding of the Christianization process in Pomerania but also sheds light on mediaeval religious art and practices.","A homeowner in Klotzow, Germany, has unearthed a rare 12th-century "" picture stone "" This ancient artefact, known as a ""bildstein,"" is a valuable addition to the limited number of such stones found along the Baltic coast of Germany and Poland.

'Earth sure looks like a perfect world': 1st private spacewalk a success,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/earth-sure-looks-like-a-perfect-world-1st-private-spacewalk-a-success/articleshow/113308460.cms,"Two private astronauts moved outside their spacecraft early Thursday, conducting the first-ever commercial spacewalk. The spacewalk was the centerpiece of Polaris Dawn , a collaboration between Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jared Isaacman , a billionaire entrepreneur who is leading the mission. ""Back at home, we all have a lot of work to do, but from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world,"" he said while standing in the hatch of the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule with the planet above his head.The successful operation further reinforces that space travel is no longer the exclusive province of professional astronauts working at governmental space agencies like Nasa, and now neither is the derring-do of spacewalks, when astronauts are protected by just their spacesuits from airless doom.The Polaris missions - this one is the first of three - aim to accelerate technological advances needed to fulfill Musk's hope of sending people to Mars someday. Bill Nelson, the Nasa administrator, cheered the spacewalk, which the govt space agency played almost no role in. ""Today's success represents a giant leap forward for the commercial space industry,"" he posted on the social platform X.The spacewalk officially began at 6:12am EST with the flow of oxygen into the astronauts' spacesuits. That was almost three hours later than originally planned, but the operation proceeded without a hitch. Because there is no airlock in the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft used for the flight, the only way to perform a spacewalk is to let all of the air out of the spacecraft. Nasa and Soviet astronauts conducted spacewalks in a similar manner in the 1960s.First turning a hand crank, Isaacman opened the top hatch of the capsule and moved outside, where he conducted mobility tests of his spacesuit. His sojourn in the vacuum of space was brief: After a few minutes, Isaacman reentered the capsule, and another crew member, Sarah Gillis, a SpaceX engineer, moved outside and performed the same mobility tests. Although the two other crew members, Scott Poteet and Anna Menon, remained inside the vehicle, they were also wearing spacesuits inside the airless capsule.It was the first time that four astronauts were simultaneously exposed to the vacuum of space. After Gillis reentered, she closed the hatch, and the inside of the spacecraft was slowly repressurised. Less than two hours after it started, the spacewalk was over. A key goal of the Polaris Dawn mission is the development of more advanced spacesuits that would be needed for any attempt at off-world colonisation by SpaceX. Before the launch, Isaacman mused about how someone stepping onto Mars might one day wear a future version of the spacesuit that SpaceX developed for this mission. ""A huge honour to have that opportunity to test it.""Closer to Earth, commercial spacewalks could open up other possibilities once impossible to imagine, such as technicians repairing private satellites in orbit. Isaacman has even suggested that the second Polaris mission could attempt a trip to Nasa's aging Hubble Space Telescope to perform repairs and extend its life in orbit.The spacewalks by Isaacman and Gillis were short and modest in complexity. Unlike frantic scenes in science fiction movies, they waited patiently as air was slowly evacuated from their capsule. Then they moved methodically, following a carefully planned choreography that lasted only a few minutes. After opening the hatch, Isaacman pulled himself upward using a railing mounted to the top of the Crew Dragon. He never let go of the spacecraft as he performed a series of movements to test the capabilities of the spacesuits. When his time was up, he moved back down into the Crew Dragon, and Gillis then repeated the same actions.The Polaris Dawn crew's cautious approach was a reminder that space is an inherently inhospitable and dangerous environment, and during spacewalks astronauts are enclosed in a small bubble of air - their spacesuits - that keep them from suffocating in the vacuum of space. No astronauts have ever died or suffered serious injury during a spacewalk.There have been over 270 spacewalks conducted at the ISS since 1998 largely without incident. (Astronauts at the ISS enter and exit the space station through airlocks, minimising the amount of air that is released into space.)

How quick action by Alaska Airlines pilot prevented near-collision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/quick-action-by-alaska-airlines-pilot-prevents-near-collision-with-southwest/articleshow/113306902.cms,"Alaska Airlines plane aborts takeoff to avoid potential collision

An Alaska Airlines jet on Thursday was forced to abruptly halt its takeoff on the runway in Nashville to prevent a potential collision with a Southwest Airlines plane.Alaska Airlines confirmed that their pilots spotted ""a potential traffic conflict on the runway"" and applied the brakes immediately to prevent the situation from getting worse. No injuries were reported, but the extreme heat from the sudden stop caused the tires on the Boeing 737 Max , scheduled to depart for Seattle, to go flat.The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) is investigating the incident at the Nashville International Airport which occurred at around 9.15 am (ET), according to Chair Jennifer Homendy. ""We are clearly very concerned about this (incident) and others we are investigating,"" Homendy told reporters.The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) is also looking into the incident, which involved Southwest Airlines Flight 2029, a Boeing 737-700 , that had been cleared to cross the end of the same runway as an Alaska Airlines plane, as reported by AP.The Alaska Airlines flight was carrying 176 passengers and six crew members. The airline arranged for another plane to transport the passengers to Seattle by Thursday night while inspecting the affected aircraft. Alaska Airlines expressed gratitude for the pilots' quick response, saying, ""We’re grateful for the expertise of our pilots who immediately applied the brakes to prevent the incident from escalating.""According to tracking website Flightradar24, the Alaska plane was traveling at a speed of 104 knots (120 mph, 193 km per hour) on the runway before slowing down.Southwest stated that they are in contact with the NTSB and FAA and will cooperate with the investigation. Alaska Airlines reported that maintenance technicians in Nashville are currently inspecting the aircraft involved in the incident.There have been several close calls, or ""runway incursions,"" in recent years, raising concerns about the safety of US air travel. NTSB chair Homendy had mentioned last November that while these incidents are ""incredibly rare"" compared to the number of flights, they indicate the aviation system is under stress.Recent incidents include a close call in Austin, Texas, where a FedEx jet flew over a Southwest jet taking off in foggy conditions, and a collision between two Delta Air Lines planes on a taxiway in Atlanta. No injuries were reported in these incidents.Alaska Airlines also made headlines in January when one of the door panels blew out on a plane flying from Portland and bound for Ontario. The plane's pilot first Officer Emily Wiprud on Thursday recalled her experience of operating the flight. Her initial indication of the unfolding crisis was a deafening blast that reverberated in her ears, accompanied by a sudden rush of air. The severity of the situation was immediately apparent to her, although the presence of a breach in the aircraft's fuselage remained unknown until the plane touched down.""I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,"" Wiprud said. ""I knew something was catastrophically wrong."" Further complicating matters, her headset, along with the phones of two passengers and various airplane parts, had been forcibly ejected from the aircraft during the incident.","An Alaska Airlines jet was forced to abruptly halt its takeoff on the runway in Nashville to prevent a potential collision with a Southwest Airlines plane.

The blazes erupted during a blistering heat wave that has just subsided.The earthquake's epicentre was closest to the Malibu fault, but also in proximity to the Anacapa fault, as stated by Lucy Jones, a seismologist from the California Institute of Technology.

A CNN flash poll painted an even starker picture, with 60% of viewers saying Harris dominated the stage.Pundits were quick to declare Harris the victor, noting how she repeatedly backed Trump into a corner. According to Reuters , Harris ""put Trump on the defensive with a barrage of attacks on his record and legal woes,"" a view echoed by 52% of poll respondents who felt Trump struggled to keep up.For Harris, the poll is a welcome rebound after a recent New York Times/Siena College survey—widely regarded as highly accurate—showed her trailing Trump by a single point. That poll had put Trump at 48% to Harris' 47%, a razor-thin margin that had fueled anxiety within Democratic circles.Despite the positive numbers, the race remains tight, with battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin holding the keys to the White House. National polls, while promising, offer only a snapshot of the larger fight for electoral votes.In a bid to capitalize on her debate momentum, Harris' campaign swiftly challenged Trump to a second face-off, with Fox News offering to host the rematch. “Vice President Harris is ready for round two.

NTSB chair calls out Boeing’s ‘safety culture problem’ as FAA chief set to testify before Senate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ntsb-chair-calls-out-boeings-safety-culture-problem-as-faa-chief-set-to-testify-before-senate/articleshow/113303579.cms,"Boeing factory workers threaten strike over pay

Boeing is facing increased scrutiny over its safety practices as the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) administrator prepares to testify before the Senate on the agency's oversight of the company. The hearing, scheduled for September 25, will focus on Boeing’s safety culture , following recent concerns raised by Jennifer Homendy, Chair of the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ).Homendy stated that Boeing has a ""safety culture problem"" that must be addressed, particularly with its workforce, which reportedly lacks trust in the company.Homendy’s remarks come after a mid-air emergency involving an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX in January, which has led the FAA to intensify its oversight of Boeing. The upcoming Senate hearing , led by Senator Richard Blumenthal, will delve into how the FAA has handled Boeing’s safety issues, raising questions about both the company and the regulator's responses.Meanwhile, Boeing is also grappling with labour unrest as tens of thousands of factory workers, primarily in Seattle, have voted on whether to strike, potentially halting production of its best-selling planes. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers is considering the move due to dissatisfaction with Boeing’s recent contract offer, which includes a 25% pay rise over four years.Union members, some of whom gathered in protest, argue that the offer falls short of their demands for a 40% pay rise and the reinstatement of traditional pensions. Boeing has urged workers to accept the deal, warning that a strike would hurt the company’s recovery and damage trust with customers. If approved, the strike would impact the production of Boeing’s 737 Max, 777, and 767 models, further compounding the company’s ongoing challenges.","FAA administrator to testify before the Senate on the agency's oversight of the company.

Georgia Judge dismisses two charges in Trump's election case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/georgia-judge-dismisses-two-charges-in-trumps-election-case/articleshow/113303050.cms,"A Georgia judge on Thursday dismissed two criminal charges against former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election interference case. Additionally, a separate count targeting Trump’s allies was removed. Despite these dismissals, the core charges, including racketeering, remain in place.Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ruled that prosecutors had exceeded their authority by bringing charges related to filing false documents in federal court.Specifically, the charges of conspiracy to commit filing false documents and filing false documents against Trump were dismissed. A third charge, targeting Trump's allies for criminal attempts to file false documents, was also quashed. McAfee's decision was influenced by a 19th-century Supreme Court ruling that prevents states from prosecuting perjury or false filings in federal court.While some charges have been dropped, Trump still faces eight remaining counts, with the racketeering charge being a major component of the case. The accusations involve an alleged effort by Trump and his co-defendants to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat in Georgia as part of a broader attempt to challenge the election results. Both Trump and 14 others have pleaded not guilty.The legal proceedings have been delayed as Trump's team appeals Judge McAfee’s decision to keep Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis as the lead prosecutor. Oral arguments for the appeal are scheduled for December, and the case is unlikely to progress before the 2024 election. Trump’s attorney, Steve Sadow, praised the ruling, asserting that Trump and his team had ""prevailed once again,"" according to the New York Post.","A Georgia judge on Thursday dismissed two criminal charges against former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election interference case.

There has also been a 20-30% tariff increase on electricity and other energy products, hitting the common man hard.Pakistan's external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.The February general election produced Shehbaz Sharif-led shaky coalition government, which now has the challenging task of tackling deep-rooted structural problems to pull the $350-billion economy out of its misery.Since joining the multilateral lender in 1950, Pakistan has secured 24 IMF bailouts, the latest being subject to approval by the lender's executive board and the confirmation of necessary financing assurances from the country's development and bilateral partners.","Islamabad has been working on implementing conditions from the IMF to complete a $7 billion, 37-month loan programme agreed in July.

Khan had been arrested on Wednesday after being taken from an angry mob that accused him of insulting the Prophet Muhammad.The police officer responsible for the shooting has been arrested, according to police official Mohammad Khurram , who did not provide additional information.In Pakistan, accusations of blasphemy are common and can lead to mob violence and lynching, even if they are just rumors. The country's controversial blasphemy laws allow for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or Islamic religious figures, although no executions have been carried out.Before his arrest, local residents claimed Khan had used derogatory remarks against the prophet and went after him. After his arrest, a mob surrounded the police station, demanding that Khan be handed over to them for execution. One person threw a grenade at the station on Wednesday, and a group of Islamists briefly blocked a key road in the city, demanding punishment for Khan. The crowd eventually dispersed after officials managed to calm them down.Pakistan has seen an increase in attacks on blasphemy suspects in recent years. In June, a mob in Madyan lynched a tourist accused of desecrating the holy Quran, and in 2022, a mob in Punjab province attacked churches and homes of Christians after claiming they saw a local Christian and his friend desecrating pages from a Quran. The attack in Jaranwala drew nationwide condemnation, but Christians say the men linked to the violence have not yet been put on trial.In 2011, a policeman killed a former governor of Punjab province after accusing him of blasphemy. The officer, Mumtaz Qadri , was later sentenced to death and hanged, but support for him grew after his execution, with tens of thousands attending his funeral in Rawalpindi. Many in Punjab still consider him a martyr today.Quetta, a conservative city in southwestern Pakistan, is also the capital of the restive Balochistan province, where militant groups stage near-daily attacks and separatists have waged a decades-long insurgency against the government in Islamabad.","A police officer shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday.

:

Pakistani police have detained several leaders and lawmakers of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) from parliament’s compound, days after the party held a rally and served a two-week ultimatum for the release of the jailed former PM. The detentions followed alleged violation of norms during the rally.In a separate development, Ali Amin Gandapur , chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) from Imran’s PTI, went missing from Islamabad for eight hours Monday and emerged in his provincial capital Peshawar Tuesday.Sources revealed Gandapur was in the custody of an intelligence agency and added that the CM of the northwestern province was quizzed for hours before his release early Tuesday.Gandapur came under fire for a tirade against the military during PTI’s protest-cum-power show Sunday in Islamabad’s suburbs. “Fix your institution, fix your generals, fix yourself. If the founder of PTI (Imran) is not legally released within one to two weeks, we will have him freed ourselves,” the CM vowed.While several PTI lawmakers apologised for Gandapur’s remarks, Imran defended him, saying he had merely expressed the nation’s sentiments. “Party members who have apologised for Gandapur’s remarks are weak and cowards. They should not remain in PTI,” Imran was quoted as saying at his prison in Rawalpindi.Last week, the federal govt passed a law to “regulate” public gatherings in Islamabad. It set three-year jail terms for participants of “illegal” assemblies, with 10 years for repeat offenders. The Islamabad administration had allowed PTI’s Sunday’s rally from 4pm till 7pm, but the gathering went on until 11pm. “They were arrested due to violation of the new law,” Islamabad police spokespersonTaqi Jawad said, referring to PTI arrests, including that of chairman Gohar Khan .Since his removal from power in April 2022, Imran and his PTI have waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against the military.The PTI says it has faced a months-long crackdown since protesters allegedly linked to the party attacked and damaged govt and military installations on May 9, 2023, after Khan’s brief arrest that day in a land graft case. Hundreds of PTI arrests followed. Many remain behind bars. The military, which says Imran and his party were behind the attacks, has initiated army court trials of at least 103 people accused of involvement in the violence.In Feb this year, Imran and PTI were barred from the national election, which was alleged to have been rigged. Candidates aligned with the party, forced to contest independently, still won most seats in parliament but not enough to form the govt.

Several top leaders of Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad. The arrests included barrister Gohar Khan, Sher Afzal Marwat, and advocate Shoaib Shaheen, following a violent clash between PTI supporters and police during a protest demanding Khan's release. The arrests have been widely condemned by PTI as politically motivated.PTI has vehemently opposed the arrests, calling them a ""direct attack on democracy."" In posts on X (formerly Twitter), the party criticised the government's actions, arguing that the arrests are an attempt to suppress their movement.PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari condemned the detentions as ""illegal"" and said, ""These arrests won’t change anything; they will only increase public anger against this puppet government.""Omar Ayub Khan, another senior PTI figure, also denounced the arrests and revealed that police had been forming teams to apprehend him and other top PTI members, including Zartaj Gul Wazir . ""This fascist regime has gone completely mad... We will continue raising our voices for our leader, PM Imran Khan ,"" he wrote on X.Despite the crackdown, many PTI lawmakers remained inside Parliament House to avoid arrest, and more detentions are expected in the coming days. The Islamabad high court bar association has also condemned the arrests, demanding the release of Marwat and Shaheen, both respected members of the legal community.The arrests occur amidst growing political tension in Pakistan. Imran Khan, who has been imprisoned since 2022 on corruption charges, remains a central figure in the country's political landscape. His supporters’ continued protests and the government’s aggressive response have only heightened the political discord.The arrests were made under the newly enacted Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Bill, 2024. This legislation, which came into effect just before the PTI rally, empowers authorities to regulate and ban public gatherings in Islamabad. Under this law, the district magistrate can disband any assembly deemed likely to disturb public peace, with penalties including up to three years in prison or fines. Repeat offenders face even harsher penalties, potentially extending to 10 years of imprisonment.

At least 16 more Taliban members were wounded in the clash, the second since last week along one of the 18 border crossings linking Pakistan's Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces with Afghanistan in the southwest and northwest.Confirmation of the Taliban casualties by Pakistan's state-owned media contrasted with a statement by Afghanistan that unprovoked firing and shelling from across the border caused civilian deaths and displacement.Pakistan said the fighting started after the Taliban attempted to illegally set up a checkpoint near the border. Light and heavy weapons were used by both sides, officials said.“Afghan Taliban opened unprovoked firing with heavy weapons yesterday from inside Afghanistan, targeting Pakistani checkpoints,"" Radio Pakistan reported Monday. ""Pakistani security forces responded effectively and killed eight Afghan Taliban, including commanders Khalil and Jan Muhammad .""Scores of families along the Durand Line, the 2,640km border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, have fled their homes due to repeated clashes between the Islamic Emirate forces and the Pakistani military.""We have two casualties, one of them a woman, and about 11 wounded,"" Thamin Khan , a resident of Zazi Maidan district, was quoted as saying by official Afghan media.""Bullets struck our homes and it is unclear what will happen next. This situation has caused problems for us, forcing many to migrate,"" Mohibullah, another resident of the conflict zone, said.Videos circulating on social media showed heavy gunfire in the area.Khost's deputy governor directed residents and the forces stationed along the Durand Line to respond appropriately to any attacks, while the Afghan deputy minister for borders and tribal affairs said in Kabul that the latest dispute had been resolved.

Clashes often lead to closure of these border crossings, disrupting trade and movement of people. The Torkham border has been shut for the past three days after Afghan Taliban announced they were investigating reports of Pakistani fighter jets violating Afghan airspace to patrol Nangarhar and Kunar provinces.Pakistani officials have accused the Afghan Taliban of sheltering the banned militant group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

Strategy backfires

NEW DELHI: In an unusual critique of the military establishment, Pakistan 's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three-star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism throughout the country.In September 2021, as the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan after the sudden pullout of US troops in August, then ISI chief general Faiz Hameed had visited Kabul and was photographed enjoying tea, during which he assured a journalist that ""everything will be fine"" -- a pivotal point in Pakistan's military and intelligence strategy towards Afghanistan.""The country is paying a price for that cup of tea in Afghanistan,"" said Dar, without naming Hameed.The deputy PM further said that the decision by the general to release some militants was the reason behind increased attacks across Pakistan. ""Those released at that time are masterminding terrorism in Balochistan today,"" he said, indicating there is a widely held belief that the decisions made by military leaders during this period were not only misguided but have also contributed to the current instability in Pakistan.Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, made the rem­a­rks during a press conference at the Pakistan High Commi­ss­i­on in London.Stating that the 2021 visit to Kabul could not have happened without the permission of former PM Imran Khan, Dar hit out at the ""mistakes"" made by the ousted leader, particularly in relation to economic and security decisions, and linked the former administration's ""missteps"" to the current rise in terrorism and economic challenges.""I find it difficult to accept that he [Hameed] could have gone without the permission of the prime minister [Imran Khan]. We are working with the security establishment on issues today, these things are not possible without the PM's approval,"" said Dar.After criticising military officials of the ""past"", Dar was quick to praise the curr­ent military establishm­ent.""They cannot be praised en­o­ugh as its members are very professional. Their agenda is Pakistan, as is ours. This is a very good omen. They are not interested in who comes in government or opposition,"" he said.The Taliban's rise to power was initially seen by some in Pakistan as a potential boon, with expectations that the group would help curb the activities of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has long posed a threat to the Pakistani state.However, the reality has proven to be quite different, with the TTP intensifying its attacks since the Taliban's takeover, undermining the very stability that Pakistan hoped to achieve through its support of the Taliban.The situation in Balochistan is particularly alarming. The province has witnessed a significant uptick in violence, with attacks attributed to both the TTP and other militant groups.The Pakistani military's response has included increased operations against these groups, but the effectiveness of these measures remains in question. Dar's comments suggest a recognition that past decisions, particularly those made by military leaders like Hameed, have directly contributed to the current security crisis.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three- star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism.
