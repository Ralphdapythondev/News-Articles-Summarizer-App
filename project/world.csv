Donald Trump to host Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-to-host-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-at-mar-a-lago-resort-in-florida/articleshow/111974691.cms,"Donald Trump , the Republican presidential nominee, announced on Tuesday that he will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday.""Looking forward to welcoming Bibi Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago,"" Trump wrote in a social media post, referring to his private club and residence.This meeting, their first since Trump left office, comes amidst tensions between Netanyahu and Democratic President Joe Biden over Israel 's conflict with Hamas in Gaza .Trump shared a letter from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, written a day after the former US president was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania. In the letter, Abbas expressed his wishes for Trump's ""strength and safety."" Trump also mentioned his eagerness to meet with Netanyahu and work towards achieving peace in the Middle East.Netanyahu had reportedly requested an in-person meeting with Trump during his visit to Washington this week. The Israeli leader is set to address US Congress on Wednesday, seeking renewed support for Israel's military operations in the Palestinian enclave. He will also meet with both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who recently entered the 2024 presidential race following Biden's withdrawal.Analysts believe that Netanyahu is hedging his bets on the outcome of the November US election, as polls indicate a close race. Many believe that a second Trump administration would grant Netanyahu more freedom in the Gaza war. During Trump's 2017-2021 term, the two leaders were largely aligned ideologically and on policy matters, such as moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a decision that pleased Israelis but angered Palestinians.Trump has criticized Netanyahu for the security failures surrounding the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas cross-border attack on Israel and has urged Israel to quickly secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas and end the war in Gaza. In his social media post, Trump commended Netanyahu's role in the Abraham Accords, landmark US-brokered agreements signed during his presidency that normalized relations between Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates.""During my first term, we had peace and stability in the region, even signing the historic Abraham Accords - And we will have it again,"" Trump said on Truth Social. He also said that Harris, as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, was ""in no way capable of stopping"" world conflicts.","Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday.

Kamala Harris bags enough delegates for President run,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-bags-enough-delegates-for-president-run/articleshow/111973706.cms,"WASHINGTON: U

S vice-prez Kamala Harris has pretty much wrapped the Democratic nomination for the presidential election well before a formal process and the party convention on Aug 19, belying expectation in some quarters of internecine warfare. The party’s leadership, including Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, lawmakers, donors, activists, backroom operatives, and most of all the nearly 4000 delegates who will formally vote for the nomination quickly lined up behind Harris after a day of tumult when Prez Biden bowed out of the race on Sunday.An unofficial survey of delegates by the AP showed Harris with more than 2,500 delegates, well over the 1,976 needed to win a vote in the coming weeks.The nomination was bequeathed and blessed by the prez himself when Harris travelled to the Democratic campaign HQ in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden’s home state, on Monday to literally inherit the campaign.Secluded because of Covid at his home nearby, Biden phoned in to event to thank his staff and ask them to support Kamala with “every bit of your heart and soul.” “The name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn’t changed at all.We still need to save this democracy. Trump is... a danger to the nation,” Biden said, repeatedly asserting that he’s “not going anywhere” and he will be campaigning for Harris soon.“I’m watching you kid, I love you,” he said, cutting in when Harris was recalling how she and husband Doug regarded the prez and his wife Jill as family. Asserting that “we made the right decisions... we have a great great candidate,” Biden urged his campaign staff to “embrace her...she’s the best”.It has been a remarkable turnaround for the US vice-prez, who only a few months ago was under pressure for what many party activists saw as a lacklustre performance, with some even suggesting she should be jettisoned from the ticket and Biden should pick a new running mate. But within 48 hours of Biden’s exit from the race, the atmosphere has been transformed, with a palpable surge of energy and vitality — not to speak of money — flowing into the campaign. Since Sunday, Harris has raised $100 million, including $81 million in the first 24 hours since announcing prez bid, a record showing as donors and contributors re-opened the money spigot after what some operatives termed as a “Dembargo” to pressu re the prez into bowing out.With Biden’s exit from the race, Trump now becomes oldest presidential candidate in US history. In her remarks, a firedup Harris (59) immediately drew a contrast with her 78-year-old opponent, accusing him of wanting to “take our country backwards to a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights”. “We believe in a brighter future that makes room for all Americans. Over the next 106 days, we are going to take our case to the American people, and we are going to win,” she said.Referring to her career as a courtroom prosecutor and at torney general before she became a senator and vice-prez, Harris threw out a warning to Trump. “In those roles I took on perpetrators of all kinds... Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type,” she said.The dramatic turnaround on the Democratic side has enraged Trump and his MAGA flock, who flooded the social media platform X, owned by Trump supporter Elon Musk, with posts about Biden’s purported death, Harris’ coup, and araft of ugly racist rants.","U.S vice-prez Kamala Harris has pretty much wrapped the Democratic nomination for the presidential election.

Kamala Harris gets muted response in India as few see change in US ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-gets-muted-response-in-india-as-few-see-change-in-us-ties/articleshow/111943467.cms,"Four years ago, when Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate, much of India was abuzz over how the first Indian-American in the White House might affect the future of US-India relations .Now, Harris is a step closer to capturing the Democratic nomination for president — but few are expecting any change in ties should she win.Despite Harris’ well-documented Indian heritage and family links to the country there is little indication that her presidency would meaningfully tip the direction of the US-India relationship, which has strengthened in recent decades under both Republican and Democratic administrations.The US has sought to cultivate a deeper partnership with India as a bulwark against a more assertive China, while India has sought greater US investment and deeper cooperation in technology sharing and defense. The economic and strategic logic that underpins US-India ties would likely remain intact were Harris to win the White House, analysts and Indian officials said.“There would be a degree of continuity if she’s elected to the White House,” said Harsh Pant of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. “India has had a productive relationship with Mr Biden. And Kamala Harris was part of the administration.”In 2020, Biden’s choice of Harris as his running mate sparked a wave of excitement in India, with social media users poring over her family connections to Chennai, the southern Indian city where her mother was born. Undated photos surfaced of a younger Harris and her sister Maya in saris, posing with grandparents during a visit.Harris at the time was the first Black woman and the first woman of Indian descent on a major ticket in a US presidential election. Her joining the ticket sparked reports in Indian media over how a Biden-Harris win might further bolster ties between the two countries.Ties have indeed continued to improve, but India has not been a personal priority for Harris, who has instead been occupied with domestic issues, like reproductive rights and securing the US-Mexico border. Harris hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House last year, where she talked about her Indian heritage and praised Modi’s leadership. But she hasn’t visited India during her time as vice president.While on the campaign trail in 2019, Harris criticized Modi’s policies on Kashmir, a region contested by both India and Pakistan and was the site of a lengthy crackdown after Modi scrapped the Muslim-majority state’s autonomy. “We have to remind Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world,” she said in September of that year.One reason Harris’s Indian ties may not be much of a political factor is that they aren’t a prominent part in her public persona, said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs. “Unlike say Rishi Sunak in the UK, for example, who has been very open about showing his Indian and Hindu roots,” he said. Sunak was Britain’s prime minister until earlier this month.Instead, Harris’s African and Carribean heritage — her father is from Jamaica — is the more visible part of her public identity, Chaulia said.Modi, meanwhile, is widely believed to enjoy warmer and more personal ties with Donald Trump, who is the Republican’s candidate for president. Both leaders have hosted each other at political rallies in their respective countries, with Trump holding a “Howdy Modi” event in Houston before a huge crowd of Indian Americans in September 2019 — just days after Modi’s new policy in Kashmir.That event was followed up in 2020 with a visit by Trump to Modi’s home state of Gujarat for an event billed “Namaste Trump.” There, the US president addressed a rally of nearly 100,000 people at a stadium in the city of Ahmedabad.Irrespective of who wins November’s election, US-India ties should maintain their upward trajectory — despite having been tested in the last year. Allegations of India’s involvement in a murder-for-hire plot against a Sikh activist on US soil, as well as Modi’s embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, have both been an irritant for the US.“The relationship between the United States and India goes beyond individuals, and even beyond parties,” said Sushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University. “All administrations, starting from President Bill Clinton, have advocated closer ties with India and that is not going to change, especially when the China factor looms large in both national capitals.”Still, in Tamil Nadu — the home state of Harris’ Indian family — pride in the prospect of an Indian-American in the White House runs high. B Krishna Moorthy, who runs the Commissionerate of Rehabilitation and Welfare of Non Resident Tamils, said the group was “deeply moved and filled with pride” at the prospect of a Harris presidency.“We look forward to seeing how her experiences and perspectives will contribute positively to global discourse, inspire future generations and foster the Indo-US relationship.”",Kamala Harris is a step closer to capturing the Democratic nomination for president. But few are expecting any change in ties should she win. The economic and strategic logic that underpins US-India ties would likely remain intact.

Praise for autocrats

Tough stance on 'illegal' immigration

Donald Trump held a campaign rally on Sunday, his first since narrowly escaping an assassination attempt last week. He mocked Democrats and compared former Democratic house speaker Nancy Pelosi to a ""dog,"" while also attacking President Joe Biden and repeating false claims about various issues.Here are five key takeaways from his speech in rally:The recently held Republican National Convention saw Trump downplaying false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.However, during his return to the campaign trail on Sunday night, Trump did not hold back.""The Radical Left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024,"" he declared, making another reference to voter fraud .""We want a landslide that is too big to rig,"" he added later.Trump urged early voters to ""follow your vote"" and claimed that in 2020, some states were ""shoveling ballots into wheelbarrows, moving them around.""The crowd cheered as he called on them to ""Fight, fight, fight.""Trump reiterated his disapproval of Project 2025 , a manifesto opponents describe as an authoritarian, right-wing agenda.""The other side is going around trying to make me sound extreme ... I'm not an extremist at all,"" he complained.He described the Heritage Foundation 's blueprint to reshape the federal government as the work of ""the radical right... they're seriously extreme,"" claiming, ""I don't know what the hell it is.""Trump said that the notion of him being a ""threat to democracy"" is ""misinformation.""""Last week, I took a bullet for democracy,"" he said.Trump criticized Biden's candidacy, highlighting concerns within the Democratic Party about Biden's age, as some believe that at 81, he is too old to serve another term.""They have no idea who their candidate is ... Sort of interesting, this guy goes and he gets the votes and now they want to take it away.

Obama had a part because he said he wasn’t going to support him,” Trump was quoted as telling.“Nancy Pelosi dumped him. They all dumped him, and they said, 'Either you get out nice or we’re going to go after you.’ And that’s what happened. And he had no choice. There’s no question about it,” the GOP nominee added.“They told him to get out, ‘You’re not going to win,” Trump said.“The debate was really Biden’s ending. He was not good at the debate. And I think I was good. Some people say I was very good, but whether I was or not, he was not good. And I think that was the end of Biden, frankly"".If Biden was disrespectfully forced to step down by his party still may be a rumor, but what is certain is Biden was under growing pressure since the lackluster debate with GOP nominee and former President Trump. And since then the president had to contend with a democratic party, donors, and critics urging him to step down, some publicly and some privately.Even democratic bigwigs like Barrack Obama and former house speaker Nancy Pelosi are reported to have conveyed their their disbelief about the 81 year old's chances to defeat Trump in private conversation, while other senior democratic lawmakers and big time donors like Hollywood star George Clooney publicly urged Biden to step aside and make way a new democratic candidate. However, with 106 days to go for the November elections and in isolation due to Covid 19, Joe Biden finally took the call to step down from the race and endorse his vice president Kamala Harris.Since taking the call to drop out, the president was briefly missing from public eye fueling speculations about a ""terminal illness,"" ""imminent death"" and a ""White House coup"" with #WhereisJoe"" trending virally. However, Joe Biden on Tuesday made his first appearance after taking the call to step aside and make way for a new democratic presidential nominee. The president who was on a brief isolation due to Covid 19 returned to the White House declaring himself well and fine after testing negative for the virus.In what seemed like a clear effort to clear the air and to keep the morale of the democratic party alive, president Biden as soon as he returned to the White House on Tuesday took to X with a picture and said, ""It's great to be back at the White House.""","Former US President and GOP nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed that it was clear that most democratic party heavyweights turned against and ""dumped"" the US President Joe Biden.

US election 2024: Kamala Harris holds narrow lead over Donald Trump in post-Biden polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-2024-kamala-harris-holds-narrow-lead-over-donald-trump-in-post-biden-polls/articleshow/111974123.cms,"Democratic frontrunner Kamala Harris has emerged with a slim lead over former President Donald Trump in a national poll released on Tuesday, in a surprising twist following Joe Biden 's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race.The Reuters/Ipsos poll shows 59-year-old Harris, leading 78-year-old Trump, by two percentage points — 44 per cent to 42 per cent.This poll, conducted in the two days after Biden’s announcement on Sunday that he was ending his reelection campaign and endorsing Harris, marks one of the first major surveys since the shake-up.Prior to Biden’s exit, the same poll had shown Harris and Trump tied at 44 per cent. Harris's new position as the US Presidential candidate , buoyed by a wave of endorsements, donations, and pledged delegates, reflects a significant shift in the race.However, the results are close, with both polls falling within their respective margins of error. In another poll released Tuesday by PBS News/NPR/Marist, Trump narrowly leads Harris 46 per cent to 45 per cent among registered voters, with nine percent undecided. When factoring in third-party candidates or independents, Trump and Harris are tied at 42 per cent.This development follows the Republican National Convention where Trump accepted the party’s nomination and Biden’s unexpected withdrawal. Despite the bounce typically received by nominees following such conventions, Harris's performance suggests she has effectively countered this effect.Additionally, 87 per cent of Americans believe Biden’s decision to withdraw was the right move, according to the PBS News survey. The decision appears to resonate across party lines, with 41 per cent of respondents feeling it enhances Democrats' chances in November, while 24 per cent believe it decreases the party’s odds, and 34 per cent see no impact.Trump’s polling advantage remains slim, with RealClearPolitics showing a 1.6 percentage point lead over Harris on average.

Kamala vs Donald pits Hollywood hawties against Silicon Valley bros?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-vs-donald-pits-hollywood-hawties-against-silicon-valley-bros/articleshow/111973763.cms,"WASHINGTON: Deep-pocketed Democratic donors , many from Hollywood , have lifted their “Dembargo” after Prez Biden made way for a Kamala Harris nomination, resulting in a $100-million-plus political donation bonanza on Monday, said to be the largest one-day haul in US presidential election history.There is a quiet, hidden reason for the surge of support for Kamala from the entertainment world — she is a Hollywood insider, partly on account of her husband Doug Emhoff, formerly an entertainment industry attorney who has represented many Hollywood clients.Although she grew up in one of the less privileged sections of Oakland, near San Francisco, the couple now own a$5 million home in a secluded corner of Brentwood, near Los Angeles, putting her closer to Hollywood than to her former digs near Silicon Valley . Their neighbours include Gwyneth Paltrow, LeBron James, Gisele Bundchen and Dr Dre.Indeed, Hollywood elites, many of whom sat on the sidelines despairing about an aging Biden candidacy, are now scrambling back to support Kamala. George Clooney, whose NYT OpEd last week urging Biden to bow out rattled Democrats and gave voice to a Hollywood hol dout, welcomed the handover: “We’re all so excited to do whatever we can to support vice-prez Harris in her historic quest.”Hollywood honchos are also chuffed about the prospect of the first prez from California — and Los Angeles — since Ronald Reagan in 1980. “Literally overnight, big-dollar Hollywood Democratic donors who’d been nervously sitting on their cheque books since Joe Biden ’s June 27 debate debacle have been lining up to shower millions on the hometown girl,” the Hollywood Reporter said Monday.The song and dance over Kamala’s elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket was heard when she walked in to the campaign headquarters on Monday to Beyonce’s song “Freedom”. Among others, celebrities from rapper Cardi B to Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis to TV producer Shonda Rhimes to director Spike Lee and singer Barbara Streisand endorsed Kamala as the new Democratic nominee for the White House.The Hollywood hooting for Kamala comes even as her opponent, Donald Trump, has made new inroads into Silicon Valley, formerly a Democratic stronghold like the rest of the state, and represented by Indian-American Congressmen Ro Khanna. Riding on the disillusionment of Tesla’s Elon Musk with the “wokism” of the left, and support from his mentor Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and founder of PayPal, Trump has been tapping into “tech bros” who are looking in to less govt regulation, including in new areas like AI. Musk himself is said to have pledged $45 million a month to the Trump campaign — something which the former prez boasted about at a rally in Michigan.But Hollywood honchos are said to be ready to counter any Silicon Valley sell-out to Trump, although Democrats still have majority support in the area. “There’s a shitload of money here in Hollywood, as well as a lot of disdain for these tech bros, and I think you’ll see people putting up a lot of dough just to teach these dudes they can’t buy an election,” a Democratic consultant was quoted telling the Hollywood Reporter.","Deep-pocketed Democratic donors lifted their ‘Dembargo’ after Prez Biden made way for a Kamala Harris nomination.

#WhereisJoe trends: Trump’s MAGA fanatics spread ‘death’ & ‘White House coup’ rumours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whereisjoe-trends-trumps-maga-fanatics-spread-death-white-house-coup-rumours/articleshow/111973557.cms,":

WASHINGTONVicious rumours about Prez Biden’s “terminal illness” “imminent death” and a “White House coup” and racist dogwhistles surrounding Kamala Harris’ life and career flowed through the sewers of social media on Tuesday as MAGA maniacs went into full meltdown mode following an unexpectedly smooth transition in the Democratic Party.With hashtags such as #whereisjoe and #dumbasarock, Trump supporters rained abuse on his opponents, going so far as as to claim Democratic backroom operatives had orchestrated a “palace coup” by blackmailing Biden into bowing out of the prez race.Laura Loomer, one such supporter patronised and praised by Trump, claimed Biden is “terminally ill and unable to perform his duties” and “final preparations are being made for him, and “soon we will have President @KamalaHarris as the 47th President”. Conspiracy theorists also scrutinised Biden’s Sunday letter announcing the end of his candidacy. Several fixated on Biden’s autograph, which clearly bears the name “J.R. Biden” but also con tains an underline not seen in other signatures from the prez. Commentators also noted the lack of a White House seal or letterhead, even though it wasn’t a govt communication.Such insights were apparently based on Biden not being seen in public for five days (he had been at his beach home recovering from Covid). But in a statement, Biden said he would address the nation from the Oval Office at 8 pm Wednesday, “on what lies ahead, and how I will finish the job for the American people”.Previously, MA GA fanatics have prematurely killed off ex-prez Jimmy Carter, who is 99 and in hospice care. A fake letter announcing his death made its way swiftly through MAGA circles on social media before it was debunked.Toxic MAGA trolls also continued to attack Harris with fake narratives on X, including posting digitally altered photos showing sex predator Jeffery Epstein’s face super-imposed on the face of her husband Douglas Emhoff. Some of the rage is tacitly encouraged by Trump himself with his vitriolic and sexist attacks on Harris.Trump’s running mate JD Vance has also taken the cue: “If Biden can’t run for prez, he can’t serve as prez.” In the MAGA narrative, Democratic operatives will invoke Article 25 to replace Biden with Harris in a “soft coup” to make her the 47th prez even before the elections. The meltdown is quite inexplicable considering most polls show Trump leading. Evidently, the prospect of Trump being challenged by a liberal woman, and a brown one at that, has brought out the worst in them."," MAGA maniacs went into full meltdown mode following an unexpectedly smooth transition in the Democratic Party.

"'Blast of rock, water and steam': Hydrothermal explosion rocks Yellowstone National Park, sends dozens running for safety",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/yellowstone-national-park-hydrothermal-explosion-sends-dozens-running-for-safety/articleshow/111973361.cms,"Yellowstone National Park experienced a dramatic hydrothermal explosion on Tuesday morning, startling visitors and causing a significant safety incident. The eruption occurred around 10 am in Biscuit Basin , a popular area known for its hot springs, located just a few miles north of the iconic Old Faithful Geyser.Witnesses captured the event on video, showing a violent eruption that propelled steam, water, and dark-colored debris high into the sky.The eruption caused chaos among the onlookers, many of whom were seen scrambling to safety, shouting warnings such as ""Back up!"" and ""Holy cow!"" as they fled the scene. The area was quickly enveloped in a thick cloud of steam and debris.Despite the dramatic visuals, no injuries were reported. However, the explosion resulted in significant damage to the boardwalk in Biscuit Basin, a wooden walkway designed to protect visitors from Yellowstone's volatile geothermal features . Photos from the aftermath showed damaged guardrails and boards covered in silt and rocks, with debris scattered near muddy pools.The cause of the explosion is believed to be a blockage in the natural geothermal plumbing beneath Yellowstone's thermal features. Mike Poland, a scientist with the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, explained that the explosion likely resulted from a buildup of heat and pressure, similar to a pressure cooker, which eventually caused the water to flash into steam and trigger the eruption. Poland estimated that the explosion sent material about 100 feet (30 meters) into the air, reported AP.Poland characterized the explosion as ""on the big side"" compared to typical hydrothermal eruptions, which often occur without causing harm due to their remote locations. The largest known hydrothermal explosion crater, located in Yellowstone, measures 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) across and was formed approximately 13,800 years ago.The site of Tuesday's explosion was Black Diamond Pool, a 120-foot-long (37-meter) hot pool known for its wide thermal features. An aerial photo taken after the eruption showed the pool slightly enlarged and its water turned a muddy beige, in contrast to the deep blue hue of the nearby Sapphire Pool, which remained unchanged.Park geologists are currently investigating the specifics of the explosion. Previous similar events have occurred in Biscuit Basin in 2009, 1991, and following the magnitude 7.2 Hebgen Lake earthquake in 1959.The eruption did not signify any new volcanic activity , as Yellowstone's volcanic system remains at normal levels, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Nonetheless, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the inherent dangers associated with Yellowstone's geothermal features, which have historically led to at least 22 fatalities due to thermal-related injuries since 1890.Visitors are continually advised to adhere to safety guidelines, including staying on designated boardwalks and trails, to avoid the thin, brittle crust covering the scalding and sometimes acidic waters of the park's thermal features.","The eruption occurred around 10 am in Biscuit Basin, a popular area known for its hot springs.

The ADL also wants training for faculty, staff and students and the removal of antisemitic posters, flags and other material on school property.A school district spokesperson declined to comment on an active investigation.Colleges, universities and high schools nationwide have seen a wave of pro-Palestinian student protests in response to Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, taking hostages and killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The toll in Gaza recently surpassed 39,000 Palestinians killed, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.Most of the focus has been on protests that rocked college campuses this spring, leading to thousands of arrests. But a recent congressional hearing spotlighted antisemitism in K-12 education, with the leaders of New York City Public Schools, the Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland, and the Berkeley Unified School District in California all vigorously denying they had failed to address hostility toward Jewish people.Like Philadelphia, New York City and Montgomery County are facing Education Department civil rights investigations into allegations of antisemitism. The ADL filed a complaint against Berkeley in California state court.In Philadelphia, schools leaders allowed hostility toward Jewish students to spread and intensify over the past nine months, and “failed to address a rampant culture of retaliation and fear"" that prevented Jewish students and parents from even coming forward, James Pasch, ADL’s senior director of national litigation, said in an interview Tuesday.“There's an environment here that really needs to change, and it really needs to change now,” he said.In May, a group called the School District of Philadelphia Jewish Family Association made similar allegations in a complaint to the education department under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on shared ancestry.After that complaint was filed, a group of pro-Palestinian teachers called Philly Educators for Palestine said that while any incidents of discrimination should be addressed, it's not antisemitic to criticize Israel or advocate for Palestinians. The group said the complaint was an attempt to silence teachers and students and a distraction from “the carnage being inflicted upon Palestinians in Gaza by Israel.”A message was sent to Philly Educators for Palestine seeking comment on the latest allegations via an allied group, the Racial Justice Organizing Committee.","The district has ignored persistent harassment and bullying of Jewish students, lawyers say.

WASHINGTON: New body camera footage released by police in Illinois shows officers shooting dead an unarmed Black woman in her home after she called for help over a possible intruder.In the United States, where police shootings of minorities have become painfully common and polarizing events, the killing has attracted national attention, with President Joe Biden saying Sonya Massey ""should be alive today.""At a news conference Tuesday, high-profile civil rights attorney Ben Crump called the shooting, in which one officer has been charged with murder, ""senseless,"" adding that the family has alleged police initially tried to downplay their responsibility.Massey, 36, called 911 to report a possible intruder at her home and police arrived after midnight July 6, according to the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office.In video footage released Monday, Massey is seen talking to two officers in her home, while they ask for ID and she searches through paperwork.The sheriff's deputies then ask her to check on a pot of boiling water on her stove, saying ""we don't need a fire while we're here.""When one of the deputies steps back, Massey asks why, and he responds with a laugh: ""away from your hot steaming water.""Holding the pot, Massey calmly responds ""Oh, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus"" -- prompting a deputy to respond ""You better fucking not. I swear to God I'll fucking shoot you at your fucking face,"" drawing his weapon.Apologizing, Massey crouches behind a counter as officers scream ""drop the fucking pot."" They then round the corner of the counter and open fire.Afterward, one of the officers said they were afraid of ""taking fucking boiling water to the fucking head.""Officer Sean Grayson, who is white, has been fired and charged with murder, with Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell issuing a statement to denounce his ""unjustifiable and reckless decision.""Biden on Monday called Massey ""a beloved mother, friend, daughter, and young Black woman,"" while Crump said that Vice President Kamala Harris was set to speak with Massey's family.""Equal justice is paramount,"" Crump told the news conference Tuesday, saying that state authorities had promised a ""fair and transparent investigation.""But Crump said those promises come after the family alleged police originally tried to downplay their involvement in the shooting.Police told family who arrived on the scene that ""we know she was having problems with her neighbor, as to suggest that the neighbor might have done it,"" Crump said.Police shootings and brutality -- especially instances of white on Black violence in a country with a long history of discrimination -- often attract outrage and protests in the United States, as well as defenses and pushback from ardent police supporters.America's decentralized policing system, where individual towns and counties are responsible for their own policing, means there are no national training requirements, which also makes reform extremely difficult.Adding to complications, the United States is home to more guns than people, meaning police often train for violent encounters with the general public.","Sonya Massey, 36, called 911 to report a possible intruder at her home.

Hundreds of PTI workers and senior leaders were arrested for their involvement in the violence and attacks on military installations, including the Jinnah House, ISI building in Faisalabad, and General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi.Maryam also accused the PTI of conspiring to default the country, writing letters to the International Monetary Fund, waving cipher messages, and disrespecting memorials as part of a larger plot. She called for strict action against the PTI under the Constitution and law, citing national security and interests.The chief minister further criticized the PTI for alienating friendly countries, making baseless accusations against the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and disrupting Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit in 2014 by staging a sit-in. She recounted PTI's previous attacks on Parliament, PTV, and the Prime Minister's house, and accused them of violence against police officers and desecrating the Supreme Court's walls.In March, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Ataullah Tarar said that a handful of ""miscreants"" associated with the PTI were bent upon sabotaging Pakistan's deal with the IMF, which he said was crucial for economic stability.He said that at the protest, activists belonging to PTI were urging the IMF to give funds to Pakistan only if their jailed leader was released, regretting that activists of an ""anti-national"" party continued to hold sit-ins and protests outside the IMF offices.

"Anti-terrorism efforts being made controversial by illegal, political mafias, says Pak army",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terrorism-efforts-being-made-controversial-by-illegal-political-mafias-says-pak-army/articleshow/111937180.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan armyaccused its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts , including a new military operation, to the detriment of the country’s national interests following the arrest on Monday of Raoof Hasan, information secretary of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), headed by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan. The army said the party information secretary was in charge of PTI ’s digital media cell which, it alleged, was involved in running anti-state propaganda.Last month PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved a military offensive to counter aspikein terrorist attacks across Pakistan, particularly in volatile northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, but the idea was widely criticised by opposition parties, particularly PTI and the rights group Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). They termed it a ploy against Pashtuns to earn dollars from major powers and exploit their resources.Addressing a presser in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, asked, “Why did a mafia, a political mafia , and an illegal mafia say that they would not let this campaign (OperationAzm-e-Istehkam, or Resolve for Stability) happen?” He added that opponents of the offensive had tried to make it “controversial” and paint it as a purely military operation in which thousands of people would be displaced.He did not name any party or group butcalled the army’s critics “politicalandillegal mafias”,an apparent reference to PTI and PTM.Lt Gen Chaudhry said they were using “fake news and propaganda” to spread lies about the army and its intentions.“This is digital terrorism,” he said. “The physical terrorist also attacks law enforcement agencies and the army, and the digital terrorist also attacks the army. They are doing the same thing.”“Digital terrorists”, the spokesman said, would be deterred through laws, regulation and monitoring.He, however, questioned the lack of action against such individuals despite their activities against the leadership of the state and other institutions. “Instead of the courts and regulations moving forward against them, they’re given further space and they’re made heroes in the name of freedom of expression,” he said.Ahead of Sharif’s press conference, security forces had raided PTI’s offices and arrested Raoof Hasan from the party’s central secretariat. The raid came a week after the govt had said it planned to ban the party.“The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,” Islamabad police said, adding that those directly involved in anti-national propaganda were arrested and all evidence from PTI’s digital media cell wasconfiscated.The party issued a statement on X, saying: “It’s absolutely shameful how Islamabad police continues to completely mock and disregard every law in this country. Law of the jungle is reigning over Pakistan!”The crackdown on PTI follows several court rulings in its favour this month that threaten PM Sharif’s govt, which came to power in Feb this year with the military’s backing.","Pakistan army accuses its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts.

The Pakistan army on Monday accused an "" illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation, codenamed "" Azm-i-Istehkam "" (Resolve for Stability), against rising terrorism in the country.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif, in a press conference in Rawalpindi, stated that a ""massive, illegal political mafia"" has risen to undermine the operation due to ""vested interests"".Sharif clarified that Azm-i-Istehkam is not just a military operation but a comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign launched through national consensus to reinvigorate the already in-place National Action Plan (NAP).He stressed that the purpose of the operation is to eliminate terrorism, which will eventually lead to ""societal and national uplift"".However, the DG ISPR accused a ""very strong lobby"" of having a vested interest in sabotaging the operation, as it does not want the NAP to succeed.He alleged that this entity is receiving a lot of money to subvert the operation.""The stakes in [sabotaging] this operation are very high, and it's not based on any ideology but involves a lot of money,"" he said.Lt Gen Sharif stated that the ""illegal political mafia"" made the first move to make the operations controversial through false and fake arguments.He pointed out that the problem lies in the implementation of the NAP's other points, such as the regularisation and registration of religious seminaries, where only a bit over 16,000 out of about 32,000 seminaries have been registered so far. He questioned whether the army should be responsible for these tasks.The DG ISPR also mentioned the issue of the ""illegal spectrum"", which hides a major illegal economy through which the criminal system and terrorism operate. He said the requirement of the illegal spectrum is a ""soft state"" and the solution to it is the National Action Plan.While the DG ISPR's statements highlight the challenges faced by the government in implementing its counter-terrorism strategy, it is essential to note that the army's involvement in political matters can be a sensitive issue.The military has historically played a significant role in the country's politics, and its direct intervention in political affairs has often been a subject of controversy.It remains to be seen whether the army will take a more active role in the country's affairs in response to the alleged sabotage of the counter-terrorism campaign by the ""illegal political mafia"".","Pakistan army accuses an ""illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation.

Hard to implement IMF deal as political pressure surges in Pakistan: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/hard-to-implement-imf-deal-as-political-pressure-surges-in-pakistan-experts/articleshow/111900333.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The current fiscal year's tax-laden budget and the Supreme Court's ruling on reserved seats have shifted the focus of politics to the economy , further posing doubts over Pakistan 's ability to meet the new International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions for a $7 billion loan, reported Dawn.A senior researcher said, ""This is crucial to determining if the government can meet the conditions for a USD 7 billion IMF loan agreement.Nonetheless, I am confident the government will sign the deal at any cost.""According to the analysts, the government is seeking China's help to restructure its substantial $28 billion debt.However, sources have suggested that China is unlikely to restructure these loans, fearing that other nations, like Sri Lanka, may also seek debt restructuring from Beijing.Bankers and analysts agreed that the country has been facing significant challenges, with political pressure mounting to provide relief to the public, Dawn reported.""The government has failed to offer any relief, instead exacerbating the situation by repeatedly increasing fuel and electricity prices,"" a senior banker said, noting that only banks and the equity market are enjoying the ""worst economy,"" recording historic profits.On the contrary, sectors like textiles are calling for tax reductions and price controls. Exporters are also dissatisfied with the new taxes on their income.The annual inflation rate for FY24 stood at 23.4%, leaving the real interest rate negative by three per cent.""How can we expect any big cut in the interest rate in the future to stimulate the economy?"" the banker questioned.The sources said that the IMF has asked the State Bank to maintain fiscal discipline, implying no substantial relief in interest rates soon.The high cost of doing business has already led to economic contraction in FY23, with a mere 2.4 per cent growth in FY24.""If the political situation remains unstable, significant growth in FY25 is unlikely, which will increase unemployment and deepen political uncertainties,"" noted an analyst. The IMF projects 3.5% growth for FY25, while Fitch Ratings estimates 3.2%.Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, showed optimism and said that the IMF deal will unlock additional funding sources, stabilise the rupee and bolster foreign exchange reserves.However, he expressed concerns about the political and social challenges in the country, which could complicate the successful implementation of IMF conditions, as reported by Dawn.""Moody's points out that Pakistan has historically struggled with implementing the structural reforms required by IMF programmes, which casts doubt on the current deal's effectiveness,"" he said.Despite campaigns for deals with Saudi Arabia, UAE and China, no substantial progress has been made, nor has privatisation of any government entity gone through, Mamsa said, adding that the anti-poor budget may not be sustainable in the long term.","The current fiscal year's tax-laden budget and the Supreme Court's ruling on reserved seats have shifted the focus of politics to the economy.
