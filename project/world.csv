"First pagers, now walkie-talkies: Lebanon on edge after new wave of explosions kill 20",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-hezbollah-war-mossad-pager-explosions-walkie-talkies-explosions/articleshow/113474697.cms,"Driving the news

Lebanon has been rocked by a series of devastating explosions over the past two days, leaving at least 26 people dead and thousands more injured.

The two main devices responsible for the carnage — pagers and walkie-talkies—were in widespread use by Hezbollah operatives.

These seemingly mundane objects detonated across the country in a coordinated wave of attacks, with security experts pointing fingers at Israel.

As per a report in Aljazeera, exploding devices include portable two-way radios, laptops, and even certain solar power setups. ""There are reports of several different devices blowing up.""

A number of vehicles have also reportedly burst into flames. However, it remains uncertain whether these explosions originated from the cars themselves or from objects within the vehicles.

The explosions have not only claimed lives but also unleashed panic and chaos as people fear more devices could still be rigged to explode.

Thousands of Lebanese residents have been directly affected by the blasts, which have targeted Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut and southern Lebanon.

At the same time, explosions have hit civilian areas, including shops, homes, and even hospitals. This attack represents the largest security breach in Hezbollah’s history, marking a new phase of violence between Hezbollah and Israel, who have been engaged in escalating hostilities for years.

Why it matters

The scale and sophistication of these attacks have exposed Hezbollah’s vulnerabilities in a way that few anticipated. With Israel being blamed for the operation, the explosions have dramatically heightened tensions in a region already on edge due to ongoing conflicts between Israel, Hamas , and Iran-backed Hezbollah. The attacks have struck fear into Lebanese civilians, many of whom are now terrified that everyday devices could explode at any moment.

, and Iran-backed Hezbollah. The attacks have struck fear into Lebanese civilians, many of whom are now terrified that everyday devices could explode at any moment. As per a news report from Reuters, Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad , was behind serial explosions in pagers.

, was behind serial explosions in pagers. The orchestration of the pager bombings seemed to be an intricate undertaking that required several months of preparation. Numerous specialists suspect that Mossad tampered with the supply chain, planting explosives in hundreds of pagers prior to their importation into Lebanon. However, concrete evidence supporting this theory remains scarce at present.

Gold Apollo , a company based in Taiwan, said that it granted permission to BAC Consulting KFT, a firm located in Hungary, to utilize its name on the pagers shipped to Hezbollah. However, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, announced on Wednesday that the pagers delivered to Hezbollah never entered Hungary and that BAC Consultants simply served as a mediator in the transaction.

However, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, announced on Wednesday that the pagers delivered to Hezbollah never entered Hungary and that BAC Consultants simply served as a mediator in the transaction. Kovács further disclosed on X that Hungary's national security services were actively collaborating with international partners in the investigation.

The chaos unleashed by these attacks threatens to destabilize Lebanon further, a country already grappling with economic collapse, political turmoil, and the lingering aftermath of the 2020 Beirut port explosion.

The big picture

The attacks began when thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah exploded almost simultaneously across Lebanon and parts of Syria, killing 12 people and injuring nearly 3,000.

The next day, a second wave of explosions from walkie-talkies and solar panels caused more devastation, killing 14 more and wounding hundreds. Lebanese media have reported that some of the dead include children and civilians who were nowhere near Hezbollah operations at the time of the explosions.

Hezbollah officials have publicly condemned Israel, accusing it of committing “mass murder.” Iran, Hezbollah’s chief backer, has also blamed Israel and vowed retribution. Meanwhile, Israel has remained tight-lipped but has declared the start of a ""new phase"" in its ongoing war with Hezbollah, raising fears of a broader conflict involving Iran and its allies.

In a Daily Mail report, journalist Hassan Harfoush shared chilling firsthand accounts of the devastation. ""The scenes here in Lebanon are from a horror film—fleshless faces, eyes hanging out. With dozens dead and thousands hurt, none of us feel safe,"" he wrote.

""Beirut has collapsed into panic. The WhatsApp groups are going non-stop. There are wild rumours doing the rounds that solar panels might explode, batteries, fridges – anything. There's fake news saying phones have exploded. I know it's stupid but I even told my parents to get a fire extinguisher, just in case ­something blows up in the house,"" Harfoush wrote in the Daily Mail, echoing the fear that has swept the country.

What they are saying

Lebanese residents, gripped by panic, have taken drastic steps to protect themselves. Some have begun tearing the batteries out of their walkie-talkies and throwing them into the streets, terrified that the devices could explode at any moment. In some areas, residents have turned off Wi-Fi routers and unplugged home appliances out of fear they could also be rigged to detonate.

At Beirut hospitals, doctors are struggling to keep up with the flood of patients. ""We are seeing horrific injuries,"" said Dr Elias Warrak, an ophthalmologist at Mount Lebanon University Hospital. ""In the last 24 hours, we’ve had more than 60 to 70 percent of patients needing at least one eye removed."" Many of the injuries involve gruesome shrapnel wounds to the face, hands, and eyes, leaving many permanently disfigured.

At a funeral for victims of the first wave of explosions, panic struck again when walkie-talkies detonated during the ceremony. Attendees fled in terror as ambulances rushed to the scene. ""The Hezbollah officials present behaved as if nothing had happened, but all of us felt it, heard it,"" Harfoush recalled. This latest wave of violence has shattered any remaining sense of security in Beirut and beyond.

Zoom in

The Lebanese armed forces have been called in to conduct controlled explosions of any suspicious devices. In one instance, soldiers detonated a bag of rice at the American University of Beirut Medical Centre, fearing it had been rigged with explosives. The Lebanese army is also working to neutralize compromised solar panels and radios, but the sheer number of devices in circulation makes the task daunting.

Images of exploded walkie-talkies and pagers show them labeled with “ICOM” and “Made in Japan.” While the devices appear to be from the Japanese electronics firm ICOM, the company has denied any involvement, saying that the specific models used in the attacks were discontinued in 2014. Taiwanese firm Gold Apollo has also distanced itself, saying that its pagers had been licensed to a Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, which acted as an intermediary.

Between the lines

Experts believe the devices were likely tampered with before they were delivered to Hezbollah, indicating a long-term infiltration of the group’s supply chain. Some security sources have suggested that small explosives were hidden inside the devices and remotely triggered, possibly through radio frequencies. This level of sophistication suggests the involvement of a state actor, with Israel’s Mossad being the most likely culprit.

The psychological impact of the explosions has been devastating. ""People used to think that if they were affiliated with Hezbollah but not fighters, they were safe. But this changes everything,"" said a Hezbollah source. Civilians who once believed they were outside the conflict’s direct line of fire are now terrified that their homes, shops, or workplaces could become the next target.

What’s next

The situation remains highly volatile, with Hezbollah vowing to retaliate. Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is expected to make a public address, possibly outlining the group’s plans for retaliation.

Meanwhile, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant has warned that Israel is just beginning its ""new phase"" of war, which could see more aggressive military actions in the coming days.

There is a growing fear that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into a full-scale regional war, drawing in other countries such as Iran and Syria. Meanwhile, residents in Lebanon are left wondering whether any electronic device could be the next to explode.

Lebanon is reeling from a second wave of deadly explosions targeting electronic devices used by Hezbollah , just a day after hundreds of the militant group's pagers detonated simultaneously. The latest attacks, which are widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, have heightened fears of an all-out war between the two sides. The explosions have also raised concerns about the extent of potentially compromised devices, especially given the high number of civilian casualties.(With inputs from agencies)","Lebanon has been rocked by a series of devastating explosions over the past two days, leaving at least 26 people dead and thousands more injured.

Trans model Kesaria Abramidze killed in Tbilisi after Georgia passes law imposing LGBTQ+ restrictions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/trans-model-killed-in-tbilisi-after-georgia-passes-law-imposing-lgbtq-restrictions/articleshow/113522846.cms,"Kesaria Abramidze , a prominent Georgian transgender model , was found murdered in her Tbilisi apartment on Wednesday, a day after the Georgian government passed a new law imposing strict limits on LGBTQ+ rights. The 37-year-old was believed to have been stabbed to death, and a man has been arrested in connection with the crime, as reported by Georgian media.Abramidze, 37, was one of Georgia 's first openly transgender public figures.The law includes bans on same-sex marriages and gender-affirming treatments, and it allows officials to ban Pride events and censor films and books.The new legislation, which passed its third and final reading in parliament on Tuesday, has been controversial. Critics say it mirrors anti-LGBTQ+ measures in Russia. Civil society groups in Georgia have linked Abramidze's death to a broader state campaign against minorities.""There is a direct correlation between the use of hate speech in politics and hate crimes,"" the Social Justice Center , a Tbilisi-based human rights group, said. The group added, ""It has been almost a year that the Georgian Dream government has been aggressively using homo/bi/transphobic language and cultivating it with mass propaganda means.""Under the Georgian Dream party, which has become more anti-liberal, violence against LGBTQ+ people has increased. Last year, opponents of gay rights disrupted an LGBTQ+ festival in Tbilisi, forcing it to be canceled. This year, a large march promoting ""traditional family values"" took place, attended by the ruling party and the Orthodox church. European Union officials and other critics have warned that the new law could harm Georgia's EU membership aspirations. Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, urged the Georgian government to withdraw the law. ""It would increase discrimination & stigmatisation,"" he said.Michael Roth, chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee in Germany, said, ""Those who sow hatred will reap violence. Kesaria Abramidze was killed just one day after the Georgian parliament passed the anti-LGBTI law.""The law's passage is seen by some as a potential shift in Georgia's stance toward Russia, especially with parliamentary elections coming up in five weeks.

Although the bench rejected the request to completely halt the legal proceedings, it granted relief by restraining the accountability court from issuing a final verdict.Khan and Bibi's lawyers argued that recent amendments in anti-corruption laws make the charges against the former prime minister and his wife invalid. They contended that the approval of the federal cabinet was involved in the matter, and the revised laws make it clear that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cannot investigate decisions made by the cabinet.""The case does not stand after the new amendments, and we seek acquittal for our clients,"" argued the defense.The court has issued notices to the involved parties, and the trial remains ongoing.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.

The posts were aimed at inciting people against two major state institutions, an action he described as highly condemnable.Imran's social media team had posted a video on his X account comparing past and present military leaderships, along with a statement urging people to review a judicial commission report on Pakistan's breakup.“Every Pakistani should study the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and get to know who was the true traitor, General Yahya Khan or Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” said a quote attributed to Imran.The posts also featured images of the current civilian and military leaders, alleging that they had stolen the mandate of Imran’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the February general elections.","Imran Khan has been booked for inciting government officer to mutiny, and committing'sedition,' through his social media posts.

"Imran Khan blames military for CM disappearance, says Pakistan scene is ‘Yahya Khan Part II’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khan-blames-military-for-cm-disappearance-says-pakistan-scene-is-yahya-khan-part-ii/articleshow/113334502.cms,"ReplyReply allForward



ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.

In some cases, their houses and families have been targeted.This is the first instance in Pakistan of uniformed personnel on a sit-in and blocking an inter-provincial highway for four consecutive days.

Bangladesh reverses ban on export of Hilsa fish to India ahead of Durga Puja,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-reverses-ban-on-export-of-hilsa-fish-to-india-ahead-of-durga-puja/articleshow/113556320.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bangladesh 's interim government on Saturday withdrew its ban on the export of Hilsa fish to India and announced that it will export 3,000 tonnes of Hilsa during the upcoming Durga Puja festival, which will take place from October 9 to 13.The Muhammad Yunus-led interim government earlier this month imposed a ban on hilsa exports to India to ensure sufficient domestic supply.""Against the backdrop of appeals by the exporters, approval has been given to export 3,000 tonnes of hilsa fish (to India), fulfilling the specific conditions on the occasion of the upcoming Durga Puja,"" the Bangladeshi commerce ministry said in a statement.In 2023, Bangladesh granted permission to 79 companies to export a total of 4,000 tonnes of hilsa fish to India, aligning with the Durga Puja festival, according to official sources.Earlier this month, India's Fish Importers Association reached out to Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Touhid Hossain, urging him to permit the export of hilsa to India during Durga Puja. This request came amidst uncertainty surrounding the shipments of the fish this year, following recent unrest and a change in government in Bangladesh.In a letter dated September 9, the Association's secretary, Syed Anwar Maqsood, highlighted that although Bangladesh implemented a ban onhilsa export in 2012, the country has been allowing limited exports from the first week of September until the end of the Durga Puja festival for the past five years as a gesture of goodwill.As the leading global producer of hilsa, Bangladesh typically imposes restrictions on the export of this fish to meet the high domestic demand. However, during the Durga Puja festivities, the country usually eases the export ban on hilsa.The practice of allowing hilsa exports to India between September and October each year, as a gesture of goodwill, had been a long-standing tradition under the previous Awami League government, led by the deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina.","Bangladesh will export 3,000 tonnes of Hilsa during the upcoming Durga Puja festival, which will take place from October 9 to 13.
