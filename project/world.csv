Listeria Outbreak In US: Almost 10 million pounds of meat recalled in US after listeria risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/almost-10-million-pounds-of-meat-recalled-in-us-after-listeria-risk/articleshow/114134261.cms,"Representative Image (Picture Credit: X)

BrucePac , a US based ready-to-eat meat and poultry items producer, has recalled 9.9 million pounds of food due to possible listeria contamination, the US Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday, as reported by CNN.The contamination was discovered by the USDA ’s Food Safety and Inspection Service during routine testing of finished poultry products.BrucePac’s ready-to-eat chicken was identified as the source of the listeria, potentially affecting other meat and poultry products produced between June 19 and October 8.Listeria bacteria can cause listeriosis (a type of food poisoning), which is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the US. Symptoms of listeriosis can include fever, muscle aches, and fatigue, and in more severe cases, it can cause a stiff neck, confusion, headaches, or seizures. People most vulnerable to severe illness are older adults, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems.So far, no confirmed cases of illness have been linked to the recalled products, but the USDA said that symptoms can take up to 10 weeks to appear, and some people may recover without ever being tested for listeria.The recalled products were distributed to restaurants and institutions all over the country and may have been used in ready-to-eat items which are currently ""on store shelves or in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers,"" according to the USDA.“Restaurants, institutions, and other establishments are urged not to serve or use these products. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase,” the USDA said. “Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.”This recall comes after a deadly listeria outbreak linked to Boar’s Head deli meats, which has resulted in 59 hospitalisations and 10 deaths since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began investigating in July, making it the largest listeria outbreak in over a decade.","BrucePac, a US based ready-to-eat meat and poultry items producer, has recalled 9.9 million pounds of food due to possible listeria contamination. contamination was discovered by the USDA ’s Food Safety and Inspection Service during routine testing of finished poultry products.

President Joe Biden on Thursday told Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to ""get a life"" after the latter accused him and vice president Kamala Harris of responding slowly and ineffectively to the hurricanes. Biden also said that the federal government is working swiftly to support those affected by Hurricane Milton Biden had accused Trump of spreading misinformation about the federal hurricane response during a press briefing on Wednesday.When asked if he had communicated with Trump after his statement at the White House, Biden responded, “Are you kidding me?” He then addressed Trump directly, saying, “Mr President Trump — former President Trump — get a life, man. Help these people.”The federal government is actively countering misinformation, which started circulating after Hurricane Helene last month and has continued with Hurricane Milton this week. When asked again if he intended to speak with Trump, Biden firmly said, “No.”The president praised Florida residents for adhering to evacuation orders, stating that their actions helped save lives. However, he noted it’s still too early to assess the full damage from Hurricane Milton. “It’s too early to know the full account of the damage,” Biden said. “But we know lifesaving measures did make a difference.”Biden warned that “very dangerous conditions” still exist in the state and urged residents to follow local authorities' directives. He assured that federal support will continue for as long as needed. “Vice President Harris and I have been in constant contact with state and local officials,” he said. “We’re offering everything they need.”Biden also stressed that the public would hold Trump accountable for making false claims about FEMA 's capacity to assist storm victims. He mentioned speaking with Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis, who confirmed their collaboration, saying, “I spoke with the president this morning…He said he wants to be helpful.”“Those who spread such lies are undermining confidence in the rescue and recovery efforts,” Biden said. “These lies are harmful to those who most need help. Lives are on the line, and people are in desperate situations — have the decency to tell them the truth.”Trump has heavily criticised Biden and Harris, calling their efforts “the worst response to a storm or hurricane disaster in US history.” At a campaign rally, Trump accused Harris of mismanaging the storm response in North Carolina and claimed that FEMA diverted funds to undocumented immigrants.Hurricane Milton left millions in Florida without power, while cleanup from Hurricane Helene continues across the Southeast.With less than four weeks until Election Day, Harris and Trump face a close race to succeed Biden, and disaster relief is a critical issue in key battleground states.","President Joe Biden told Donald Trump to ""get a life"" after the latter accused him and vice president Kamala Harris of responding slowly and ineffectively to the hurricanes.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump announced new tax break proposals during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club on Thursday. He proposed making interest on car loans tax-deductible and ending double taxation for Americans living abroad.Trump said that the car loan interest deduction could boost domestic auto production and make car ownership more affordable, especially in Michigan, a key swing state.“This will stimulate massive domestic auto production and make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families,” he said.Trump also shared plans to notify Mexico and Canada about renegotiating the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement upon taking office, aiming to shift manufacturing jobs back to the United States. He said, “You vote for Trump, and you will see a mass exodus of manufacturing jobs, but from Mexico to Michigan, from Shanghai to Sterling Heights.”The former president also committed to helping US citizens living abroad by pledging to end double taxation. He made this promise in a video statement shared by Solomon Yue, CEO of the group Republicans Overseas , on his account on X. “You have to make sure that you are registered and you are going to vote, because I'm going to take very good care of you,"" Trump said. ""Once and for all, I'm going to end double taxation on our overseas citizens. You've been wanting this for years, and nobody has listened to you. You deserve it, and I'm going to do it,"" he addedSolomon Yue praised Trump for his commitment, saying, ""Republicans Overseas has been fighting for the rights of Americans abroad since its inception ten years ago.” He added, ""We have spoken to many politicians over the years, and while they sympathized with the burden of double taxation, very few have been willing to act.”Currently, Americans residing in other countries often have to pay taxes both to the US government and the country where they live. Some bilateral agreements exist to reduce this tax burden.Critics question the effectiveness of the car loan interest deduction, as many Americans do not itemize deductions. Howard Gleckman from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center called it ""more campaign pandering.""Trump has also proposed tax breaks on tips, Social Security benefits, and overtime pay, as well as lifting the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, which he had previously signed into law. His tax plan could increase the national debt by $7.5 trillion over a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s policy package would increase the debt by $3.5 trillion over the same period, the committee found.Economist Marc Goldwein estimates Trump’s new proposals could reduce tax revenues by over $100 billion over ten years. Only about one-fifth of taxpayers might benefit from the car loan interest deduction if it is similar to the mortgage interest deduction.Some audience members supported the proposals, like barber Paulina Salzeider, who said, “In the service industry, the nicer you are, the kinder you are, the friendlier you are, you get rewarded by tips. So I feel that we deserve it.""

The winner of this year's Fat Bear Contest has triumphed over the bear that tragically killed her cub this summer. Grazer secured her victory by defeating the formidable Chunk , receiving over 40,000 votes from fans watching live at Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve.The Fat Bear Contest invites fans to vote for their favourite bear based on winter preparedness, highlighting the fat accumulated during the summer months.Each year, 12 bears are pitted against each other in a tournament-style bracket. The bears feed on the abundant sockeye salmon that leap upstream at Brooks River, often catching them mid-air at the falls.Grazer’s cub met its fate after slipping over the waterfall, where it was killed by Chunk, the largest brown bear on the river. Grazer's attempts to save her cub were recorded on the live cameras, which have also documented other bear interactions, including a recent incident involving another bear, Bear 402, who was killed by a male bear just before the contest bracket was released.Grazer, easily recognisable by her distinctive blond ears and straight muzzle, is known for her strength and fearlessness, earning her the respect of other bears. Meanwhile, Chunk’s sheer size and aggression have allowed him to dominate the river, reportedly consuming 42 salmon in just ten hours.The annual contest, which attracted over 1.3 million votes last year, celebrates the resilience of the 2,200 brown bears inhabiting the preserve on the Alaska Peninsula. With live cameras capturing their activities, Katmai has become a popular tourist destination, offering viewing stands for visitors eager to witness these magnificent creatures in action.","Grazer defeated the formidable Chunk at Alaska’s Katmai National Park.

All about Nobel prize in Physics



From 1901 to 2023, the Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded 117 times to a total of 225 laureates. Notably, John Bardeen is the only recipient to have won the prize twice, in 1956 and 1972. This brings the total number of individuals who have received the Nobel Prize in Physics to 224.

The youngest Nobel laureate is Lawrence Bragg. He received the prize in 1915 “for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays”

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was assigned to award the Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry, the Karolinska Institutet was chosen for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and a committee of five members elected by the Norwegian Parliament (Storting) for the Nobel Peace Prize.

In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences tasked with selecting the laureates starting in 1969.

The Nobel prize in Physics 2024 has been awarded to John J Hopfield and Geoffrey E Hinton “for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.”The 2024 Nobel Prize laureates in Physics utilized tools from their field to develop methods that have significantly contributed to the foundation of modern machine learning.John Hopfield created a framework capable of storing and reconstructing information, while Geoffrey Hinton developed a technique that enables the independent discovery of properties within data, which is crucial for today’s large artificial neural networks.He developed a network that employs a method for storing and reconstructing patterns, where the nodes can be visualized as pixels. The Hopfield network draws on physics principles related to a material's properties influenced by atomic spin, which allows each atom to act as a tiny magnet.This network is described in terms similar to the energy in a spin system, and it is trained by adjusting the connection values between nodes to ensure that the stored images maintain low energy levels. When presented with a distorted or incomplete image, the Hopfield network systematically updates the values of its nodes, reducing its energy to find the stored image that most closely resembles the input.He built upon the Hopfield network to create a new model known as the Boltzmann machine, which employs a different learning method to recognize key features in specific types of data. Hinton utilized concepts from statistical physics, which studies systems composed of many similar components.The Boltzmann machine is trained by providing it with examples that are highly probable when the machine is executed. It can classify images and generate new instances of the patterns it has learned.","The Nobel Prize in Physics 2024 has been awarded to John J Hopfield and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Trump: Harris overtakes Trump among suburban voters: Poll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harris-overtakes-trump-among-suburban-voters-poll/articleshow/114134867.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: Agencies)

Tuning In

WASHINGTON: Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has erased Republican rival Donald Trump 's advantage in the vast middle of American society: suburban residents and middle-income households, an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos polling shows.Since President Joe Biden ended his flagging reelection bid on July 21, Vice President Harris has pulled into the lead in both of these large demographic groups, reinvigorating Democrats' prospects in the Nov 5 election, though the race remains exceptionally close.Suburbanites, who make up about half of the US electorate and are as racially diverse as the nation at large, are a key prize. Biden beat Trump in suburban counties by about six percentage points in the 2020 presidential election.Before Biden dropped out, Trump was leading 43 per cent to 40 per cent among suburbanites in Reuters/Ipsos polls conducted in June and July, reflecting the Democrat's struggle to energize supporters.Harris began closing the gap when she launched her campaign in July and led Trump 47 per cent to 41 per cent among suburban voters in polling across September and October. That represents a nine-point swing in the Democrat's favor, according to the analysis of six Reuters/Ipsos polls that included responses from over 6,000 registered voters.During the same periods, Trump went from leading Biden 44 per cent to 37 per cent among voters in households that earn between $50,000 and $100,000 - roughly the middle third of the nation - to trail Harris 43 per cent to 45 per cent, also a nine-point swing away from Trump. The figures had margins of error of around 3 percentage points.Trump carried this group 52 per cent-47 per cent in 2020, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of exit polls.Reuters/Ipsos surveys have shown voters consider the economy the No. 1 issue ahead of the election and in a poll conducted in October, 46 per cent of voters said Trump was the better candidate for the economy, 8 points more than Harris' 38 per cent.The polls have also shown Trump as the more trusted candidate on immigration and crime. Trump told supporters in August he was the candidate that would keep suburbs safe and ensure that migrants coming across the border illegally are kept ""away from the suburbs.""Trump has blamed the Biden administration for inflation that has hurt middle class Americans. Harris, meanwhile, has put considerable focus in her speeches on pledges to increase the size of the middle class. She also is more often picked in polls as the better candidate for protecting democracy and taking a stand against political extremism.""Her focus on affordability has been highly effective in narrowing Trump's advantage on inflation and the economy,"" said David Wasserman , a political analyst at the Cook Political Report .Wasserman said Harris appeared to be performing well among relatively affluent suburbanites who could be growing more optimistic about the economy, while her gains among middle-income voters could be due to her campaign's regular pledges to help middle-class households.But he noted that voter turnout in Democratic-leaning urban areas and Republican-leaning rural towns could also be critical in deciding the election.Harris supporters contacted by Reuters for follow-up interviews this week also said they had not paid much attention to her before she became a presidential candidate, and that they became more supportive of her as they learned more about her.The latest of the six polls, conducted Oct 4-7, showed Harris up a marginal 3 percentage points over Trump among registered voters overall, 46 per cent to 43 per cent.Her modest edge in national polling is significant although the winner of the election will likely be determined by the results in seven battleground states - Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nevada, Wisconsin and Georgia - where polls have also shown a tight race.Winning the middle - whether nationally or in the election's key states - won't necessarily crown the victor. Democrat Hillary Clinton, who got nearly 3 million votes more than Trump nationwide in the 2016 election and beat him in suburban counties by about 1 percentage point, still lost the election when Trump flipped six states that had voted Democratic in 2012.Poll respondent Sheila Lester , an 83-year-old Harris supporter living in Peoria, Arizona, which mostly lies in the state's battleground Maricopa County, said in a phone interview that she had become convinced Trump would beat Biden.She said she rejoiced when the Democratic Party quickly coalesced around the candidacy of Harris, especially since she could be the first woman U.S. president.""The response that she has gotten has made me a little bit more proud of this country,"" said Lester , a retired customer service employee who considers herself part of the middle class. She said she liked Harris' toughness on abortion rights and her pledge to grow the middle class. ""I am definitely anti-Trump, but I believe I'm more pro-Harris.""Maricopa County played an important role in Biden's 2020 victory, when the county narrowly flipped Democratic after voting for Trump in 2016.Karen Davidson, 83, who lives in West Bloomfield, Michigan, a middle-class suburb of Detroit, said she had not been that familiar with Harris before she moved to the top of the ticket.""I needed to know more about her to form any kind of thought,"" Davidson said.""The way she stood up to people who were berating her, I had to respect that having been in the industrial machinery business when women didn't work in it, I know what that's like,"" Davidson continued. ""She had the strength, and that's what's needed to run our country.""In Pooler, Georgia, a suburb of Savannah, grocery store employee Kevin Garcia said he also was relieved Biden had bowed out and preferred Harris' pledges to support small businesses over Trump's promise to tax imported goods.""I just feel better about the chances,"" said Garcia, 24, who lives in a single-family home neighborhood in the state that, like Arizona, narrowly flipped Democratic in 2020.","Kamala Harris has erased Republican rival Donald Trump's advantage in the vast middle of American society.

While waiting for rescue, the twelve individuals remained in good spirits and were in contact with authorities via radio. They were provided with water and blankets to ensure their comfort, and later received pizza after their rescue.Earlier in the day, eleven other passengers had been safely evacuated from the elevator, four of whom sustained minor injuries.

While a rope rescue was prepared as a backup option, using the elevator was deemed the safest choice.The mine, located 110 miles south of Denver, has a history of operational safety, with only one previous incident reported in 1986.","Twelve people were trapped 1,000 feet underground at the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine in Cripple Creek, Colorado, on Thursday.

What to know about Hurricane Milton after it slammed Florida's Gulf Coast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-to-know-about-hurricane-milton-after-it-slammed-floridas-gulf-coast/articleshow/114134773.cms,"Contractors with the City of New Port Richey help clean debris left by Hurricane Helene in preparation for Hurricane Milton.

As Hurricane Milton barreled into and across Florida , it spawned dozens of tornadoes , knocked out power to millions, damaged homes, flooded neighborhoods and led to hundreds of rescues. But the damage wasn't as bad as had been feared.Gov. Ron DeSantis said that while the storm ""was significant,"" it ""was not the worst-case scenario."" He noted that as he flew over some of the hard-hit areas, he saw that many homes that were built in recent years fared well.""I've seen a lot of grit, I've seen a lot of determination and I'm very confident that this area is going to bounce back very, very quickly,"" DeSantis said at a news conference in Sarasota , near where the storm made landfall on the Gulf CoastThe storm caused at least eight deaths in the state, where some communities were still dealing with the damage from deadly Hurricane Helene two weeks ago.Follow The Associated Press' coverage of tropical weather at https://apnews.com/hub/hurricanes.Where did Milton make landfall, and where did it go next? Milton came ashore Wednesday evening as a Category 3 storm in Siesta Key, a barrier island of white sand beaches about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of the Tampa Bay area.While the Tampa Bay area, home to over 3.3 million people, was spared a direct hit, there was still flooding and damage.By Thursday afternoon, Milton had moved off Florida's east coast and became a post-tropical cyclone that no longer had hurricane-force winds.How bad is the damage? Officials in hard-hit counties have warned people to beware of downed power lines, trees in roads, blocked bridges and flooding. Before Milton even made landfall, heavy rain and tornadoes lashed parts of southern Florida.The storm knocked out power across a large section of the state, leaving over 3 million homes and businesses without electricity, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utility reports. By 9 p.m., that had dropped to 2.8 million.In St. Petersburg, a crane working on a 46-story building toppled and a water main break led the city to shut down service. Also the roof of Tropicana Field, home to the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team, was destroyed.Just inland from Tampa, the flooding in Plant City was ""absolutely staggering,"" according to City Manager Bill McDaniel.The National Weather Service said almost 19 inches (48 centimeters) of rain fell in the St. Petersburg area.A manufacturer of IV fluids critical to hospitals nationwide said its Daytona Beach factory and distribution center were left intact after Milton.How did people die in the hurricane? Officials were reporting at least eight deaths as of Thursday.Five people were killed when a tornado hit in the Spanish Lakes Country Club near Fort Pierce, on the Atlantic Coast, authorities said.In Volusia County, a 79-year-old woman in Ormond Beach and a 54-year-old woman in Port Orange died after trees crashed into their homes, the sheriff's office said.And in Tampa, police said the body of a woman in her 70s was found Thursday morning under a large tree branch.DeSantis said in the afternoon that search-and-rescue operations were ongoing, with at least 340 people and 49 pets rescued so far.How strong was Milton? It reached Category 5 strength with winds of 180 mph (290 kph) while still in the Gulf of Mexico, but then encountered wind shear nearing land that dropped it to Category 3 - less powerful but plenty strong. At landfall, maximum sustained winds were measured at 120 mph (about 205 kph).Storm surge - one of the most devastating elements of any hurricane - was believed to top out at 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 meters) in Sarasota County. That was less than feared. By comparison, Hurricane Ian's 15-foot (4.6-meter) storm surge devastated the community of Fort Myers Beach two years ago.Some might wonder if it is possible to control extreme weather events. But scientists say hurricanes are too powerful for that, and climate change is providing more fuel than ever for storms like Milton and Helene.What if I have plans to vacation in Florida? Three major theme parks in the Orlando area - Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld - all closed as Milton approached but planned to reopen on Friday.Several airports ceased operations as well. Orlando International Airport - the nation's seventh busiest and Florida's most trafficked - began receiving some domestic arrivals Thursday evening and said domestic and international departures would resume the following morning.The Orlando airport said it sustained only minor damage, including a few leaks and downed trees.Tampa's airport planned to reopen Friday morning. Milton damaged six jet bridges used to board planes, and crews were repairing leaks in the main terminal.","The storm caused at least eight deaths in the state, where some communities were still dealing with the damage from deadly Hurricane Helene two weeks ago.

What is the Internet Archive?

The Internet Archive , a digital library, was the target of a 'catastrophic' cyber attack on Thursday, leaving the site defaced and offline. Brewster Kahle, the founder of the San Francisco-based nonprofit, confirmed that a series of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks began on Tuesday, disrupting the site’s services and compromising the data of millions of users.Users reported encountering a pop-up message claiming that the site had been hacked, with data from 31 million accounts compromised.The message, apparently issued by the attackers, urged users to check the site ""Have I Been Pwned"" (HIBP) to see if their information had been leaked.""Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach?"" the message reportedly said.Kahle reported that the attacks led to the breach of usernames, email addresses, and passwords. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday, he stated that the organisation was enhancing its security measures. Following the initial attacks, the hackers returned early Thursday, further impacting the main site and its “Open Library,” which is a digital catalogue of books. Kahle assured users that while the website had been defaced, the data itself had not been corrupted and that efforts were underway to restore services safely.HIBP later confirmed that it had received records from the Internet Archive, including email addresses and passwords. The hacker group ""SN_BLACKMETA"" took responsibility for the attack, claiming that the archive was targeted due to its perceived ties to the US government and its support for Israel.Experts have labelled SN_BLACKMETA a ""rising cyber threat,"" identifying it as a pro-Palestinian hacktivist group, possibly operating from Russia and with potential connections to Sudan.Founded in 1996, the Internet Archive is a nonprofit organisation dedicated to preserving the web and promoting an open internet. It operates the Wayback Machine, which captures snapshots of millions of web pages over time. This tool is essential for fact-checkers and researchers, allowing them to access deleted content and track changes in online information. The Internet Archive serves as a vital resource for maintaining the historical record of digital information.","The Internet Archive, a digital library, was the target of a 'catastrophic' cyber attack on Thursday.

Harris as prepared to be president as any nominee in past; election going to be tight: Obama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harris-as-prepared-to-be-president-as-any-nominee-in-past-election-going-to-be-tight-obama/articleshow/114134575.cms,"Harris as prepared to be president as any nominee in past; election going to be tight: Obama

WASHINGTON: Vice President Kamala Harris is as prepared for this job as any nominee for the president in the past, former president Barack Obama said on Thursday, noting that the November election will be ""tight"" between her and Republican candidate Donald Trump . ""Kamala is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been. That's who Kamala is. And in the White House, she will have an outstanding partner in Governor Tim Walz,"" Obama told a cheering crowd in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, a battleground State, as the former president came out to address his first campaign rally for Harris in this election cycle.""If you elect Kamala and Tim, they won't be focused on their problems, they'll be focused on yours. They understand that too many folks here in Pennsylvania and across the country are struggling to pay the bills. Even though wages are steadily growing and inflation is finally slowing, the price of everything from health care to housing to groceries, it's still too high,"" he said.""That takes a real bite out of the paycheck. It hurts. The question is, who's really going to do something about it? That's what you should be asking yourself. Now, Donald Trump plans to do what he did last time - give another massive tax cut to billionaires and big corporations,"" he said.Addressing thousands of his supporters in this battleground State, Obama said the election is going to be tight. ""This election is going to be tight because there are a lot of Americans who are still struggling out there. They're striving to make life better for themselves, for their families, and for their kids,"" he said.""Let's face it. As a country, we've been through a lot these last few years. We had a historic pandemic wreaking havoc on communities and businesses. Disruptions from the pandemic then caused prices to spike, and that put a strain on family budgets. In many ways, it's felt like the aspirations of working people have taken a backseat to the priorities of the rich and the powerful. So, I get why people are looking to shake things up,"" he said.Obama said he understood people's frustration and their feeling that they (President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris) could do better. ""What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you. I don't understand that. Because there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself,"" he said.""Donald Trump is a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago. You've got the tweets in all CAPS, the ranting and the raving about crazy conspiracy theories. You've got the two-hour speeches, word salad... it's like Fidel Castro, just on and on,"" he alleged.""Constant attempts to sell you stuff. Who does that? Selling you gold sneakers and USD 100,000 watch and, most recently, a Trump Bible. He wants you to buy the Word of God, Donald Trump edition. Got his name right there next to Matthew and Luke. It's crazy. And the reason he does it is because all he cares about is his ego, money and his status,"" Obama said.""He's not thinking about you. Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to an end. He wants the middle class to pay the price for another huge tax cut that would mostly help him and his country club buddies. Doesn't care if he costs more women their reproductive freedom, because it won't make a difference in his life,"" he alleged.""Most of all, Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them, between real Americans who support him and the outsiders who don't. Because having people divided and angry, he figures, boosts his chances of being elected. He doesn't care who gets hurt,"" Obama said.""Think about it. Just the other day, we learned that on January 6, a couple of years ago, Donald Trump was told that Mike Pence was in the Capitol about 40 feet from an angry mob chanting, hang Mike Pence. And his response was 'So what?' If Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his vice president, do you think he cares about you? We do not need four more years of that. We don't need four more years of arrogance, bumbling, bluster and division. America's ready to turn the page,"" Obama said.Eight years out of power, Obama has been one of the Democratic Party's most reliable surrogates to galvanise voters.As the nation's first Black president, Obama's appearance for Harris underscores the history-making nature of her own political career. Harris, the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, would be the first woman to serve as president if elected next month.Obama also appeared at a Harris fundraiser in California and spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August.","Kamala Harris is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been, Obama says.

I mean, I am the hopey-changey guy, so I understand people feeling frustrated and feeling we can do better,"" Obama said.“What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania.”Obama, who received a roaring welcome from the crowd, described Trump’s frequent all-caps posts on social media and his ""ranting and the raving about crazy conspiracy theories."" He compared Trump's long speeches to Fidel Castro’s, saying, “It’s like Fidel Castro . Just on and on. Constant attempts to sell you stuff.

Referring to Trump’s alleged response to Mike Pence’s close encounter with rioters, Obama said, “If Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his own vice president, do you think he cares about you?”He ended his speech by urging Pennsylvanians to vote. “We do not need four more years of arrogance and division,” Obama said. “We are ready for President Kamala Harris.”","Former President Barack Obama delivered a sharp critique of Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) plays a crucial role in supporting low-income individuals and families across the United States by providing essential food assistance. With the rising cost of living and inflation affecting many households, SNAP benefits are regularly adjusted to ensure that participants can access nutritious food.This vital program not only helps alleviate hunger but also promotes overall health and well-being by allowing families to purchase a wide range of food items. As SNAP continues to evolve, its impact remains significant, offering necessary relief to millions of Americans striving to meet their nutritional needs.SNAP Increase for 2025 is considered as the key federal program of low-income individuals and families in accessing healthy food. In response to the rising cost of living, particularly due to inflation, SNAP benefits have been adjusted annually to reflect economic changes.To ensure families receive the adequate amount of support to fulfil the nutritional needs, the Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) 2025, will be crucial for over 40 million Americans who depend on this program to make ends meet.Texas SNAP allows participants to purchase a wide variety of essential food items, including fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, and cereals, providing critical support. Additionally, families can use SNAP benefits to buy seeds and plants to grow their own food. However, the program has specific restrictions.SNAP benefits cannot be used for non-food items such as toiletries, pet food, household supplies, or hot prepared foods. The primary aim of the Texas SNAP increase is to alleviate hunger and enhance access to nutritious food for low-income families.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), administered by the Texas Health and Human Services, is a vital government aid initiative in the USA designed to assist low-income individuals in purchasing food. In 2024, the program will see a benefit increase of 2.5% to 3%, with payments starting on October 1, 2025, via Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT). This increase aims to help millions of Americans meet their nutritional needs. For more information, you can visit the official website at www.hhs.texas.gov.The Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) for SNAP benefits is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which measures inflation in the United States. This index is also used by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to calculate annual benefit increases.The COLA is expected to raise SNAP benefits modestly in 2025, from 2.5% to 3%. For instance, a household receiving $10,000 in benefits in 2024 might see an increase to between $10,250 and $10,300 in 2025.The CPI-W reflects inflation rates, with the COLA calculation relying on data from the third quarter of the preceding year. The adjustment for 2025 will be based on the economic conditions of 2024, with the final percentage released in late October after reviewing all necessary information. The COLA for SNAP and other federal benefits automatically takes effect once announced, demonstrating the federal government’s commitment to aligning benefits with the cost of living through the October 1 COLA adjustment in 2025.COLA adjustments significantly affect households receiving SNAP benefits. As food prices rise due to inflation, even a slight increase in benefits can provide crucial relief for struggling families. By ensuring that SNAP benefits are updated to reflect inflation, the government helps reduce the financial strain on many households attempting to afford nutritious food.

A 59-year-old man was killed by a group of dogs on Wednesday evening in Albany, New York, in a backyard next to a house where around two dozen dogs were kept, according to police.The incident occurred at a residence on Central Avenue in Schenectady, where James Provost was fatally attacked by eight to nine mixed-breed pit bull dogs.Albany police arrived at the scene around 6 pm after receiving reports of an active dog attack.Upon arrival, officers found Provost being attacked by the dogs. One officer discharged his weapon, hitting one of the dogs and causing the others to disperse. Despite efforts to stop the attack, Provost was pronounced dead at the scene.A total of 24 dogs, including 15 puppies, were found at the residence and have been taken to the Mohawk Hudson Humane Society . The dogs' owner, who resides in Cohoes, was not present at the time of the attack.Police chief Eric Hawkins mentioned that the dogs were not kept in a traditional family setting, but their exact purpose is still unknown.“There are so many unanswered questions that we’re trying to sift through,” Hawkins said.Provost's connection to the dogs or their owner is unclear. Nearby witnesses reported hearing him shout for help during the attack.The investigation is ongoing as authorities work to understand how Provost ended up in the yard and the overall circumstances surrounding the case. They have also indicated that criminal charges against the owner may be possible.“We’re going to do everything we can to bring justice for this person who was viciously attacked,” Hawkins added.Officials had previously seized dogs from the same residence in May during a search related to drug activity, although the dogs were not the primary focus of that investigation.","A 59-year-old man was killed by a group of dogs on Wednesday evening in Albany, New York.

Ron DeSantis: Kamala Harris is trying to ‘politicize the storm’

Florida governor Ron DeSantis on Thursday criticised Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris for trying to involve herself in the response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, saying she has ""no role"" in the process.DeSantis recently refused a call from Harris about the hurricane response, while Harris accused him of being ""utterly irresponsible"" and ""selfish.""In an interview with Fox News, DeSantis said he has been collaborating with President Joe Biden and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) for over two weeks, but claimed Harris never reached out to Florida or offered support.""Although I've worked well with the president, she has never called Florida. She has never offered any support,"" DeSantis said.He accused Harris of politicising the disaster for her campaign and reiterated that he had no time for political games amidst the recovery efforts.""I don’t have time for those games. I don’t care about her campaign. Obviously, I'm not a supporter of hers, but she has no role in this process. I'm working with the people I need to be working with,"" he added.DeSantis also mentioned that he had worked well with both Trump and Biden during previous storms.The issue was raised at the White House when a reporter asked President Biden if it was the governor's responsibility to take the vice president's calls. Biden responded, ""All I can tell you is I’ve talked to Governor DeSantis. He's been very gracious. He thanked me for all we've done. He knows what we're doing, and I think that's important."" Biden reportedly was unaware of the dispute between DeSantis and Harris over hurricane recovery efforts before describing DeSantis as ""gracious."" He remained focused solely on managing the disaster response , according to reports.Biden has had several calls with DeSantis since Hurricane Helene began approaching the Southeast two weeks ago, followed by Hurricane Milton 's landfall on Wednesday. Biden instructed both DeSantis and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor to ""call him directly"" if more support was needed. DeSantis confirmed that his federal requests for additional support had been met.During a broadcast warning about Hurricane Milton, which reached Category 3 status with winds up to 120 mph, Biden condemned misinformation surrounding Hurricane Helene. He specifically mentioned former President Donald Trump as spreading misinformation.",Florida governor Ron DeSantis criticised Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris for trying to involve herself in the response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton.

Amidst the deteriorating relationship, Pakistani border troops and Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in a clash while the former country's forces engaged in fence repair work.The incident occurred after the Afghan side launched an attack on a border post in the Naushki-Ghazni sector of the Pak-Afghan border , as reported by The Express Tribune. In response, the Pakistan Army launched a strong counterattack on the Afghan checkpoints, resulting in significant casualties for the Afghan Taliban.The Pakistani newspaper's sources suggested that Pakistan would continue to take robust measures to defend its borders, and its security forces reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the country's territorial integrity, delivering a decisive response to this aggression from Afghanistan.This incident was not an isolated case of unprovoked aggression from Afghan forces. In the previous month, the Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing using heavy weapons, targeting Pakistani check posts from the Afghan region of Plosin. The fighting that took place during the night between September 8 and 9 resulted in the death of at least 16 Afghan Taliban fighters and the injury of 27 others.The Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 2021, allegedly with the support of Pakistan, which had hoped that they would eliminate the threat of militancy emanating from their soil. However, for Pakistan, such hopes turned out to be an illusion as the Afghan Taliban failed to uproot the hideouts of Pakistan Taliban from their territory, leading to an increase in attacks against Pakistan and souring ties between Islamabad and Kabul.","Pakistani border troops and Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in a clash while the former country's forces engaged in fence repair work.

ISLAMABAD: The JUI-F has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition on a proposed constitutional amendment , according to a media report on Wednesday. The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has claimed that the decision to table the 'Constitutional Package' in Parliament had been postponed by the government at its request, The Dawn newspaper reported.The paper quoted sources in the party as saying that the stance regarding opposition to the amendment had not changed, calling the matter ""disputed"".According to a JUI-F source, the government agreed to postpone the amendment at the demand of Maulana Rehman. ""Now…this matter will be taken up after the SCO summit,"" said a party office-bearer.On Monday, the Maulana attended a multi-party moot on Palestine at the invitation of the president and the prime minister and also held a meeting with the bigwigs of the ruling coalition, giving rise to speculations that he had agreed to support the government.However, according to the party spokesperson, there was no truth to these reports while insiders termed the amendment disputed which the JUI-F chief would not agree to ""under the current circumstances"".Sources said the JUI-F endorsed a separate constitutional court but expressed reservations over the constitutional amendment.""Our concern was based on common sense - we demanded the document that we were supposed to vote for, but the government negotiating teams failed to do so,"" a senior party official remarked on the dialogue between the government and the JUI-F last month.The JUI-F still expects the government to share the draft with the party. The JUI-F leader said they would also share their draft on the constitutional court with the government and expected the government to do the same. In order to take everyone on board, the JUI-F leaders have suggested a separate constitutional bench instead of an independent court.On the other hand, the government is almost ready to table the constitutional amendment, and sources in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) believe that this time, it would not be rushed through Parliament.""There will be separate sessions of the National Assembly and Senate and it is likely to be held on October 18,"" they added.It is likely that the National Assembly and Senate sessions will separately be convened on the same day and after getting it cleared from one house, the amendment would be introduced in the other the same day.In order to achieve a two-thirds majority, the ruling alliance has been trying to win over Maulana Rehman as well as some Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-linked lawmakers whose votes against the party line would not be annulled following a review of Article 63A of the Constitution.The Pakistan Peoples Party and PML-N are in contact with Akhtar Mengal, the head of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) as well, hoping to secure the support of two BNP senators.Sardar Mengal, who recently resigned from the National Assembly, is still a member of the house as his resignation hasn't been accepted by the NA speaker, Dawn reported.",The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit , following India's refusal earlier. Last Friday, India confirmed that foreign minister S Jaishankar would lead a delegation to Pakistan for the summit in Islamabad.Responding to a question on Jaishankar's visit and India-Pakistan relations , the spokesperson said that Pakistan had ""officially received notification"" about the visit and is prepared to welcome all participating members.Further on the question of bilateral talks, the spokesperson cited Jaishnakar's refusal and assured to toe the same line.""Regarding your question about bilateral meetings, I would like you to refer to the remarks made by the Indian minister for external affairs on 5th of October, in which he maintained that his visit was meant for a multilateral event and not for discussing Pakistan-India relations. These remarks are self-explanatory,"" she said.The last time an Indian external affairs minister visited Pakistan was when Sushma Swaraj in December 2015 travelled for a forum on the Afghanistan issue. However, Jaishankar's upcoming visit is looked at as a significant move by New Delhi, given the strained bilateral relations between the two countries.Tensions escalated after India carried out airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Balakot in February 2019, following the Pulwama terror attack. Relations worsened further after India revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and reorganised the state into two union territories in August 2019, leading Pakistan to downgrade diplomatic ties.India has consistently stated its desire for normal relations with Pakistan, which New Delhi has said will depend on Islamabad creating an environment free of terrorism and hostility.In May 2023, Pakistan's then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India for an SCO foreign ministers' meeting in Goa, marking the first such visit by a Pakistani foreign minister in nearly 12 years.Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, however, confirmed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will chair the upcoming Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting of the SCO.""We expect high-level participation from SCO members; the observer state of Mongolia; Turkmenistan as a special guest; and representatives of the international organisations, including Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and European Economic Community (EEC),"" she said.The spokesperson stated that the CHG meeting will focus on discussions regarding cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, environment, and socio-cultural connections, while also reviewing the SCO's overall performance.","Pakistan has ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit. Last Friday, India confirmed that foreign minister S Jaishankar would lead a delegation to Pakistan for the summit in Islamabad.

"'Mountaineering testament to strength...': Nima Rinji Sherpa becomes youngest to summit all 14 peaks above 8,000 meters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/mountaineering-testament-to-strength-nima-rinji-sherpa-becomes-youngest-to-summit-all-14-peaks-above-8000-meters/articleshow/114081056.cms,"Nima Rinji Sherpa

An 18-year-old Nepali mountaineer Nima Rinji Sherpa set a new world record by becoming the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.As per the news agency ANI, his historic feat was completed on Wednesday when he successfully scaled Tibet's 8,027-metre-high Shisha Pangma , marking the culmination of his two-year mission to conquer the most daunting mountains on the planet.Summiting all 14 ""eight-thousanders"" is considered the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, requiring climbers to cross into ""death zones,"" where oxygen levels are too low to support human life for long periods. Nima’s success at such a young age has been hailed as a remarkable testament to his strength and determination.Looking back at his journey, Nima posted about the achievement on his Instagram page. He said, ""This summit is not just the culmination of my personal journey, but a tribute to every Sherpa who has ever dared to dream beyond the traditional boundaries set for us. Mountaineering is more than labour; it is a testament to our strength, resilience, and passion.""Wanting this feat to be an inspiration for the younger generation, he further said, ""Through #SherpaPower, I want to show the younger generation of Sherpas that they can rise above the stereotype of being only support climbers and embrace their potential as top-tier athletes, adventurers, and creators. We are not just guides; we are trailblazers. Let this be a call to every Sherpa to see the dignity in our work, the power in our heritage, and the limitless possibilities in our future.""""To humanity as a whole: let this climb remind us that the peaks we reach together, united, are far greater than any individual achievement. As a teenager, witnessing the division caused by borders, wars, racism and other conflicts, I call for love, respect, and harmony among all people. In this vast world, we are but one human race. No summit, no boundary, no conflict is worth more than the peace and unity we can achieve by understanding and supporting one another,"" he added.Then he called out to the people to preserve nature and said, ""The mountain does not define us; we define the mountain We are its guardians, similarly the world we live in should be defined by people who reside in it ! Let’s all unite to protect and preserve our natural resources to live a sustainable and adventurous life!""Nima Rinji hails from a family of renowned mountaineers.He reached the summit of Shisha Pangma early in the morning, accompanied by fellow climber Pasang Nurbu Sherpa. ""He reached the summit this morning. He had trained well, and I was confident he would do it,"" said his father, Tashi Sherpa, while expressing pride in his son’s accomplishment.The President of the Nepal Mountaineering Association , Nima Nuru Sherpa also expressed his happiness at Rinji’s achievement. “This is a proud moment for our country. Nima broke all the stereotypes, and his success has given a message that nothing is impossible if you have a strong determination"".Nima Rinji began his mountaineering career in earnest in August 2022 when he summited Mount Manaslu at the age of 16. By June 2024, he had successfully climbed his 13th mountain, Kanchenjunga, the third-highest peak in the world. His ascent of Shisha Pangma on October 9, 2024, completed his record-breaking achievement.The record for the youngest person to summit all 14 peaks was previously held by Mingma Gyabu 'David' Sherpa, who achieved the feat at the age of 30 in 2019. Nima Rinji, however, accomplished the same feat at just 18 years and five months, completing his journey in two years and ten days, according to Seven Summit Treks, the expedition organiser.Nepali climbers, particularly Sherpas, have long been considered the backbone of the climbing industry in the Himalayas, often carrying equipment and setting up routes for foreign climbers. However, in recent years, Sherpas have gained recognition in their own right, taking centre stage in some of the most challenging climbs.","Nima Rinji Sherpa is the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.
