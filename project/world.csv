'Not stranded': Nasa insists Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams 'enjoying their time' at space station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/nasa-insists-boeing-starliner-crew-butch-wilmore-sunita-williams-not-stranded-and-enjoying-their-time-at-space-station-iss/articleshow/111353997.cms,"Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams , who launched aboard Boeing 's Starliner capsule on June 5, will remain at the International Space Station for an extended period as engineers work to resolve issues with the spacecraft's propulsion system and helium leaks that emerged during the journey.Nasa's commercial crew program manager, Steve Stich, emphasised that the astronauts are safe and in no rush to return, saying, ""We're not in any rush to come home.""The official mentioned that the duo is having a pleasant stay aboard the space station.He said, ""enjoying their time on the space station,"" and further added, ""our plan is to continue to return them on Starliner and return them home at the right time.""The test flight, which marked Boeing's first astronaut launch after numerous delays and setbacks, was originally planned to last about a week.However, the mission has been prolonged multiple times to allow for thorough analysis of the thruster problems and leaks while avoiding conflicts with spacewalks by station astronauts. A recent spacewalk was postponed due to a water leak in an astronaut's spacesuit, an issue that remains unresolved.During Starliner's approach to the space station, five out of 28 thrusters failed, nearly jeopardizing the docking process. Although all but one thruster was successfully restarted, the capsule experienced several helium leaks throughout the flight. Boeing has said that these issues are not expected to impact the return trip.Nasa and Boeing have decided to conduct ground tests of the capsule's thrusters in New Mexico to gather more information and attempt to replicate the situation that occurred during docking. These tests are expected to take a couple of weeks.Despite the challenges, Stich emphasised that the astronauts are not stranded in space, noting that Starliner is designed for missions lasting up to 210 days.He also assured that in the event of a space station emergency, the astronauts could return to Earth using Starliner. Following the retirement of the space shuttle fleet, Nasa has been relying on private companies like SpaceX and Boeing to transport astronauts to and from the space station, with plans to alternate between the two providers in the future.Mark Nappi, Boeing's commercial crew program vice president and program manager, expressed his disappointment regarding the public perception of the recent test flight. He said, ""It is pretty painful to read the things that are out there.""Despite the successful completion of the test flight, Nappi feels that the accomplishment is being portrayed in a negative light. He further added, ""We've gotten a really good test flight that's been accomplished so far, and it's being viewed rather negatively.""Wilmore and Williams have been assisting with tasks and investigations aboard the space station, in addition to their responsibilities evaluating the systems on the Boeing spacecraft. The two astronauts have prior experience working at the orbital outpost. According to Nasa, the space station is well-stocked with provisions to support the duo and the seven crew members on extended missions.","Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams will remain at the International Space Station for an extended period.

'George Floyd 3.0': Missouri prison guards charged with murder in death of Black man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/george-floyd-3-0-missouri-prison-guards-charged-with-murder-in-death-of-black-man/articleshow/111349818.cms,"Four Missouri prison guards have been charged with murder, and a fifth with involuntary manslaughter, in connection with the death of Othel Moore Jr, a 38-year-old Black man, in December. According to a complaint filed on Friday, Moore was pepper sprayed, had his face covered with a mask, and was left in a position that caused him to suffocate while in custody at a correctional facility.The incident occurred on Dec 8, 2023, when a group of guards from the Department of Corrections Emergency Response Team was conducting a sweep for contraband in one of the housing units.During the sweep, Moore was pepper sprayed twice and then placed in a spit hood, leg wrap, and restraint chair. He was then moved to a separate housing unit, where he was left in the hood, wrap, and chair for 30 minutes, despite multiple people hearing him say he couldn't breathe. Moore was eventually taken to a hospital wing, where he was pronounced dead.The medical examiner ruled Moore's cause of death as positional asphyxiation , and the events were captured on the prison's video surveillance system. Cole County prosecuting attorney Locke Thompson stated, ""After sitting down and reviewing all evidence, the dozens and dozens of interviews, all the reports, we determined that charges were appropriate.""Andrew Stroth, an attorney for Moore's family, has described the incident as "" George Floyd 3.0 in a prison,"" and has alleged a pattern of racist and unconstitutional abuse within the Missouri Department of Corrections, particularly at the Jefferson City Correction Center.The complaint charges Justin Leggins, Jacob Case, Aaron Brown, and Gregory Varner each with one count of second-degree murder and one count of being an accessory to second-degree assault. Bryanne Bradshaw, a fifth guard, is charged with one count of accessory to involuntary manslaughter. Those charged with felony murder could face between 10 and 30 years in prison.Moore's family has filed a lawsuit against the officers and the Department of Corrections, alleging that the attack on Moore was not an isolated occurrence but rather a manifestation of a barbarous pattern and practice fostered by the highest-ranking members of the Missouri department of corrections.","Othel Moore Jr, a 38-year-old Black man, was pepper sprayed, had his face covered with a mask, and was left in a position that caused him to suffocate.

Trump claimed that the upcoming is not about Biden 's ability to ""survive a 90-minute debate"" but rather about America 's survival under another four years of his presidency.Throughout his speech, Trump repeated false statements about various issues, including abortion, immigration, climate change, and the 2020 election.He told Biden that the country “doesn’t want” him and to “get the hell out of here.""He suggested that Biden is not leaving the presidential race . “Many people are saying after last night’s performance that Joe Biden is leaving the race, but the fact is I don’t believe that,” said Trump.Trump also claimed that Biden got the debate rules, date, network, and moderators he wanted, implying that Biden was attempting to rig the debate.Trump continued to paint a grim picture of America, repeating lies about doctors killing babies after birth and making unfounded allegations about immigrants taking jobs from Black and Hispanic Americans. He dismissed rising sea levels as an opportunity for ""waterfront property"" and claimed that global warming is ""fine."" Trump also boasted about his knowledge of weapons and warned of an impending third World War.In response to Biden's reminder that Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, said Trump called dead military veterans ""suckers"" and ""losers,"" Trump denied the accusation and insulted Kelly, calling him ""the dumbest of them all"" and ""a lost soul.""Meanwhile, at a competing rally in North Carolina, Biden attempted to reframe his debate performance, admitting that he is not as young or as skilled in debating as he once was. However, he emphasized his commitment to telling the truth, distinguishing right from wrong, and executing the duties of the presidency.","Trump claimed that Biden got the debate rules, date, network, and moderators he wanted, implying that Biden was attempting to rig the debate.

US supreme court rules in favor of January 6 rioters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-january-6-rioters/articleshow/111349688.cms,"The US supreme court ruled on Friday that prosecutors overreached when charging January 6 rioters with obstruction for attempting to hinder the certification of the 2020 presidential election. The decision, which could lead to the reversal of numerous convictions, was made in the case of Joseph Fischer , a former police officer and Trump supporter who entered the Capitol alongside hundreds of others on January 6, 2021.Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, stated that the prosecutors' interpretation of the law would ""criminalize a broad swath of prosaic conduct, exposing activists and lobbyist(s) to decades in prison."" He emphasized that the government ""must establish that the defendant impaired the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or other things used in an official proceeding, or attempted to do so.""The case was decided with a 6-3 majority, with Ketanji Brown Jackson siding with the court's conservatives. The dissent was authored by Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, and was supported by liberal judges Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. The case will now return to a lower court to determine if Fischer's indictment can be upheld under the more restrictive interpretation of ""obstruction.""According to the department of justice, 52 rioters have been convicted and sentenced on obstruction charges, with 27 currently serving time in prison. Attorney General Merrick Garland stated, ""The vast majority of the more than 1,400 defendants charged for their illegal actions on January 6 will not be affected by this decision.""The case centered on the interpretation of the word ""otherwise"" in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was passed following the destruction of documents in the 2001 Enron scandal. The majority argued that the word ""otherwise"" gives prosecutors too much discretion, allowing them to pursue charges that go beyond the original intent of Congress. In her dissent, Barrett maintained that the joint session of Congress on January 6 was undeniably an official proceeding, and accused the majority of performing ""textual backflips to find some way -- any way"" to limit the scope of the relevant subsection.This case also has potential implications for Donald Trump , who faces four felony charges brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith related to his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy to deny Americans the right to vote and have their votes counted. However, this case is currently on hold pending the supreme court's ruling on Trump's claims of immunity from criminal prosecution, which is expected to be delivered on Monday.","The US supreme court ruled on Friday that prosecutors overreached when charging January 6 rioters with obstruction for attempting to hinder the certification of the 2020 presidential election.

Vladimir Putin orders production of banned missiles after scrapping of treaty with US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/vladimir-putin-orders-production-of-banned-missiles-after-scrapping-of-treaty-with-us/articleshow/111349383.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday called for the production of intermediate-range missiles, which were previously banned under a treaty with the United States that has now been scrapped.The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan in 1988, prohibited ground-based nuclear and conventional missiles with a range of 500-5,500 kilometers (310-3,410 miles) and was considered a significant arms control achievement.However, the US withdrew from the treaty in 2019, citing Russian violations.During a meeting of Russia 's national security council, Putin stated, ""We need to start production of these strike systems and then, based on the actual situation, make decisions about where - if necessary to ensure our safety - to place them.""He noted that while Russia had not produced such missiles since the treaty was scrapped in 2019, the United States has not only been producing these missile systems but has also brought them to Europe for exercises in Denmark and announced their deployment in the Philippines.Since the treaty's termination, the US has tested missiles that would have been prohibited under the INF treaty. The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported in April that the US Army's Pacific commander, Gen Charles Flynn, stated that such a missile would be deployed in the region by the end of the year, marking the first deployment since the treaty's end.The scrapping of the INF treaty was a significant event in the deterioration of relations between the US and Russia.The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, is the last remaining arms-control pact between Washington and Moscow. It is set to expire in 2026, and the lack of dialogue on establishing a successor deal has raised concerns among arms control advocates.Putin's statement comes amidst heightened tensions between Russia and the West over the conflict in Ukraine and concerns about potential nuclear attacks.In June, Putin addressed executives from international news organizations regarding Moscow's use of nuclear weapons, stating, ""We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.""","The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan in 1988, prohibited ground-based nuclear and conventional missiles with a range of 500-5,500 kilometers (310-3,410 miles) The US withdrew from the treaty in 2019, citing Russian violations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111349415,imgsize-1299878,width-400,resizemode-4/111349415.jpg"
Trump's relentless attacks & falsehoods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-relentless-attacks-falsehoods/articleshow/111349739.cms,"For most of Thursday night's debate, former Prez Trump verbally pummeled Prez Biden , painting his political opponent as an ineffective leader with a torrent of attacks that were frequently false, lacked context or were vague enough to be misleading.Trump went directly after Biden's personal character, calling him ""weak"" and little respected by global leaders who were ""laughing"" at him.He tried to accuse Biden of corruption, dubbing the president as a ""Manchurian candidate"" who was ""paid by China,"" a nod to frequent accusations of undue influence for which there is no evidence. He directly blamed Biden for a wave of immigrants ""coming in and killing our citizens at a level we've never"" seen, a hyperbolic claim that is not backed up by statistics. And in a wild misrepresentation of facts, Trump claimed falsely that Biden ""encouraged"" Russia to attack Ukraine, even though Biden has consistently tried to rally support for Ukraine.Trump's remarks during the debate were not different from the way he inveighs against Biden during his rallies. But the attacks were particularly striking given that Biden was standing mere feet away from him. The CNN anchors focused on keeping the peace, they did not even try to fact-check Trump's assertions.Biden did get in a few licks though. He said Trump had the ""morals of an alley cat"" and accused him of having sex with a porn star while his wife was pregnant. But by and large, Biden was on the defensive.Seizing on Biden's halting speech, Trump pounced at one moment when Biden trailed off, saying: ""I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said, either."" But Trump's most forceful attacks surrounded immigration . Trump invoked the idea of ""Biden migrant crime,"" claiming that Biden's lax border policy had allowed terrorists and criminals to cross the border illegally. He accused Biden of killing ""so many at our border"" by not curbing the surge of migrants, an assertion that he did not back up with statistics.Trump also went after Biden's profile on the world stage. He argued that Putin was ""laughing at"" Biden's leadership and at his failure to secure the release of WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich. Trump also revived his accusations that Biden improperly received payments from a Chinese energy company tied with his son Hunter. There is no proof any portion of those payments went to the president.","Biden did get in a few licks though.

""Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself.Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight — and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit. Last night didn’t change that, and it’s why so much is at stake in November,"" Biden posted.Biden's support marked a shift in the Democrat narrative which was in favor of an alternative candidate as soon as the debate ended, but hours later it threw its weight behind Biden -- making it clear that Biden will not opt out of the contest.Biden too -- in his rally in North Carolina-- acknowledged his age-related frailties and said he was aware that he was not a young man and could not debate as he used to, but he knew his job, he knew the right and the wrong, the 81-year-old made an emotional appeal to the supporters who were writing him off after the debate.Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, said members of Biden's Cabinet should consider using the 25th Amendment to remove him from the office. “There’s a lot of people asking about the 25th Amendment, invoking the 25th Amendment right now because this is an alarming situation,” Johnson said. “Our adversaries see the weakness in this White House as we all do. I take no pleasure in saying that. I think this is a very dangerous situation.”“But it’s not just political. It’s not just the Democratic Party. It’s the entire country. We have a serious problem here, because we have a president who, by all appearances, is not up to the task,” Johnson said. “And these are very dangerous times. This is a very serious moment in American history. And it needs to be regarded and handled as such. And we hope that they will do their duty, as we all seek to do our duty to do best for the American people.”The 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which governs presidential succession, says that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet may vote to declare a president “unable to discharge the powers and the duties of his office” and give the vice president the duties of acting president.",Biden's support marked a shift in the Democrat narrative which was in favor of an alternative candidate as soon as the debate ended.

ISS astronauts take cover as Russian satellite breaks into over 100 pieces in space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/iss-astronauts-take-cover-as-russian-satellite-breaks-into-over-100-pieces-in-space/articleshow/111329140.cms,"What happened to the defunct Russian satellite?

How did this affect the astronauts aboard the ISS?

What is the risk associated with this debris?

How are space agencies responding to this incident?

What caused the satellite to break up?

What are the implications of this incident for future space operations?

Astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) were forced to take cover as a defunct Russian satellite broke up into more than 100 pieces of debris. This fragmentation has significantly added to the growing space debris problem, posing a risk to space operations.Nasa confirmed that the debris from the Russian satellite breakup passed close enough to the ISS, triggering precautionary measures.The astronauts were directed to shelter in place as a safety measure. ""The crew followed standard procedures and moved to their designated safe areas,"" stated a Nasa spokesperson.The breakup of the RESURS-P1 satellite, an Earth observation satellite declared dead by Russia in 2022, occurred at around 10am am Mountain Time (1600 GMT) on Wednesday. The incident took place in low-Earth orbit near the ISS, prompting US astronauts on board to shelter in their spacecraft for about an hour. This event has reignited discussions about the need for international regulations and collaborative efforts to manage space debris.The defunct Russian satellite RESURS-P1 broke up into over 100 pieces of debris in low-Earth orbit. US Space Command confirmed that ""over 100 pieces of trackable debris"" were created immediately following the breakup.The debris field from the breakup passed close enough to the ISS to necessitate precautionary measures. Nasa's Space Station office reported that the astronauts were directed to shelter in their designated safe areas. They remained in their spacecraft for roughly an hour before resuming their normal activities.The debris field created by the disintegrated satellite is expected to remain in orbit for several years, increasing the likelihood of collisions with operational satellites and space stations. ""It's a wild west out there,"" commented a leading astrophysicist. ""The increased debris heightens the risk of disastrous collisions, presenting a real environmental problem.""Nasa and other space agencies are using space-tracking radars to monitor the debris. US Space Command and firms like LeoLabs have detected at least 180 pieces of debris. There are ongoing discussions about the need for international regulations to manage space traffic and mitigate the risks associated with space debris.There are no immediate details on what caused the break-up of the RESURS-P1 satellite. Analysts speculate it could have been due to an onboard issue, such as leftover fuel causing an explosion. Jonathan McDowell, a space-tracker and Harvard astronomer, remarked, ""I find it hard to believe they would use such a big satellite as an ASAT target. But, with the Russians these days, who knows.""This incident underscores the ongoing challenges faced by space agencies worldwide in maintaining safe operations in an increasingly congested orbital environment. The prospect of satellite collisions and space warfare has added urgency to calls from space advocates and lawyers for an international mechanism to manage space traffic.(With inputs from agencies)","Astronauts aboard the International Space Station were forced to take cover as a defunct Russian satellite broke up into more than 100 pieces of debris.

This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years, a Newsweek report said.Melania Trump's former friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff , weighed in on the evolving dynamics within the Trump family. Wolkoff, who has previously published a tell-all book about her time with the former first lady, described some of the recent claims about Melania and Ivanka's relationship as ""ridiculous."" Wolkoff's comments suggest that the public may not have the full picture of the intricate relationships within the Trump family.This development comes as Donald Trump faces various legal challenges, which have undoubtedly impacted the family's interactions. The former president's conviction in New York has led to increased media attention on his personal life, including his relationships with Melania and Ivanka.Historically, there have been reports of tension between Melania and Ivanka. Ivanka, who served as a senior advisor during Donald Trump's presidency, often took on a prominent role, leading to speculation about her influence and relationship with her stepmother. However, the current situation appears to show a thawing of relations between the two women, perhaps brought on by the pressures of their shared circumstances.Melania Trump has largely remained out of the public eye since leaving the White House, making few public statements and maintaining a low profile. Ivanka, on the other hand, has also stepped back from the political spotlight but continues to be a figure of interest due to her high-profile role during her father's administration.As the Trump family navigates these legal and personal challenges, the evolving relationships within the family continue to be a topic of public fascination. The reported improvement in Melania and Ivanka's relationship adds a new layer to the complex narrative of the Trump family's public and private lives.","A source close to the family noted that ""Melania and Ivanka are rumored to be getting along better since Donald Trump was convicted in New York"" This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111292941,imgsize-10050,width-400,resizemode-4/111292941.jpg"

After the incident the plane continued safely to Baltimore, Southwest said.Several other incidents involving Southwest flights in recent months have raised concerns.Last week, the FAA said it was investigating a Southwest flight that descended to a low altitude of around 500 feet (152.4 m) about 9 miles (14.5 km) from the Oklahoma City airport.After the automated Minimum Safe Altitude Warning sounded, an air traffic controller alerted the flight crew of Southwest Airlines Flight 4069, which had departed from Las Vegas.Earlier this month, the FAA and NTSB said they were investigating a May 25 Southwest flight of a Boeing 737 MAX. The NTSB said the plane experienced a ""Dutch roll"" at 34,000 feet while en route from Phoenix, to Oakland, California. Such lateral asymmetric movements are named after a Dutch ice-skating technique and can pose serious safety risks.The FAA said this month it was also investigating a Southwest 737 MAX 8 flight in April that came within about 400 feet of the ocean off the coast of Hawaii after bad weather conditions prompted pilots to bypass a landing attempt at Lihue airport.During the go-around, the first officer ""inadvertently pushed forward on the control column while following thrust lever movement commanded by the autothrottle,"" according to a June 7 airline memo, and the plane began to descend rapidly, hitting a maximum descent rate of about 4,400 feet per minute.The pilots in a post-debrief said seeing the severity of the flight ""through the animations was a significant, emotional event,"" Southwest said, adding the incident prompted the airline to review data and trends related to its procedures, training, standards, and performance.","Southwest Flight 4805 departed from a temporarily closed runway in Maine earlier this week.

Kabul harbouring TTP leaders, claims Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Amid heightened tensions with the Taliban rulers in Kabul and under increasing pressure from China, the Pakistan government has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"", to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan .Speaking about the new initiative, defence minister Khawaja Asif recently told the Voice of America that Pakistan was even willing to go as far as carrying out cross-border strikes to eliminate militant hideouts in Afghanistan -- a move that could potentially trigger a retaliatory move from the Taliban regime.There has been a spike in terror-related incidents in Pakistan ever since the Taliban stormed back to power in Kabul in August 2021 after the US suddenly withdrew from the war-torn country.Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023.Many of the incidents have centered around Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan areas.Terror incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been of particular concern to the Pakistan government as they have resulted in the deaths of many Chinese citizens working on projects related to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have highlighted the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).China has come out strongly against the attacks and has sternly warned Islamabad that it must take strict and effective action or it would re-evaluate its investments and projects in the country.Pakistan has blamed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for majority of the attacks and has repeatedly asserted that the terrorist organisation's leaders are being given a safe haven in the border areas of Afghanistan.The defence minister's strong statement came on the day JUI-F Maulana Fazlur Rehman warned about the critical security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Rehman has claimed that things have reached a point where even the police could not go out at night due to the presence of armed men. The TTP ended its ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022.In an interview with Voice of America, Asif said Islamabad could strike terror havens in Afghanistan and it would not be against international law since Kabul had been ""exporting"" terrorism to Pakistan and the ""exporters"" were being harboured there.He said though the TTP was operating from the neighbouring country, its cadre, about a few thousand in number, ""are operating from within the country"" and blamed the previous Imran Khan-led PTI government for bringing militancy back.The minister also ruled out any chances of dialogue with the banned outfit, saying that there was no common ground.Speaking about 'Azm-i-Istehkam', Asif said parliament would be taken on board in this regard and the concerns of political parties would also be addressed.Dawn reported that in separate remarks to local news channels, the minister said Islamabad would ""stringently enforce international laws at its borders with Afghanistan"" to restrict the movement of smuggled goods.The media outlet reported him as saying that the decision would also ""thwart the infiltration of terrorists"".","Pakistan has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"" The move is to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.

The National Assembly of Pakistan approved the government's finance bill for the upcoming fiscal year on Friday, which includes significant tax increases, the bill was passed ahead of further negotiations with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) regarding a new bailout package, as the country seeks to prevent a debt default amidst the slowest economic growth in South Asia.Despite facing strong opposition from rival political parties, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented the tax-heavy budget in parliament, which was subsequently endorsed by the ruling alliance under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq announced the bill's passage during a live television broadcast.The government has set an ambitious tax revenue target of 13 trillion rupees ($46.66 billion) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, representing a nearly 40% increase from the current year. This target was outlined in the national budget presented on July 12, which aimed to bolster Pakistan's case for a new IMF rescue package, with the country currently in discussions for a loan ranging from $6 billion to $8 billion.The tax increases include a 48% rise in direct taxes and a 35% increase in indirect taxes compared to the revised estimates for the current year. Non-tax revenue, such as petroleum levies, is expected to surge by an astonishing 64%. Textile and leather products, as well as mobile phones, will face an 18% tax, and there will be an increase in the tax on capital gains from real estate transactions. Workers will also be subject to higher direct taxes on their income.Pakistan has forecasted a significant reduction in its fiscal deficit for the new financial year, aiming for 5.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), down from an upwardly revised estimate of 7.4% for the current year. However, the central bank has cautioned about the potential inflationary impact of the budget, noting that limited progress in structural reforms to expand the tax base means that increased revenue must come from tax hikes. The country has set a growth target of 3.6% for the upcoming year, with inflation projected at 12%.",The National Assembly of Pakistan approved the government's finance bill for the upcoming fiscal year on Friday.

However, he has secured relief in other cases, including £190 million reference and Toshakhana, and acquittal in the cypher case, according to Geo News report.Earlier in February, the district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi each to seven years in prison after the trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Bushra Bibi's former husband, Khawar Maneka, approached the court against the couple's marriage.The district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra each, to seven years in prison in February earlier this year after a trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Khawar Maneka, Bushra's ex-husband, moved the court against the couple's marriage.Khawar Maneka said that the marriage was solemnized during Bushra Bibi's iddat period, the time a woman goes into isolation after a divorce or her husband's death. Imran Khan and his wife then filed appeals, including the ones against their conviction and those seeking suspension of their sentences.Considering Khawar Maneka's repeated expression of no-confidence, the Islamabad high court (IHC), on Judge Arujmand's request, transferred the case to the court of additional district and sessions judge Muhammad Afzal Majuka.On June 25, the district and sessions court reserved its verdict on pleas against Khan and Bushra Bibi's conviction, after directions given by IHC to decide the matter of suspension of the sentences within 10 days, Geo News reported.The court had also given one month for the decision on the petition filed by the couple against their conviction. Meanwhile, Bushra Bibi had requested a decision on her plea filed in the sessions court seeking suspension of her sentence.The court will announce the reserved verdict on June 27 at 3 pm (local time) while the hearing on the couple's plea seeking annulment of their conviction in the said case will be resumed on July 2, Geo News reported.PTI has been awaiting a favorable decision as a major relief for Imran Khan, who has been acquitted in some cases or has been granted bail in others. However, it is also likely that the government will try to block his release as Pakistan prime minister's Adviser on political and public affairs Rana Sanaullah on Tuesday gave credence to the reports that the federal government was planning to register new cases against the incarcerated PTI founder.Speaking on Geo News programme 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath', Sanaullah said, ""Imran Khan's main agenda is to destabilise the country and spread chaos and anarchy in the country that's why the government will certainly try to keep him behind bars as long as possible.""Rana Sanaullah made these remarks while responding to a question on reports that the government was planning to delay the release of former Pakistan PM Imran Khan as the courts granted him relief in several cases, according to Geo News report.Sanaullah said Imran Khan ""boycotted"" parliament and launched the agitation movement against the government after the PTI government was ousted through a no-confidence motion in 2022.Pakistan PM's adviser said, ""Persistently he has only one agenda spread anarchy and mischief in the country, hence for the betterment of the country he [Imran Khan] should be kept behind bars."" He said that the federal government would use all legal means, including registration of new cases to delay the release of Imran Khan.","An Islamabad local court will announce the verdict on the pleas filed by former Pakistan PM Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi seeking suspension of their sentences in the iddat case. Imran Khan has been facing several charges, including corruption and terrorism since his removal as Pakistan's PM. The PTI founder has remained in prison after he was sentenced in the Toshakhana case and subsequently sentenced in other cases before the elections held on February 8.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111301866,imgsize-779917,width-400,resizemode-4/111301866.jpg"

He said security forces had arrested two key militant commanders— TTP’s Nasrullah, alias Maulvi Mansoor, and Idrees, aka Irshad— and then showed a recorded statement of the former.In the video statement Nasrullah claimshe belongs to South Waziristan’s Sararogha tehsil and that he had worked from slain Baitullah Mehsud’s platform before joining TTP in 2007.He recalled that he had settled in Afghanistan’s Paktika province during the2014 military offensive in North Waziristan and had been working as an “emir” in TTP’s defence commission since 2023.He thenexplainedaplanhe had been briefed about in Jan 2024 according to which a BLA guide would take him to southern Balochistan by helping him cross the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan through Spin Boldak town. According to the militant, Bashir Zeb, commander of BLA Majeed Brigade, was complicit in the plan’s creation.Nasrullah alleged India’s intelligence agency R&AW was behind all this, that it wanted a BLA-TTP nexus, and that TTP bases be established in Khuzdar, Balochistan.“TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsudand the outfit’s defence minister, Mufti Muzahim, said we(TTP)and our friends(R&AW)have three objectives in establishing a foothold in Balochistan,” he claimed, adding: “Sabotaging CPEC projects, including targeting Chinese citizens; carrying out kidnappings for ransom to play up the matter of enforced disappearances so that intelligence agencies can be defamed; and spreading anarchy and frustration among the people by fomenting terrorist activities in Balochistan.”He claimed that Mehsud held meetings with R&AW agents at the Indian embassy in Kabul and that this was fully supported by the Afghan government.After showing Nasrullah’s video statement, Langau said, “The global community should have no doubt left that there is India behind all this.”He said that while TTP vowed to “introduce an Islamic system”, the BLA on the other hand was their “ideological opposite”. “Their nexus only means that their investor is the same who is using them from two angles,” he alleged. “If you look at the financial support or the intelligence of BLA and TTP, or their members sitting abroad, there is no doubt that RAW is funding them,” Langau alleged.","Minister Ziaullah Langau’s allegations came during a press conference in Quetta.

Azm-e-Istehkam: Pakistan's new military operation to take on TTP and other militant groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/what-is-azm-e-istehkam-pakistans-new-military-operation-against-militants/articleshow/111255323.cms,"China has pressured Pakistan to crack down on the armed violence against CPEC targets.

What they're saying

“A soft state can never gain the trust of investors,” PM Shehbaz remarked. “The responsibility of the fight against terrorism is the collective duty and the primary obligation of all state institutions. It’s not about you and me, it’s about us, we have to trample it together.”

""The campaign will be complemented by socioeconomic measures aimed at addressing genuine concerns of the people and creating an environment that discourages extremist tendencies,"" said a statement from Sharif's office.

Ihsanullah Tipu, a security analyst, noted, ""Pakistan views the use of active military force as the most effective approach to counter armed violence.""

Some analysts suggest that the operation's timing may also be influenced by domestic political and economic considerations. Asfandyar Mir of the US Institute of Peace said, ""With the election done and a government in place, and the economic situation stabilizing, Pakistani leadership probably feels confident to pursue a vigorous campaign.""

What is the main objective of

Operation Azm-e-Istehkam

?

The primary objective of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam is to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan. This includes addressing domestic security threats and dealing with armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan. The operation also aims to implement socioeconomic measures to create an environment that discourages extremist tendencies.

Why now?

The timing of the operation is linked to a dramatic increase in violent incidents over the last 18 months. Most of these attacks have been claimed by the TTP , which ended a ceasefire in November 2022.

, which ended a ceasefire in November 2022. Additionally, recent attacks targeting Chinese interests in Pakistan have further underscored the urgency of a robust military response.

Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023. Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have increased, highlighting the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ).

). Senior Chinese officials have also emphasized the need for improved security for Chinese nationals and investments in Pakistan.

How will the operation be different from previous military campaigns?

Unlike previous large-scale military operations that required mass displacement of local populations, Azm-e-Istehkam is not intended to be a kinetic large-scale military campaign. The focus will be on augmenting the efforts of armed forces with intelligence-based operations and legal measures to address terrorism-related cases. The operation is described as a “multi-domain, multi-agency, whole of the system national vision” for enduring stability.

What are the potential challenges to the success of this operation?

Security analysts highlight several challenges, including the transient nature of TTP bases in Pakistan and the risk of escalating tensions with Afghanistan if cross-border operations are conducted. Additionally, the lack of public support for security forces in provinces heavily affected by violence could hinder the operation’s effectiveness. There is also the issue of diverging approaches between Pakistan and China regarding the Taliban in Afghanistan, a report in AlJazeera said.

What has been the reaction of opposition parties to this operation?

Opposition parties, including the PTI, JUI-F, and ANP, have expressed significant criticism of the operation. They argue that it could worsen the volatile situation in border regions and have questioned the government's decision-making process, claiming it lacked sufficient consultation with parliament and local stakeholders.

How has China reacted to recent attacks targeting its nationals and investments in Pakistan?

China has expressed strong concerns over the security of its nationals and investments in Pakistan, urging the Pakistani government to take effective measures to protect them. Following attacks on Chinese engineers and installations, Chinese officials have reiterated the importance of security and the need to protect Chinese interests in the country.

Will the operation affect Pakistan’s relationship with Afghanistan?

The operation could strain already tense relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly if cross-border military actions are taken. The Taliban government in Kabul has consistently denied harboring TTP militants, and any escalation of military activities could complicate diplomatic relations further.

Since 2001, Pakistan's military has conducted many high-profile operations like ""Zarb-e-Azb"", ""Rah-e-Nijat"", ""Rah-e-Rast"" and many more against homegrown militants in border areas. It seems it's time for another military operation against militants in Pakistan. But the Pakistan military has failed to root out these militant groups time and again.However, under pressure from China, the Pakistan government has again approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability."" This initiative, announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after a review of the country's counterterrorism efforts, aims to address domestic security threats and the activities of armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.The operation comes amid heightened tensions between Islamabad and the Taliban rulers in Kabul.(With inputs from agencies)","Operation Azm-e-Istehkam aims to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan.
