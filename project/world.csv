Who plotted to sell Elvis’ Graceland? An identity thief raises his hand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-plotted-to-sell-elvis-graceland-an-identity-thief-raises-his-hand/articleshow/110578652.cms,"The writer said he was an identity thief — a ringleader on the dark web, with a network of “worms” placed throughout the US. In an email to NYT, he said his ring preyed on the dead, the unsuspecting and the elderly, using birth certificates and other documents.“We figure out how to steal,” he said. Recently, the writer suggested, the group had turned its attention to a major target: the estate of Lisa Marie Presley , which last week faced a threat that Graceland was about to be foreclosed on and sold by a mysterious company, Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC. Media outlets often recei ve unsolicited emails from people who make outlandish claims. But this email arrived Friday in response to one sent by NYT to an email address that Naussany listed in a legal filing.In its email, NYT referred to the company’s claim that Presley had borrowed $3.8 million from it, using Graceland as collateral. In the responses, which came from the email address NYT had written to, the writer described the foreclosure effort not as a legitimate attempt to collect on a debt, but as a scam. “I had fun figuring this one out and it didn’t succeed very well,” the email writer said. He said he was based in Nigeria, and his email was written in Luganda, a Bantu language spoken in Uganda. But the filing with the email address was faxed from a number to serve North America.Since the news broke last week that a company was trying to sell Graceland — Elvis Presley ’s former home and a beloved tourist attraction — the Naussany company has been a persistent puzzle. It is difficult to find any public records that prove that the company exists. In Sept, eight months after Lisa Marie Presley’s death, Naussany said it would agree to settle what it described as the debt for a discounted $2.85 million. But the family trust, now led by Lisa.Marie’s daughter, actress Riley Keough, did not view the debt as legitimate. That led Keough to court last week, declaring in a legal filing that the loan was a fiction, the company “a false entity” and the bid to sell Graceland a fraud. At a hearing Wednesday, the judge blocked any immediate foreclosure on Graceland, saying he needed to review more evidence. No one representing the Naussany company attended the hearing.When NYT sought clarification on the issue, the email writer wrote, “You don’t have to understand.” The writer was only keen on taking credit. “I am the one who creates trouble.”","The writer said he was an identity thief on the dark web.

North Korea's Kim supervises firing drills simulating preemptive attacks on South Korea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-koreas-kim-supervises-firing-drills-simulating-preemptive-attacks-on-south-korea/articleshow/110578335.cms,"NEW DELHI: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw firing drills involving nuclear-capable ""super-large"" multiple rocket launchers. The state media on Friday reported that these drills were intended to demonstrate North Korea 's capability for preemptive attacks on neighbouring South Korea .These firing exercises seem to refer to what South Korea identified as a barrage of ballistic missile test-launches conducted by North Korea on Thursday. Experts highlight that North Korea's large artillery rockets blur the lines between artillery systems and short-range ballistic missiles . This is because they generate their own thrust and are guided during flight.The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that the recent weapons tests are a clear indication of North Korea's determination to carry out a preemptive strike on South Korea if it feels threatened. Kim Jong Un stated that these drills ""will serve as an occasion in clearly showing what consequences our rivals will face if they provoke us.""KCNA accused South Korea of staging a ""clumsy counteraction of dangerous armed demonstration against the exercise of legitimate sovereign right"" of North Korea. This accusation was in reference to a South Korean aerial exercise conducted just hours before North Korea's unsuccessful spy satellite launch on Monday night. Had it succeeded, North Korea would have placed its second spy satellite into orbit.The multiple rocket launchers are a significant part of North Korea's arsenal aimed at South Korea. North Korea claims that the weapons fired from these launchers can carry tactical nuclear warheads.State media photos showed Kim Jong Un observing at least 18 projectiles being launched from trucks. South Korea's military had earlier reported that North Korea fired about 10 suspected ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast.The unsuccessful spy satellite launch by North Korea was strongly condemned by the US, South Korea, and others. The UN bans any satellite launches by North Korea, viewing them as a front for testing missile technologies. However, North Korea insists it has the right to conduct satellite launches and missile tests.In recent times, North Korea has been actively conducting weapons tests to enhance its nuclear capabilities, addressing what it perceives as growing US military threats. Foreign experts believe that North Korea aims to use its expanded nuclear arsenal to gain greater concessions from the US in future diplomatic engagements.(With inputs from agencies)","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw firing drills involving nuclear-capable ""super-large"" multiple rocket launchers.

"Biden allows Ukraine limited use of US arms to strike inside Russia, say US officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-allows-ukraine-limited-use-of-us-arms-to-strike-inside-russia-say-us-officials/articleshow/110578404.cms,"WASHINGTON/PRAGUE: President Joe Biden quietly has authorized Kyiv to launch US-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia that are supporting an offensive against the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv , four US officials said on Thursday.The decision marks a policy shift by Biden, who had steadfastly refused to allow Ukraine to use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia.Russia's embassy in Washington and Russia's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Biden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages.""The President recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,"" said one US official.Russia is building up forces near the northern part of the region, but it lacks the troop numbers to stage a major push, Ukraine's top commander said on Thursday.Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.It is the second time this year that Biden has quietly relaxed his policy on weapons supplies for Ukraine, bending to calls to send long-range missiles known as ATACMS to Kyiv.""The Biden administration has come a long way from their hypersensitivity to and misunderstanding of the risk of escalation,"" said Alexander Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former director for European affairs at the White House National Security Council under the Trump administration.He applauded the shift in Biden's policy, which he said ""unties Ukraine's hands.""""Of course it's the right move,"" Vindman said.The US is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its battle against the full-scale invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022.The officials said that US policy would continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range US-supplied weapons for deep strikes inside Russia.Biden's decision also does not mean the US now approves of drone attacks that Ukraine has been launching against Russian petroleum facilities, they said.Some NATO allies and US lawmakers have been calling on Biden to relax the restriction on US weapons to allow Ukraine to strike missile launchers and other military sites inside Russia that are backing Moscow's drive toward Kharkiv.Russia jetfighters flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defenses have been supporting the offensive by loosing highly precise glide bombs at Ukrainian defense lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.Putin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and he raised anew a risk of nuclear war.Some experts dismissed his remarks as bluster. They noted that Putin has failed to act on similar threats in the past and already has committed the bulk of his conventional forces to Europe's biggest land war since World War Two.""I don't think we can or should be bullied by Vladimir Putin,"" said US Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Is he really willing to risk nuclear war and a conflict with NATO?""Connolly co-signed a May 20 letter with Representative Michael Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and other lawmakers urging the Biden administration to allow Ukraine to use US weapons to hit strategic targets inside Russia.For some time, critics have urged NATO allies to relax restrictions on use of their weapons against military targets inside Russia. Those voices have grown within the alliance since Russia launched the Kharkiv offensive.Countries that have called for relaxing restrictions or done so for their own arms sent to Ukraine include Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Baltic states, Finland, Denmark, Germany and France.Biden faced the potentially embarrassing prospect that as he hosts a NATO summit in July, Russian forces would be advancing on Kharkiv and in Ukraine's east as the alliance marks its 75th anniversary, analysts said.",Biden had steadfastly refused to allow Ukraine to use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia. The decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region.

'I'm gonna kill all the Jews': Pakistan immigrant attempts to run down kids outside NYC school,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-gonna-kill-all-the-jews-pakistan-immigrant-attempts-to-run-down-kids-outside-nyc-school/articleshow/110563431.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a shocking incident on Wednesday, an unhinged driver attempted to mow down Orthodox students and a rabbi outside a Brooklyn Jewish school while allegedly shouting, ""I'm gonna kill all the Jews"".Video footage from the Flatbush Shomrim Safety Patrol captures the driver revving his engine and mounting the curb as he swerved toward Orthodox Jews outside the Yeshiva in Canarsie around 11.25am.As per a New York Post report, the alleged attacker, identified as 58-year-old Asghar Ali, a Pakistani immigrant and cab driver with a history of mental illness, is currently under investigation by the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force. Detectives interviewed Ali on Wednesday night.Ali faces more than a dozen charges, including attempted murder , attempted assault, and hate crimes charges. Police do not believe the attack is terror-related and have not found evidence linking him to radical groups online.The attack began as Ali, driving a 2011 white Crown Victoria, turned onto East 55th Street in front of the Mesivta Nachlas Yakov School and suddenly veered toward students in Orthodox attire. He then circled the block and returned, targeting two more students and a rabbi.“I’m gonna kill all the Jews,” Ali allegedly shouted, according to police. The victims managed to run into the building before being struck. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Authorities have listed five victims in the case: three 18-year-olds, a 41-year-old man, and a 44-year-old man.Rabbi Twersky, who works at the Yeshiva, described the chaos as the driver attempted to strike one of the boys at the corner of Glenwood Road and East 55th Street. Ali then drove up the wrong side of East 56th Street and barreled toward a group of 30 to 40 students.“I’m much more scared than they are — their adrenaline is up,” Twersky said.Tire marks on the sidewalk near the Yeshiva remained visible Wednesday night, with a police car stationed outside. Ali initially got away but was quickly located by the Shomrim Safety Patrol, who swarmed the area and found the attacker at a nearby Dunkin' Donuts, the NY Post report said.“We were able to retrieve the video footage. We got the guy’s plate number,” said Bob Moskowitz, executive coordinator of the patrol. “Obviously it was a very distinct car, a Crown Vic, an old model. You don’t see too many of those around.”Ali, who has lived in the US for over two decades, was taken into custody and transferred to Coney Island Hospital. He is considered an “emotionally disturbed” person with a prior arrest in 1998 for false personation. He has four prior arrests, including one for criminal impersonation, though details of the other arrests were not immediately clear.“We were very pleased to be able to apprehend this individual,” Moskowitz stated. “This is not somebody that we want driving around the streets, especially with this anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish climate that’s out there. So we were glad to be able to put this to rest. The community was kind of uptight about this. Now everybody can be a little more relaxed.”","Asghar Ali, 58, a Pakistani immigrant and cab driver with a history of mental illness, is currently under investigation by the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force.

"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down massive global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities.

NEW DELHI: After huge criticism worldwide, Israel has now retaliated by sharing its own image, 'Where were your eyes', questioning why people did not post about the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 . This came after celebrities, public figures, and countless social media users shared the AI-generated 'All eyes on Rafah ' image to highlight Israel's air strikes in Rafah, a city in war-ravaged Gaza.The Israeli air strike , aimed at destroying Hamas, resulted in the deaths of at least 45 civilians, including children, at a refugee camp in Rafah. The incident has sparked global outrage, however, while facing widespread criticism, Israel denied targeting the Rafah camp, claiming that the damage was caused by a secondary fire resulting from a rocket striking a Hamas weapons facility.The image shared by Tel Aviv, in response, highlights the attack on October 7 that claimed the lives of approximately 1,160 people in Israel, primarily civilians. The militants also took around 250 hostages, many of whom were freed during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes that 99 hostages remain alive in the militants' custody, while 31 have perished.Israel's retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has claimed at least 31,112 lives, according to the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza.The Israeli government , led by Benjamin Netanyahu , shared an image on X with the text ""Where were your eyes on October 7,"" depicting a Hamas militant standing in front of a baby.This response came shortly after the 'All eyes on Rafah' image went viral, with nearly 44 million users sharing it on Instagram.

Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif set to be re-elected as PML-N president after six years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/former-pakistan-pm-nawaz-sharif-set-to-be-re-elected-as-pml-n-president-after-six-years/articleshow/110488540.cms,"LAHORE: Three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is set to be re-elected as the President of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) party here on Tuesday, six years after losing the post following a Supreme Court ruling in the Panama Papers case. The Dawn newspaper reported that the General Council meeting is set to take place at a local hotel. It is likely that the 74-year-old veteran politician, who returned to Pakistan in October last year after a four-year self-imposed exile in the UK, will be elected unopposed even though as many as 11 party members have received the nomination papers for the top post, the report said.The PML-N had earlier announced convening the general council meeting on May 11 but it was postponed to coincide with the celebration of 26 years of Pakistan becoming a nuclear power, the report said.PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah, while addressing a press conference, hinted that the elder Sharif would be elected without a contest.Responding to a question if others were contesting against the former premier, Sanaullah said if any party member wanted to contest against him, they should come forward.When asked why the party didn't adopt a democratic process to vote for a new president, Sanaullah said the party was a ""servant of power corridors and it was Nawaz Sharif who made it a party of the public"". He added that after Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, it was Nawaz Sharif who ""made the party vibrant"".Replying to another question on why Nawaz Sharif wasn't active in politics after the February 8 general elections, Sanaullah said the former PM is not angry with anyone and he is active in the party. ""All major decisions of the party and government are taken by him,"" he added.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had earlier this month resigned as the PML-N president citing the ""unjust"" disqualification of the party supremo and his elder brother Nawaz Sharif from the PM Office.Shehbaz, 72, said that it was time for the latter to ""resume his rightful place as the president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party.""The February 8 general elections had delivered a fractured mandate and the PML-N did not get a clear majority. It joined hands with the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by Bilawal Zardari Bhutto and other smaller parties to form the government at the federal level when Nawaz relinquished the post of prime minister in favour of Shehbaz.Much before that, in 2017, Nawaz had stepped down as the country's prime minister after the Supreme Court disqualified him for life from holding public office for not declaring a receivable salary.Following his trial in the Panama Papers case, the apex court, in February 2018, disqualified the PML-N supremo as the party's president.",Nawaz Sharif is set to be re-elected as the President of the ruling PML-N party.

Pakistan PM Shehbaz calls some judges 'black sheep'; accuses them of giving relief to Imran Khan



(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from former US president Donald Trump , former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday claimed that the February national election was rigged , calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate.""Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, where he is being held in solitary confinement, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations and were being ""victimised.""Despite Khan's party winning the most seats in the February election, they fell short of a majority, allowing his opponent Shehbaz Sharif to form a government with the support of allied parties. The top court granted Khan permission to appear and plead petitions he had filed against amendments to the country's anti-graft laws.The Pakistan Muslim League (N) secured 75 seats, the Pakistan People's Party came third with 54 seats, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) has agreed to support them with 17 seats.Imran Khan's defense was similar to that of former US President Donald Trump who on several occasions has also claimed that the 2020 US elections were 'rigged' and 'stolen' by the democrats.Earlier today, a Pakistan court acquitted Imran Khan in two cases related to violence that occurred on May 9. The court cited a lack of sufficient evidence against the 71-year-old founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. The verdict was delivered by judicial magistrate Umar Shabbir of the district and sessions court of Islamabad, who approved the petition challenging the two cases filed at Shehzad Town police station.The court stated in its verdict: ""Because of insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution, the PTI founder has been acquitted.""Last year, following Khan's arrest in an alleged corruption case, his supporters engaged in vandalism targeting public property, including sensitive army installations. This is not the first time Khan has been acquitted in cases connected to the May 9 violence; on May 15, he was also cleared in two other related cases.Earlier, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday had accused some serving judges, whom he referred to as ""black sheep,"" of allegedly providing relief to Imran Khan in various cases.""Some black sheep in (the) judiciary are there to save Imran Niazi from 190 billion pounds and other cases. Every day, it is planned how to give him bail in certain cases,"" he said.Shehbaz made these allegations during a general council meeting of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), where his elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was re-elected as the party's president.","Imran Khan claims that the February national election was rigged, calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate"" Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations.

Hush money trial: Donald Trump is convicted on all 34 charges. Now what?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-trial-donald-trump-is-convicted-on-all-34-charges-now-what/articleshow/110577474.cms,"What happens now

The next step is for Judge Juan Merchan to approve the verdict and enter a final judgment. This is usually a formality. Sentencing typically follows within several weeks, but legal arguments can delay this process. Lawyers on both sides will recommend sentences, which will be debated at the sentencing hearing where Merchan will make a final decision.

Will Trump go to prison?

That is unlikely. While the maximum sentence for falsifying business records is four years in prison, it is rare for first-time offenders of this crime in New York to receive prison time. ""Punishments like fines or probation are more common,"" and alternatives like home confinement or curfews could be considered, given the logistical challenges of imprisoning a former president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.

Can Trump appeal the conviction?

Yes, Trump is expected to appeal. He may argue that the indictment was legally flawed and politically motivated. His defense will likely focus on several legal points, including that state election laws do not apply to federal elections and that the charges themselves were legally improper.

Could Trump still become president?

Yes, the US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years. Even if he were in jail, Trump could theoretically be sworn in as president on January 20, 2025.

Can Trump vote for himself?

Yes, as long as Trump is not imprisoned in New York, he can vote for himself. Florida defers to other states' rules on felony disenfranchisement, and in New York, felons regain their voting rights once they are out of prison, even if on parole.

Will Trump's conviction affect his campaign?

The conviction does not legally prevent Trump from running for or becoming president. The Republican National Convention, which will take place shortly after his sentencing, has no rules disqualifying a convicted nominee. Trump remains popular among the GOP base, and the party's leadership is aligned with him.

What are the broader implications of this conviction?

The conviction marks unprecedented territory in US politics, especially as Trump faces three other criminal cases. The Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts after deliberating for two days. The trial included explicit testimony and evidence that implicated Trump in approving a $130,000 payment to silence Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.

What are the next steps for Trump legally and politically?

Following his sentencing, Trump can appeal to higher courts. His defense team has already laid groundwork for appeals, citing potential judicial bias and procedural issues. Politically, Trump continues to rally support, painting the conviction as a politically motivated attack. Despite the legal challenges, leading strategists believe Trump remains a formidable candidate for the 2024 election.

There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box.""The White House was even less keen to get its hands dirty after the former occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was convicted on all 34 counts in his hush money case.""We respect the rule of law, and have no additional comment,"" Ian Sams, White House Counsel's Office spokesperson, said in a curt statement.From Biden himself there was no comment on Thursday.The president was at his home in Delaware on what was already a hugely significant day for him -- nine years to the day after his son Beau's death from brain cancer in 2015, aged 46.- 'Big deal' -In a normal US election year it would be game over if one's opponent was convicted in court, but 2024 is no normal campaign.Analysts said that while Trump's guilty verdict would energize his base of supporters and help him fundraise, it would be unlikely to significantly swing the dial in his favor.For his part, Biden will be hoping that the verdict can sway even a small number of independents or wavering voters who could be crucial in one of the closest White House races in living memory.""It helps Biden for this reason: I'm Joe Biden and I'm not a convicted felon,"" said Democratic strategist Rachel Bitecofer.But Biden will also be keen to avoid giving Trump ammunition for his baseless accusations that the trial was somehow ordered by the president.""These are uncharted waters,"" said David Karol, who teaches government and politics at the University of Maryland.""Definitely Democratic surrogates are going to talk about this a lot. For Biden it's a little trickier... he's wanted to avoid the impression that he is directing the prosecution of his opponent,"" Karol told AFP.Biden has largely avoided commenting on the case so far and will likely continue, instead letting Trump's conviction speak for itself, in an election that he's already framed as a fight for the future of American democracy.""I don't think this is the kind of thing that Biden needs to talk about to bring it to voters' attention. It's a big deal, it's historic,"" said Karol.But it may be hard for Biden -- who has previously joked about Trump falling asleep in his trial -- to resist any comment.Biden and Trump are due to face each other in their first televised debate on June 27 -- just over two weeks before Trump is set to be sentenced.""If they actually appear in a debate, I wouldn't be surprised if in the heat of the moment it comes up,"" said Karol.","Biden campaign stresses that Trump remains a dangerous threat as he eyes a comeback to the White House.

Hush money case: Former US President Donald Trump found guilty in New York criminal trial; sentencing set for July 11,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-us-president-donald-trump-held-guilty-in-new-york-criminal-trial/articleshow/110573549.cms,"NEW DELHI: Donald Trump was found guilty in a criminal trial on all 34 counts of falsifying documents to conceal a payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.The trial judge has set the date of sentencing for July 11, days before the Republicans are scheduled to officially choose him as the 2024 election nominee.The core of the allegations revolves around payments made to Trump's previous attorney, Michael Cohen , as compensation for a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The payment was made to ensure Daniels' silence regarding her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.According to the prosecution, the reimbursements were incorrectly recorded as ""legal expenses"" in an attempt to conceal the actual purpose of the transactions. The charges brought against Trump carry a potential sentence of up to four years in prison. However, Trump has maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty.The decision is historic as Trump is the first US president to be found guilty of a crime. The verdict was reached after two days of deliberations by the 12-member jury.This development comes as Trump, the Republican candidate , prepares to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the upcoming November 5 presidential election . Despite denying any wrongdoing, Trump is expected to appeal the verdict. The maximum sentence for his crime is four years in prison, although lesser penalties such as fines or probation are more common. Incarceration would not prevent him from campaigning or taking office if elected.According to Reuters/Ipsos polling, the guilty verdict could potentially cost Trump support from independent and Republican voters in what is currently a close race between him and Biden. The jury's decision came after a five-week trial that included explicit testimony from porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he denies.Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, testified that Trump approved a $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 election and a plan to reimburse Cohen through monthly payments disguised as legal work. Trump's lawyers questioned Cohen's credibility, highlighting his criminal record, imprisonment, and history of lying.Prosecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated the charge of falsifying business documents, normally a misdemeanor in New York , to a felony on the grounds that Trump was concealing an illegal campaign contribution. Trump complained that he could not receive a fair trial in his heavily Democratic hometown. This case, known as the ""zombie case"" because Bragg revived it after his predecessor chose not to bring charges, is considered the least consequential of the four criminal prosecutions Trump faces. It is also likely to be the only one to go to trial before the election, as the others are delayed by procedural challenges.If elected, Trump could potentially shut down the two federal cases accusing him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election loss and mishandling classified documents after leaving office in 2021. However, he would not have the power to stop a separate election-subversion case taking place in Georgia. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all the cases and has portrayed his legal troubles as an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to harm him politically.(With agency inputs)","Donald Trump found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying documents to conceal a payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.

It is more common in men and older adults.The expanded approval for Bristol's drug is based on data from a study that showed it helped clear all signs of cancer in 67.6% of MCL patients who had previously received two or more treatments.Breyanzi belongs to a class of treatments known as CAR-Ts and works by modifying white blood cells or T-cells to attack cancer. It is also approved for use in treatment of other types of blood cancers including large B-cell and follicular lymphoma.Bristol expects the addressable market for Breyanzi to roughly double after the recent approvals.To cater to higher demand arising from the approvals, the company is working on expanding its manufacturing capacity for its CAR-T therapies - Breyanzi and Abecma.""We continue to proactively expand our capacity to support increased patient demand and now have more than 100 treatment centers throughout the country certified to administer Breyanzi,"" said Lynelle Hoch, president, Cell Therapy Organization at Bristol.Hoch said the company would take bookings for the new indication within a day of the approval.Breyanzi, like other CAR-T therapies, comes with a serious warning about the risk of secondary malignancies, or cancers, in patients who use the drug.","Bristol Myers Squibb's Breyanzi is approved for mantle cell lymphoma.

The United Kingdom announced sanctions against her last month, citing corruption.At the center of an ongoing probe ordered by the president, is whether Among owns property in the UK that she did not declare to authorities.The State Department statement said those sanctioned are barred from entering the US.Among's husband and lawmaker Moses Magogo was also sanctioned.

The group had been working with insurance companies to offer its members Carry Guard policies that covered losses caused by firearms, even when the insured person intentionally killed or hurt somebody. Critics have called the policies ""murder insurance.""In an unusual alignment, the NRA was represented in the case by the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Biden administration argued some of its claims should go forward.The high court ruling favoring the NRA reverses a lower-court decision tossing out the gun rights group 's lawsuit against Vullo. The decision means the NRA's lawsuit can go forward, but it does not decide the merits of the claim. It also should not be read to shield the NRA and other advocacy groups from regulation, Sotomayor said.But, she wrote, the NRA's complaint ""plausibly alleges that Vullo threatened to wield her power against those refusing to aid her campaign to punish the NRA's gun-promotion advocacy. If true, that violates the First Amendment.""Vullo argued that she rightly investigated NRA-endorsed insurance policies. She said she did speak out about the risks of doing business with gun groups but didn't exert any improper pressure on companies, many of which were distancing themselves from the NRA on their own at the time.The NRA said Vullo leveraged a state investigation into the legality of NRA-endorsed insurance products to pressure insurance companies, saying she would go easier on them if they cut ties with the group.The products clearly violated state law, Vullo said, including by covering intentional acts and criminal defense costs. The probe started before the Parkland massacre, which left 17 people dead, and the insurance providers ultimately agreed to pay $7 million and $1.3 million fines.Vullo also sent out guidance letters to banks and insurance companies warning about the ""reputational risks"" of working with the NRA. The NRA said her words had significant sway because of her position and several companies cut ties with the group, costing it millions of dollars in revenue.Vullo said the letters were evenhanded, and her attorney argued that letting the lawsuit go forward would improperly muzzle public officials.","NRA sued a former New York state official over claims she pressured companies to blacklist it.

Hill could have to reimburse the expenses and face thousands of dollars or more in fines. And if the commission thinks she broke any laws, they can forward the information to prosecutors.A criminal investigation into whether Hill tampered with the Murdaugh jury or misused her office continues, the State Law Enforcement Division said Thursday.Hill resigned in March during the last year of her four year term, citing the public scrutiny of Murdaugh's trial and wanting to spend time with her grandchildren. She hasn't publicly addressed the ethics allegations and her lawyer didn't return a message Thursday.Murdaugh was convicted of killing his wife and younger son after a six-week trial in Colleton County last year.

Murdaugh is also serving decades in prison for admitting to stealing millions of dollars from settlements for clients who suffered horrible injuries or deaths and from his family's law firm.An initial appeal was denied, but the judge said she wasn't sure Hill told the truth about her dealings with jurors and was ""attracted by the siren call of celebrity.""The ethics allegations against Hill say she bought lunches for prosecutors and then paid herself back with county money. One count said she spent $543.89 for food and alcohol for a going away lunch for an employee in a local prosecutor's office.None of the allegations mention spending for public defenders or defense attorneys.Hill gave herself nearly $10,000 in bonuses from federal money that is meant to improve child support collection but has few rules on how it is spent, according to the complaint.The former clerk used public money to buy meals for her staff, her family, judges, court employees and others 36 times. She reimbursed herself for gifts bought for jurors and her staff on Valentine's Day and for her employees on Mother's Day, Father's Day and Easter, the complaint said.Expenses included $481 for a 50th birthday party for a staffer and dog food, bones and a pet bed for another, ethics officials said.In all, Hill is accused of spending nearly $20,000 in county money in ways she shouldn't, according to the complaint.","Former Colleton County Clerk of Court Becky Hill accused of giving herself bonuses and using county money to by dozens of lunches for her staff, prosecutors and a vendor. Hill struck a deal with a documentary maker to use the county courtroom in exchange for promoting her book on the trial. Hill resigned in March during the last year of her four year term.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110571295,imgsize-1377319,width-400,resizemode-4/110571295.jpg"

"Jury in Trump hush money trial resumes deliberations after rehearing instructions, testimony",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jury-in-trump-hush-money-trial-resumes-deliberations-after-rehearing-instructions-testimony/articleshow/110570627.cms,"NEW YORK: The jury in former president Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed deliberations Thursday after revisiting portions of the judge's instructions and rehearing testimony from multiple key witnesses about the alleged scheme at the heart of the history-making case. The judge responded to a jury request by rereading 30 pages of jury instructions related to how inferences may be drawn from evidence.The 12-person jury, which deliberated for about 4 1/2 hours Wednesday without reaching a verdict, also reheard testimony Thursday morning from a tabloid publisher and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer.It's unclear how long the deliberations will last. A guilty verdict would deliver a stunning legal reckoning for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to reclaim the White House while an acquittal would represent a major win for him and embolden him on the campaign trail.Since verdicts must be unanimous, it's also possible the case ends in a mistrial if the jury can't reach a consensus.In a memo Wednesday evening, Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles blasted the proceedings as a ""kangaroo court"" and argued the case would not matter in November.""The bottom line is this case doesn't have an impact on voters,"" they wrote.Trump, who on Wednesday appeared to be priming supporters for the possibility of a guilty verdict by saying that ""Mother Teresa couldn't bear these charges,"" struck a pessimistic tone again Thursday.""It's all rigged. The whole thing, the whole system is rigged,"" he said. It's the same language he used to try to inoculate himself against losses in the 2020 presidential election and Iowa's 2016 GOP primary.Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records at his company in connection with an alleged scheme to hide potentially embarrassing stories about him during his 2016 presidential election campaign.The charge, a felony, arises from reimbursements paid to then Trump lawyer Michael Cohen after he made a $ 130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to silence her claims that she and Trump had sex in 2006.Trump is accused of misrepresenting Cohen's reimbursements as legal expenses to hide that they were tied to a hush money payment.Trump has pleaded not guilty and contends the Cohen payments were for legitimate legal services. He has also denied the alleged extramarital sexual encounter with Daniels.To convict Trump, the jury would have to find unanimously that he created a fraudulent entry in his company's records or caused someone else to do so and that he acted with the intent of committing or concealing another crime.The crime prosecutors say Trump committed or hid is a violation of a New York election law making it illegal for two or more conspirators ""to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.""While the jurors must unanimously agree that something unlawful was done to promote Trump's election campaign, they don't have to be unanimous on what that unlawful thing was.The jurors, a diverse cross section of Manhattan residents and professional backgrounds often appeared riveted by testimony in the trial, including from Cohen and Daniels. Many took notes and watched intently as witnesses answered questions from prosecutors and Trump's lawyers.Jurors started deliberating after a marathon day of closing arguments in which a prosecutor spoke for more than five hours, underscoring the burden the district attorney's office faces in needing to establish Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.The Trump team need not establish his innocence to avoid a conviction but must instead bank on at least one juror finding that prosecutors have not sufficiently proved their case.In their first burst of communication with the court, jurors asked to rehear testimony from Cohen and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about an August 2015 meeting with Trump at Trump Tower, where the tabloid boss agreed to be the ""eyes and ears"" of his fledgling presidential campaign.Pecker testified that the plan included identifying potentially damaging stories about Trump so they could be squashed before being published. That, prosecutors say, was the beginning of the catch-and-kill scheme at the heart of the case.Jurors also want to hear Pecker's account of a phone call he said he received from Trump in which they discussed a rumor that another outlet had offered to buy former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story that she had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Trump has denied the affair.Pecker testified that Trump told him, ""Karen is a nice girl,"" and asked, ""What do you think I should do?"" Pecker said he replied: ""I think you should buy the story and take it off the market."" He added that Trump told him that he doesn't buy stories because they always get out and that Cohen would be in touch.The publisher said he came away from the conversation thinking Trump was aware of the specifics of McDougal's claims. Pecker said he believed the story was true and would have been embarrassing to Trump and his campaign if it were made public.The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., eventually paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story in an agreement that also included writing and other opportunities with its fitness magazine and other publications.The fourth item jurors requested is Pecker's testimony about his decision in October 2016 to back out of an agreement to sell the rights to McDougal's story to Trump through a company Cohen had established for the transaction, known as an ""assignment of rights.""""I called Michael Cohen, and I said to him that the agreement, the assignment deal, is off. I am not going forward. It is a bad idea, and I want you to rip up the agreement,"" Pecker testified. ""He was very, very, angry. Very upset. Screaming, basically, at me.""Pecker testified that he reiterated to Cohen that he wasn't going forward with the agreement.He said that Cohen told him: ""The boss is going to be very angry at you.""",Jurors want to rehear testimony from tabloid publisher and Trump's former lawyer. The 12-person jury deliberated for about 4 1/2 hours Wednesday without reaching a verdict. A guilty verdict would deliver a stunning legal reckoning for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110570825,imgsize-665255,width-400,resizemode-4/110570825.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A court in Pakistan has acquitted former Prime Minister Imran Khan in two cases related to the May 9 riots citing insufficient evidence.Khan's supporters, members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, were involved in vandalizing public property, including sensitive army installations, following his arrest in an alleged corruption case.The acquittal was granted by Judicial Magistrate Umar Shabbir of the district and sessions court of Islamabad. The court in its verdict said, ""Because of insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution, the PTI founder has been acquitted.""Back on May 15, Khan was also acquitted in two other cases related to the May 9 incidents. Judicial Magistrate Sahib Bilal approved Khan's plea challenging those cases, which had been filed at the Khanna police station in Islamabad. These cases were related to the long march and the violation of Article 144.Following Khan's detention, a large number of his followers and PTI workers vandalized several military installations. Targets included the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase, and the ISI building in Faisalabad. For the first time, the Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi was also attacked by the mob.Despite these acquittals, Khan, who is held in the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, faces multiple allegations connected to the violence that erupted after his arrest.","Imran Khan was acquitted in two cases related to the May 9 riots citing insufficient evidence.

Nawaz Sharif signals peace as India awaits new government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/nawaz-sharif-signals-peace-as-india-awaits-new-government/articleshow/110542804.cms,"NEW DELHI: While former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has in the past too accused his own country (read Pervez Musharraf ) of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999, his reiteration of the same on Tuesday is significant because of the timing. The elder Sharif, who is now the most powerful civilian leader in the country, spoke about Pakistan having sabotaged the agreement through its Kargil adventurism while taking back the reins of his ruling party after 6 years, and days before the outcome of the Indian elections.“Once Pakistan conducted five nuclear tests in reply to India’s [then Indian premier] Atal Bihari Vajpayee sahib came here and made a [peace] agreement with us ... but we violated it and it was our fault,” said Nawaz, after being re-elected PML-N president, according to the Dawn newspaper.Nawaz, whose brother Shehbaz Sharif is Pakistan PM, has long maintained that he learnt about Musharraf’s Kargil “misadventure” only from a phone call by his then counterpart A B Vajpayee and that the Pakistani military operation scuttled the peace process he had initiated with Vajpayee in the form of the Lahore Declaration early that year.The latest remarks by Nawaz, who has even otherwise been making favourable noises about ties with India, are seen as significant also because they come in the middle of Indian elections, and just before the results are declared on June 4. “It must be read as a significant signal from Pakistan’s currently most important civilian leader for India’s incoming government,” says former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria.Nawaz enjoys a strong rapport with Indian PM Narendra Modi and it was under him, in 2015, that the 2 countries last had a substantive bilateral engagement, although the comprehensive bilateral dialogue they launched to address all issues, including J&K and terrorism, was quickly undone by the Pathankot terrorist attack.The Sharif brothers may hope to break the deadlock in ties if the Modi government returns next week but, for India in that case, the onus will remain squarely on Islamabad to make the first move as it was Pakistan that recalled its high commissioner and called off trade ties, after India revoked the special status of J&K in 2019.There was a hint of some forward movement by Pakistan in March when foreign minister Ishaq Dar said Islamabad would seriously consider restoring trade ties with India. That Pakistan remains conflicted about ties with India was evident again when his own ministry quickly clarified there was no change in Pakistan’s position and that the responsibility to improve ties lied with India. Pakistan officially maintains that talks are possible only if India reverses its actions in Kashmir.No Indian government of course will accede to any such demand by Pakistan, except for working towards an early return to statehood as asked for by the Indian Supreme Court in a verdict last year that upheld the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state. For the Modi government, the judgment was an endorsement of its position that Pakistan is not a stakeholder in the internal administrative process of J&K. Pakistan of course maintains statehood and elections cannot be a substitute to the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination. Whether it can show any flexibility on the issue, without recourse to cross-border terrorism, may determine the road ahead if the Modi government indeed returns.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has accused his own country of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999.

His unopposed at the party’s general council meeting came on a day that was declared a public holiday by his younger brother, PM Shehbaz Sharif , to commemorate the 26anniversary of Pakistan’ nuclear tests , conducted during Nawaz Sharif’s second term as PM.Pakistan conducted the tests on May 28, 1998, almost three weeks after India tested its devices, in Chaghi hills of southwestern Balochistan province, making it the seventh nuclear nation in the world and the first Muslim state to have a nuclear arsenal.While Nawaz was at peak of his popularity in May 1998, he could not celebrate the first anniversary of the nuclear tests following his ouster from office in Oct 1998 by General Pervez Musharraf in a military coup.The anniversary is being commemorated for the first time in 26 years, coinciding with his re-election as PML-N president . He took the party’s reins back from Shehbaz, who had stepped down on May 13, paving the way for the 74-year-old party founder, to be elected again.Shehbaz hailed Nawaz, who returned to Pakistan in Oct 2023 after a four-year self-imposed exile in UK, for the nuclear tests, which he said ensured “credible minimum deterrence”. In a post on X, he said: “On this historic day in 1998, then-PM Nawaz Sharif demonstrated bold leadership by rejecting nerve-wracking pressures and inducements to make Pakistan a nuclear-armed nation.” He also paid tribute to ex-prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who, he said, was the founder of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, for his “strategic foresight and unwavering commitment to the cause”.Shehbaz was elected PML-N president in March 2018, months after the Supreme Court disqualified Nawaz for life in the Panama Papers case. Weeks later, an apex court bench also barred from heading a political party.","Pakistan conducted the tests on May 28, 1998, almost three weeks after India tested its devices.

The tobacco industry 's targeting of youth is rampant across our member states. As a result, we have a very worrying 11 million adolescents using various tobacco products. Coupled with the approximate 411 million adult tobacco users, our region, unfortunately, has the highest number of adolescent and adult users globally,"" Wazed said in a statement.The tobacco industry lures youths by aggressively introducing new nicotine and tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products, which are becoming increasingly popular among the youths in the region, she said.This multibillion-dollar industry recruits new tobacco users to reward their investors with even more profits. To achieve this, it preys on children and adolescents through marketing tactics, targeting them with new products, Wazed stated.""It is worrying that children and adolescents are regularly exposed to the digital marketing of tobacco products. This is despite having policies and regulations in place to prevent this,"" she said.""This situation is likely to get worse, as youngsters spend more time on social media and other similar platforms,"" Wazed said, highlighting that personalised and targeted advertising by the industry appears to dominate here, exposing them to harm.This year's theme for World No Tobacco Day is 'Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference'.The tobacco industry is fast to launch new products, using every means to expand market share before the regulations can catch up, she said.It continues to oppose evidence-based measures, such as increases in excise taxes, and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorships. The companies even threaten legal action against governments that try to protect the health of their citizens, the WHO regional director added.Wazed pointed out that the response from governments and institutions lags in the matter.""Our efforts are complicated by the rapid changes in the marketing strategies of the tobacco industry,"" she said, emphasising that the relevant provisions of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) '? including Article 5.3 '? should be implemented in letter and spirit.Also, necessary tools and support are urgently needed to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the WHO FCTC recommendations in 'online' settings, she added.""Our goal for our youth is clear. We want to prevent and reduce tobacco consumption, nicotine addiction, and exposure to new tobacco products. To do this, we need a multi-stakeholder approach to frame and implement legislation, policies, regulations and administrative measures,"" the WHO's South-East Asia director said.""This approach needs to cast a wide net. We should engage with all relevant government departments, UN and intergovernmental organisations, civil society, the private sector, academia, and the community, including students, teachers and parents,"" she added.A generational tobacco ban, leading to a ""tobacco-free generation"" would be a huge step forward for the region, Wazed stressed, adding, ""For this to happen, the WHO FCTC must be recognized as a legally binding international instrument by all our member states.
