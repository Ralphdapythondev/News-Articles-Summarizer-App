One of those relatives, Paul Guard, mostly blames the conflict raging in eastern Ukraine a decade ago for the missile attack that killed 38 Australian citizens and permanent residents including his parents, Toowoomba doctors Roger and Jill Guard.""I don't think anyone intended to bring down a passenger plane. So in that sense, I'm heartbroken that the conflict continues,"" Paul Guard told Australian Broadcasting Corp.""But I think that a lot of families would really have just liked an acknowledgement that what happened was wrong and that Russia should not have been waging war,"" the son added.The conflict has since escalated into a full-scale war with Russia's invasion of its smaller neighbour in February 2022.The pro-Russia rebel-held border region from where a Soviet-era Buk surface-to-air missile was fatefully launched and the fields where much of the debris landed after the Boeing 777 disintegrated is now territory controlled by the Russian military.Moscow has repeatedly denied responsibility for MH17 's destruction and refused to hand over two Russians and a Ukrainian convicted by a Dutch court in absentia in 2022 of murder.Russia continues to be pursued under international law by the Netherlands through in the European Court of Human Rights and by Australia and the Netherlands jointly through the International Civil Aviation Organization Council, or ICAO, over its alleged role in bringing down MH17.Australian foreign minister Penny Wong told Wednesday's service she was ""appalled"" that Russia had withdrawn from the ICAO proceedings in June.""The case will continue and we will not be deterred in our commitment to hold Russia to account,"" Wong told the gathering that included foreign diplomats.""Today, on behalf of the Australian government, I recommit again to our collective pursuit of truth, justice and accountability for the outrages perpetrated on 17th July, 2014,"" she added.A commemoration is also planned in the Netherlands later Wednesday at a monument near Schiphol Airport, from where MH17 left on its way to the Malaysian city of Kuala Lumpur.Australian Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus will represent Australia at that monument, were 298 trees were planted to commemorate each victim and sunflowers like those that grew at the crash site.He expected the Netherlands-Australia case against Russia would be back before the ICAO in October despite Moscow's withdrawal.""We won't let this go until we've brought Russia to account,"" Dreyfus said.The Netherlands was home to 196 victims. As well as Australia, victims also came from Malaysia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, the Philippines, Canada, New Zealand, Vietnam, Israel, Italy, Romania, the United States and South Africa.An international investigation initiated in the UN Security Council by the Netherlands, Malaysia and Australia concluded that the Buk missile system that destroyed MH17 belonged to the Russian 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. The investigation concluded the missile was driven into Ukraine from a Russian military base near the city of Kursk and returned there after the plane was shot down.Tony Abbott was Australia's prime minister when MH17 was shot down. Abbott recalled on Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin became physically aggressive when the Australian raised MH17 and the Ukraine conflict on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' summit in Beijing in 2014.Putin said through an interpreter that Ukrainians were all fascists, had brought down MH17 themselves and that Ukraine had no right to exist, Abbott said.""Then as we were going back into the conference - and this was really quite an extraordinary thing - he suddenly turned, grabbed the elbows and tried to shake me and then pushed me away. And he said in English, where he's quite fluent: Look, you are not a native Australian but I am a native Russian,' and pushed me away,"" Abbott told ABC.""I think what he was trying to say to me in his own rather blunt and brutal way was that how could I as a citizen of a settler society understand the blood and soil and mystical attachment that he had to every last inch of Mother Russia?"" Abbott said.""So it was pretty obvious to me right back then what he was on about. I just think it's a pity that more wasn't done to arm up the Ukrainians in the meantime,"" Abbott added.",Relatives of MH17 victims gather at Australia's Parliament House to mark 10th anniversary of tragedy. 38 Australian citizens and permanent residents were killed in the missile attack over eastern Ukraine.

The broader market was down around 0.4%.TSMC is spending billions building new factories overseas, including $65 billion on three plants in the US state of Arizona, though it says most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan.Taiwan also has a backlog worth some $19 billion of arms deliveries from the United States, which US officials and politicians have repeatedly pledged to speed up.Since 2022, Taiwan has complained of delays in deliveries of US weapons such as Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, as manufacturers focused on supplying Ukraine to help it battle invading Russian forces.In April, the US Congress had passed a sweeping foreign aid package which includes arms support for the island, after House Republican leaders abruptly switched course and allowed a vote on the $95 billion in mostly military aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and US partners in the Indo-Pacific.","US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Taiwan should pay the United States for its defence.

Spotlight-shy but key player

Happy interfaith couple

Usha Vance , 38, would be the possible first Indian American second lady, if Donald Trump and her husband J D Vance win the Nov 5 election. She would be the first Hindu spouse of a vice-president.Friends from her childhood described her as a “leader” and a “bookworm”. Brainy, ambitious and pragmatic, she moved from an extracurricular-studded four years at Yale, where she got a bachelor’s degree in history, to Cambridge, where she earned a master of philosophy degree, and moved in liberal and left-wing circles.As of 2014, she was a registered Democrat. Now a corporate litigator at a prestigious San Francisco law firm, Usha has clerked for Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he was an appeals court judge. It’s a conspicuous resume for a woman whose husband gave a speech in 2021 titled “The Universities are the Enemy”.Usha has played a quiet but key role in her husband’s rise. At Yale, she helped Vance organise his ideas about social decline in rural white America, which formed the basis of his memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy”. And she made rare but well-choreographed appearances with Vance as he sought the Ohio Senate seat. In an interview last month, Usha, who mostly stays out of the spotlight, sounded a note of ambivalence about the prospect of her husband running for V-P. “I’m not raring to change anything about our lives..., but I believe in JD.”Vance has said his wife “is not a Christian” but was “very supportive” of his deepening faith. Asked about the challenges of an interfaith marriage, Usha said, “There are a lot of things we agree on, I think, especially when it comes to family life, how to raise our kids. So I think the answer really is, we just talk a lot.”(With inputs from NYT & PTI)","Usha Vance, 38, would be the possible first Indian American second lady, if Donald Trump and her husband J D Vance win the Nov 5 election.

How JD Vance won over Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-jd-vance-won-over-donald-trump/articleshow/111797507.cms,"Vance stance

The Debate Moment

The East Palestine Visit

The Decision

The meeting got off to a bad start.JD Vance walked into Donald Trump 's office at Mar-a-Lago on a warm winter afternoon in February 2021. The former president had a thick stack of papers on his desk: printouts of Vance's copious broadsides against Trump. Vance's past criticisms had included an essay in one of Trump's least favorite magazines, The Atlantic, where Vance described Trump as ""cultural heroin"" -- a purveyor of false promises to the white working class.Trump, using an expletive, bluntly told Vance: You said some nasty stuff about me. The discussion that followed was described in detail by two people with knowledge of the meeting who insisted on anonymity to talk about a private conversation.Vance's next move was crucial. This was the first time he was meeting Trump, and Vance needed the former president to like him or at least leave the meeting with an open mind. Vance -- the author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" a best-selling memoir about his troubled upbringing and the struggles and pathologies of the white working class -- was running for the open U.S. Senate seat in Ohio as a Republican populist, a Never Trumper turned pro-Trumper.Vance decided to immediately apologize. He told Trump that he had bought into what he described as media lies and that he was sorry he got it wrong. Of all people, Vance told Trump, Vance himself should have understood.Trump agreed, telling Vance that he should have understood because Vance had written the ""Hillbilly Elegy"" book. His implication was that Vance should have supported him because Trump's own base of non-college-educated voters angry about globalization, immigration and foreign wars were exactly the people Vance purported to represent.At that point, Trump seemed disarmed, and the meeting went on for almost two hours. They discussed the 2020 election and the Ohio race, but mostly they talked about the difficulties of politics. It had been less than a month since Trump left the White House a pariah, in the wake of a pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol after the president had spent two months lying about a stolen election.Trump closed the conversation by asking Vance what he wanted. Trump told him that everyone else had already been down to Mar-a-Lago begging for his endorsement -- a reference to Vance's potential opponents in the Ohio Senate primary.Vance, who along with a spokesperson for Trump declined to comment for this article, told the former president he wasn't going to do that.Trump, surprised, asked Vance if he wanted the endorsement.Vance said that of course he wanted it, but that Trump should let him run his race, and see how he did. Vance said he would not be the type of candidate who would attack the former president when the media came after him.Trump seemed intrigued. All right, Trump replied, telling Vance, whom he called JD, to take care and check in from time to time.Trump had relatively little personal contact with Vance after that first meeting, but he took note as Vance kicked off his Senate campaign in July 2021, ran circles around his primary opponents in debates and became a frequent presence on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" at the time the top-rated show on cable television.Trump was impressed. He told allies he thought Vance was smart and handsome -- ""those beautiful blue eyes,"" he'd say repeatedly -- great on TV and a killer at the debates. Trump, who split with allies at the influential conservative group Club for Growth in backing Vance, felt validated when Vance won the general election against his Democratic rival, Rep. Tim Ryan, and then immediately became one of Trump's most vocal supporters in the Senate.When Trump announced his third campaign for president, in November 2022, at a time when most Republicans wanted nothing to do with him, Vance distinguished himself by immediately signaling to Trump's staff that Vance was all in.Since then, Vance has played his cards nearly perfectly, making himself visible at key moments, promoting himself assertively but not too much, publicly backing Trump during his Manhattan criminal trial and having the right people champion him to the former president at the right time.That day in early 2021, Vance was ushered into Trump's office at Mar-a-Lago by one of the most secretive donors in GOP politics: Peter Thiel, the billionaire founder of PayPal who broke with Silicon Valley to support Trump for president in 2016. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was at the meeting, too.Though initially skeptical of Vance's loyalty, Donald Trump Jr. became close friends with him over the course of the Senate campaign. He became a huge asset when allies of Vance's rivals for running mate tried desperately to undermine Vance with a pressure campaign aimed at changing the elder Trump's mind.Now, the 39-year-old Vance has become the party's vice-presidential nominee.An experienced fighter in the modern culture wars, Vance is in many ways a different type of running mate from the one Trump selected in 2016: Mike Pence was a Ronald Reagan conservative and evangelical governor whose penchant for spontaneous prayer unnerved the man under whom he served. In Vance, Trump is picking someone whose impulses for fighting against existing institutions and challenging global systems match his own.Yet the arc of how Trump made his choices in 2016 and in 2024 had similarities. He had described both Pence and Vance as ""out of central casting."" Then Trump began to question his options and solicited the opinions of everyone he spoke to, before ultimately returning where he began.But the lead-up to Trump's selection of Vance was even more chaotic than it was with Pence. It was uncertain down to the final hours, with a frantic lobbying effort until the last possible moment by anti-Vance forces, including Rupert Murdoch and his allies, with some of it playing out in public.Trump seemed uncertain right until the end, privately raising some of the negative comments Vance had made about him in the past. Allies of Vance, including Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson, ran a counter campaign to reassure Trump about the selection, with supportive calls to the former president continuing until the moment Trump finally told Vance of his decision, on Monday afternoon, less than half an hour before he announced his choice on social media.Six months into his Senate campaign, Vance was seen by most as the walking dead.Throughout the fall of 2021, he was savaged in the Ohio Republican Senate primary by television commercials that re-aired his past condemnations of Trump. Vance's support fell precipitously in private polling, and even Trump privately voiced concerns about the impact the ads were having in the race. Many Republican operatives believed Vance's chances of surviving the onslaught were close to zero.He began his comeback on a debate stage.At a March 2022 debate among the crowded Senate Republican field, Vance's two main rivals -- Josh Mandel, a former Ohio state representative and treasurer, and the businessman Mike Gibbons -- nearly came to blows on the stage.Vance seized the moment. He described their fight as ""ridiculous"" and confronted Mandel for using Mandel's military service as a ""political football"" earlier in the debate, calling it ""disgraceful,"" setting off a burst of applause in the room. The moment presaged Vance as a deft performer on his feet, one who would eventually eviscerate his general election rival, Ryan, on the debate stage.Trump relished that primary debate confrontation and felt that it showed Vance had what it took. Trump has always paid close attention to debate performances, crediting his own showing in the 2016 debates for his victory over Hillary Clinton. He told allies he liked what he'd seen from Vance. One month after the debate, Trump formally endorsed him.Trump announced his own candidacy for president a week after the November 2022 midterms.His campaign launch was a disaster.High-profile MAGA candidates endorsed by Trump had lost midterm races they should have won. Trump was blamed for the disappointing results, and most Republican elected officials stayed away from his presidential kickoff event at Mar-a-Lago.Shortly after he announced his campaign, Trump ignited a string of controversies, including calling for the termination of parts of the Constitution to overturn his 2020 defeat and dining with Kanye West, a rapper whose stream of vitriol against Jews stirred outrage, and Nick Fuentes, a notorious white supremacist.Trump found himself abandoned by many in the Republican-leaning media, with Fox News extolling his main presidential primary rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, and his favorite newspaper, The New York Post, giving DeSantis the headline title: ""DeFuture."" A chorus of prominent conservatives was saying it was time for fresh blood.Vance was not among them.He signaled privately to Trump's team, shortly after the midterms, that he planned to endorse the former president. He said he wanted to make an intellectual argument for Trump that would resonate with the donor class and other elites, according to a person briefed on the exchanges. He ended up announcing his endorsement in late January 2023 in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, praising Trump's foreign policy. The proactive support was reassuring to the Trump team amid so many threatened defections at a time when the campaign seemed rudderless.The Trump campaign found its direction a month later, in February. It started with a visit to a derailment site of a train that had been carrying hazardous chemicals through East Palestine, Ohio.President Joe Biden and his advisers had been criticized for days for not visiting the site, and Vance was among the most vocal critics of the federal response. Biden's administration blamed policy rollbacks from Trump's era for the derailment.Trump's son Don Jr. soon had a thought: What if his father visited the site? He ran the idea past both Vance and Trump's top adviser, Susie Wiles, and a plan was soon in place. Flying aboard his plane, dubbed Trump Force One, from Florida to Ohio for the event, Trump was watching Fox News. Vance was on the air. The former president turned to his son and observed that Vance had been ""incredible, hasn't he?"" -- using an expletive to underscore the point.When the plane landed, it was clear that Trump was stepping into a media vacuum created by Biden's absence. Walking down the movable stairs from his plane on the tarmac, Trump appeared on the extensive television coverage as if he were still president.By the fall of 2023, chatter was growing that Vance was a top contender to be Trump's running mate. But while advisers to both men had discussed the possibility informally, it had not become a topic of conversation between Trump and Vance.Vance was slow to believe Trump would actually pick him as a running mate, people close to him said. His view started to change around the New Hampshire presidential primary in late January, as he campaigned for Trump in the state and drew a warm response.Vance's allies began an aggressive strategy to show he could be successful in two areas that preoccupied Trump: performing well in adversarial interviews on mainstream news channels, and bringing in new financial supporters.Vance's advisers booked him on a slew of shows on CNN, NBC, ABC and CBS, including one appearance that caught Trump's eye, with the CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, shortly after Trump was convicted in his Manhattan criminal trial. Vance was the first vice-presidential hopeful to show up in court to support Trump, and he stepped up his aggressive televised defense of Trump after the conviction.Vance helped pave the way for Trump with some Silicon Valley donors. He spent months working on David Sacks, an entrepreneur whom Vance has called ""one of his closest confidants in politics,"" to support Trump. That effort resulted in a $12 million event for the Trump campaign. Sacks said at the event that it ""would never have happened"" without Vance's support, according to a person familiar with his remarks.Musk, one of the world's richest men and the owner of the website X, has emerged as a quiet ally of Vance's, according to two people briefed on the relationship. Musk has viewed Biden's reelection as an existential crisis for the nation and told Trump directly that he should choose Vance as his running mate, describing the Trump-Vance pairing as ""beautiful,"" according to one of the people with knowledge of their relationship. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.Yet it was Don Jr. and his allies who pushed Vance most insistently -- publicly and privately.For most of the year, Trump's associates have said that the former president was not especially enamored of any of his VP choices, doubtful that any of them would make much of a difference to his chances in November. And yet in recent weeks, he told people that he liked the idea of someone who could carry on his MAGA legacy, something Trump believed the two other top contenders -- Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota -- were not as well positioned as Vance to accomplish.Trump continued playing Hamlet of sorts, polling nearly everyone he encountered about what they thought he should do.The anti-Vance campaign was intense, widespread and carried right up until the final hours before Trump announced his choice. Several major Republican donors, including the hedge fund magnate Ken Griffin, as well as the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, tried to persuade Trump not to choose Vance. (A Griffin spokesperson wouldn't address what he told Trump, saying only that there were a number of good options and that Trump and his team had been ""thoughtful."")Murdoch even went so far as to dispatch senior executives and columnists at The New York Post to meet with Trump and dissuade him from picking Vance. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's 2016 campaign manager who is also close to Melania Trump , argued privately that other options, such as Rubio, were better, according to several people with knowledge of her outreach effort.The Murdoch crowd lobbied aggressively for Burgum, in private and in editorials in The New York Post. When the anti-Vance forces made their arguments to Trump, they focused on Vance's prior criticisms of the former president and on Vance's youth and inexperience. But in many cases, these GOP donors were motivated because they loathed Vance's ideology and policy positions, especially his staunch opposition to U.S. support for Ukraine against Russia.Old comments made by Vance about Trump began to circulate on social media, and were put in front of the former president, who indicated to associates that they had given him pause.But Trump was repelled by a Daily Mail article describing Burgum weeping at various moments -- ""When I see a man cry I view it as a weakness,"" he once said. Allies also brought to Trump's attention the fact that Burgum had signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, a point that could become a liability in a general election.Trump told associates that he viewed Rubio as disloyal for having campaigned in 2016 against Rubio's friend and mentor, Jeb Bush, and wondered whether he could be trusted.In the final days, all three leading candidates made direct pitches to Trump.Burgum let it be known that he had no interest in serving in another role in the Trump administration, a stance that did not play well with Trump, who had mused about making him the secretary of energy, according to two people briefed on the matter.Vance was flown to Mar-a-Lago late last week aboard the plane of Steve Witkoff, a real estate investor and one of Trump's few close friends.When word got back to Tucker Carlson a few weeks ago that Trump might be wavering on Vance, he intervened. Carlson, who was visiting Australia on a speaking tour, phoned Trump and delivered an apocalyptic warning, according to two people briefed on their conversation. He told Trump that Rubio could not be trusted -- that he would work against him and would try to lead America into nuclear war. Carlson, who declined to comment for this article, told Trump that Burgum could not be trusted, either.","JD Vance was running for the open U.S. Senate seat in Ohio as a Republican populist.

Although this wasn't surprising, as she had previously stated her intention to vote for him and released her convention delegates to support him, her affirmation was met with resounding applause.She then focused on persuading her supporters, even those who had backed her long after Trump had secured the nomination, to support the candidate she had once harshly criticized.""You don't have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him. Take it from me,"" she said. ""I haven't always agreed with President Trump. But we agree more than we disagree.""Haley further added, ""I will start by making one thing perfectly clear. Donald Trump has my strong endorsement.""Talking about the contrasting situations during the presidencies of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Donald Trump. Haley pointed out, ""When Barack Obama was president, Vladimir Putin invaded Crimea. When Joe Biden was president, Putin invaded all of Ukraine. But when Donald Trump was president, Putin did nothing. No invasion no wars.""Haley attributed this difference to Trump's perceived toughness, suggesting that Putin refrained from attacking Ukraine due to Trump's strong leadership. She emphasised that a strong president focuses on preventing wars rather than starting them.The remainder of her speech addressed foreign policy, immigration, and crime, while also taking jabs at Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. The crowd booed whenever she mentioned their names. While her speech may not have been sufficient to completely mend the damage her campaign caused among Trump's loyal supporters, it was a crucial beginning if she intends to have a future in Republican politics.Her address marked a gradual easing of tensions between Haley and Trump following a contentious, yearlong campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.The speech, a collaborative effort between Haley and the Trump campaign, was approved by Republican convention officials and represents Haley's most recent attempt to unify the party behind her former competitor.Throughout her campaign earlier, Haley had urged GOP voters to support her to avoid the ""chaos"" that she believed accompanied the former president.Despite losses in New Hampshire and her home state of South Carolina, Haley resisted calls to withdraw from the race and endorse Trump. Instead, she intensified her criticisms of the former president and his age, often highlighting polls that suggested she would perform better than Trump against President Joe Biden in a general election. Additionally, Haley warned that Trump's legal issues would likely dominate the campaign cycle.","Haley was met with scattered boos at the Republican convention.

"Term limits, ethics code: US President Biden eyes Supreme Court reforms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/term-limits-ethics-code-us-president-biden-eyes-supreme-court-reforms/articleshow/111795557.cms,"US President Joe Biden is seriously considering implementing term limits for US Supreme Court justices and establishing an enforceable ethics code . This move is in response to mounting concerns over accountability for the justices.These proposals would mark a significant shift for Biden, who has traditionally resisted calls for reforming the high court.He has grown increasingly vocal about the court’s current trajectory, which he feels is departing from mainstream constitutional interpretation , as per the Associated Press sources.The most significant changes Biden is considering would require approval from Congress, a challenging prospect given its division. Nonetheless, Biden's proposals may energize his voter base, particularly given his potential 2024 Republican rival, Donald Trump 's, boasts about appointing three conservative justices during his tenure. Biden is also contemplating a constitutional amendment to remove the broad immunity for presidents recently affirmed by the court. This arises after Trump claimed immunity from prosecution for his actions on January 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol.Biden's considerations follow increasing frustration among Democrats over recent Supreme Court decisions that overturned longstanding precedents on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers. Moreover, questions about the court's ethics have surged following revelations about justices, including Clarence Thomas, who accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor.In a recent interview with BET, Biden predicted, ""there are probably going to be two more appointments"" within the next four years as justices retire. He criticized Trump for nominating three conservative justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, adding, ""Just imagine if he has two more appointments, what that means.""The Supreme Court has not yet commented on these proposals.In a conversation with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Biden mentioned, ""And by the way, I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out. I don’t want to prematurely announce it, but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court and what we do and – I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help.""Public sentiment appears to support such changes. According to a 2022 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, about 2 in 3 Americans favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices.A separate June survey revealed that confidence in the court remains low, with 4 in 10 US adults saying they have hardly any confidence in the people running the Supreme Court. Additionally, 7 in 10 Americans believe the justices are more influenced by ideology, while only about 3 in 10 think the justices provide an independent check on other government branches by being fair and impartial.In November, the Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics. However, this policy, agreed to by all nine justices, does not seem to impose significant new requirements and leaves compliance up to each justice.Republicans have long focused on reshaping the federal judiciary and Supreme Court. Former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, notably refused to meet with Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland in 2016, stalling the nomination until Trump assumed office. Trump ultimately succeeded in appointing three Supreme Court justices and 54 federal appeals court judges, significantly altering the judiciary for a generation.Democrats have recently begun to grasp the power of judicial appointments as a political tool. Biden has prioritized judicial nominations , setting a record for appointments at this point in his first term, including some of the judiciary's most diverse picks. He often highlights these accomplishments during his reelection campaign, but Democratic activists are urging him to take further action.Trump criticized Biden’s potential move on his Truth Social platform, stating, ""The Democrats are attempting to interfere in the Presidential Election, and destroy our Justice System, by attacking their Political Opponent, ME, and our Honorable Supreme Court. We have to fight for our Fair and Independent Courts, and protect our Country.""","US President Joe Biden is seriously considering implementing term limits for US Supreme Court justices and establishing an enforceable ethics code.

Nevada county reverses controversial vote and certifies two recounts while legal action looms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nevada-county-reverses-controversial-vote-and-certifies-two-recounts-while-legal-action-looms/articleshow/111795761.cms,"RENO: Commissioners in Nevada's second most populous county certified the results of two local recounts on Tuesday, reversing course on a controversial vote against certification that spurred legal action and put Washoe County in unchartered legal territory.The 4-1 vote overturns a rare move against certifying election recount results from last month's primary in the politically mixed swath of Reno and northern Nevada that had potential implications for how the November elections could play out in one of the nation's most important swing counties.Nevada secretary of state Cisco Aguilar and attorney general Aaron Ford are still waiting for the state supreme court to address a petition they filed last week that seeks to confirm the legal obligations of county commissioners to certify election results. While it is unclear if or when the court will take that up, a ruling could set precedent and apply to county commissions statewide who refuse to certify results in November.Aguilar had said that the circumstances of last week's vote could set ""a dangerous precedent"" that undermines the confidence of voters.Moments before Tuesday's redo of the vote, the county's chief deputy district attorney, Mary Kandaras, recommended that the commissioners certify the vote to follow state law.Once seen as a mundane and ministerial task, election certification has become a pressure point since the 2020 election. During the midterms two years later, a scenario similar to what is unfolding in Washoe County played out in New Mexico after that state's primary, when a rural county delayed certification of the results and relented only after the secretary of state appealed to the state's supreme court.Two Republican Washoe County commissioners, Jeanne Herman and Mike Clark, have consistently voted against certifying results and are supported by the wider far-right movement within the county that promotes election conspiracy theories .But on Tuesday, Clark apologized to his constituents before changing his vote in favor of certification. He said he made the vote after being advised that the commission's certification is not discretionary. He said his vote came ""under extreme duress under the threat of both my position, and prosecution."" Throughout the meeting, he doubled down on his mistrust of the county's election tallies.""I'm not going to call it a vote, because it isn't a vote,"" he said before voting in favor of certifying the recount results. ""We're compelled and we have to.""Republican Commissioner Clara Andriola, who the far-right movement had targeted in the primaries, also reversed course on Tuesday. She has often been the swing vote in election votes - rejecting the label of election denier and thanking the county elections department, while alleging that several ""hiccups"" in the process called for more governmental bodies to look at county elections processes.On Tuesday, Andriola said that she has more recently met with the county's interim registrar of voters, who gave her more confidence in how elections are run in Washoe County. She also spoke with the county district attorney's office, who she said made it clear that the commission's duty is to certify election results without discretion.""Our responsibility is to follow the law,"" Andriola said.The local far-right movement has been on full display at commission meetings, where conspiracy theories about voting machines and distrust of election administrators have become a mainstay during the commission's public comment sections and have led to harassment and high turnover in the local election office the past four years.Amidst the rapid election staff turnover, the county elections department has also made certain administrative mistakes, like sending mail ballots to voters who had opted out of receiving them and misprinting certain local sample ballots, though none that affect tabulation.On Tuesday, most commenters urged the commissioners to not certify the results. Some repeated false claims of stolen elections, broken machines and a ""cabal"" within the county that undermines elections. Others called for a hand recount or a complete redo of the election.One commenter printed out pictures of city and county employees that she accused of corruption. Several times, commission chair Alexis Hill threatened to go into a recess when public comments were interrupted or delved into calling out individuals, rather than the board itself. A few commenters had urged commissioners to certify the vote.""Stand your ground, stay the course. You showed backbone last week. Don't lose it now,"" said Bruce Parks, the chairman of the Washoe GOP that falsely alleged Joe Biden did not win the 2020 election.","Commissioners in Nevada's second most populous county certified the results of two local recounts on Tuesday, reversing course on a controversial vote against certification. The 4-1 vote overturns a rare move against certifying election recount results from last month's primary in the politically mixed swath of Reno and northern Nevada.

'Politics got too heated': US President Joe Biden returns to campaigning in Nevada following Trump's assassination bid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/politics-got-too-heated-us-president-joe-biden-returns-to-campaigning-in-nevada-following-trumps-assassination-bid/articleshow/111792590.cms,"President Joe Biden returned to the campaign trail in Nevada on Tuesday with a speech to a crowd of black voters majorly at the NAACP national convention . It was his first political address since the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump .Biden expressed gratitude for Trump’s well-being, calling for a crucial national discussion on the heated nature of current politics, according to Reuters report.His campaign has shifted to a message of unity, pausing ads and attacks aimed at Trump following the incident.""I am all in,"" Biden told the convention audience as they chanted ""four more years.""Biden acknowledged his Republican rival’s safety after the Saturday shooting incident and emphasized the need for a serious conversation in the country.""It's time for an important conversation in our country. Our politics got too heated,"" Biden said.Biden also urged for the prohibition of semi-automatic rifles, such as the AR-15, which was utilized in the recent attack on his political opponent, Donald Trump. ""Join me in getting these weapons of war off the streets of America. An AR-15 was used in the shooting of Donald Trump... It's time to outlaw them,"" Biden said.Following the attempt on Trump’s life, Biden's campaign had removed its television ads, halted verbal critiques of Trump, and instead focused on promoting unity. Earlier, the campaign strategy was centered on criticizing Trump as a threat to US democracy, spotlighting his refusal to concede the 2020 election and his felony convictions. Now, the campaign is poised to strike a balanced tone while still distinguishing the differences between the two candidates.The long-standing and influential NAACP—representing a vital Democratic constituency—has shown waning support for Biden according to recent polls, despite strong turnout for him in 2020. NAACP president Derrick Johnson expressed hope that Biden would address economic struggles and rights concerns within the Black community.""People are concerned about the price of gas, price of bread, but they're also concerned with their growing knowledge around Project 2025,"" Johnson said, referring to conservative policy proposals that have garnered criticism from Trump opponents.One day prior, Biden addressed the nation from the White House Oval Office, urging Americans to lower political tensions and resolve differences peacefully. He described the upcoming November 5 election as a ""time of testing.""In a Monday interview with NBC News, Biden admitted it was an error to use the term ""bullseye"" in reference to Trump during a recent campaign donor call.Biden postponed a trip to Texas meant to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library. White House officials hope the assassination attempt on Trump might alleviate pressure on Biden to withdraw as the Democratic candidate amid concerns about his mental acuity and stamina for another term.The president is set to speak to Latino leaders at the UnidosUS Annual Conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the Republican Party’s nominating convention is taking place in Milwaukee, where US Senator JD Vance has been selected as Trump's running mate.","President Joe Biden addressed a crowd of black voters at the NAACP national convention.

"Terror attacks kill 10 soldiers, 5 civilians in Pakistan’s volatile northwest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/terror-attacks-kill-10-soldiers-5-civilians-in-pakistans-volatile-northwest/articleshow/111791956.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan army said on Tuesday that at least 15 people, including 10 soldiers , were killed in two separate attacks in the volatile northwest bordering Afghanistan and added that security forces killed all 13 assailants in the ensuing gunfights.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media wing, reported that two female health workers, two children, and a security guard were killed when terrorists stormed a rural medical facility in militancy-hit Dera Ismail Khan district on Tuesday.Pakistani forces, the ISPR said, “effectively engaged” the assailants, killing three of them and losing two soldiers in the clashes.The announcement came just hours after the military confirmed the deaths of at least eight soldiers in a pre-dawn militant raid against an army base in the garrison town of Bannu on Monday. It stated that security forces killed all 10 assailants in the ensuing gunfight.The attack on Bannu cantonment, the ISPR said, had been orchestrated by militants based in Afghanistan. “The attempt to enter the cantonment was effectively thwarted by security forces personnel, which forced the terrorists to ram an explosives-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall of the cantonment,” ISPR said.It added that the suicide car bombing destroyed a portion of the wall and damaged adjoining infrastructure, resulting in the deaths of the eight soldiers.“In the ensuing operation, our troops effectively engaged the terrorists as a result of which all 10 terrorists were sent to hell,” the army said. “This timely and effective response by the security forces prevented a major catastrophe, saving precious innocent lives,” it added.Locals said the blast was heard miles away and caused damage to nearby houses and shops. They said they saw black smoke billowing above the site and heard gunshots in the cantonment area.A militant outfit allied with the globally designated terrorist group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) took responsibility for the attack shortly after it started.The ISPR statement attributed the assault to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group which, according to it, operates from Afghanistan and has used Afghan soil to orchestrate acts of terrorism inside Pakistan in the past.Bannu and adjoining districts in the border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have particularly seen frequent TTP attacks targeting military and police forces since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan three years ago.Pakistan maintains TTP leaders and fighters are being increasingly facilitated by the de facto rulers of Afghanistan. The Taliban govt dismisses the allegations, saying TTP is an internal problem for Pakistan to deal with.There has been a sharp rise in terror incidents since PM Shehbaz Sharif announced anewmilitary offensive against militancy and extremism in the country’s northwestern and southwestern border regions. The announcement was vehemently resisted by Pashtun and Baloch leaderships in Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces through public protests, rallies and digital media campaigns.","At least 15 people, including 10 soldiers, killed in two separate attacks in the volatile northwest bordering Afghanistan.

However, the PTI leader declined to meet with the team, which sought to interrogate him on charges related to inciting public unrest against the state, as reported by Dawn.According to Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Asghar, Imran Khan was arrested as the primary suspect in 12 cases registered at different police stations in Lahore. The charges against him range from provoking the public to attacks on government properties and military installations.Senior police officials specified that the focus of the investigation primarily centred on two cases: the assault on the Lahore corps commander's residence and the Askari Tower.The cases were filed at several police stations, including Sarwar Road, Gulberg, Race Course, Naseerabad, Shadman, and others in Lahore.In today's hearing at anti-terrorism Court-I before Judge Khalid Arshad , the police requested a 30-day physical remand for Imran Khan to facilitate further investigation into the 12 cases. Imran Khan appeared via video call from Adiala Jail, represented by his lawyers, Azhar Siddique and Usman Gul, who objected to the remote proceedings and insisted on his physical presence.After hearing arguments from both sides, Judge Khalid Arshad reserved his verdict briefly and later granted a 10-day physical remand for Imran Khan.

Import premiums during the period remained unchanged at USD 9.60 and USD 6.50 per barrel for petrol and HSD, respectively, while the Pakistani Rupee depreciated by about 17 paise against the dollar over the same fortnight.The government also disclosed its decision to raise the maximum limit of the petroleum development levy (PDL) to PKR 70 per litre through the Finance Bill. This move aims to bolster revenue collection, targeting PKR 1.28 trillion for the current fiscal year, up from PKR 960 billion in the previous year and surpassing the initial budget target by PKR 91 billion.Taxes on both petrol and HSD currently stand at approximately PKR 77 per litre, alongside a fixed PKR 60 per litre PDL, which notably impacts consumers. Additionally, a PKR 17 per litre customs duty is applied uniformly to both locally produced and imported petrol and HSD.The price hikes in petrol and diesel are expected to impact inflation, with petrol predominantly used in private transport, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, while diesel is crucial for heavy transport vehicles and contributes significantly to the cost of essential commodities such as vegetables, Dawn reported.","Petrol prices surged by PKR 9.99 per litre, reaching PKR 275.6/ltr, while HSD saw a rise of PKR 6.18/ ltr.

""We believe Article 17 of the Constitution gives the govt the right to ban political parties.""Tarar said that besides Imran and Alvi, the govt had decided to slap a treason case on ex-deputy speaker Qasim Suri under Article 6 for dissolving the assemblies in April 2022 despite a no-confidence motion moved against the then government in parliament.“The reference, under Article 6, will be sent to the apex court after being approved by the cabinet,"" he said.Article 6 states, ""Any person who abrogates or subverts or suspends, or holds in abeyance or attempts or conspires to abrogate or subvert or suspend the Constitution by use of force, or show force or by any other unconstitutional means shall be guilty of high treason.""The minister said the Sharif govt would also submit a review petition in the apex court, challenging its verdict on reserved seats.Lawyer-politician Moiz Jaferii said a political party couldn't be banned other than through a reference to the apex court. He termed the govt's move ""ridiculous and desperate posturing by a regime exposed day by day for its lack of legitimacy and popular appeal"".Activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir said the coalition govt's pursuit of a ban on PTI ""not only shows how weak PML-N is but also how desperate and frustrated the establishment has become"".Last week, the govt authorised Pakistan's ISI to intercept phone calls and messages ""in the interest of national security"" amid nationwide outrage over the allegedly unbridled powers the spy agency already enjoys.","The governing coalition's step is seen as an attempt to block PTI from becoming the single largest party in the National Assembly.

The former first couple was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) soon after a district and sessions court on Saturday quashed their conviction in their un-Islamic marriage case.The court's short order also stated to release Khan and Bibi immediately unless they were wanted in other cases.The NAB, which filed a new Toshakhana case against the couple, on Sunday presented them before Judge Muhammad Ali Warraich of the accountability court.The judge conducted the hearing inside the Adiala Jail due to security reasons.NAB Deputy Director Mohsin Haroon, who led the team to arrest them, requested their physical remand and the court, after hearing the lawyers, agreed to grant an eight-day remand.The court then ordered to present the two on July 22.The remand period can be extended to a maximum of 40 days at the request of NAB if it is needed to probe the suspects.Khan, objecting to the absence of media, said at the beginning of the hearing: ""If the media is not allowed, I will walk out of the court.""The court subsequently ordered media representatives to be brought inside the jail, and the hearing commenced once they arrived.Khan, 71, then addressed the judge directly, asserting that his wife had no involvement in the Toshakhana case, The Express Tribune reported.""I have read the Quran four times in jail, and it places a great responsibility on judges,"" he stated. ""Bushra Bibi is only imprisoned to cause me distress.""Bibi, 49, was also re-arrested on Saturday in the new NAB reference as she was to be released from Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail.He accused higher authorities of targeting his wife due to his decisions and said: ""My wife is being targeted by the King because I removed him from the ISI position, and my wife did not support him.""He referred to the army chief Gen.

A district and session court on Saturday overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case related to the violation of the mandatory waiting period for a Muslim woman between two marriages.The relief came a day after the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the national and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some kind of change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.The court in the Iddat case verdict stated that Khan and his wife should be released ""if not required to be detained in any other case"" and anticipating his release a large number of PTI supporters accompanied by key leaders reached the Adiala Jail Rawalpindi, where they have been kept, to welcome them.But the PTI feared counter-measures by the government and announced that Khan would be arrested in three cases related to May 9 violence. However, it emerged that he and his wife were taken into custody by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB ) in a fresh Toshakhana corruption case .Khan and his wife during his government allegedly obtained gifts from the gift repository at low prices and sold them at higher rates.It is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.The new case alleged that the couple got some precious watches and other gifts from the state depository by violating rules.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.Despite dozens of cases against him and several party leaders, he has kept up his rhetoric by attacking the senior Army leadership , and his supporters churning out half-baked stories against the establishment on social media.The Army this month after a key meeting termed the attack on social media as ""digital terrorism"", calling it ""unwarranted criticism by some quarters"".Army commanders stated that the onslaught of politically motivated digital terrorism, unleashed by conspirators, duly abetted by their foreign cohorts against state institutions is meant to induce despondency in the nation and sow discord through the peddling of blatant lies, fake news and propaganda.The forum affirmed that military leadership is cognizant of the full spectrum of the challenges and resolved to shoulder its constitutionally mandated responsibilities with the support of the resilient people of Pakistan.Khan on his side uses the presence of media on the occasion of hearing cases against him in the Adiala Jail to fire salvos at rivals, showing unflinching resolve to fight. He also reiterates not to spare his tormentors.His own X handle is active, apparently operated by someone on his behalf, charging his opponents from the Army and civilians with an unwavering commitment. The same attitude has been displayed by his party leaders who often compete with each other to breathe more fire than others.All this had added to his hardships despite getting relief from the courts regularly.In the latest arrest, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) is expected to produce Khan and his wife before an accountability judge to seek their physical remand. Under the law, NAB can detain a person for 40 days on remand for investigation.As courts operate within rules, it is not easy for his legal team to secure his release.The circuitous legal battle is getting more entangled due to the official opposition to his release from jail.Recently, political advisor to Prime Minister, Rana Sanaullah, reportedly stated that new cases would be lodged against Khan in the coming days. Talking to the reporters in Lahore on June 15, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stated that Khan's detention for the next five years was necessary to bring economic stability.""People come to us and tell us if Pakistan has to progress then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,"" he said.","A district and session court overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case.

This was the last case keeping Khan in prison but he will not walk free as the authorities immediately issued fresh orders for his arrest in three other cases.In a short order, additional sessions judge Afzal Majoka directed authorities to immediately release Khan and his wife if they are not wanted in any other case.After the decision Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said, “Mr Khan has been arrested in three more cases.” The three cases are linked to violence against the military and other state installations after his brief arrest in May 2023.“An anti-terrorism court in Lahore approved the request to arrest Imran Khan in the May 9 case,” the PTI statement read. The party warned that keeping Khan, 71, in jail after Saturday’s decision would lead to another political crisis.Just days before national polls on Feb 8 the couple were sentenced to seven years in jail in the “iddat” case after the court found them guilty of breaking Islamic law by failing to observe the required interval between Bibi’s divorce from her previous husband and her marriage to Khan. The verdict had coincided with his convictions and sentences in the Toshakhana (state treasure store) and cipher cases. His sentences in two alleged graft cases, however, were suspended, while his sentence in the cipher case, linked to leaking of state secrets, was overturned. Various courts have also freed him in several other cases linked to the events of May 9, 2023 when his first arrest had caused riots across the country, following which the state launched a crackdown against him and his party.Ahead of Khan’s acquittal in a fake marriage case , a pair of applications was filed by Khawar Fareed Maneka, Bushra’s previous husband. One application asked the court to carry out a medical checkup of his ex-wife to ascertain her menstrual cycle while the other called on religious scholars for consultation on further deliberation on the duration of “iddat”.Before ordering Khan and his wife’s release, judge Majoka dismissed both applications. “Both petitions seeking the formation of a medical board and consultations with religious scholars are hereby rejected,” the verdict stated.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023.

Judge Majoka announced the judgment in the afternoon after reserving the verdict earlier in the day, acquitting Khan, 71, and Bushra, 49.""If they are not wanted in any other case, then PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi should be released [from jail] immediately,"" the judge said after accepting their appeals. However, it was not immediately clear if Khan would be released, as this was the only case for which he was currently imprisoned following the suspension of his Toshakhana corruption case sentence and acquittal in the cipher case.Imran Khan, the cricketer-turned-politician, has been behind bars since August last year after being sentenced in the Toshakhana corruption case and subsequently convicted in other cases ahead of the February 8 elections.Maneka filed the case against the couple in November 2023, alleging that they married without observing the mandatory Iddat period. He sought to have the marriage declared null and void.Khan and Bibi married in 2018, the same year Khan won the general elections and became prime minister. Bibi, who was ostensibly Khan's spiritual guide, divorced her husband of 28 years, with whom she had five children, and developed a romantic relationship with Khan. She is Khan's third wife; during his cricketing career, Khan had a reputation as a playboy.PTI chief Gohar Khan welcomed the verdict, calling it a victory for the independent judiciary. ""All these cases were fake, and he will also get justice in all other cases,"" he said, demanding Imran Khan's immediate release as this was the last case in which he was convicted.This judgment follows a major legal victory for Khan's PTI party.

As a result, over 600,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan since the order was issued last year. Human rights organizations have cautioned that some of those sent back to Afghanistan may face persecution by the Taliban , who took power in 2021 and have implemented strict Islamic laws, denying girls access to higher education and excluding women and girls from many areas of public life.Malala, who grew up in Pakistan's Swat valley and had to relocate to the UK after being shot at the age of 15 for resisting the Pakistan Taliban's ban on girls' education, emphasized the importance of protecting girls and women, given the bleak future they face in Afghanistan. She expressed hope that Pakistan would reverse its policy, stating, ""I hope that Pakistan reverses its policy and that they protect girls and women especially because of the dark future that they would be witnessing in Afghanistan"".On her birthday, recognized by the UN as Malala Day, the activist addressed the challenges faced by Afghan girls, who have been banned from education for over three years. While finding the situation shocking, she admired the resilience of Afghan activists. The Malala Fund is advocating for the UN to formally expand its definition of crimes against humanity to include ""gender apartheid,"" a term used by the UN to describe the situation in Afghanistan.Malala criticised the recent talks between the UN and the Taliban in Doha, which took place without the presence of women. She called for a ""principled engagement"" with the Taliban and urged world leaders to realize that excluding women and girls from such discussions is doing the Taliban a favor.She specifically called out countries with feminist foreign policies, such as Canada and France, to condemn such conversations.Furthermore, Malala called for an urgent ceasefire in the ongoing war in Gaza, expressing concern over the bombing of schools in the region. She emphasized the importance of providing humanitarian support to innocent civilians and praised countries that have resumed funding for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, despite Israeli accusations of its workers being involved in Hamas's attack against Israel on October 7.","Malala Yousafzai has expressed deep concern over Pakistan's decision to deport undocumented Afghan refugees.
