NEW DELHI: The Calcutta high court on Wednesday ordered a court-monitored CBI probe into alleged crimes against women, forcible land-grabing in West Bengal's Sandeshkhali . The court has directed the CBI to file report on illegal conversion of agricultural land for pisciculture.A division bench presided by Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam directed the CBI to file a comprehensive report on the alleged illegal conversion of agricultural land into water bodies for pisciculture after conducting a thorough inspection of revenue records and physical inspection of land alleged to have been converted.Sandeshkhali, located in the North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, has become a focal point of political controversy for almost two months now.The village was engulfed in widespread protests following accusations of sexual abuse leveled by numerous women against a local TMC leader, Sheikh Shahjahan, who was identified as the primary conspirator.The court had earlier expressed deep concern over the contents of affidavits presented before it during a hearing on a PIL seeking an independent investigation into the Sandeshkhali sexual harassment allegations.It warned that Bengal's claim of being the ""safest state for women"" would lose credibility if the allegations in the affidavits were proven true.","The court has directed the CBI to file report on illegal conversion of

External interference cannot stop 'family reunion' with Taiwan: China President Xi Jinping,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/external-interference-cannot-stop-family-reunion-with-taiwan-china-president-xi-jinping/articleshow/109193280.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday met former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou , telling him that external interference cannot hinder the ' family reunion ' between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Xi stressed on the importance of dialogue, stating that all issues can be discussed.This meeting holds significance as it marks a rare interaction between leaders from Taiwan and China since the establishment of the Republic of China government in Taiwan in 1949.Ma, who served as Taiwan's president from 2008 to 2016, made history last year by becoming the first former Taiwanese leader to visit China. During his current visit, it was anticipated that Ma would meet with Xi, as they had previously held a landmark summit in 2015.Xi reaffirmed the shared identity of both sides of the strait as Chinese and spoke against the futility of external interference, particularly from Western countries like the United States. ""External interference cannot stop the historical trend of reunion of the country and family,"" Xi said, in comments reported by Taiwanese media.Xi highlighted the mutual Chinese identity of people on both sides of the strait and expressed a willingness to address any unresolved issues through discussion. ""There is no rancour that cannot be resolved, no problem that cannot be discussed, and no force that can separate us,"" he said.China's stance on Taiwan remains firm, with Xi reiterating the possibility of using force to assert control over the island. Notably, Xi addressed Ma as 'Mr. Ma Ying-jeou,' reflecting the lack of formal recognition between the Chinese and Taiwanese governments.Taiwan, a democratic nation, rejects China's territorial claims and insists on the right of its people to determine their own future. While the Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan's main opposition party, advocates for closer ties with China, it denies any pro-Beijing affiliations.","Chinese President Xi Jinping met former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou.

'Hunter Biden-linked Ukrainian firm connected to terror attacks in Russia',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hunter-biden-linked-ukrainian-firm-connected-to-terror-attacks-in-russia/articleshow/109184433.cms,"NEW DELHI: Russia has launched a ""financing terrorism"" investigation, implicating Western countries and specifically targeting funds received by US firms in Ukraine. Among these is Burisma Holdings , an oil and gas company that notably employed Hunter Biden , son of US President Joe Biden. The probe underscores Moscow 's ongoing narrative that blames the West and Ukraine for a deadly attack on a concert hall last month, which resulted in 144 fatalities.The Crocus City Hall attack, claimed by the Islamic State group, has been a focal point of controversy, especially after US officials disclosed they had preemptively warned Moscow about the impending threat. Nonetheless, Russia's Investigative Committee is delving into the ""sources of income"" involving millions of dollars and the ""involvement of specific individuals"" from Western nations.""It has been established that financial funds received through commercial organisations, including Burisma Holding, working in Ukraine over recent years were used to carry out terrorist acts inside Russia,"" said the committee. This assertion aims to trace the financing back to its origins, seeking to identify the connections between the perpetrators of these terrorist acts and their international backers.In response, the White House has dismissed the allegations as unfounded. US national security advisor Jake Sullivan labeled the Russian claims as ""nonsense"".""Russia knows that it was ISIS who committed the attack in Moscow, we know it was ISIS who committed the attack in Moscow,"" Sullivan said, referring to the so-called Islamic State group, ""we warned Russia of an impending terrorist attack in Moscow, and all of the rest of this is noise.""The investigation into Burisma Holdings not only revives concerns over the company's connections to the Biden family but also rekindles debate over the complex interplay of political influence, international business dealings, and security issues.

Economic clout or territorial claim? China's growing presence in Russia raises eyebrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/economic-clout-or-territorial-claim-chinas-growing-presence-in-russia-raises-eyebrow/articleshow/109108543.cms,"While Beijing and Moscow have displayed a facade of an ""unlimited partnership"" on the global stage, tensions are brewing in the far-eastern corner of Russia , Primorsky Krai, as it attracts a significant influx of Chinese farmers. These farmers, benefiting from their economic prowess, are outpacing local competitors, posing a subtle challenge to local Russian dominance.This region, historically part of the Qing dynasty until 1860, has recently seen a push from Beijing, evident in the inclusion of Haishenwai (the Chinese name for Vladivostok, the region's administrative center) and seven other locations in official Chinese maps, a Newsweek report said.This development aligns with Chinese Leader Xi Jinping 's broader territorial ambitions, mirroring Russian President Vladimir Putin 's claims over Ukraine. As China eyes territories like Taiwan and most of the South China Sea, its growing economic influence in Russia's backyard raises strategic concerns. The increasing presence of Chinese agricultural ventures in Primorsky Krai, driven partly by economic shifts in China's northeast, has sparked fears of the ""Yellow Peril"" - a historical anxiety over Chinese dominance in the sparsely populated Russian Far East.Economically, this Chinese incursion has mixed effects; a study in the American Journal of Economics and Sociology highlighted both benefits and drawbacks for local Russian farmers, noting shifts in crop yields, land prices, and labor dynamics. Despite Western sanctions and the financial isolation over its invasion of Ukraine, Russia finds its economy propped up by trade with China. This economic interdependence has made Russia increasingly reliant on the yuan, with three-quarters of its trade turnover with China settled in the Chinese currency.""Russia's reliance on the yuan leaves ""junior partner"" Putin in a tight spot should any diplomatic tensions or trade disputes arise between the two countries—and more exposed to economic challenges facing the world's second-largest economy. Moscow is also vulnerable to third-party pressure via its dependency on Beijing. For example, Russian companies with business interests in China reported payment bottlenecks after Washington introduced secondary sanctions targeting banks that facilitate the transfer of banned goods into Russia,"" the Newsweek report said.The strategic and economic dynamics suggest a complex interplay of mutual benefit and dependency, with Russia's sovereignty and economic stability hanging in the balance amid its pivot towards China.","Tensions are brewing in the far-eastern corner of Russia as it attracts a

The protesters, heading towards the Chinese consulate, voiced their demands loudly, calling for China to ""leave"" and to halt its aggressive actions against Filipino interests in the region.This public outcry comes in the wake of a series of maritime disputes between the Philippines and China, including a recent confrontation where China used water cannons to disrupt a Philippine resupply mission to its soldiers stationed on a grounded warship at the Second Thomas Shoal.Mong Palatino, a leader of the protest, articulated the demonstrators' demands, urging the Chinese government to vacate the West Philippine Sea, dismantle its ""illegal structures,"" honor the 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling, and cease harassment of Filipino fishermen and supply missions.Despite a 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling invalidating Beijing's expansive claims to the South China Sea, China continues to reject the decision and assert its dominion over the area, monitored by a fleet of coastguard vessels.In response to the growing geopolitical tension with China, the US Army, in collaboration with the Philippine military, is set to introduce joint battlefield training in the Philippines. Aimed at enhancing combat readiness, the drills will focus on navigating the challenges of tropical jungles and scattered islands, ensuring the efficient supply of ammunition and other logistical needs.Maj Gen Marcus Evans of the US Army's 25th Infantry Division outlined the plans for combat drills scheduled for June, marking a first in response to Manila's request.

However, the state department's second-ranking diplomat, who previously asserted that China aided Moscow in ""retooling"" and strengthening its military following initial setbacks in the Ukraine conflict, warned Beijing bluntly about its ""significant"" support for Russia's war endeavors.""We have directly informed China that if this behavior persists, it will affect the US-China relationship.

Eid-ul-Fitr marks the month-long Ramzan fasting and the beginning of Shawwal which is the tenth month per the Islamic calendar.Since the observance of the moon is essential for ending Ramzan month and celebrating Eid, it is celebrated in different parts on different days usually with a one-day difference.Earlier today, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, also greeted the Muslims in the country and across the world on the occasion of Eid.Wishing ""Eid Mubarak to Muslims celebrating across the UK,"" Sunak, in a video message, thanked people from the community for their contribution across many fields in the nation.""After the long month of fasting, I wish you all the joy of this festival that brings people together for thanks and reflection. And at this special time, I want to say an enormous thank you, not just for your contribution in so many different fields, from the NHS to business, politics and the armed forces, but for your generosity, hard work, commitment to service, and for your compassion to those in need,"" Sunak said in the personalised video that he shared on his official X handle.He said the UK was also working towards ensuring that the British Muslims felt secure in the country.""Here in the UK also, we're working to make British Muslims feel secure and tackle sickening and utterly unacceptable hatred. That's why we've committed over £29 million every year for the next four years, to help protect the mosques, faith schools and community venues,"" Sunak said.""But for now, as people gather together to pray and spend time visiting family and friends, I simply want to wish you and Muslims around the world a blessed and peaceful Eid,"" he added.","Eid ul-Fitr is celebrated on the first day of Shawwal, the 10th month of the

Arizona top court revives 1864 law that bans nearly all abortions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/arizona-top-court-revives-1864-law-that-bans-nearly-all-abortions/articleshow/109174844.cms,"PHOENIX: Arizona's highest court on Tuesday upheld an 1864 law that bans nearly all abortions , a decision that could have far-reaching consequences for women's healthcare and poll-year politics in a critical battleground state.The Arizona Supreme Court said that because the federal right to abortion in Roe v. Wade had been overturned, there was no federal or state law preventing Arizona from enforcing a near-total ban on abortions that had sat dormant for decades.The 1864 law, the court said in a 4-2 decision, ""is now enforceable."" But the court also put its ruling on hold for the moment and sent the case back to a lower court to hear additional arguments.The ruling was focused on a law on the books long before Arizona achieved statehood. It outlaws abortion from the moment of conception, except when necessary to save the life of the mother, and it makes no exceptions for rape or incest. Doctors prosecuted under the law could face fines and two to five years in prison.The court's ruling was a stinging loss for abortion-rights supporters, who said it would put women's health at risk. Attorney general Kris Mayes, a Democrat, called it ""unconscionable and an affront to freedom"". The stakes could be significant for Arizona after former President Donald Trump said this week that he thought abortion rights should be left up to the states to decide.","Arizona's highest court upheld an 1864 law that bans nearly all abortions.

Importance of allies and advanced technology

NEW DELHI: Pentagon space experts have released a stark warning that the United States is at risk of falling behind China in the new space race . In a report, issued by specialists from the Space Force , Air Force Research Laboratory and Defense Innovation Unit, experts have emphasized the urgent need to bolster American and allied space industries and streamline bureaucratic processes to maintain the US lead in space exploration and warfare capabilities .China has been identified as a significant strategic competitor, rapidly developing its capabilities in space. The White House has referred to the current era as a ""decisive decade"" in the competition with Beijing. The report indicates that China could surpass the US as the dominant space power by 2045 if proactive measures are not taken immediately.As per a report in the Washington Times, China's advancements in space propulsion systems and its collaboration with Russia highlight the urgency for the US to improve its efforts in space. The report notes China's recent space maneuvers close to US satellites as a potential military threat and emphasizes the necessity for the US to develop ""in-space servicing, assembly, and manufacturing"" (ISAM) capabilities.By 2060, experts predict the possibility of vibrant human communities beyond Earth, a vastly expanded space economy, and a balance of power that could potentially favor US leadership. However, this is contingent upon the current space industry's fortification. ""To sustainably win the new space race is to determine the conditions for which future generations may inherit not just the technological achievements of our day, but the preservation of our values, a free and open society, a free market economy, and the right of self-determination free from tyranny and oppression,” the report asserts.The report highlights the pivotal role of private-sector high-tech companies in leading U.S. space systems and programs. However, it cautions that ""bureaucratic inefficiency"" is hampering space innovation and competitiveness, calling for new ideas to ""disrupt the status quo at the speed and scale necessary to compete and win.""Among the strategic recommendations, the report suggests considering the creation of a Cabinet-level Space Department or National Space Agency. This move is geared toward accelerating strategic space programs and retaining US leadership against strategic competitors, particularly the People's Republic of China (PRC).The US also needs to collaborate on space programs with allies, including countries that are developing military space capabilities. This collaboration is crucial as commercial space technology, like Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communications, plays a pivotal role in current global conflicts, such as in Ukraine.","Pentagon space experts have released a stark warning that the United States is

He attributed the resurgence of terrorism in Pakistan to the Sharif family and their ""facilitators,"" asserting that PML-N, PPP, MQM, and other members of the PDM intended to overthrow a stable PTI government, thereby creating a political vacuum exploited by terrorists.Hasan said that terrorism wasn't a recent occurrence, tracing its roots back to Nawaz Sharif's tenure when, backed by the military, terrorism was ""imported"" into Pakistan. His remarks came in response to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz's criticism of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for failing to adequately control its corridors, which she claimed were exploited by terrorists and smugglers.Regarding PTI's approach towards the Centre despite differences with the PML-N mindset, Hasan mentioned Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur's recent visit to Islamabad, where he met Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Despite criticism from party members, Hasan explained PTI's rationale for maintaining a positive working relationship with the Centre.Despite efforts by the provincial government, Hasan lamented the Centre's failure to fulfill its obligations, including the appointment of requested officers and the release of long-awaited funds for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Critiquing political rivals advocating for governor rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Hasan highlighted the disregard for the rule of law and constitutional principles.

PTI leader Barrister Gohar said.Barrister Gohar said that PTI maintained a strong understanding with SIC, ensuring both parties' representation in Parliament. However, he criticized ECP and National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq for not allocating reserved seats to SIC.Regarding a recent meeting at Peshawar's Corps Commander's House by the KP government, Gohar minimized its significance, emphasizing the need for a working relationship amidst provincial security concerns.PTI announced Barrister Ali Zafar as their candidate for the opposition leader in the upcoming Senate chairman and deputy chairman elections. Gohar highlighted the absence of KP representation due to postponed Senate elections, questioning the legitimacy of conducting these elections.Responding to rift allegations within PTI leadership following Shehryar Afridi's comments, Gohar emphasized internal matters should be addressed within party platforms.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Saturday said that a

He said that the rule of law remained non-existent, constitution was being disregarded and morality has been ruined in Pakistan during the past two years.Raoof Hasan said political parties who said that PTI was responsible for resurgence of terrorism had publicly spoken bad about judges and generals. He said people have not forgotten Nawaz Sharif's Gujranwala speech, where he said that Sharifs had a history of ""attacking state institutions as Nawaz's goons attacked Supreme Court and bought judges"".PTI leader called all provincial governments, except Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ""fake and unlawful"", adding that the reason of their frustration was that people of Pakistan rejected them in the elections held on February 8, as none of the members of Sharif family including Nawaz Sharif could actually win their seats.He announced that tribunals would expose their ""polls fraud"" before people of Pakistan, according to Dawn report. Hasan vowed that PTI will continue their struggle against ""mandate theft"" until reclaiming their mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan and Centre. He said that people would not let the ""criminals to escape"" Pakistan.Speaking on the occasion, Shaukat Mahmood Basra said the Sharif family and the Punjab CM were taking revenge of the ""humiliating defeat"" in the polls.

Imran Khan accused the former Pakistan army chief of backstabbing him and added that he could have de-notified him but he exercised restraint.Around the time of his ouster, Imran said that General Bajwa was involved in a US-backed conspiracy to remove him from office.Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Imran said he also sent a message to Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, General Asim Munir, through former Pakistan President Arif Alvi that he knew about the so-called 'London Plan', Dawn reported.Imran alleged that police entered his bedroom on August 5 last year to detain him, as per the Dawn report. He said the police at the time confiscated his passport and the chequebook, adding that Bushra Bibi had moved her valuables to a secure location. He claimed that intelligence agencies had asked his staffers to become 'approver' against him.The PTI founder said Pakistan was facing a 1970s-like situation.

Why the green onion has become a contentious poll issue in the South Korean elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/why-the-green-onion-has-become-a-contentious-poll-issue-in-the-south-korean-elections/articleshow/109105265.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Ahead of South Korea's crucial parliamentary election on April 10, green onions have unexpectedly taken center stage, overshadowing traditional hot topics like foreign policy and the economy. So contentious is the humble allium that it has been banned from polling stations due to concerns of electoral interference, sparking a wave of discussions among voters and election officials.The green onion frenzy began on March 18 when current president Yoon Suk Yeol visited a grocery store in Seoul to check consumer prices.His comment on the reasonable price of green onions, at 875 won ($0.65), stirred controversy as local media revealed the store had discounted the vegetable for his visit.This incident led to online backlash and opposition parties using green onions as a symbol of the president being out of touch with the people.As early voting commenced, photos of voters holding green onions at polling stations flooded social media, accompanied by hashtags like #earlyvotedone and #greenonions875won. Despite the high early voting turnout, reaching 13.8 million out of 44.2 million eligible voters, the National Election Commission (NEC) intervened by prohibiting green onions from polling stations to prevent any potential election interference .The NEC's decision faced ridicule online, with more onion memes circulating on social media platforms. This ban prompted a rush for green onion-themed memorabilia to circumvent the restrictions. Some voters expressed defiance by planning to wear green onion headbands on election day, criticizing the NEC's ban as arbitrary and condescending.One voter, Hyun Jung, voiced her disapproval, questioning the ban's logic and suggesting other items like colored clothing or luxury bags could also be restricted. Despite the ban on green onions, election officials will decide on-site whether green onion-themed items are acceptable, according to an NEC official.Political analyst Yum Seung-yul criticized the NEC's decision, deeming it too hastily implemented. While the ban is within the NEC's discretion, it has raised questions about the reasoning behind prohibiting green onions and the potential impact on voters' freedom of expression .As the election day approaches, the green onion controversy continues to stir debate and creativity among voters. The unexpected focus on this humble vegetable has become a symbol of political discourse and resistance against perceived restrictions on electoral participation.The green onion saga highlights the intersection of political symbolism and everyday life, illustrating how a seemingly mundane item can spark a nationwide conversation during a crucial electoral period. The outcome of the parliamentary election remains uncertain, but one thing is clear – green onions have secured their place in South Korea's political landscape, serving as a reminder of the power of everyday objects in shaping public discourse.","Green onions have taken center stage ahead of South Korea's crucial

'Try-hard bid': UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faces online backlash over shoe choice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/try-hard-bid-uk-prime-minister-rishi-sunak-faces-online-backlash-over-shoe-choice/articleshow/109185328.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently faced backlash for his choice of footwear—Adidas Samba sneakers—in a video discussing his Conservative government’s policies. The video, aimed at explaining the latest tax and childcare policies, sparked a discussion not about its content but about Sunak’s attempt to appear relatable through his ""everyman"" shoes.Comments ranged from jests about belonging to the populace to sarcastic appreciation for making the video relatable.The sneakers, which have been sported by celebrities like Harry Styles and Rihanna, lost their ""eternally cool"" status, according to British GQ, the moment Sunak appeared in them. The Guardian echoed this sentiment, describing Sunak's attempt to seem relatable as a ""try-hard bid"" that ultimately fell flat, a CNN report said. This response starkly contrasts with the acclaim that other politicians, such as Barack Obama and Kamala Harris, have received for their sneaker choices. Obama's Stan Smiths and Harris's Converse were celebrated as tasteful and appropriate, underscoring how political figures can successfully use fashion to enhance their public image when the context is right.Meanwhile, the Conservative Party, led by Sunak, is anticipated to face a significant defeat in the upcoming national election slated for later this year. A seat projection released by YouGov on Wednesday indicates a landslide victory for the opposition Labour Party , which is expected to secure over 400 seats.According to the YouGov model, which forecasts outcomes in individual parliamentary constituencies based on vote share estimations, the Conservatives are projected to secure merely 155 seats, while Labour is poised to win 403 out of the 650 total seats in Britain's parliament.Labour has consistently led the Conservatives by a double-digit margin in polls leading up to the election, which Sunak has hinted could be called in the latter half of the year.Since 2010, the Conservative Party has been at the helm of the UK government, navigating through the complexities of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the party has seen five different leaders during this period due to ongoing political upheaval.The recent poll suggests a challenging path ahead for Sunak, who has struggled to rally support following a budget announcement last month that included tax cuts. This struggle comes as the country prepares for local elections in May. The latest YouGov projection even suggests the Conservatives might perform worse than in 1997, when they won only 165 seats in a devastating defeat to Labour under Tony Blair's leadership.Notably, high-profile Conservative members such as finance minister Jeremy Hunt and former leadership contender Penny Mordaunt are among those potentially at risk of losing their parliamentary seats, according to YouGov.","UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently faced backlash for his choice of

Flesh-rotting 'Zombie drug' tranq raises alarm in UK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/flesh-rotting-zombie-drug-tranq-raises-alarm-in-uk/articleshow/109185020.cms,"NEW DELHI: Experts are sounding an alarm over the spread of Xylazine , a potent animal tranquiliser known as ' tranq ', which has been linked to 11 deaths in the UK . This drug, powerful enough to sedate elephants, has been found in cocaine , heroin , fentanyl, and even some cannabis vapes, posing a grave threat to public health. Originally developed in the 60s for large animals, its misuse among humans is causing severe health issues, including flesh-rotting effects on users, a Daily Mail report said.The situation in the UK mirrors the crisis in the US, where cities like Philadelphia and New York have seen their streets turn into 'zombielands' due to the rampant use of tranq. Its addition to cocaine and other drugs makes them more potent and extends their supply, creating a dangerous cycle of dependency and harm. With the UK having the highest cocaine usage rate in Europe, the presence of tranq in these supplies is particularly concerning.Researchers from King's College London have detected tranq in various illegal substances, revealing the extent of its penetration into Britain's drug market. This discovery is alarming due to the severe side effects associated with the drug, including ulcers and necrosis, particularly in individuals who inject it directly into their bloodstream.Dr Caroline Copeland, a senior author and expert in toxicology, emphasizes the need for immediate action to prevent a tranq epidemic similar to that in the US. Proposed measures include making cheap xylazine test strips available, educating healthcare providers on the signs of xylazine-related skin ulcers, and urging pathologists and coroners to test specifically for xylazine to grasp the true prevalence of the drug in the UK.The drug's rise in the US, where it is often mixed with stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, has been linked to creating a state of zombie-like immobility in users. This combination of a sedative and stimulant prevents users from completely passing out, trapping them in a dangerous limbo. The flesh-rotting quality of tranq, while not fully understood, is thought to be due to its constriction of blood vessels, which hampers the body's ability to heal wounds and increases the risk of severe infections, the Daily Mail report said.As the UK grapples with this emerging threat, the situation calls for heightened awareness and swift intervention to mitigate the spread of tranq and its devastating effects on individuals and communities.","Xylazine is a potent animal tranquiliser known as'tranq ', which has been linked

NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old man identified as Nicholas Metson , from Shuttleworth House in Lincoln, stabbed his wife, Holly Bramley to death, cut her body into more than 200 pieces and dumps her remains in a river days later, with the help of a friend, Joshua Hancock .Nicholas pleaded guilty to the murder of his wife, whose body was found dismembered in the River Witham in March 2023.He confessed to a UK court that he paid his friend, Joshua, to dispose of the remains, which were kept hidden in their flat for almost a week.During the court hearing at the UK court on Friday, Nicholas remained silent and didn't gave a reason for how and why he had killed his wife.Victim impact statements presented in court by Holly's mother and siblings revealed the ""coercive control and manipulation"" she endured at the hands of the ""evil monster"". The couple, who had tied the knot in 2021, was reportedly on the brink of separation when the heinous crime took place.Prosecutor Gordon Aspden KC, informed court that concerns were raised about Holly's well-being, leading Lincolnshire Policeto visit the couple's residence on 24th March 2023.The investigators discovered disturbing evidence inside the flat, including a pungent smell of ammonia and bleach, bloodstained sheets in the bathtub, and suspicious cleaning activities, Aspden said.Nicholas informed officers that his wife had been abusive towards him, displaying a bite mark on his forearm as evidence. He claimed she had left their home to join a local mental health support group on March 19.""At one point Nicholas joked she might be hiding under the bed,"" Aspden said. The bite mark on Nicholas arm ""suggests she was being restrained in a headlock"", he added.Police later discovered that Nicholas had deceived them, prompting them to return and search the apartment.After murdering his wife, Nicholas withdrew £50 from her bank account and searched on the internet with questions such as ""What benefits do I get if my wife has died"" and ""Can someone haunt me after they die"".A passerby made a ""made a grim discovery"" in the River Witham, when he noticed plastic bags floating in the River Witham, one of which contained a human hand, he said.Despite the recovery of 224 remains, some parts were never found, leaving the family with unimaginable pain and grief.As per Aspden, the 26-year-old was likely stabbed in the bedroom and then dismembered in the bathroom, with her remains stored in the kitchen larder.CCTV footage presented in court captured the last moments of Holly before her disappearance returning to her flat on 17 March, further the footage showed Nicholas's suspicious activities involving moving bags from 14th floor to the ground floor in the early hours of 25 March.In court, Holly's mother, Annette Bramley, addressed Nicholas directly, telling him he had condemned her family ""to a life sentence of grief"". ""The heinous way in which she was murdered and dismembered has left us in such unimaginable pain,"" she said.Bramley stated that Nicholas controlling and coercive behavior had prevented the family from seeing Holly in the years leading up to her death. The court was informed that Nicholas had prior convictions for offenses against former partners in 2013, 2016, and 2017.Nicholas had previously denied murder, he later changed his plea to guilty during his appearance at a UK court last month.","Nicholas Metson, 28, stabbed his wife, Holly Bramley, to death, cut her body
into more than 200 pieces and dumps her remains in a river days later. He
confessed to a UK court that he paid his friend, Joshua, to dispose of the
remains, which were kept hidden in their flat for almost a week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109104145,imgsize-30864,width-400,resizemode-4/109104145.jpg"
