"Trump bowls a Google-y, says Pichai called to compliment his McD sortie",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-bowls-a-google-y-says-pichai-called-to-compliment-his-mcd-sortie/articleshow/114641692.cms,"TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Amid conjecture that big-tech CEOs and billionaires are folding before his hints of retribution after seeing the ""writing on the wall"" in the Presidential elections, MAGA supremo Donald Trump is claiming that Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to compliment him on his visit to McDonald's .""I actually got a call from Sundar...the head of Google and he said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald's was one of the single biggest events we've ever had at Google,"" Trump claimed at a rally in Pennsylvania, repeating an assertion he made a few hours before on the Joe Rogan podcast.Trump has previously claimed such supplicatory calls from Apple's Tim Cook and Facebook/META's Mark Zuckerberg. As with Pichai, they too have refrained from confirming or denying the calls, likely so as to not offend the tetchy former President.Claiming calls and conversations from prominent figures, including foreign leaders, has long been a Trump practice. Some critics see them as fictional or hyperbolic or an inaccurate or self-aggrandizing rendering of the exchanges.Trump frequently relates how he warned France's President Emmanuel Macron that would impose retaliatory tariffs on French wines and champagne if France did the same to American automobile industry, forcing him to back down. He also claims to have warned a Taliban leader, whom he refers to only by the first name ""Abdul,"" that he would bomb his house if US troops in Afghanistan are attacked.He once claimed, in a White House meeting with then Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked him to mediate on the Kashmir issue, forcing New Delhi to refute the claim. Such an invitation would be a departure from New Delhi's long-standing position that it is a bilateral matter, a stand successive US administrations have embraced.Typically, foreign leaders and business honchos who Trump claims made conciliatory calls, do not confirm the conversation -- likely so as to not offend him. But Trump's MAGA acolytes see these uncontested claims as proof of Trump's impending victory.""They’re either all trying to keep up with Elon Musk or they’re trying to get ahead of something they see coming,"" Charlie Kirk, a prominent Trump supporter and MAGA talking head, said. Another Trump supporter noted that ""when Fortune 500 CEOs start aligning towards the end of the election cycle, that should give everyone some indication of what's coming..these people have more skin in the game and know better to align early.""",Donald Trump claims Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to compliment him on his visit to McDonald's.

Tropical storm Trami leaves 126 dead or missing amid massive flooding and landslides in Philippines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tropical-storm-trami-leaves-126-dead-or-missing-amid-massive-flooding-and-landslides-in-philippines/articleshow/114642156.cms,"Tropical storm Trami leaves 126 dead or missing in Philippines (Picture credit: AP)

Tropical storm Trami has caused severe flooding and landslides in Philippines , leaving at least 126 people dead or missing, according to the government’s disaster-response agency . President Ferdinand Marcos said on Saturday that many areas remain isolated, and people are in urgent need of rescue.Trami, also known as Kristine, exited the northwestern Philippines on Friday, resulting in at least 85 deaths and 41 missing persons, making it one of the deadliest storms of the year in the region, according to the government agency. The death toll is expected to rise as more reports emerge from previously inaccessible areas.Emergency personnel, including police and firefighters, are using backhoes and sniffer dogs to continue search and rescue efforts in the lakeside town of Talisay in Batangas province. In the town center, more than a dozen coffins bearing the remains of storm victims were lined up. These victims were discovered amidst mud, boulders, and trees from landslides.President Marcos inspected another severely affected region southeast of Manila, highlighting the overwhelming impact of the rainfall. “The water was just too much,” he said. “We’re not done yet with our rescue work. Many areas remain flooded and inaccessible, even by large vehicles.”Marcos stressed the need for a major flood control project to address future climate threats . Over 5 million people were affected by the storm, with nearly half a million displaced to emergency shelters.In an emergency Cabinet meeting, officials raised concerns about the possibility of the storm making a U-turn due to high-pressure winds in the South China Sea . If its course remains unchanged, the storm is expected to reach Vietnam over the weekend.To ensure public safety, the Philippine government closed schools and offices on Friday, and suspended inter-island ferry services, stranding thousands. As weather conditions cleared on Saturday, cleanup operations began in many areas.The Philippines, situated between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea, experiences around 20 storms and typhoons annually. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan left over 7,300 people dead or missing and devastated entire communities.","Tropical storm Trami has caused severe flooding and landslides in Philippines, leaving at least 126 people dead or missing.

Kamala Harris McDonalds: Photo of Kamala Harris in McDonald's dress going viral. Is it real?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/photo-of-kamala-harris-in-mcdonalds-dress-going-viral-is-it-real/articleshow/114634790.cms,"The truth of Kamala Harris' McDonald's stint

What McDonald's said

A photo of a young Kamala Harris donning a blue dress apparently of McDonald's when she did a stint there has gone viral. But MAGA supporters pointed out that it was a doctored image shared mostly by pro-Kamala Harris accounts on X. They shared the original image of a McDonald's staff which they claimed had been manipulated to put Kamala Harris' face.Working at McDonald's emerged as a key flashpoint between the GOP and the Democrats as Donald Trump claimed Kamala Harris lied about working at McDonald's 41 years ago. To emulate her 'false claim', Donald Trump last Sunday worked a shift at a McDonald's outlet in Pennsylvania and said he worked 15 minutes more than Kamala Harris because Kamala Harris never worked at any McDonald's -- as there is no record of it.“We have checked with McDonald’s, and they say, definitively, that there is no record of Lyin’ Kamala Harris ever having worked there,” Trump wrote after his McDonald's shift. “In other words, she never worked there, and has lied about this ‘job’ for years.”Kamala Harris said she worked at a Bay Area McDonald's 41 years ago when she was in college in the summer of 1983. But the Trump campaign claimed that there has been no record of Kamala Harris working at McDonald's she claimed and hence she lied. But reports said it was a pre-digital era and no record found may not hint at 'never worked'.McDonald's said it is true that no records of Harris' employment exist but this is not an aberration and not a reason to think that she didn't work at a McDonald's. ""Though we are not a political brand, we’ve been proud to hear former President Trump’s love for McDonald’s and Vice President Harris’s fond memories working under the Arches. While we and our franchisees don’t have records for all positions dating back to the early ’80s, what makes ‘1 in 8’ so powerful is the shared experience so many Americans have had.""",Kamala Harris said she worked at a Bay Area McDonald's 41 years ago when she was in college in the summer of 1983.

Restaurant distributors US Foods Holding Corp and Sysco Corp have also notified customers of the recall.“Despite no contact from health authorities and no indications of illness, we proactively asked our 5% of restaurants who received whole onions distributed by this facility to dispose of them immediately two days ago and we are in the process of restocking them from other facilities,” Burger King said.Fat Brands Inc, owner of restaurants including Johnny Rockets, said it pulled all of Taylor Farms’ fresh onion products.“We have identified an extremely limited number of Buffalo’s Cafe locations and Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouses that are currently utilizing Taylor Farms as a supplier for onions,” the company said in a statement Thursday.The restaurant industry is on alert after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that an E. coli outbreak likely tied to pre-slivered onions served on McDonald’s Quarter Pounders sickened dozens of people in the US and killed one.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Trump or Harris: Who is Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu likely to support?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-or-harris-who-is-israel-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-likely-to-support/articleshow/114644543.cms,"Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is hopeful for Trump’s return to the presidency, expecting beneficial policies for Israel despite Trump's mixed messages. Analysts suggest a Trump victory would provide Netanyahu greater freedom, contrasting Biden's more critical stance. Meanwhile, Palestinians remain skeptical of both candidates.

Historic partnership

Popularity contest

Mixed feelings among Palestinians

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is likely counting on a return for former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump to the White House, AFP reported citing political analysts.The former president's previous tenure was marked by a series of favorable policies for Israel , and Trump’s mixed messages on Middle Eastern policy have put Netanyahu in a position of hopeful anticipation.In recent remarks, Trump has oscillated between urging aggressive military action—such as striking Iran’s nuclear facilities—and criticizing Netanyahu for the October 7 attack, claiming it would not have occurred under his administration. He also suggested he would pressure Israel to de-escalate its ongoing conflicts. Despite these mixed signals, political analysts assert that Netanyahu views a Trump presidency as a potential boon.Gidon Rahat, a political science professor at Hebrew University, told AFP, ""One of Netanyahu's milestones is the US election . He is praying for a Trump victory, which he thinks will give him a lot of freedom of movement.""This sentiment was shared by Aviv Bushinsky, Netanyahu’s former chief of staff, who noted, ""His experience with Republicans is very good... unlike with the Democrats who are much tougher on him.""Netanyahu’s relationship with Trump stands out over his 17 years in office, having only worked alongside one Republican president. Trump’s administration initiated several actions that bolstered Netanyahu’s political capital, such as relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and facilitating the normalization of relations between Israel and three Arab nations. Trump’s withdrawal from theIran nuclear deal and the imposition of severe sanctions against the Islamic Republic further solidified his status as a staunch ally of Israel.In stark contrast, President Joe Biden's approach has been characterized by a more restrained engagement, often critical of Netanyahu’s policies, especially regarding strikes on Iran's oil and nuclear infrastructure. Yet, despite this frigid relationship, Biden has consistently reaffirmed his ""ironclad support"" for Israel.The former president's popularity in Israel is notable. A recent poll by Mitvim, the Israel Institute for Regional Foreign Policies, indicated that 68% of Israelis believe Trump would best serve their nation's interests, compared to just 14% for Vice President Kamala Harris, despite her vocal support for Israel.While Netanyahu may relish the prospect of Trump’s return, Palestinians remain largely dissatisfied with both candidates. Voices on the ground express skepticism about any potential change stemming from the US elections as both candidates are seen as pro-Israel.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is likely counting on a return for former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump to the White House.

"'He promises peace, not war' : Arab and Muslim leaders support Trump at Detroit rally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-promises-peace-not-war-arab-and-muslim-leaders-support-trump-at-detroit-rally/articleshow/114644566.cms,"Donald Trump

As the race for the US presidency intensifies with less than two weeks until the election, members of the Arab and Muslim community in Michigan endorsed Donald Trump during a rally in Detroit.Speaking from the stage, a community leader highlighted the reasons for their backing: “As the President said, we just had a positive meeting with President Trump. We as Muslims stand with President Trump because he promises peace. He promises peace , not war.” This endorsement aligns with Trump’s recent claims that, if elected, he would work to end conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, areas plagued by long-standing turmoil.The leader continued, saying, “The bloodshed has to stop all over the world and I think this man can make that happen.”The endorsement also touched on family values, with the leader saying, “We support Donald J. Trump for his commitment to promoting family values and protecting our children’s well-being, especially when it comes to curriculums and schools.” This focus on educational reform resonates with many voters who prioritise the welfare of their families in their electoral choices.In a time when immigration remains a contentious topic, the community expressed agreement with Trump’s stance on border security. “We want a strong border… but anyone who wants to come to this country is welcome through a legal pathway,” the leader noted.The rally also featured light-hearted predictions, with the speaker humorously forecasting the Detroit Lions’ victory in the Super Bowl alongside Trump’s potential election as the 47th president of the United States. “We are with President Trump to make America great again through peace and justice for all,” they concluded, invoking a vision of unity.This endorsement comes amidst a backdrop of fierce campaigning, with Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris exchanging sharp critiques. Trump has warned that Harris’s presidency could lead the US into World War III, a claim she vehemently contests. Meanwhile, former First Lady Michelle Obama has been rallying support for Harris, condemning Trump’s previous tenure and urging voters to reconsider their choices.","Members of the Arab and Muslim community in Michigan endorsed Donald Trump during a rally in Detroit.

Their appearance comes amid a flurry of campaigning as both parties vie for support in the lead-up to November 5.Michelle Obama expressed frustration over the scrutiny faced by Harris compared to the lack of accountability for Donald Trump , saying, ""I hope you'll forgive me if I'm a little angry that we are indifferent to his erratic behaviour, his obvious mental decline, and his history as a convicted felon."" Her remarks reflect a growing concern among Democrats about the narrative surrounding the candidates as they head into the final stretch of the campaign.""His history as a convicted felon, a known slumlord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse. All of this while we pick apart Kamala's answers from interviews that he doesn't even have the courage to do,"" she said.Meanwhile, Trump held a rally in Michigan, where he launched a series of personal attacks on Harris. He labelled her as ""a dope"" and accused her of advocating for an ""open border"" policy, asserting, ""She will destroy our country. Everyone knows it."" Trump's rhetoric was met with criticism from Democratic supporters, who argue that his tactics distract from pressing issues facing voters.Harris, fresh from a rally with pop icon Beyoncé in Texas, continued to focus on abortion rights—an area seen as a vulnerability for Republicans—by visiting a local doctor's office in Kalamazoo. ""Because of Trump and what he did with the Supreme Court, we are looking at a health care crisis in America,"" she told reporters, highlighting the impact of recent judicial decisions on reproductive rights.As early voting continues, polls indicate a virtual dead heat between the candidates. With over 38 million Americans having cast their ballots already, voters face a historic decision: electing the first woman president or returning Trump to office at 78 years old.Harris plans to campaign in Philadelphia on Sunday, targeting voters in key districts, while Trump rallies supporters in Pennsylvania, a state he hopes to reclaim after losing it in 2020. The outcome in Michigan, along with other swing states, could prove pivotal in determining the next president.","Michelle Obama joined Vice President Kamala Harris on the campaign trail in Michigan.

Indian govt sources here said that the deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility .DHS said a large-frame charter removal flight was conducted on Oct 22 to India of Indian nationals who did not establish legal basis to remain in the United States. This shows the “department’s continued commitment to pursuing sustained cooperation with the Indian govt and other international partners to reduce and deter irregular migration and jointly work to counter human smuggling”, it said in a press release. DHS, however, did not give details about the number of immigrants or about where they came from in India.“Indian nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States are subject to swift removal, and intending migrants should not fall for the lies of smugglers who proclaim otherwise,” said senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security Kristie A Canegallo. “DHS will continue to enforce our nation’s laws,” added the official.Sources in the Indian govt said as part of India-US cooperation on migration and mobility, both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration. “This is being done to create more avenues for legal migration from India to the US. The latest deportation of Indian nationals by a chartered flight is a result of this cooperation,” said an official, adding such deportations have been happening for several years.Since June 2024, DHS said, it removed or returned over 160,000 individuals and operated more than 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries — including India.The Indian govt said in Parliament last year that according to data published by US Customs and Border Protection on their website, the number of illegal Indian immigrants encountered by US authorities in 2023 was 96,917. The annual India-US Consular Dialogue is a mechanism through which both countries discuss consular issues of mutual interest including ensuring safe and legal migration.DHS said it regularly engages with foreign govts throughout the hemisphere and around the world to accept repatriations of their nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States.“This is one tool among many DHS uses to reduce irregular migration, promote the use of safe, lawful, and orderly pathways, and hold transnational criminal networks accountable for smuggling and exploitation of vulnerable people,” it said.",The deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility.

Reports claimed that Jeff Bezos killed the Washington Post editorial board's idea of endorsing Kamala Harris as it was his call to not upset Donald Trump and hence the decision to not endorse anyone was taken.Amid anger over the decision, Donald Trump Friday met with the executives at Blue Origin -- the space company owned by Jeff Bezos. According to reports, Trump met with David Limp, the CEO, and Megan Mitchell, its vice president of government relations.A lot of unconfirmed inside information is floating around after the WaPo announced its decision. According to one report, an endorsement of Harris was drafted but was not published as the go-ahead from Bezos was awaited. The decision not to publish that endorsement was made by Bezos alone.A Daily Beast report said publisher Will Lewis fought Bezos ""tooth and nail"" to prevent him from nixing the draft that endorsed Kamala Harris. But then Lewis had to announce the decision that the paper would not endorse any presidential candidate this year.Eight columnists of the paper -- E.J. Dionne Jr, David Ignatius, Ruth Marcus, Dana Milbank, Eugene Robinson, Jennifer Rubin, Karen Tumulty, and Perry Bacon Jr -- issued a strong but measured joint statement condemning the action by Bezos in which they said: ""This is a moment for the institution to be making clear its commitment to democratic values, the rule of law and international alliances, and the threat that Donald Trump poses to them—the precise points The Post made in endorsing Trump’s opponents in 2016 and 2020.""",The Washington Post announced that it won't endorse any presidential candidate in this election.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan authorities Thursday released Bushra Bibi , wife of jailed former PM Imran Khan , from prison in Rawalpindi, a day after Islamabad high court granted her bail in an alleged graft case involving purchase and sale of state gifts.Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31. She and her husband were convicted of corruption and illegal marriage just ahead of the Feb 8 polls in Pakistan. The Islamabad-based accountability court had sentenced the couple to 14 years in jail in what is known as the “toshakhana” (state repository) case.The case over allegations of illegal marriage had collapsed on appeal and Bibi’s graft sentence was suspended in July, allowing her to walk free from Adiala Jail where Imran remains imprisoned.She was, however, arrested again in a fresh graft case. In the new case, dubbed as “Toshakhana 2,” the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bvlgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader at a low price, causing a significant loss to the national exchequer. The gift set included a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings.A day earlier, HC judge Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb approved Bushra’s bail in the case, following which a special court issued her release orders, ending nearly nine months of her detention. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) hailed her release, with slogans of “welcome back Bushra Bibi.”“You have faced extremely difficult times, disgusting campaigns and character assassination attempts against you during your illegal time in jail. The Pakistani nation salutes your bravery,” PTI said in a post on X, confirming that Bibi had reached her Bani Gala residence in the federal capital.Meanwhile, the Islamabad HC on Thursday also ordered the jail administration to produce Imran by 3pm in court to facilitate his meeting with his lawyers. “I know you won’t implement my orders, but let me issue directions,” Justice Ijaz Ishaq Khan remarked during the hearing. The judge later softened his stance after jail authorities assured him that they would arrange Imran’s meeting with his counsels in prison.Imran and his party have been at crosshairs of an ongoing tussle between the executive and the judiciary, with the latter accusing the country’s powerful military and intelligence agencies of exerting pressure to secure favourable verdicts in political cases, particularly those involving the PTI chief.Imran has not physically appeared in a court since Aug last year, with all hearings being held in the high-security Rawalpindi prison.","Bushra Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31.

Fake news of rape sparks real protest in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fake-news-of-rape-sparks-real-protest-in-pakistan/articleshow/114538687.cms,"The recent reports of a college campus rape that went viral on social media have sparked a heated debate in Pakistan . While the police dismiss the reports as "" fake news "" designed to incite unrest, protesting students see them as a rare opportunity to publicly address the issue of sexual assault.Despite the conflicting narratives, both sides acknowledge that the case has exposed legitimate concerns. Khadija Shabbir, a 21-year-old protester in Lahore , asserts that girls on campuses feel threatened. Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi, the senior officer investigating the case, admits that harassment is an extremely sensitive subject that most women in Pakistan have experienced to some degree.The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore. When authorities were unable to identify a victim, they dismissed the claims as a hoax. However, student protests erupted, leading to arrests and the closure of educational institutes across Punjab province.Students, who have been banned from officially organizing in unions for the past four decades, continue to protest, driven by a deep-rooted frustration with the lack of trust in authorities to take the matter of harassment seriously. Many protesters cite personal experiences of harassment as their primary motivation for participating in the movement.The Lahore High Court has announced a new committee of judges to investigate campus sexual harassment , indicating that authorities are acknowledging the validity of the protests. However, the confrontation between students and police is taking place amidst a broader crackdown on dissent in Pakistan, with student social media pages and online chat groups disappearing and officials pledging to prosecute those spreading misinformation.As the protests continue, women who have shared their experiences with harassment find themselves sidelined as the demonstrations sometimes turn violent, often led by men. Despite this, young female students remain determined to stand up for their rights and fight against sexual harassment on college campuses.","The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore.

ISLAMABAD: A court in Pakistan granted bail to the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in a case pertaining to the illegal sale of state gifts, his party said on Wednesday - a relief for the embattled politician who could see his spouse released from prison for the first time in months.Both Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , are currently in jail on multiple charges including illegally selling gifts worth more than 140 million rupees ($501,000) received during his 2018-2022 premiership from a state treasury known locally known as the "" Toshakhana "".The Islamabad High Court said Bibi was granted post-arrest bail for ""reasons to be recorded later,"" according to an order shared by the media office of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party.The Khans deny the charges and say they are trumped up by the government to victimise the 72-year-old former cricket star, who remains widely popular and whose candidates won the most seats in February's general election.PTI said a surety bond had been submitted for Bibi's release and hoped she would be freed from prison on Wednesday after ""264 days of unlawful incarceration"".Bibi, Khan's third wife, was first arrested in January. She was acquitted on charges of her marriage with Khan violating Islamic injunctions, but quickly arrested again in the state gifts case before she would be released.Khan has faced dozens of cases since he was removed as premier in 2022 and launched a protest movement against a coalition of his rivals led by current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .The Sharif-led government says it does not interfere in the judicial process.Khan's standoff with powerful military generals, who he says back Sharif, has spawned the worst political turmoil in decades in the nation of 241 million people.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, are currently in jail on multiple charges.

Marriage apps in Pakistan challenge traditional 'rishta aunties',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/marriage-apps-in-pakistan-challenge-traditional-rishta-aunties/articleshow/114491653.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: Lexica AI)

In Pakistan, the traditional matchmaking system is facing competition from marriage apps specifically designed for Muslims. These apps are being adopted as an alternative to the longstanding tradition of using "" rishta aunties ,"" or matchmakers, who facilitate arranged marriages .Ezza Nawaz, a textile designer in Lahore, decided to try an app after witnessing a friend's successful marriage through an online introduction . ""When I saw my colleague happy after being married to someone she met online... I thought, since we have tried rishta aunties for four or five years, let's try this too,"" she told AFP. Nawaz married Waseem Akhtar just three months after meeting him on an app called Muzz.Traditionally, rishta aunties prepare women and present them to potential suitors' families in Pakistan, where dating is often seen as dishonorable. More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey, with families taking the lead in deciding unions.Despite offering features like the option to blur profile pictures and providing message transcripts to a relative, marriage apps still face stigma, according to an AFP report. They are seen by some as comparable to casual dating apps like Tinder, which is banned in Pakistan.Waseem Akhtar, married to Nawaz, admits to being discreet when discussing their meeting. ""I do not tell people how I met my wife until I am sure that the person would not judge us,"" he said.In Pakistani culture, marriage is viewed as an alliance between families, and choosing a spouse independently is seen as challenging traditional structures. Rida Fatima, who used a rishta auntie, found the advice limiting and invasive. She was told to list ""cooking and cleaning"" as her hobbies instead of her interests like hiking and photography. ""They had the audacity to talk about how I looked, what I did, how much I earned, who my family is, how many brothers I have, and what my future aspirations are. So every little thing is judged,"" she said.Marriage apps continue to rise in popularity, with 1.2 million Pakistanis signing up since the launch of some apps last year, according to an AFP report. Despite this, traditional matchmaking remains strong, reflecting deep-rooted cultural practices . Matchmaker Fauzia Aazam dismisses marriage apps, stating, ""People waste time on these apps. Chatting together all through the night, I just don't like it.""Feminist author Aisha Sarwari points to control issues in the traditional matchmaking process and suggests a balanced approach. ""I would say that we need to find a good middle ground, where the respect is equal on both sides and there is no sense of demeaning a human being just because they look a certain way or they are from a particular race,"" she said.Aneela, a digital media artist, experienced different challenges on marriage apps. She found men lying on profiles and admitted to using fake details herself to avoid being identified. Eventually, she considered returning to arranged marriage options.","More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey.

We have taken a number of initiatives to address the matter and now we are planning for artificial rain in the city.""She, however, did not declare any date for it.The Punjab government , led by Maryam Nawaz, has launched the 'Anti-Smog Squad' to monitor areas affected by smog as this hazardous pollution has caused significant health problems for city residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation, and skin infections.These squads will be educating farmers about alternative methods for residue disposal, the hazards of burning crop residues and promoting the use of super seeders.Smog is a specific phenomenon that arises from a mixture of smoke and fog, occurring when certain polluting microparticles combine with cold, moist air and linger near the ground. This results in reduced visibility and can lead to various health problems.Previously, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had also called for ""climate diplomacy"" with India to mitigate smog impact in the province.She said that stubble burning in Punjab, India also impacts across the border because of air direction and hence both sides should make joint efforts to combat smog.""This issue needs to be taken up with India forthwith,"" she said.""Obstacles to environmental improvement must be removed. Smog causes breathing difficulties and damages eyesight,"" the CM added.Meteorology plays an important role in determining the level of air pollution in north Pakistan, just as it is a major factor in the neighbouring region of northwest India. After the rainy season crop is harvested, farmers from both sides tend to burn stubble adding to the existing causes of pollution caused due to industrial emissions and transport.Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, the Environment Ministry said,""The positive effects of the measures taken to combat smog will become visible in 8 to 10 years. Environmental protection has been included as a subject in the curriculum in the province.”She also urged the farmers to avoid burning the crop residues, as it harms not only the crops but also their children's health.","Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world on Monday with an alarming AQI of 394.

It states that a 12-member parliamentary committee, comprising eight NA members and four from the Senate, will appoint the chief justice from a panel of the three most senior judges of the top court for a period of three years. The panel will forward the name to the PM who will then send it to the president for appointment.The bill, tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, was approved by the NA with 225 votes, one more than required for a two-thirds majority, after a handful of turncoats from jailed former PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) voted against the party’s policy. In the Senate, the required number for two-thirds was 64 and 65 members voted in favour. Hours later, President Asif Ali Zardari gave formal assent to the new law. Imran’s party, however, abstained from voting.An earlier attempt, in Sept, by the governing PML-N to bulldoze the amendments did not succeed as it failed to win the support of some opposition lawmakers and the legislation could not be tabled despite the two Houses being in session.Sharif’s govt said the constitutional amendment has ensured that parliament will not remain a rubber stamp in future. The current govt’s tensions with the judiciary have been on the rise since controversial nationwide general elections were held in Feb this year.The new legislation, specifically about judicial reforms, was passed just days ahead of the retirement of chief justice Qazi Faez Isa . Khan’s PTI has been accusing Isa of being aligned with govt, an allegation govt has repeatedly rejected.Under the previous law, Justice Isa would have been automatically replaced by the senior puisne judge, currently Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, who has consistently issued verdicts deemed favourable to Khan and PTI.PTI assailed the “conscience” of lawmakers affiliated with it who voted in favour of the amendment. “They won votes on Imran Khan’s name and sold their vote to the same mafia against whom the public gave them the mandate!” the party said on its ‘X’ account, sharing pictures of the said lawmakers and terming them “seditious”.“These conscience-sellers would be counted among the darkest characters in Pakistan’s history,” it added.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan criticised the bill, saying it would make the judiciary “subservient” for all time.",Pakistan's parliament clipped the powers of the Supreme Court in the early hours of Monday by empowering the executive.
