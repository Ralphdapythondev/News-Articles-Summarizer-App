Musk's X to host Trump 'town hall' ahead of election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musks-x-to-host-trump-town-hall-ahead-of-election/articleshow/110607943.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: X, formerly known as Twitter , will host self-styled "" town hall "" meetings with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and independent candidate Robert F.

DeSantis later dropped out of the race, giving his support to Trump.Musk, who once donated money to Democrats, has increasingly used his X account to relay xenophobic conspiracy theories, misinformation and a hard line on immigration that closely matches Trump's.Still, the South African-born tech guru has said he will not give his financial support to either Trump or Biden in this year's election.","X, formerly known as Twitter, will host self-styled "" town hall "" meetings with Donald Trump and Robert F.

Upside-down flags become symbol for Republicans protesting Trump's verdict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/upside-down-flags-become-symbol-for-republicans-protesting-trumps-verdict/articleshow/110607500.cms,"A Trump supporter in Florida after the guilty verdict was announced (Reuters photo)

After a New York jury returned a historic guilty verdict against former prez Donald Trump on Thursday, many Americans chose to rally around the flag. The upside-down flag. Social media overflowed on Thursday with images of Old Glory hung with the stars on the bottom, posted by elected Republicans , right-wing activists and regular Americans upset by the news that a former prez was now a felon.

The upside-down flag traditionally indicates distress and, on occasion, has been used as a sign of protest. But after NYT revealed two weeks ago that an inverted flag flew outside Justice Samuel Alito Jr.'s home in the weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the symbol has gained traction on the right - and Thursday's verdict seemingly pushed it into the centre of the conservative mainstream. Just six minutes after the jury in Manhattan found the former prez guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene posted an image of the upside-down flag on social media. The post had been viewed over 1.8 million times in a matter of hours.

That same picture was soon posted on Telegram by Ali Alexander, one of the key organisers of the campaign to convince voters that the 2020 polls had been rigged, along with the caption ""No one is coming to save us."" Guy Benson, a Fox News contributor, posted one too. The response was not limited to public figures, and many lower-profile Americans were posting photos of actual flipped flags suspended from poles outside their homes. The accompanying text generally pointed to the flag serving as an act of protest against the verdict, the US justice system, Biden and the so-called Deep State.

MOSCOW: The Kremlin said on Friday that it was already aware of attempts by Ukraine to strike targets on Russian territory with weapons provided by the United States.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was commenting after four US officials told Reuters on Thursday that US President Joe Biden had quietly authorised Kyiv to launch US-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia that are supporting an offensive against the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.

""No, nothing is known to us about this particular decision,"" Peskov told a news briefing when asked about it.

""What we know is that generally, there are already attempts to strike Russian territory with weapons produced by the United States. This is enough for us and it speaks volumes about the degree to which the United States is involved in the conflict.""

Peskov did not elaborate on his assertion about such strikes or reference evidence detailing them.

He said a pro-war mood was also being whipped up in Europe to the point of ""pre-war hysteria"".

Detectives interviewed Ali on Wednesday night.Ali faces more than a dozen charges, including attempted murder , attempted assault, and hate crimes charges. Police do not believe the attack is terror-related and have not found evidence linking him to radical groups online.The attack began as Ali, driving a 2011 white Crown Victoria, turned onto East 55th Street in front of the Mesivta Nachlas Yakov School and suddenly veered toward students in Orthodox attire. He then circled the block and returned, targeting two more students and a rabbi.“I’m gonna kill all the Jews,” Ali allegedly shouted, according to police. The victims managed to run into the building before being struck. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Authorities have listed five victims in the case: three 18-year-olds, a 41-year-old man, and a 44-year-old man.Rabbi Twersky, who works at the Yeshiva, described the chaos as the driver attempted to strike one of the boys at the corner of Glenwood Road and East 55th Street. Ali then drove up the wrong side of East 56th Street and barreled toward a group of 30 to 40 students.“I’m much more scared than they are — their adrenaline is up,” Twersky said.Tire marks on the sidewalk near the Yeshiva remained visible Wednesday night, with a police car stationed outside. Ali initially got away but was quickly located by the Shomrim Safety Patrol, who swarmed the area and found the attacker at a nearby Dunkin' Donuts, the NY Post report said.“We were able to retrieve the video footage. We got the guy’s plate number,” said Bob Moskowitz, executive coordinator of the patrol. “Obviously it was a very distinct car, a Crown Vic, an old model. You don’t see too many of those around.”Ali, who has lived in the US for over two decades, was taken into custody and transferred to Coney Island Hospital. He is considered an “emotionally disturbed” person with a prior arrest in 1998 for false personation. He has four prior arrests, including one for criminal impersonation, though details of the other arrests were not immediately clear.“We were very pleased to be able to apprehend this individual,” Moskowitz stated. “This is not somebody that we want driving around the streets, especially with this anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish climate that’s out there. So we were glad to be able to put this to rest. The community was kind of uptight about this. Now everybody can be a little more relaxed.”","Asghar Ali, 58, a Pakistani immigrant and cab driver with a history of mental illness, is currently under investigation by the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force.

"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down huge global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities.

Hush money trial: Donald Trump is convicted on all 34 charges. Now what?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-trial-donald-trump-is-convicted-on-all-34-charges-now-what/articleshow/110577474.cms,"What happens now

The next step is for Judge Juan Merchan to approve the verdict and enter a final judgment. This is usually a formality. Sentencing typically follows within several weeks, but legal arguments can delay this process. Lawyers on both sides will recommend sentences, which will be debated at the sentencing hearing where Merchan will make a final decision.

Will Trump go to prison?

That is unlikely. While the maximum sentence for falsifying business records is four years in prison, it is rare for first-time offenders of this crime in New York to receive prison time. ""Punishments like fines or probation are more common,"" and alternatives like home confinement or curfews could be considered, given the logistical challenges of imprisoning a former president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.

Can Trump appeal the conviction?

Yes, Trump is expected to appeal. He may argue that the indictment was legally flawed and politically motivated. His defense will likely focus on several legal points, including that state election laws do not apply to federal elections and that the charges themselves were legally improper.

Could Trump still become president?

Yes, the US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years. Even if he were in jail, Trump could theoretically be sworn in as president on January 20, 2025.

Can Trump vote for himself?

Yes, as long as Trump is not imprisoned in New York, he can vote for himself. Florida defers to other states' rules on felony disenfranchisement, and in New York, felons regain their voting rights once they are out of prison, even if on parole.

Will Trump's conviction affect his campaign?

The conviction does not legally prevent Trump from running for or becoming president. The Republican National Convention, which will take place shortly after his sentencing, has no rules disqualifying a convicted nominee. Trump remains popular among the GOP base, and the party's leadership is aligned with him.

What are the broader implications of this conviction?

The conviction marks unprecedented territory in US politics, especially as Trump faces three other criminal cases. The Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts after deliberating for two days. The trial included explicit testimony and evidence that implicated Trump in approving a $130,000 payment to silence Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.

What are the next steps for Trump legally and politically?

Following his sentencing, Trump can appeal to higher courts. His defense team has already laid groundwork for appeals, citing potential judicial bias and procedural issues. Politically, Trump continues to rally support, painting the conviction as a politically motivated attack. Despite the legal challenges, leading strategists believe Trump remains a formidable candidate for the 2024 election.

Pakistan PM Shehbaz calls some judges 'black sheep'; accuses them of giving relief to Imran Khan



(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from former US president Donald Trump , former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday claimed that the February national election was rigged , calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate.""Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, where he is being held in solitary confinement, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations and were being ""victimised.""Despite Khan's party winning the most seats in the February election, they fell short of a majority, allowing his opponent Shehbaz Sharif to form a government with the support of allied parties. The top court granted Khan permission to appear and plead petitions he had filed against amendments to the country's anti-graft laws.The Pakistan Muslim League (N) secured 75 seats, the Pakistan People's Party came third with 54 seats, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) has agreed to support them with 17 seats.Imran Khan's defense was similar to that of former US President Donald Trump who on several occasions has also claimed that the 2020 US elections were 'rigged' and 'stolen' by the democrats.Earlier today, a Pakistan court acquitted Imran Khan in two cases related to violence that occurred on May 9.

The verdict was delivered by judicial magistrate Umar Shabbir of the district and sessions court of Islamabad, who approved the petition challenging the two cases filed at Shehzad Town police station.The court stated in its verdict: ""Because of insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution, the PTI founder has been acquitted.""Last year, following Khan's arrest in an alleged corruption case, his supporters engaged in vandalism targeting public property, including sensitive army installations. This is not the first time Khan has been acquitted in cases connected to the May 9 violence; on May 15, he was also cleared in two other related cases.Earlier, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday had accused some serving judges, whom he referred to as ""black sheep,"" of allegedly providing relief to Imran Khan in various cases.""Some black sheep in (the) judiciary are there to save Imran Niazi from 190 billion pounds and other cases. Every day, it is planned how to give him bail in certain cases,"" he said.Shehbaz made these allegations during a general council meeting of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), where his elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was re-elected as the party's president.","Imran Khan claims that the February national election was rigged, calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate"" Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations.

"Under pressure, Biden allows Ukraine to use US weapons to strike inside Russia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/under-pressure-biden-allows-ukraine-to-use-us-weapons-to-strike-inside-russia/articleshow/110607314.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden , in a major shift pressed by his advisers and key allies, has authorised Ukraine to conduct limited strikes inside Russia with American-made weapons, opening what could well be a new chapter in the war for Ukraine, US officials said on Thursday.Biden's decision appears to mark the first time that an American president has allowed limited military responses on artillery, missile bases and command centres inside the borders of a nuclear-armed adversary. White House officials insisted, however, that the authorisation extended only to what they characterised as acts of self-defence, so that Ukraine could protect Kharkiv , its second-largest city, and the surrounding areas from missiles, glide bombs and artillery shells from just over the border.""The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,"" a US official said in a statement issued by the administration. ""Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,"" the statement continued, referring to an artillery system, provided to Ukraine, that has the capability to reach deep inside Russian territory.The decision by Biden was reported earlier Thursday by Politico. American officials said that the change in policy went into effect Thursday.Though the White House cast the decision as a narrow one, the implications are clearly much broader. Until now, Biden has flatly refused to let Ukraine use American-made weapons outside of Ukrainian borders, no matter what the provocation, saying that any attack on Russian territory risked violating his mandate to ""avoid World War III"". But having reversed his position, even in limited circumstances, Biden has clearly crossed a red line that he himself drew. And administration officials conceded that if Russia mounted other attacks from inside its territory beyond Kharkiv, the president's restrictions could be subject to further loosening. ""This is a new reality,"" one senior official said, declining to speak on the record, ""and perhaps a new era"" in the Ukraine conflict.Ukraine President Zelenskyy hailed the US decision Friday, calling it ""a step forward toward (the) goal ... of making it possible to defend our people...""","Biden's decision appears to mark the first time that an American president has allowed limited military responses on artillery, missile bases and command centres inside the borders of a nuclear-armed adversary.

Last-minute verdict left Trump stunned,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/last-minute-verdict-left-trump-stunned/articleshow/110607067.cms,"Reuters photo

NEW YORK: History happened just as everyone was about to leave for the day. Judge Juan M. Merchan had already summoned Donald Trump , his legal team and prosecutors into the courtroom where the former prez has been on trial since mid-April. The judge said he planned to send the jury home in a few minutes - at 4.30pm (local time) - with deliberations to resume the next morning.

Trump looked upbeat, having animated chats with his lawyers. Then, unexpectedly, the judge was back on the bench. There was a note from the jury, signed at 4.20pm. Merchan read it aloud. ""We the jury have reached a verdict,"" it said, and asked for an extra 30 minutes.

As the minutes ticked by, defence lawyer Todd Blanche whispered to Trump , who was stone-faced, arms crossed across his chest. The courtroom was packed with people, among them reporters, members of the public and Trump's son Eric.

Just before 5pm, the judge returned to the bench. Then, the moment came. The courtroom was silent. ""How say you to the first count of the indictment, charging Donald J. Trump with falsifying business records in the first degree?"" a court staffer asked. ""Guilty,"" the foreperson said. The same answer, ""guilty"", came again and again. The recitation took less than two minutes. Trump, convicted of all 34 felony counts , was seen sitting with an expressionless stare. He stood as jurors filtered out of the courtroom, appearing to be looking at them one by one as they passed in front of him. As the ex-president walked out, Eric put a hand on his back. Then, Trump turned to the cameras awaiting him in the hallway and said, ""I'm a very innocent man"". ""We'll fight to the end, and we'll win.""

Biden says Israel has offered to Hamas a three-step road map to an enduring ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-says-israel-has-offered-to-hamas-a-three-step-road-map-to-an-enduring-ceasefire/articleshow/110603765.cms,"The first phase would involve a six-week ceasefire, during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza, and hostages, including the elderly and women, would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Palestinian civilians would return to Gaza, including northern Gaza, and 600 trucks would deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza daily.

In the second phase, Hamas and Israel would negotiate the terms of a permanent end to hostilities. ""The ceasefire will still continue as long as negotiations continue,"" the president said.

The third phase would involve a major reconstruction plan for Gaza.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden on Friday said that Israel had proposed a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages, and urged Hamas to accept the new offer, stating that it was the most effective way to end the ongoing conflict.""It's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,"" said Biden, who is facing pressure during an election year to bring the eight-month-long Gaza conflict to a close.Despite mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar, and others, ceasefire negotiations between Israel and the militant group Hamas have repeatedly stalled, with both sides accusing each other of hindering progress. Neither the Israeli prime minister's office nor Hamas immediately responded to Biden's comments.The new proposal outlined by Biden on Friday consists of three phases.According to Biden, the proposal has been relayed to Hamas by Qatar.The president appealed to those in Israel who are advocating for an ""indefinite"" war ""indefinite"" to change their minds.""I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan. And will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some are even in the government coalition. They've made it clear. They want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years and hostages are not a priority for them. Well, I've urged leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes,"" Biden said.""As someone who's had a lifelong commitment to Israel, as the only American president who has ever gone to Israel at a time of war, as someone who just sent the U.S. forces to directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, I ask you to take a step back, think what will happen if this moment is lost. We can't lose this moment,"" he added.Several Israeli media outlets described Biden's speech as dramatic and interpreted it as an attempt to directly appeal to the Israeli public. Channel 12, a leading news channel, interrupted its evening news show to broadcast Biden's speech live. According to anchor Danny Kushmaro, Israel's censor had previously prohibited the publication of the offer's details.An earlier hostage proposal put forward this year called for the release of sick, elderly, and wounded hostages in Gaza in exchange for a six-week ceasefire that could be extended to allow for more aid to be delivered into the enclave. However, the proposed deal collapsed earlier this month after Israel refused to agree to Hamas' demand for a permanent end to the war as part of the negotiations and intensified its assault on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza.Hamas on Thursday said that it had informed mediators that it would not participate in further negotiations during ongoing aggression but was prepared for a ""complete agreement,"" including an exchange of hostages and prisoners, if Israel ended the war.According to a US official speaking on condition of anonymity, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan would meet on Friday with diplomats from 17 countries whose citizens are being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.A senior Israeli security official stated on Friday that Israel will not agree to any halt in fighting that is not part of a deal that includes the return of surviving hostages.The week has been dominated by the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike in Rafah on Sunday that killed 45 Palestinians.","US President Joe Biden said that Israel had proposed a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages.

Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said.

Those that started growing were infected with (parasite) black hopper,"" said Yusuf, who has worked half his life growing mangoes.Now over 60 years old, Yusuf said ""climate change has wreaked havoc"" in his village of Tando Allahyar, around 200 kilometres (124 miles) northeast of economic hub Karachi.Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP .Further south in Tando Ghulam Ali , Arsalan, who manages a 900-acre mango orchard, noticed the damage as soon as the harvest started this week.""We have production losses of 15 to 20 percent, and the picking has only just started so this figure will surely increase,"" said the 32-year-old.Exports will be slashed as a result warned Arsalan, who goes by one name.""The mangoes turn yellow from the outside but remain underripe or overripe inside,"" he explained.Ziaul Haq, a mango grower and exporter from Tando Ghulam Ali, said the ""many attacks on fruit"" by pests were unprecedented.""This, in our history, has never happened before,"" he told AFP.The proliferation of parasites has led to an explosion in spending on pesticides.This uptick was confirmed by several farmers in Sindh province, where Tando Allahyar and Tando Ghulam Ali are located, as well as those in the leading agricultural province of Punjab further north.They told that chemicals are now used six to seven times per year, compared to just twice three years ago.Farmers in Sindh said they have been struggling since 2022 when a series of severe heatwaves were followed by unprecedented flooding, while those in Punjab said the declining crops yields date back several years more.""The losses in Punjab reached 35 to 50 percent and in Sindh, 15 to 20 percent"" compared to last year, said Waheed Ahmed, head of the Pakistan Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association (PFVA).Speaking to local media, he said that last year Pakistan had only managed to export 1,00,000 of the 1,25,000 tonnes of mangoes it planned to sell abroad.Pakistan's 20 varieties of mangoes come second only to oranges as the most-produced fruit in the country.The income loss from a poor harvest could have a significant impact on the country, which is in talks to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Mashooq Ali, a 30-year-old labourer in Tando Ghulam Ali, wants the government to help farmers cope.""Landowners will earn less this year,"" said Ali, whose wife has started trading clothes to earn extra cash.""And even if they paid us as much as last year, with inflation, we won't be able to feed our families.""",Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP.

Those that started growing were infected with (parasite) black hopper,"" said Yusuf, who has worked half his life growing mangoes.Now over 60 years old, Yusuf said ""climate change has wreaked havoc"" in his village of Tando Allahyar, around 200 kilometres (124 miles) northeast of economic hub Karachi.Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP.Further south in Tando Ghulam Ali, Arsalan, who manages a 900-acre mango orchard, noticed the damage as soon as the harvest started this week.""We have production losses of 15 to 20 percent, and the picking has only just started so this figure will surely increase,"" said the 32-year-old.Exports will be slashed as a result warned Arsalan, who only goes by one name.""The mangoes turn yellow from the outside but remain underripe or overripe inside,"" he explained.Ziaul Haq, a mango grower and exporter from Tando Ghulam Ali, said the ""many attacks on fruit"" by pests were unprecedented.""This, in our history, has never happened before,"" he told AFP.'Feed our families'The proliferation of parasites has led to an explosion in spending on pesticides.This uptick was confirmed by several farmers in Sindh province, where Tando Allahyar and Tando Ghulam Ali are located, as well as those in the leading agricultural province of Punjab further north.They told AFP that chemicals are now used six to seven times per year, compared to just twice three years ago.Farmers in Sindh said they have been struggling since 2022 when a series of severe heatwaves were followed by unprecedented flooding, while those in Punjab said the declining crops yields date back several years more.""The losses in Punjab reached 35 to 50 percent and in Sindh, 15 to 20 percent"" compared to last year, said Waheed Ahmed, head of the Pakistan Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association (PFVA).Speaking to local media, he said that last year Pakistan had only managed to export 100,000 of the 125,000 tonnes of mangoes it planned to sell abroad.Pakistan's 20 varieties of mangoes come second only to oranges as the most-produced fruit in the country.The income loss from a poor harvest could have a significant impact on the country, which is in talks to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Mashooq Ali, a 30-year-old labourer in Tando Ghulam Ali, wants the government to help farmers cope.""Landowners will earn less this year,"" said Ali, whose wife has started trading clothes to earn extra cash.""And even if they paid us as much as last year, with inflation, we won't be able to feed our families.""",Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP.

NEW DELHI: A court in Pakistan has acquitted former Prime Minister Imran Khan in two cases related to the May 9 riots citing insufficient evidence.Khan's supporters, members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, were involved in vandalizing public property, including sensitive army installations, following his arrest in an alleged corruption case.The acquittal was granted by Judicial Magistrate Umar Shabbir of the district and sessions court of Islamabad. The court in its verdict said, ""Because of insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution, the PTI founder has been acquitted.""Back on May 15, Khan was also acquitted in two other cases related to the May 9 incidents. Judicial Magistrate Sahib Bilal approved Khan's plea challenging those cases, which had been filed at the Khanna police station in Islamabad. These cases were related to the long march and the violation of Article 144.Following Khan's detention, a large number of his followers and PTI workers vandalized several military installations. Targets included the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase, and the ISI building in Faisalabad. For the first time, the Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi was also attacked by the mob.Despite these acquittals, Khan, who is held in the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, faces multiple allegations connected to the violence that erupted after his arrest.","Imran Khan was acquitted in two cases related to the May 9 riots citing insufficient evidence.

However, they made their stance clear, refusing to leave the premises until they received a firm assurance regarding the supply of the promised six hours of electricity. The siege continued as the grid staff filed the report, unable to provide any assurance without the presence of responsible Tesco officials.Meanwhile, in a related incident, prisoners in the overcrowded Bara sub-jail also raised concerns about the suffocating conditions caused by excessive load shedding, as reported by Dawn.

Nawaz Sharif signals peace as India awaits new government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/nawaz-sharif-signals-peace-as-india-awaits-new-government/articleshow/110542804.cms,"NEW DELHI: While former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has in the past too accused his own country (read Pervez Musharraf ) of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999, his reiteration of the same on Tuesday is significant because of the timing. The elder Sharif, who is now the most powerful civilian leader in the country, spoke about Pakistan having sabotaged the agreement through its Kargil adventurism while taking back the reins of his ruling party after 6 years, and days before the outcome of the Indian elections.“Once Pakistan conducted five nuclear tests in reply to India’s [then Indian premier] Atal Bihari Vajpayee sahib came here and made a [peace] agreement with us ... but we violated it and it was our fault,” said Nawaz, after being re-elected PML-N president, according to the Dawn newspaper.Nawaz, whose brother Shehbaz Sharif is Pakistan PM, has long maintained that he learnt about Musharraf’s Kargil “misadventure” only from a phone call by his then counterpart A B Vajpayee and that the Pakistani military operation scuttled the peace process he had initiated with Vajpayee in the form of the Lahore Declaration early that year.The latest remarks by Nawaz, who has even otherwise been making favourable noises about ties with India, are seen as significant also because they come in the middle of Indian elections, and just before the results are declared on June 4. “It must be read as a significant signal from Pakistan’s currently most important civilian leader for India’s incoming government,” says former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria.Nawaz enjoys a strong rapport with Indian PM Narendra Modi and it was under him, in 2015, that the 2 countries last had a substantive bilateral engagement, although the comprehensive bilateral dialogue they launched to address all issues, including J&K and terrorism, was quickly undone by the Pathankot terrorist attack.The Sharif brothers may hope to break the deadlock in ties if the Modi government returns next week but, for India in that case, the onus will remain squarely on Islamabad to make the first move as it was Pakistan that recalled its high commissioner and called off trade ties, after India revoked the special status of J&K in 2019.There was a hint of some forward movement by Pakistan in March when foreign minister Ishaq Dar said Islamabad would seriously consider restoring trade ties with India. That Pakistan remains conflicted about ties with India was evident again when his own ministry quickly clarified there was no change in Pakistan’s position and that the responsibility to improve ties lied with India. Pakistan officially maintains that talks are possible only if India reverses its actions in Kashmir.No Indian government of course will accede to any such demand by Pakistan, except for working towards an early return to statehood as asked for by the Indian Supreme Court in a verdict last year that upheld the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state. For the Modi government, the judgment was an endorsement of its position that Pakistan is not a stakeholder in the internal administrative process of J&K. Pakistan of course maintains statehood and elections cannot be a substitute to the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination. Whether it can show any flexibility on the issue, without recourse to cross-border terrorism, may determine the road ahead if the Modi government indeed returns.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has accused his own country of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999.

We only had some gold jewellery with us. We tried to pawn that but it wasn't easy. The interest was too high.""The fate of Pauktaw's residents reflects a nationwide tragedy. Across Myanmar, around 2.7 million have been forced to flee by the civil war.- Looting -The AA has not allowed residents to live back in Pauktaw, citing the danger of more air or artillery strikes on the town, although it does allow them to come and go to pick up items.The man who spoke to AFP said he had returned to check on his house and found it partly in ruins, with the family statue of the Buddha fallen onto the floor.His savings box -- containing money for a Buddhist ritual for his children and for timber to repair a roof damaged by a cyclone last year -- was gone, he said.""I have lost all of that money,"" he said.""Everything in our house got stolen... my father's fishing nets were stolen,"" another woman said, also requesting anonymity.""I am a tailor, and luckily, I managed to save my sewing machines.""During the fighting, both sides looted houses and damaged buildings, according to local reports.In March, the AA said it would ""investigate"" any reports of looting by its members during the fighting.- 'Decisive battle' -The AA's offensive has seized swathes of territory in Rakhine state and along the border with India and Bangladesh.It has said it will capture state capital Sittwe, 25 kilometres from Pauktaw and the last major town in northern Rakhine in the military's hands.In April, the AA warned residents of the town, which is home to an India-backed deep sea port, to leave ahead of a ""decisive"" battle.Sittwe residents contacted by AFP said the military was restricting travel out of the town by road and river and the prices of basic foods such as rice and eggs had doubled.Those already displaced from Pauktaw fear further fighting nearby.""I am sad that we have fled our own house and we can't live in it,"" one resident told AFP.""I have pawned my necklace for 18 lakhs ($850) so we have money to live. I still hope I can claim it back.""Others said they wanted payback.""I haven't joined the Arakan Army because I am worried about who will look after my child,"" one woman said.""If I wasn't...

"WHO sounds alarm over adolescents' exposure to tobacco ads, products in Southeast Asia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/who-sounds-alarm-over-adolescents-exposure-to-tobacco-ads-products-in-southeast-asia/articleshow/110571223.cms,"NEW DELHI: On the eve of the 'World No Tobacco Day', WHO Regional Director for Southeast Asia Saima Wazed expressed concern over children and adolescents in the region being regularly exposed to digital marketing of tobacco products , despite preventive policies and regulations in place.A generational tobacco ban, leading to a ""tobacco-free generation"" would be a huge step forward for the region, Wazed said.""The fight against tobacco is particularly important for us in South-East Asia. The tobacco industry 's targeting of youth is rampant across our member states. As a result, we have a very worrying 11 million adolescents using various tobacco products. Coupled with the approximate 411 million adult tobacco users, our region, unfortunately, has the highest number of adolescent and adult users globally,"" Wazed said in a statement.The tobacco industry lures youths by aggressively introducing new nicotine and tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products, which are becoming increasingly popular among the youths in the region, she said.This multibillion-dollar industry recruits new tobacco users to reward their investors with even more profits. To achieve this, it preys on children and adolescents through marketing tactics, targeting them with new products, Wazed stated.""It is worrying that children and adolescents are regularly exposed to the digital marketing of tobacco products. This is despite having policies and regulations in place to prevent this,"" she said.""This situation is likely to get worse, as youngsters spend more time on social media and other similar platforms,"" Wazed said, highlighting that personalised and targeted advertising by the industry appears to dominate here, exposing them to harm.This year's theme for World No Tobacco Day is 'Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference'.The tobacco industry is fast to launch new products, using every means to expand market share before the regulations can catch up, she said.It continues to oppose evidence-based measures, such as increases in excise taxes, and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorships. The companies even threaten legal action against governments that try to protect the health of their citizens, the WHO regional director added.Wazed pointed out that the response from governments and institutions lags in the matter.""Our efforts are complicated by the rapid changes in the marketing strategies of the tobacco industry,"" she said, emphasising that the relevant provisions of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) '? including Article 5.3 '? should be implemented in letter and spirit.Also, necessary tools and support are urgently needed to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the WHO FCTC recommendations in 'online' settings, she added.""Our goal for our youth is clear. We want to prevent and reduce tobacco consumption, nicotine addiction, and exposure to new tobacco products. To do this, we need a multi-stakeholder approach to frame and implement legislation, policies, regulations and administrative measures,"" the WHO's South-East Asia director said.""This approach needs to cast a wide net. We should engage with all relevant government departments, UN and intergovernmental organisations, civil society, the private sector, academia, and the community, including students, teachers and parents,"" she added.A generational tobacco ban, leading to a ""tobacco-free generation"" would be a huge step forward for the region, Wazed stressed, adding, ""For this to happen, the WHO FCTC must be recognized as a legally binding international instrument by all our member states. This ban will require effective enforcement of existing policies, including confronting tobacco industry interference and institutional corruption surrounding the illicit tobacco trade.""","WHO Regional Director for Southeast Asia Saima Wazed expressed concern over children and adolescents in the region being regularly exposed to digital marketing of tobacco products.
