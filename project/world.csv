Amid reports that a Parkinson's disease expert visited the White House and met President Joe Biden's doctor in January, the White House Monday said the president is not being treated for Parkinson's disease. The press briefing turned chaotic as press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked to give clear answer on the visit of the Parkinson's specialist to which she strongly reacted and said she won't be able to divulge any name of experts for privacy and security reasons.She said Biden had seen a neurologist three times -- in three years -- connected to Biden's annual physical exams.Reports claimed not only in January, the neurologist visited the White House eight times, according to the visitors' log. The January meeting was with Biden's chief physician and a cardiologist.Dr Kevin Cannard , who works at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, has made early morning visits to the White House residence clinic seven times between July 2023 and March 2024 to meet with Megan Nasworthy, who coordinates primary care visits for the 81-year-old president and his family, New York Post reported.The eighth visit took place on January 17 where Dr Cannard met Biden's chief physician Dr Kevin O'Connor and cardiologist Dr John E Atwood. Cannard also met at the White House with Joshua Simmons, an emergency medical specialist at Walter Reed, in November 2022, the report said.The press secretary once again said that Biden did not have any medical examination after the debate. She explained that President's medical unit is right there in the White House and he does a verbal check with them several times a week.Karine said she will not confirm any name -- be it a dermatologist or a neurologist no matter how much she is pressed on the issue. ""We have to keep their privacy. I think they would appreciate this too..."" she said adding that there are many military personnel receiving treatment in the White House.",Reports claimed a Parkinson's disease expert visited the White House and met President Joe Biden's doctor in January.

'Justifying terrorism': Russian playwright and director held for playing Islamic State wives play,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/justifying-terrorism-russian-playwright-and-director-held-for-playing-islamic-state-wives-play/articleshow/111592175.cms,"A Russian military court sentenced playwright Svetlana Petriychuk and theater director Yevgenia Berkovich to six years in prison on Monday, finding them guilty of ""justifying terrorism "" through their play ""Finist the Brave Falcon.""Petriychuk, 44, and Berkovich, 39, have been in custody since May 2023. They were accused of promoting terrorism through their adaptation of a classic fairy tale, which tells the stories of Russian women lured online to join the Islamic State group.Prosecutor Ekaterina Denisova claimed Petriychuk held ""extremely aggressive Islamic ideologies"" and that Berkovich justified and propagated terrorism. The court also banned both women from ""administering websites"" for three years after their release.""Finist the Brave Falcon"" premiered in 2020 and won two Golden Mask awards, the highest honor in Russian theater. The play's main character, feeling betrayed by her recruiter, returns to Russia only to be imprisoned as a terrorist. Both Petriychuk and Berkovich insisted the play had an anti-terror message.""I absolutely do not understand what this set of words has to do with me,"" said Berkovich, when she pleaded not guilty. ""I have never partaken in any forms of Islam: neither radical nor any other. I have respect for the religion of Islam, and I feel nothing but condemnation and disgust toward terrorists.""The trial, held partly behind closed doors, heightened concerns about freedom of expression in Russia. Defense lawyer Ksenia Karpinskaya described the hearing as ""absolutely illegal"" and ""unfair,"" pledging to appeal despite ""little hope.""The case has been condemned by prominent Russian intellectuals and performers, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry A. Muratov and actress Yulia Peresild. Supporters suggest Berkovich'sprosecution may be linked to her critical poems about Russia's military offensive in Ukraine.Since the invasion of Ukraine, Russia's artistic community has faced increasing pressure from the Kremlin. The crackdown has effectively criminalized anti-war sentiment, and more than 99% of criminal trials in Russia result in convictions.The sentencing occurs amid recent deadly attacks by Islamist militants in Moscow and Dagestan, with the Kremlin suggesting unsubstantiated links to Ukraine. The case exemplifies the broader repression of dissent and artistic expression in Russia, drawing international attention and criticism.","A Russian military court sentences playwright and theater director to six years in prison.

The party would then begin a primary stint in which the six candidates will pledge to run campaigns in the month leading up to the convention. The “blitz primary” would involve weekly forums with each candidate moderated by cultural icons (Michelle Obama, Oprah, and Taylor Swift are among the names floated in the memo) in order to engage voters, Semafor reported.

With a clear reference to that, a secret but detailed memo is being circulated among the Democrats saying, ""Lord helps those who help themselves"".

Or Democrats can make this Our Finest Hour,” the memo says.Biden said Monday that he is committed to staying in the presidential race because he knows he can defeat Donald Trump.

Go ahead, announce for president. Challenge me at the convention,” an angry Biden raged in a phone-in to MSNBC's Morning Joe, a sympathetic platform, saying “I don’t care what those big names think,” and talk of turfing him out is ""driving me nuts.""In his letter to party lawmakers, Biden said he was not blind to concerns being expressed in various fora but insisted “I wouldn’t be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.”He said Democratic voters had spoken during the primaries, and it was their decision to have him run -- “not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors.”The President's defiant stand came hours after several lawmakers reportedly told the party's Congressional leadership that Biden should step aside. Although only five lawmakers have publicly called for Biden to withdraw from the presidential race , those who are still backing him are said to be shrinking in numbers.Polls -- and public figures aligned with the Democratic Party -- are also suggesting that Biden should withdraw, and do it quickly, so that the party can nominate a new challenger to Trump before the party convention in Chicago on August 19.""Joe Biden has been a fine president, but it’s time for him—in the interests of the America he so clearly loves—to announce he will not run for re-election,"" the writer Stephen King, a fierce Trump critic, tweeted on Monday.Liberal media maven Michael Moore is among those pressing for Biden's withdrawal, saying putting him up to such scrutiny is the ""cruelest form of elder abuse.""""He was in epic distress that Thursday night (at the debate). Every cognitive default in his mind seemed to be shutting down. If this had been somebody that you truly cared about, loved, embraced, what would you have done? Would you have seriously even let him go out on that stage? Who would send an 81 year old out onto any stage to debate a living monster at nine o’clock at night for a brawl that would not end until 10:42 p.m.?"" Moore said in a podcast.Biden still has his supporters although the numbers are fading. Many of them expressed outrage that while the President's every move every hour is being subjected to such intense scrutiny, the media was giving a free pass to Trump, who has rarely been seen in public this past week.Biden himself took as shot at Trump, saying he (Trump) hasn't done anything in 10 days except for ""riding around a golf cart in Mar-a-Lago with his wealthy friends.""

Biden knows he can defeat Trump

If anyone has a problem with Biden's candidacy, challenge

President Joe Biden started the week with a bang -- first shooting off a letter to Democrats in doubt over his candidacy and then appearing on NBC's Morning Joe where he vigorously stamped out the growing criticism inside the party about his age, health etc. In a contrast to a shaky Biden, the president appeared firm and resolute as he said he does not care about what the elite donors are saying; he knows he can defeat Donald Trump and that's why he is in the race.From his letter and his statement at Morning Joe, three things became clear:As the White House and Joe Biden said earlier, the president is not opting out of the race.After his CNN debate followed by the debate on the ABC News which did little damage control, rumblings that Biden need to be replaced by a younger candidate grew louder with prominent donors threatening to withdraw their support. Now it's clear that Biden is not getting anywhere.""We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump,"" Biden wrote in his letter.Biden addressed the growing concerns over his health and said he is grateful for the rock-solid, steadfast support from many Democrats. ""I can respond to all this by saying clearly and unequivocally: I wouldn't be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024,"" he wrote in his letter.On Morning Joe, he said he is frustrated by the elites in the party.He asked what Donald Trump has done in the last 10 days. ""He's been riding around a golf cart in Mar-a-Lago with his wealthy friends. I'm not running because of the rich guys. I'm running for the American people.

Canada Police believes that the gold stolen last year in Canada's biggest-ever gold heist must have gone to India and Dubai gold markets. Over 6,500 gold bars disappeared overseas after being stolen from an airport, the department believes.

Mike Mavity said.""That would be Dubai, or India, where you can take gold with serial numbers on it, and they will still honor it and melt it down,"" the investigator said.Nine individuals were arrested in connection with the meticulously planned heist including a former Air Canada manager and a jewelry store owner. The suspects used a completed bill for a seafood pick-up to forge paperwork that was given to a warehouse attendant. A small amount of precious metal was probably melted down in the basement of a Mississauga jewelry store immediately after the heist. Only 90,000 Canadian dollars were recovered from the heist.Canada cops described the heist as Netflix material as a lot of daring planning went behind it. The robbery was staged in an Air Canada cargo facility within the Toronto Pearson International Airport.A man gained entry to an Air Canada cargo terminal with a duplicate waybill for a shipment of seafood and then drove off with a palette full of gold bars. The heist was busted a year later. India-origin men Parmpal Sidhu, Archit Grover, Amit Jalota were among the arrested.The gold container arrived on the Air Canada flight from Switzerland to Toronto. It had 22 million Canadian dollars in gold bars and foreign currency. A day after the cargo arrived, it was reported missing. Police said at least two former Air Canada employees assisted the theft.Parmpal Sidhu was working at the Air Canada Cargo terminal during the heist; Archit Grover is a longtime friend of Sidhu and Amit Jalota is Grover's cousin.","Over 6,500 gold bars disappeared overseas after being stolen from an airport.

A massive heat wave is set to bring a new set of record-breaking temperatures to the US West Coast , while millions of Americans endure a heat dome that is also affecting Arizona and Nevada.The national weather service reported on Sunday that around 36 million people, or about 10% of the nation's population, are under excessive heat warnings resulting from the heat dome centered over California.Research indicates that climate change is responsible for driving extreme heat waves worldwide and will persist in delivering hazardous weather for years to come.An additional 36 million people are under heat advisories, while approximately 1 million people face excessive heat watches, including areas in eastern Oregon, northeastern Nevada, and southwestern Idaho.According to NWS meteorologist Bryan Jackson, temperatures in locations such as Redding, a city in northern California that reached an all-time high of 119 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) on Saturday, are running up to 20 degrees above normal for this time of year.""We're expecting it to merely drift east through the early part of next week and basically persist through the week, so we've got a real expansive and extreme heat wave ongoing, and it's expected to continue this week,"" he said.In places like Washington state, Oregon, California, northern Arizona, and central Idaho, high temperatures are predicted to meet or surpass daily high records.Heat warnings indicate that conditions are imminent, which is different from watches that are issued when conditions are predicted in the upcoming days.Last week, the administration of US President Joe Biden proposed the first-ever safety standard aimed at protecting workers and communities from the effects of extreme heat.Earth experienced record-high temperatures for 13 consecutive months, with June 2024 marking the 12th straight month of global temperatures 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to Copernicus.

Despite hopes that the record-setting heat may subside, climate disruptions will persist.The June global temperature averaged 62°F, the highest for any June, and the third hottest month recorded. Extreme heat affected regions like southeast Europe and the US The oceans have also been breaking heat records for 15 months. Long-term greenhouse gas emissions and factors like El Niño contribute to the rising temperatures. Scientists warn that the planet is on a path to 3°C warming unless emissions are curbed. This crisis highlights the growing impact of climate change, with more frequent and severe weather events, posing risks to both the wealthy and the poor.","Earth experienced record-high temperatures for 13 consecutive months, with June 2024 marking the 12th straight month of global temperatures 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

He has great marks. He's going to be going to college soon. And we're looking at some colleges that are different [than] they were two months ago,"" Trump said in May.Though Barron Trump remains far away from politics, he is Internet's curiosity and more so recently because of a controversy over cryptocurrency DJT meme coin which was attributed to Barron Trump without any evidence. It was reported that Barron Trump amassed a huge amount of money through the crypto token.Barron was last seen with his father at the Golf Course where his father was hurling abuses on Joe Biden and Kamala Harris -- as seen in a leaked video. Though Barron was seen sitting silently beside his father, social media at least got to know that Barron probably shares father's hobby of golf.It is for Barron that Melania Trump is very concerned and does not want to be a full time first lady if Trump re-enters the White House.

He explained, ""I wanted to share with you background on why Dr Kevin Cannard visited the White House.To protect patient privacy for the thousands of patients of the White House Medical Unit and the physicians who treat them, normally we do not disclose the names of the specialists we work with. However, in the interests of accuracy, I have obtained permission from the President and Dr Cannard to confirm the details I am sharing.""Dr O'Connor also disclosed that as part of Biden's annual physical, the President sees a team of specialists covering various areas, including Optometry, Dentistry, Orthopedics (Foot and Ankle), Orthopedics (Spine), Physical Therapy, Neurology, Sleep Medicine, Cardiology, Radiology, and Dermatology.Connor also released the findings of Biden's health exam conducted in February.Furthermore, Dr O'Connor shared the findings of Biden's health exam conducted in February. The report stated, ""An extremely detailed neurologic exam was again reassuring in that there were no findings which would be consistent with any cerebellar or other central neurological disorder, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's or ascending lateral sclerosis, nor are there any signs of cervical myelopathy. This exam did again support a finding of peripheral neuropathy in both feet. No motor weakness was detected.""The report also noted, ""He exhibits no tremor, either at rest or with activity. He demonstrates excellent fine motor dexterity. But a subtle difference in heat/cold sensation could be elicited as it was last year. This heat/cold sensation deficit was detected a couple of inches higher on his ankle/calf this year, which is not unexpected. There may, in fact, be day to day subjective variation of these findings, as during last year's exam, this area of sensation deficit was actually found to be smaller than the year before.""Administration officials have attributed his perplexed and sometimes incomprehensible responses during the debate with Republican Donald Trump to a head cold, jet lag, and inadequate preparation at Camp David. However, at 81 years old, Biden's health has emerged as a significant concern for many voters as the November election approaches.","US President Joe Biden's doctor released a statement addressing concerns about the President's health following the June 27 presidential debate.

Texas officials warned it might take several days to restore electricity. The storm, now downgraded to a tropical storm, caused significant damage by toppling transmission lines and trees, complicating restoration efforts. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, acting governor, emphasized the extensive work required to return power.“We’re not past any difficult conditions,” said acting governor Dan Patrick, adding that it would be a ""multiple day process to get power restored.""Parts of coastal Texas were evacuated amid warnings of severe flooding and power outages as Hurricane Beryl neared landfall. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported wind speeds of 70 miles per hour, predicting the storm would regain hurricane status before hitting the coast. Houston Mayor John Whitmire urged residents to stay alert, noting that conditions could change dramatically overnight.""We have to take Beryl very, very seriously. Our worst enemy is complacency,"" said John Whitmire the mayor of Houston.Houston faced severe impacts, with CenterPoint Energy reporting over 2 million homes and businesses without power. The company is deploying thousands of additional workers to prioritize power restoration for critical facilities such as nursing homes and assisted living centers.

Trump's running mate?

The frontrunners on the former President's mind are either North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum or Senator JD Vance from Ohio, barring a last-minute surprise, New York Post reported quoting insiders.Trump 2024 senior adviser Jason Miller informed Fox News on Monday that the VP choice would be revealed by next Monday.The leading candidates for the GOP's VP slot are Doug Burgum, 67, and JD. Vance, 39, with Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) having a slim chance. Other potential candidates like Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and former HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson are unlikely to be chosen, with one source stating there was ""no way"" Trump, 78, would pick Carson.While Burgum and Vance have been leading the list of potential running mates, Trump and his campaign have been cautious not to reveal too much. The report suggested Burgum has a 50-50 chance of being selected, Vance has a 30% chance, and Rubio and others have a 10% chance each.The report quoted another source as telling that it would likely be JD, Marco, or Burgum, believing that one of these three would ultimately be selected.“I would give Burgum and JD a little more of an edge than Marco,” the source was quoted as telling, handicapping that “Marco still has a shot” and that “Burgum and JD have an equal shot.”Trump is known for keeping the public and his aides in suspense about staffing decisions. This selection process is expected to include false leaks to generate speculation and intrigue, similar to the last-minute surprises during his 2016 selection of then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.There are indications that any of the top three candidates could be chosen next week. Rubio is reportedly set to attend Trump’s rally at Doral, Florida, on Tuesday night, having adjusted his schedule to be there. Another rally in western Pennsylvania on Saturday could be an opportune moment for Trump to announce Vance, who represents neighboring Ohio, as his choice.However, Trump may announce his decision at any time and in any manner, whether during a nighttime campaign event or a morning post on Truth Social.“Who, when, and where will be decided by President Trump,” campaign spokesperson was quoted as saying.All three main VP candidates have been strong supporters of Trump throughout his re-election campaign and participated in the post-debate spin room activities at the June 27 CNN showdown in Atlanta","Trump 2024 senior adviser Jason Miller informed Fox News on Monday that the VP choice would be revealed by next Monday.

However, the Pentagon has not confirmed the origin of these objects.Classified US government technology: ThePentagon report dismissed the possibility of the UFOs being linked to classified US government or Pentagon projects. However, the advanced flight characteristics exhibited, such as accelerating to hypersonic speeds over 5 times the speed of sound and performing seemingly impossible maneuvers, suggest they could be experimental US aircraft not publicly acknowledged.Extraterrestrial Craft: While the Pentagon report did not mention extraterrestrials, some believe the UFOs could be alien spacecraft from distant planets or galaxies. However, the report concluded the evidence analyzed does not support the notion of alien originsNatural phenomena or misidentification: Some skeptics argue the UFO sightings could be caused by natural atmospheric phenomena, misidentification of known objects, or hoaxes.These revelations have prompted calls for greater transparency and further investigation into the nature of these unexplained phenomena. The US government has recently declassified several reports and videos showing unidentified objects performing maneuvers that defy current technological understanding.As the debate continues, experts and officials urge the public to keep an open mind.

Besieged by the detractors and also supporters urging him to opt out of the race, does Biden think Dark Brandon will come to his rescue?Dark Brandon was born on the Internet but was embraced by Joe Biden as Biden's cool alter-ego helped the party reach the youngsters with Biden's success stories.Dark Brandon has its line of merchandise -- quite popular among youngsters.According to reports, Dark Brandon came to existence during the 2020 election -- was created by Chinese illustrator Yang Quan. He visualized Biden as the laser-eyed super hero after he defeated Trump in the election but it was only in 2022 that Dark Brandon went places.Hours after Biden announced that Dark Brandon will be back, Biden supporters started sharing his byte on Morning Joe where Biden sounded resolute and defiant.“I’m getting frustrated by the elites in the party, ‘Oh, they know so much more,’” Biden said on the MSNBC morning show. “Any of these guys that don’t think I should run, run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention.”“I don’t think what those big names think,” Biden said. “They were wrong in 2020. They were wrong in 2022 about the red wave. They’re wrong in 2024.” “I am not letting up,” Biden said.“This is a guy who’s an extreme candidate. I can’t think of a candidate in my lifetime who’s been more extreme,"" the president said. ""He makes George Wallace look like a patriot.”The Morning Joe interview came as Biden released letter Monday morning addressed to the Democrats assuring them that he is in the race to win. ""The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it's time for it to end,"" Biden says. ""We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us.

Pakistan will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue: Finance minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-will-continue-to-seek-imf-bailouts-if-it-fails-to-boost-tax-revenue-finance-minister/articleshow/111580232.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has warned that the cash-strapped country will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue , according to a media report on Monday. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader in an interview with the the UK-based Financial Times newspaper said that he was ""relatively confident"" of reaching a staff-level agreement with the Washington-based global lender this month for an estimated loan of $6-8 billion.Aurangzeb, however, said, ""It will not be our last fund programme if we don't bring our tax revenues up.""Last month, the federal government passed the tax-laden Rs 18,877 billion budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, amidst protests from the Opposition which labelled it as an International Monetary Fund-driven document that was harmful to the public.Weeks after slashing the fuel prices ahead of the Eid ul Adha festival, the cash-strapped Pakistan government on July 1 sharply hiked their prices for the next fortnight as it began the new fiscal year.The tax rises will mostly fall on salaried workers, who comprise a relatively small part of Pakistan's mostly informal economy , as well as some retail and export businesses, Geo News reported.The budget also threatened punitive measures for tax avoiders, including restrictions on mobile phones, gas and electricity access and the ability to fly abroad.""We do not have five years for our programme,"" Aurangzeb warned in the wake of a budget that seeks to reset the country's ailing economy. ""We have to start showing, start delivering, in the next two to three months,"" he said.The finance minister said the direction of travel is positive, and investors are showing confidence in the stock market , referring to the KSE-100 index.Still, the government faces a considerable challenge in putting Pakistan on the path for longer-term growth and debt sustainability , he said.The country's debt has soared since the mid-2000s, as authorities failed to invest the money from loans into productive and export-oriented sectors, Geo News reported.Instead, the country remains reliant on imports, forcing Islamabad to borrow to pay off existing and accumulating debts, Aurangzeb said.""We need to create the capacity to repay loans,"" the finance minister said. ""As long as this economy stays import-based, what happens is the moment it heats up, ""we run out of dollars [and] we have to go back to the lender of last resort on our knees.""Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has travelled recently to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China to solicit investments on top of the IMF programme, which would be Pakistan's 24th with the multilateral lender.","Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb says Pakistan will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue.

The allocation for PSEs in the 2024-25 budget saw a dramatic increase, reaching PKR 1.267 trillion, largely earmarked for subsidies and grants, marking a 104 per cent surge from the previous fiscal year.The State Bank of Pakistan 's latest report reveals a notable decrease in PSE borrowing during FY23, contrasting sharply with the PKR 43.5 billion borrowed in FY24 alone, adding to the existing debt burden. Despite receiving substantial funding from the ADB, which initiated the USD 300 million Public Sector Enterprises Reform Programme (PSERP) in 2016, aimed at enhancing corporate governance and operational efficiency, meaningful reforms have been elusive.Former finance minister Ishaq Dar, during his tenure, committed to improving PSE performance, particularly in sectors like railways, Pakistan Steel, and Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). However, the political sensitivity surrounding the privatisation of major PSEs, significant employers in a job-scarce economy, has hindered progress on critical economic reforms.""The ADB's support began with a USD 300 million loan for sub-programme one in June 2016, followed by an additional USD 300 million for sub-programme two in 2017, aimed at sustaining and expanding initial reform efforts,"" noted an ADB report. Despite these efforts, the transformation of loss-making entities such as PIA and Pakistan Steel remains a contentious issue, highlighting the challenges of balancing economic imperatives with political realities, according to Dawn.Many PSEs continue to rely heavily on government subsidies and credit guarantees to maintain operations, underscoring persistent governance and accountability deficiencies. The ADB's objectives included enhancing transparency, performance management, and revenue generation in PSEs, aligning their operations with commercial principles to improve service delivery and financial sustainability.The failure to implement comprehensive reforms has perpetuated the financial woes of PSEs, jeopardising fiscal stability and inhibiting broader economic development, Dawn reported.

Pakistan: Punjab province urges social media shutdown amid security concerns during Muharram,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-punjab-province-urges-social-media-shutdown-amid-security-concerns-during-muharram/articleshow/111540176.cms,"Pakistan 's Punjab government has requested country's interior ministry for a 'temporary suspension' on social media platforms from July 6-11 during Muharram processions, Dawn reported.The home department of Punjab province has sent a letter to the Pakistan's interior ministry recommending the suspension of popular social media applications such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok.However, the final decision on the social media shutdown request lies with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , as it has not been definitively approved or denied at this stage.Heightened security measures are currently underway across various regions of the Islamic Republic, as reported by Pakistmedia.It has been reported that 502 locations in Punjab have been identified as sensitive areas, prompting the deployment of army and Rangers personnel.On Saturday, the Punjab government implemented Section 144 throughout the province for Muharram due to perceived risks to public peace, sectarian unity, and overall law and order. Sensitive cities like Karachi have made extensive preparations for Muharram.Muharram holds profound significance forShia Muslims . However, Pakistan has faced recurrent sectarian violence during this period between Sunni and Shia communities.On January 19, 2007, a suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Quetta during Muharram prayers, resulted in 15 deaths and numerous injuries. On December 28, 2009, in Karachi, a suicide bombing targeting a Muharram procession claimed the lives of 43 people and injured over 100. Another bombing during a Muharram procession in Rawalpindi on November 21, 2012, resulted in the deaths of at least 23 people and injured over 60.The Pakistan government's inability to effectively mitigate these threats has exacerbated the situation, leading to deadly incidents targeting Shia gatherings. Extremist factions exploit social media platforms during sensitive religious periods like Muharram to propagate hate speech and incite violence.","The home department of Punjab province has sent a letter to the Pakistan's interior ministry recommending the suspension of popular social media applications such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok.

Imran Khan to go on hunger strike over lack of confidence in chief justice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-to-go-on-hunger-strike-over-lack-of-confidence-in-chief-justice/articleshow/111522851.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to go on hunger strike over his lack of confidence in the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Qazi Faez Isa , and if the ill-treatment meted out to him in prison continues, said Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians who met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Friday.Speaking to media after meeting Khan, the PTI politicians warned that if the injustice continues the party's founder will go on hunger strike.“If the party’s founder goes on a hunger strike in jail, it will trigger a nationwide hunger strike,” said Shamim Naqvi, a PTI politician from Karachi.Imran cited ongoing concerns over Justice Isa’s involvement in benches handling PTI cases and his personal cases. He emphasised the concerns expressed by his legal team about the CJ’s infrequent attendance, reflecting a growing sentiment in his camp that justice might not be administered fairly in these circumstances.Imran also expressed disappointment over a cancelled meeting with his legal and political teams. The superintendent, allegedly at the request of a jailed colonel, denied Khan’s team access, citing operational reasons.“They (Pakistan’s powerful military authorities) are mistaken; they think my party will weaken. They don't realize that the party with the strongest voter base remains strong,” Imran said while asserting his party’s resilience.He emphasised that the IMF cannot solve the country’s issues and that the solution lies in fair and transparent elections. “The entire nation states that the biggest fraud (Feb 2024 national and provincial polls) occurred, yet the chief justice is defending the election commission. The electoral watchdog has committed the greatest fraud in the country. We are seeking justice. If investigations proceed, the chief election commissioner will face Article 6 (guilty of high treason).”“I will never succumb to the tyranny of time; I am prepared to die in jail. As long as I live, I will wage this battle,” Imran remarked.About national security, he highlighted the necessity of a strong relationship with Afghanistan. “Why did Bilawal Bhutto and our foreign minister not visit Afghanistan? Without support from the Afghan govt, we cannot win this war (against TTP) across a 2,500-km-long border,” he added.","Imran cites ongoing concerns over Justice Isa’s involvement in benches handling PTI cases and his personal cases.
