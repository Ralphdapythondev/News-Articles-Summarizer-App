"Shanghai on red alert as Typhoon Bebinca makes landfall, strongest in decades",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/shanghai-on-red-alert-as-typhoon-bebinca-makes-landfall-strongest-in-decades/articleshow/113378555.cms,"Typhoon Bebinca struck Shanghai early Monday, as reported by Chinese state media . The city is under a red alert due to the severe weather conditions, including powerful winds and heavy rainfall .The typhoon made landfall in Shanghai, a metropolis with a population of almost 25 million, at approximately 7.30 am. local time (2330 GMT). The powerful storm system brought fierce winds, with maximum sustained speeds of 151 kilometers per hour (94 miles per hour) near its center.Meteorologists say that Typhoon Bebinca could be the strongest to hit Shanghai since 1949.In response to the typhoon, Shanghai authorities have taken precautionary measures. Coastal residents in certain areas have been evacuated to safer locations. Additionally, numerous air travelers have been impacted by the cancellation of hundreds of flights at Shanghai's two airports since Sunday evening. Additionally, some train services have been halted at the Shanghai railway station. The disruptions coincide with China's ongoing three-day public holiday, the mid-Autumn Festival. Also, popular tourist destinations, including the renowned Shanghai Disney Resort , have been shut down until further notice.Bebinca left a trail of destruction, claiming the lives of six people in the central and southern regions of the Philippines due to falling trees. The storm also impacted Japan before making its way to China.According to local broadcaster CCTV, Bebinca is forecasted to continue its northwesterly path, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the Chinese provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui.Shanghai rarely experienced the full force of powerful typhoons, which typically strike the southern regions of China. Last week, the devastating Yagi , classified as a Category 4 storm, unleashed its fury, killing at least 2, as it swept past the southern province of Hainan.As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, which scientists believe are contributing to climate change and the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, China is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of storms like Bebinca.","Typhoon Bebinca made landfall in Shanghai at approximately 7.30 am. local time (2330 GMT) The powerful storm system brought fierce winds, with maximum sustained speeds of 151 kilometers per hour (94 miles per hour) near its center.

China censors allow a Ye gig amid economic woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-censors-allow-a-ye-gig-amid-economic-woes/articleshow/113378507.cms,"BEIJING: When the news broke that Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West , would be performing in China on Sunday, the elation of many of his fans was mixed with another emotion: confusion. Why would the notoriously prickly Chinese govt let in the notoriously provocative Ye? Why was the listening party, as Ye calls his shows, taking place not in Beijing or Shanghai, but in Hainan, an obscure island province? Under a trending hashtag on Weibo on the subject, one popular comment read simply, ""How?"" alongside an exploding-head emoji.The answer may lie in China's struggling economy.Since China reopened its borders after three years of Covid lockdowns, the govt has been trying to stimulate consumer spending and promote tourism. Even before the pandemic, the number of big-name foreign entertainers visiting China had been falling as authorities tightened controls on speech. Acts such as Bon Jovi and Maroon 5 had shows abruptly cancelled, leading to speculation that band members' expressions of support for causes like Tibetan independence were to blame. Justin Bieber was barred from China in 2017 over what the Beijing city govt, without specifying, called ""bad behaviour.""Ye might have seemed like a no-go, too. Chinese authorities declared war on hip-hop in 2018, with the state media saying that artists who insulted women and promoted drug use ""don't deserve a stage."" But in Ye's case, objections to hip-hop may have been outweighed by the potential payoff - especially for Hainan.For years, the govt has sought to turn Hainan, an island roughly the size of Maryland or Belgium, into an international commercial hub. It offers visa-free entry and duty-free shopping, and has pledged to attract more world-class cultural events. Sheng Zou, a media scholar, said enforcement of censorship was capricious. ""When it comes to Ye, I guess his celebrity status may outweigh his identity as a hip-hop artist.""","Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, will be performing in China on Sunday.

In the images, the utilitarian bins come to life with carefully arranged accessories - cameras, headphones, tickets. Some displays get elaborate, adding designer purses and makeup, while others simply arrange commonplace items in a nicer way.A recent video showed a creator's monochrome variations for different cities. Others opt to display the contents of their gadget-filled personal carry-on item or their favourite book. For Hitha Palepu , the author of ""How to Pack: Travel Smart for Any Trip"", the trend is one of her ""biggest travel pet peeves and icks"" for several reasons: inconsideration of fellow travellers and security staff, ""gross"" hygiene and an unrealistic portrayal of the messy - and often stressful - realities of travel. (A 2018 study found that the plastic trays carry more cold germs than airport toilets.)As if the base line anxiety of travel weren't enough to deal with, adding ""annoyed"" to the roster of emotions might send some travellers like Celeste Hernandez, 27, over the edge. ""The way I'm waiting for TSA to yell at me just because I'm taking my sweater off,"" she said, en route to Houston from New York. But some said onlookers were too quick to be grumpy about the latest influencer trend.

A video on this topic was a marketing attempt by Sarin Jivalagian, the founder of an online store for vintage bags . She and her friends arranged a photoshoot on some benches after the security line at Hollywood Burbank Airport in California. Some people jumped to conclusions, she said, assuming that she had been holding up the line. ""Did you do this in Des Moines, Iowa?""

The poll , conducted over two days after the showdown, shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 42%—a five-point margin that has expanded since late August.The debate, marked by sharp exchanges and personal attacks, saw Harris relentlessly press Trump on his fitness for office and ongoing legal troubles.Polling suggests voters saw her as the clear winner, with 53% believing Harris outperformed Trump, compared to just 24% who backed Trump’s performance. A CNN flash poll painted an even starker picture, with 60% of viewers saying Harris dominated the stage.Pundits were quick to declare Harris the victor, noting how she repeatedly backed Trump into a corner. According to Reuters , Harris ""put Trump on the defensive with a barrage of attacks on his record and legal woes,"" a view echoed by 52% of poll respondents who felt Trump struggled to keep up.For Harris, the poll is a welcome rebound after a recent New York Times/Siena College survey—widely regarded as highly accurate—showed her trailing Trump by a single point. That poll had put Trump at 48% to Harris' 47%, a razor-thin margin that had fueled anxiety within Democratic circles.Despite the positive numbers, the race remains tight, with battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin holding the keys to the White House. National polls, while promising, offer only a snapshot of the larger fight for electoral votes.In a bid to capitalize on her debate momentum, Harris' campaign swiftly challenged Trump to a second face-off, with Fox News offering to host the rematch. “Vice President Harris is ready for round two.

Retirement age raised

'An inevitable choice'

NEW DELHI: In a major indication that alarm bells are going off in Beijing due to an impending demographic crisis that could potentially have severe impact on its economy , healthcare and social welfare systems, China's top legislative body on Friday announced plans to raise the country's retirement age .The development also comes as reports have highlighted that over 22,000 kindergartens have been closed across China in the past two years due to plummeting birth rates, with some turning into nursing homes to tend to the elderly.A slowing economy, shrinking government benefits and a decades-long one-child policy have created a creeping demographic crisis in China. China's pension pot is also running dry and the country is running out of time to build enough of a fund to care for the growing number of elderly.Over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce . This is the country's largest age group, nearly equivalent to the size of the US population.Significantly, the national population fell in 2023 for the second year in a row.Reform is urgent with life expectancy in China having risen to 78 years as of 2021 from about 44 years in 1960 and projected to exceed 80 years by 2050.The number of people aged 60 and older is projected to rise dramatically, with estimates suggesting that this demographic will account for about 30% of the population by 2035, up from 14.2% in 2021.At the same time, the working population needed to support the elderly is shrinking.The decision to raise the retirement age, marks the first such adjustment since the 1970s and accelerates an overhaul of decades-old laws to tackle the economic pressure of a shrinking workforce.China's retirement ages are currently among the lowest globally.The retirement age will be raised for men to 63 years old from 60, while for women in white collar work it would be raised to 58 years from 55. For women in blue collar work it will be adjusted to 55 from 50.The changes will come into effect from January 1, 2025 and will be implemented over the next 15 years with incremental adjustments occurring every few months.""Starting 2030, the minimum year of basic pension contributions required to receive monthly benefits will also be gradually raised from 15 years to 20 years at the pace of an increase of six months annually,"" said news agency Xinhua. By 2039, they would have to clock 20 years of contributions to access their pensions.The new rules will also allow Chinese people ""to postpone retirement to an even later date if they reach an agreement with employers"".Retiring before the statutory age will not be allowed, state news agency Xinhua reported, although people can extend their retirement by no more than three years.The demographic crisis poses severe risks to China's economy, particularly regarding the pension system. A report from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences projected that the state pension fund could be depleted by 2035 if no reforms are enacted. The increasing number of retirees, coupled with a declining birth rate, places immense pressure on the pension system, which relies on a robust workforce to support an expanding elderly population.By extending the retirement age, the government aims to alleviate some of this pressure. Delaying retirement can help stabilise the labour force participation rate and reduce the financial burden on the pension system. Moreover, it allows for a larger tax base to support social welfare programs, which is crucial as the population ages.But delaying pension payouts and requiring older workers to stay at their jobs longer may not be welcomed by all.""In the next 10 years, there will be another bill that will delay retirement until we are 80,"" one user wrote on a Chinese social media site Weibo.Further, many younger workers fear that an expanded labour pool will intensify competition for jobs, particularly as youth unemployment rates have soared to alarming levels. In July 2024, the jobless rate for those aged 16 to 24 reached 17.1%, raising concerns about the economic prospects for younger generations""What a miserable year! Middle-aged workers are faced with pay cuts and raised retirement ages. Those who are unemployed find it increasingly difficult to get jobs,"" another chimed in.However, Mo Rong, director of the Chinese Academy of Labour and Social Security, told the People's Daily that raising the retirement age was ""an inevitable choice for our country to adapt to the new normal of population development"".","China's top legislative body on Friday announced plans to raise the country's retirement age.

Did Royal family remove Meghan Markle from Prince Harry's birthday post?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-royal-family-remove-meghan-markle-from-prince-harrys-birthday-post/articleshow/113378712.cms,"On the occasion of Prince Harry 's 40th birthday , the offices of King Charles and Prince William extended their well-wishes publicly for the first time in three years via social media platforms X and Instagram.However, the posts inadvertently drew attention to the ongoing tensions between the Sussexes and the Royal Family , particularly about Meghan Markle The birthday messages featured a photograph of Harry from a 2018 visit to Dublin but notably omitted Meghan, who had been present beside him in the original image.This subtle exclusion served to highlight the strained relationship between Meghan and the Royal Family, despite the apparent olive branch of the public birthday greetings.Both royal households clarified that the posts were in keeping with 'tradition,' which dictates acknowledging significant birthdays of non-working royals. This practice had been observed for Meghan's 40th birthday and Prince Andrew's 60th, irrespective of the controversies surrounding them.The complex and often fraught relationship between the Sussexes and the Royal Family has been evident since their departure from royal duties in 2020. While the birthday messages appear amicable, they come after months of silence and distancing by royal officials, who have been guarded in addressing matters related to Harry and Meghan. Insiders have indicated that King Charles remains open to reconciliation but is cautious of further public leaks or media scrutiny.The relationship between Harry and his brother, Prince William, is said to be more fractured, with the two not having communicated for over two years due to Harry's public criticism of his brother and sister-in-law, Catherine. Although Harry has expressed a desire to maintain some connections with the UK through his charitable work, he has no intention of resuming royal duties, further complicating any potential reconciliation.The public birthday wishes , while adhering to royal tradition, serve as a poignant reminder of the deep divide between Meghan, Harry, and the Royal Family, with both parties seemingly navigating their interactions with great care.","Prince Harry's 40th birthday was celebrated with a public message from King Charles and Prince William.

Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Saturday that he is under federal investigation related to a 1994 incident involving a whale. Speaking at a campaign event for former President Donald Trump in Glendale, Arizona, Kennedy revealed he received a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) regarding allegations that he unlawfully collected a whale specimen two decades ago.Kennedy, 70, contends that the investigation is politically motivated. ""This is all about the weaponization of our government against political opponents,"" he stated, expressing frustration over the renewed scrutiny. Although he did not provide specifics about the whale incident, he referenced an account from his daughter, Kathleen ""Kick"" Kennedy.The controversy stems from a 2012 interview with Kick Kennedy, who described how her father used a chainsaw to sever the head of a dead whale that had washed ashore near Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. The whale’s head was then transported strapped to the family car, causing a mess and unpleasant odor during their drive back to New York.The Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund (CBDAF) has called for a federal investigation into Kennedy's actions, arguing that they may have violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act and possibly the Endangered Species Act. They also claim that transporting the whale head across state lines could be a felony under the Lacey Act, which governs wildlife transport.Kennedy has denied the allegations, insisting he has never engaged in illegal wildlife activities. In response to the investigation, he criticized the media for focusing on what he describes as ""gossipy nonsense"" rather than serious policy issues, according to Sky News.This investigation follows another controversy from August, where Kennedy admitted to a prank involving a dead bear cub in New York City’s Central Park. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation noted that such disposal methods were illegal, although the statute of limitations had expired, NBC News reported.","Former independent presidential candidate Robert F.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.

Authorities on Monday launched a new, nationwide polio vaccination campaign amid stepped-up security to protect the polio workers.On Monday, a roadside bomb exploded near a vehicle carrying officers assigned to protect polio workers in the district of South Waziristan, also in the same province, wounding six officers and three civilians.

There has also been a 20-30% tariff increase on electricity and other energy products, hitting the common man hard.Pakistan's external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.The February general election produced Shehbaz Sharif-led shaky coalition government, which now has the challenging task of tackling deep-rooted structural problems to pull the $350-billion economy out of its misery.Since joining the multilateral lender in 1950, Pakistan has secured 24 IMF bailouts, the latest being subject to approval by the lender's executive board and the confirmation of necessary financing assurances from the country's development and bilateral partners.","Islamabad has been working on implementing conditions from the IMF to complete a $7 billion, 37-month loan programme agreed in July.

Khan had been arrested on Wednesday after being taken from an angry mob that accused him of insulting the Prophet Muhammad.The police officer responsible for the shooting has been arrested, according to police official Mohammad Khurram , who did not provide additional information.In Pakistan, accusations of blasphemy are common and can lead to mob violence and lynching, even if they are just rumors. The country's controversial blasphemy laws allow for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or Islamic religious figures, although no executions have been carried out.Before his arrest, local residents claimed Khan had used derogatory remarks against the prophet and went after him. After his arrest, a mob surrounded the police station, demanding that Khan be handed over to them for execution. One person threw a grenade at the station on Wednesday, and a group of Islamists briefly blocked a key road in the city, demanding punishment for Khan. The crowd eventually dispersed after officials managed to calm them down.Pakistan has seen an increase in attacks on blasphemy suspects in recent years. In June, a mob in Madyan lynched a tourist accused of desecrating the holy Quran, and in 2022, a mob in Punjab province attacked churches and homes of Christians after claiming they saw a local Christian and his friend desecrating pages from a Quran. The attack in Jaranwala drew nationwide condemnation, but Christians say the men linked to the violence have not yet been put on trial.In 2011, a policeman killed a former governor of Punjab province after accusing him of blasphemy. The officer, Mumtaz Qadri , was later sentenced to death and hanged, but support for him grew after his execution, with tens of thousands attending his funeral in Rawalpindi. Many in Punjab still consider him a martyr today.Quetta, a conservative city in southwestern Pakistan, is also the capital of the restive Balochistan province, where militant groups stage near-daily attacks and separatists have waged a decades-long insurgency against the government in Islamabad.","A police officer shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday.

""At the start of our govt, we did have some rough patches (with India), you know,"" Zameer was quoted as saying by a Maldivian newspaper. He added these ""misunderstandings"" had been resolved following the repatriation of Indian troops.

He said, ""We have bilateral partners who are very sensitive to our needs and our situation. I seriously don't think it is a time where we will be right now engaging with the IMF.
