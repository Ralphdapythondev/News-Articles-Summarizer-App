United Airlines flight aborted after engine catches fire at Chicago airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/united-airlines-flight-aborted-after-engine-catches-fire-at-chicago-airport/articleshow/110480890.cms,"NEW DELHI: A United Airlines flight was forced to abort takeoff at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Monday afternoon when one of its engines caught fire, sending thick plumes of smoke gushing from one of the wings. The incident occurred on United Flight 2091, an Airbus 320, which was scheduled to fly to Seattle.The aircraft was on the taxiway preparing for takeoff when the engine burst into flames. This sudden malfunction prompted immediate action from the flight crew and airport emergency services. A total of 148 passengers and five crew members were onboard at the time. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and United Airlines provided separate statements confirming the details of the incident.As the plane was towed back to a gate, passengers were evacuated safely. Footage taken by Ivan Paloalto, a passenger on the flight, showed thick smoke billowing from one of the wings. Paloalto described hearing an explosion just as the plane was nearing takeoff. “I felt the impact on my window. As I looked, the engine was on fire and smoke was coming out,” he recounted to Storyful.In response to the fire, the FAA temporarily halted arrivals into O’Hare, one of the busiest airports in the United States, especially during the Memorial Day weekend. Regular operations resumed after sometime, minimizing further disruptions.An airport spokesman described the incident as an ""emergency situation"" that was resolved ""safely."" United Airlines assured that there were no injuries reported and commended the quick response from first responders who “immediately addressed” the engine issue. Passengers deplaned “normally,” according to the airline. “We are working to make alternative travel arrangements for customers,” United said in their statement.This incident is part of a broader pattern of travel disruptions over the Memorial Day weekend. In addition to the engine fire at O’Hare, travelers at JFK International Airport faced a temporary ground stop on Monday as officials monitored powerful thunderstorms moving through the area. These combined issues underscored the challenges faced by travelers during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.The emergency response at O’Hare highlights the rigorous safety protocols in place to handle such incidents effectively, ensuring passenger safety remains paramount. While the incident was undoubtedly alarming for those onboard, the swift actions of the flight crew and emergency responders averted what could have been a far more serious situation.","A United Airlines flight was forced to abort takeoff at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Monday afternoon.

Pope Francis used vulgar Italian word to refer to LGBT people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/pope-francis-used-vulgar-italian-word-to-refer-to-lgbt-people/articleshow/110480180.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pope Francis reportedly used a derogatory term for the LGBT community during a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops , stating that gay people should not be allowed to become priests. Italy's La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera quoted the pope as saying seminaries are already too full of ""frociaggine,"" a vulgar term roughly translating to ""faggotness.""However, the Vatican has not commented on the reports. La Repubblica cited several unspecified sources, while Corriere mentioned a few unnamed bishops who suggested the pope, being Argentine, might not have realized the term's offensiveness.Italian website Dagospia was the first to report on an alleged incident involving Pope Francis on May 20, during the Italian Bishops Conference's four-day assembly, which began with a private meeting with the pontiff.Pope Francis, 87, has been credited with leading the Roman Catholic Church towards a more welcoming approach to the LGBT community. In 2013, at the start of his papacy, he famously stated, ""If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?"" Last year, he allowed priests to bless members of same-sex couples, triggering significant conservative backlash.Nevertheless, he delivered a similar message on gay seminarians - minus the reported swear word - when he met Italian bishops in 2018, telling them to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject any suspected homosexuals.In a 2005 document, released under Francis's late predecessor Benedict XVI, the Vatican said the Church could admit into the priesthood those who had clearly overcome homosexual tendencies for at least three years.The document said practicing homosexuals and those with ""deep-seated"" gay tendencies and those who ""support the so-called gay culture"" should be barred.(With agency inputs)","Pope Francis reportedly used a derogatory term for the LGBT community during a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops.

Argentina's 300% inflation spawns 'ghost' border town,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/argentinas-300-inflation-spawns-ghost-border-town/articleshow/110478056.cms,"Paraguayan shoppers used to flock in their droves to the border town of Nanawa to buy cheap imports from Argentina, where the weak peso currency for years kept relative prices low for fuel, medicine and groceries smuggled in across the frontier.

Now Nanawa is a ghost town, with prices of the contraband pushed up steeply by Argentina's rare mix of near 300% inflation and a propped-up peso that has even rallied against the dollar in widely-used parallel markets under libertarian Prez Javier Milei.

""Before, things worked very well, we sold everything,"" said Marta, 57, a pharmacy employee in Nanawa. ""Now there is nothing left."" Shopkeepers in Nanawa estimated that sales had plunged between 60-80% since Milei took office in Dec when he sharply devalued the official peso currency and ushered in austerity. Since then the peso has been allowed to depreciate just 2% per month on a controlled 'crawling-peg', and monthly inflation - while slowing - has been some 10-20% each month. That's meant prices in dollar terms have soared.

In Argentina, products like olive oil and toothpaste are becoming small luxuries. Colgate toothpaste is priced at 4,976 pesos or $5 for a single 90g tube, twice what retailers charge in Paraguay and Uruguay.

This is all under the guidance of Iran's supreme leader and likely won't change after the helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister.The report, seen by AP, said Iran now has 142.1 kg of uranium enriched up to 60% - an increase of 20.6 kg since the last report by the watchdog in Feb. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran's overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6,201.3 kg, which represents an increase of 675.8 kg since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency.According to the IAEA's definition, around 42 kg of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible - if the material is enriched further to weapons-grade levels of 90%.Iran has maintained its nuclear programme is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make ""several"" nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran's centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment.The latest IAEA report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its Sept 2023 decision to bar nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear programme. The report also said that the death of Iran's Prez Raisi have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. Iran has suggested that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran ""be continued in Tehran on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,"" the report said.","Iran now has 142.1 kg of uranium enriched up to 60% - an increase of 20.6 kg since the last report.

NEW DELHI: The national disaster center of Papua New Guinea on Monday said that a deadly landslide that occurred on Friday in a secluded village located in the country's northern region caused major destruction and more than 2,000 people were buried alive.An official from the national disaster centre said in a letter to the United Nations , ""The landslide buried more than 2,000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country,"" an official from the national disaster centre said in a letter to the United Nations.Search and rescue operations faced significant challenges in rural Papua New Guinea on Saturday, following a massive landslide that buried villages and claimed several lives.The affected area, encompassing three villages, is home to nearly 4,000 residents. Sandis Tsaka, the provincial administrator for Enga, where the disaster occurred, highlighted the likelihood of a substantial death toll due to the landslide striking a densely populated region and a key transportation route.Local officials initially estimated the death toll to be 100 or more on Friday. By Sunday, only five bodies and a leg of a sixth victim had been recovered.Emergency responders in Papua New Guinea were relocating survivors to safer areas on Sunday. This action was necessary due to the threat posed by tons of unstable earth and tribal warfare, which is prevalent in the country's Highlands.Longtime tribal warfare has raised questions about the accuracy of the official population estimate of nearly 4,000 residents in the village. This doubt emerged when a portion of Mount Mungalo collapsed.Justine McMahon, country director of the humanitarian agency CARE International, said moving survivors to ""more stable ground' was an immediate priority along with providing them with food, water and shelter. The military is taking the lead in these efforts.Medical facilities, along with houses, several small businesses, a guest house, school, and a gas station, were buried, according to officials.McMahon mentioned that there are other health facilities in the region. Additionally, the provincial government is dispatching health workers, and the World Health Organization is mobilizing staff.""There will be some support, but it's such a spread-out area that I think it will be quite a challenging situation,"" McMahon said. ""The scale of this disaster is quite immense.""Papua New Guinea is located in the tropics, but the village is situated at an elevation of 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) above sea level, resulting in substantially cooler temperatures.","The national disaster center of Papua New Guinea on Monday said that a deadly landslide that occurred on Friday in a secluded village located in the country's northern region caused major destruction.

"US, European nations consider vaccinating workers exposed to bird flu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/us-european-nations-consider-vaccinating-workers-exposed-to-bird-flu/articleshow/110454042.cms,"Prepandemic stockpile

CHICAGO/LONDON: The United States and Europe are taking steps to acquire or manufacture H5N1 bird flu vaccines that could be used to protect at-risk poultry and dairy workers, veterinarians and lab technicians, government officials said, moves influenza experts say could curb the threat of a pandemic.U.S officials last week said they were moving bulk vaccine from CSL Seqirus that closely matches the current virus into finished shots that could provide 4.8 million doses of vaccine. European health officials told Reuters they were in talks to acquire CSL's prepandemic vaccine.Canadian health officials said they have met with GSK, maker of Canada's seasonal flu shots, to discuss acquiring and manufacturing a prepandemic bird flu vaccine once its seasonal flu production capacity is freed up.Other countries, including the UK, are discussing how to proceed on prepandemic vaccines, scientists said.The actions follow the explosive spread of a new strain of bird flu that emerged in late 2020 and has caused unprecedented numbers of deaths among wild birds and domestic poultry and has begun infecting many mammal species.In March, US officials reported the first outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle, which has infected dozens of herds in nine states and two dairy workers. The US Food and Drug Administration has estimated that 20% of the US milk supply shows signs of the virus, indicating a wider spread is likely.Human exposures to the virus in poultry and dairy operations could increase the risk that the virus will mutate and gain the ability to spread easily in people.""All of our efforts need to be focused on preventing those events from happening,"" said Matthew Miller, co-director of the Canadian Pandemic Preparedness Hub at McMaster University. ""Once we have widespread infections of humans, we're in big trouble.""Dr Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan, said she has been in discussions with US and Canadian officials about using vaccines to protect workers following the virus' spread into new mammal species.Dawn O'Connell of the US Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response said the government is ""looking closely"" at the possibility of vaccinating farm workers and others in close contact with the virus.The US has contracts with CSL and GSK to test prepandemic vaccines that more closely match the circulating virus than older H5N1 vaccines in the stockpile. The US is moving forward with the CSL vaccine, a Department of Health and Human Services official confirmed.Discussions about prepandemic vaccine use are going on at government levels and among scientists in a number of places, including in the UK, said Wendy Barclay, chair in influenza virology at University College London, who also researches avian flu for the UK Health Security Agency.If deployed strategically to dairy farmers, healthcare workers and those in close contact with infected animals, ""it would put a pin in the virus,"" she said, although she said it was not clear if this step was necessary yet.The UK government did not comment but said it is monitoring the situation in the USIn Europe, the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority is working on a joint procurement of CSL Seqirus's vaccine to ""potentially prevent a pandemic"" sparked by individuals exposed to infected birds and animals, spokesman Stefan De Keersmaecker told Reuters.A spokeswoman for CSL, which has contracts for pandemic influenza vaccines with 30 governments, said the company has been in talks with several governments about procuring vaccines since 2022. Those requests have accelerated with the US outbreak, she said.The US maintains a stockpile of prepandemic vaccine candidates and bulk vaccine against an array of influenza strains and conducts clinical trials to support an Emergency Use Authorization or FDA license in the event of pandemic.Seasonal flu vaccine makers, including Sanofi, could also be asked to shift to producing pandemic flu vaccines.The US is in talks with mRNA vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna about potential pandemic vaccines.Dr. Richard Webby, a St. Jude Children's Research Hospital virologist who studies flu in animals and birds for the World Health Organization, said the situation in dairy cattle merits vaccine use.""If we look at the exposure levels that some of these farmers are getting, it's high,"" Webby said.The decision on how and when to use the vaccine will hinge on evidence of increased transmission, severity of disease, cases in people with no link to a dairy farm and mutations in the virus, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah said.Dutch flu virologist Ron Fouchier of the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, who has conducted experiments mapping the changes necessary for bird flu to spark a pandemic, said Europe's plan is to procure the CSL vaccine for people occupationally exposed to the virus.His lab could well be eligible if a vaccine becomes available, he said, adding, ""I would certainly take it.""","The U.S. and Europe are taking steps to acquire or manufacture H5N1 bird flu vaccines.

Tel Aviv Rocket Attack: Hamas' armed wing launches 'big missile' attack on Tel Aviv,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hamas-armed-wing-claims-it-launched-a-large-scale-missile-attack-on-tel-aviv/articleshow/110440087.cms,"(with inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: For the first time in months, rocket sirens sounded in Tel Aviv after Hamas ' armed wing launched a 'big missile' attack on the Israeli city on Sunday.Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, claimed responsibility for the missile strike, in a statement released on its Telegram channel. The group said the attack was carried out as retaliation for what it described as ""Zionist massacres against civilians"".The statement did not provide further details about the extent of the missile attack or any resulting damage or casualties. The escalation in violence between Hamas and Israel has been ongoing leading to a growing number of civilian casualties on both sides.Hamas Al-Aqsa TV reported that rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip, triggering rocket sirens in Tel Aviv for the first time in several months. The Israeli military did not immediately provide an explanation for the sirens.According to Israeli emergency medical services, no casualties were reported in connection with the incident.The rocket attack demonstrated that the Islamist group maintained the capability to launch long-range projectiles, despite enduring more than seven months of relentless Israeli military assaults from both aerial and ground forces.Earlier on Sunday, aid trucks entered Gaza from southern Israel through a new agreement to bypass the Rafah crossing with Egypt, following the seizure of the Palestinian side by Israeli forces earlier this month. However, it remains uncertain whether humanitarian groups will be able to access the aid due to the ongoing fighting in the area.Egypt has refused to reopen its side of the Rafah crossing until control of the Gaza side is returned to the Palestinians. As a temporary measure, Egypt agreed to divert traffic through Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, Gaza's primary cargo terminal, following a call between US President Joe Biden and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.However, the Kerem Shalom crossing has been largely inaccessible due to the fighting associated with Israel's offensive in the nearby city of Rafah. While Israel claims to have allowed hundreds of trucks to enter, United Nations agencies report that retrieving the aid on the other side is often too dangerous.According to Gaza's health ministry, close to 36,000 Palestinians have lost their lives during Israel's military campaign. The operation was initiated by Israel after militants led by Hamas launched attacks on communities in southern Israel starting on Oct. 7. Israeli figures indicate that approximately 1,200 individuals were killed and over 250 hostages were taken during these attacks.","Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, claimed responsibility for the missile strike.

At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-least-21-dead-in-memorial-day-weekend-storms-that-devastated-several-us-states/articleshow/110476059.cms,"A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern US over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages .The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida.Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties.The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas.Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding.The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers).""It's a big mess,"" said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. ""Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever - no water, no power.""Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey.""There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,"" Bailey said. ""Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.""Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes.The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky.""It could have been much worse,"" Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. ""The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we've been through.""More than 500,000 customers across the eastern US were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us.The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern US, from Alabama to New York.President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need..It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation's midsection.Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months.That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May.The heat index - a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body - is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas.Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.","More than 500,000 customers across the eastern US were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky.

""He is just a tragic front for a far left political machine,"" Musk wrote. It was the 29th time this year that he had posted about the US prez on X, formerly Twitter , which Musk bought in 2022.Musk has steadily ramped up his criticism of Biden as the campaign season heats up before the Nov election. Musk has posted about Biden on X at least seven times a month since Jan, attacking the prez for everything from his age to his policies on immigration and health. Before that, he posted about Biden twice in Dec and not at all in Nov, according to an NYT analysis. In all, Musk had posted nearly 40 times about Biden this year, compared with about 30 times for all of last year.In contrast, Musk had posted more than 20 times on X this year about former prez Donald Trump . In those posts, Musk defended Trump, arguing that he is a victim of media and prosecutorial bias in the criminal cases that the former prez faces.Musk's posts about the prez race stand out because he is signalling a willingness to tip the political scales as the owner of an influential social media platform, something that no other head of a social media firm has done. And Musk exerts outsize influence over the political discourse on X, where he regularly posts to his 184 million followers. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's founder, has shied away from endorsing candidates and rarely posts political content on Facebook or Instagram. Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief, and Sundar Pichai, Google's chief, have also not posted political commentary on their companies' social media platforms, LinkedIn and YouTube.","Musk has steadily ramped up his criticism of Biden as the campaign season heats up before the Nov election.

Russia steps up covert sabotage campaign aimed at Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russia-steps-up-covert-sabotage-campaign-aimed-at-europe/articleshow/110477151.cms,"WASHINGTON: US and allied intelligence officials are tracking an increase in low-level sabotage operations in Europe that they say are part of a Russian campaign to undermine support for Ukraine's war effort. The covert operations have mostly been arsons or attempted arsons targeting a wide range of sites, including a warehouse in England, a paint factory in Poland, homes in Latvia and, most oddly, an Ikea store in Lithuania. But people accused of being Russian operatives have also been arrested on charges of plotting attacks on US military bases. While the acts might appear random, US and European security officials say they are part of a concerted effort by Russia to slow arms transfers to Ukraine and create the appearance of growing European opposition to support for Ukraine. The officials say Russia's military intelligence arm, the GRU, is leading the campaign.

The attacks, at least so far, have not interrupted weapons flow to Ukraine, and indeed many of the targets are not directly related to the war. But some security officials say Russia is trying to sow fear and force European nations to add security throughout the weapons supply chain, adding costs and slowing the pace of transfers.

Nato and European leaders have been warning of the growing threat. PM Kaja Kallas of Estonia said last week that Russia was conducting a ""shadow war"" against Europe. PM Donald Tusk of Poland announced the arrest of 12 people accused of carrying out ""beatings, arson and attempted arson"" for Russian intelligence. And PM Jonas Gahr Store of Norway said Russia posed ""a serious threat"" after his country warned about possible attacks on energy producers and arms factories.

One of the first of the recent sabotage acts attributed to Russia was a March fire at a warehouse in London. Authorities say the warehouse was connected with the effort to supply Ukraine but have provided few details. Security officials briefed on the incident said GRU operatives used a Russian diplomatic building in Sussex, England, to recruit locals to carry out the arson. Four British men have been charged with arson in the attack, and one of them has been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. In response, Britain expelled a Russian military officer working for intelligence services and closed several Russian diplomatic buildings, including GRU operations centre in Sussex. The use of local recruits, officials said, has been a hallmark of the sabotage campaign. They said it is to make them appear to be result of domestic opposition to supporting Ukraine.

"Revealed: Cult-like dynamics in Chad Daybell, Lori Vallow's death penalty trial",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/revealed-cult-like-dynamics-in-chad-daybell-lori-vallows-death-penalty-trial/articleshow/110469316.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two contrasting versions of Chad Daybell are being presented at his death penalty trial : a religious leader who masterminded the murders of his wife and his lover’s children, and a submissive man manipulated by the women around him.Prosecutors argue that Daybell’s “desire for sex, money, and power” led to the killings of his first wife Tammy, 49, and his current wife Lori Vallow ’s children, Tylee Ryan, 16, and JJ Vallow, 7. The defense, however, paints Daybell as a man under Vallow’s control, describing her as a “very sexual” woman who lured him into her schemes, a report in the Independent said.The trial, taking place in Boise, Idaho, has horrified the nation not only due to the brutality of the murders but also because of the couple’s extreme beliefs. Daybell and Vallow believed they were on a religious mission to lead “the 144,000” followers, with Daybell as a prophet and Vallow as a goddess.Vallow, who married Daybell two weeks after his wife’s mysterious death, was convicted last year for the murders and sentenced to life in prison. Daybell’s trial, now wrapping up, centers on the question: who was in charge? Gender dynamics within their religious beliefs play a significant role in this question.Author Leah Sottile described the defense’s strategy of deflecting blame to Vallow as “misogynistic,” attempting to portray Daybell as overtaken by a “Jezebel figure.” This narrative contrasts with the patriarchal teachings of their Mormon faith, which traditionally positions men as presiding authorities over their families, the Independent report said.Family and friends testified that Vallow’s beliefs became more extreme after meeting Daybell at a religious conference in 2018, leading to increasingly dangerous ideologies involving zombies, dark spirits, and death.Daybell’s daughter Emma defended her father’s actions, saying that his demeanor at his wife’s funeral was typical for a grieving Latter-day Saint husband. Julie Coulter Bellon, a former author with Daybell’s publishing company, also described him as quiet but intense, involved in all major decisions at the company.The trial, marked by graphic testimonies and emotional family accounts, is set to conclude soon. If convicted, Chad Daybell faces the death penalty or life in prison.","Chad Daybell faces the death penalty or life in prison for the murders of his wife and his lover's children.

'US fears 'October Surprise' from Russia and North Korea',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-fears-october-surprise-from-russia-and-north-korea/articleshow/110467766.cms,"NEW DELHI: White House officials are reportedly anxious about the possibility that Russia and North Korea might escalate geopolitical tensions just before the upcoming US presidential election . This potential maneuver is seen as an effort to assist Republican candidate Donald Trump in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden .According to NBC News, the Biden administration is ""increasingly concerned"" about the growing relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Six senior officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, indicated that the White House is preparing for the possibility of provocative military actions by North Korea, allegedly at Putin's behest, as a strategic move to influence the November election.A US intelligence official said, “We have no doubt that North Korea will be provocative this year. It’s just a matter of how escalatory it is.” The concept of an ""October surprise"" refers to an unexpected event occurring shortly before the election, potentially swaying voter opinion. The theory suggests that increased turmoil in global hotspots, alongside the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts, could drive American voters to seek a change in leadership.Trump, who is the presumptive Republican nominee, has been polling ahead of Biden in several key swing states. He has attributed the current conflicts to Biden's leadership, arguing that his perceived weakness has led to these international crises.In the 2016 US election, Democrats accused Russia of interference, though Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation concluded there was no collusion between Moscow and Trump's campaign. Despite this, U.S. media reports have continued to allege Russian meddling in the 2024 race. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has denied any interference in past or future U.S. elections.North Korea has intensified its missile tests since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in February 2022, heightening tensions with both South Korea and Washington. The Biden administration anticipates a possible nuclear warhead test from Pyongyang, which would be its first since 2017. A US official asserted that Washington is ""ready and prepared"" to respond to any such test.US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin noted last month that increasing strategic cooperation with Putin was emboldening Kim. He highlighted the ""growing nexus"" between Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, saying, “This is something that we are watching very closely.”","The Biden administration is ""increasingly concerned"" about the growing relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

More severe weather in forecast

VALLEY VIEW: Powerful storms killed at least 18 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter in a restroom during the latest deadly weather to strike the central US.The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas, and the system threatened to bring more violent weather to other parts of the Midwest. By Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City.Kentucky governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing ""multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.""Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas governor Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff.Storms also killed two people and destroyed houses in Oklahoma, where the injured included guests at an outdoor wedding, eight people in Arkansas and one person in Kentucky. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region.In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest-hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph (217 kph), officials said.""The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,"" said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month.Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April.Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot.""A firefighter came to check on us and he said, 'You're very lucky,'"" Parra said. ""The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.""Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas.No more deaths are expected and nobody was reported missing in Texas, Abbott said, though responders were doing one more round of searches just in case.Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity.The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county's emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said.In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said.In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media it was a storm-related death.The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection.Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. ""If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!"" the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X.Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months.Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home.In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area.Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed.As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said.""They were conscious but severely injured,"" Dorantes said.The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms.By late Sunday, more than 80,000 customers in Arkansas were without power. In neighboring Missouri, more than 90,000 were also without power. Texas reported 27,000 outages while 3,000 were reported in Oklahoma, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us.Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was ""shut down"" due to the damage.The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend.The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans.More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee.The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.","NEW: Kentucky's governor declares a state of emergency, citing ""multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes"" NEW: Forecasters say the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City.

NEW DELHI: A high school English teacher at the esteemed Dalton School in America has resigned following allegations of sexual abuse involving a former student , according to sources reported by The Post.The accusations against Mara Naaman came to light in a letter dated May 2, authored on behalf of a student who had previously attended the Upper East Side institution, known for its $61,000-a-year tuition.Head of school José De Jesús and board of trustees president Aly Jeddy addressed the school community via email on May 9, acknowledging the ""serious matter"" and indicating that the alleged misconduct had occurred between 2020 and 2022.Naaman, 50, was promptly placed on leave upon receipt of the student's letter and subsequently tendered her resignation on May 6, as per De Jesús' email.The school administration took swift action, filing a police report and enlisting the services of a firm specializing in investigating harassment and sexual abuse.While the NYPD did not comment on the specific incident, they emphasized their commitment to taking sexual assault cases seriously and encouraged victims to come forward and file reports.The sudden revelation has reverberated throughout the Dalton community, with former parents expressing shock and confusion over the allegations.Naaman, who taught English literature to ninth through 12th graders and served as a house advisor, providing academic and emotional support, abruptly leaving her students without an anticipated source of guidance for college recommendation letters.Prior to her tenure at Dalton, Naaman held positions at Columbia University, Hofstra University, and Williams College, where she was granted tenure in 2013. Her academic background includes a PhD from Columbia, where she conducted research in Egypt.Despite Naaman's notable professional accomplishments, her reputation now faces scrutiny amidst the unfolding allegations.The Dalton School, known for its prestigious alumni and rigorous academic standards, declined to comment on the matter.This incident echoes past controversies involving the institution, including the association with late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who taught at the school in 1973, as well as allegations of sexual abuse against former headmaster Gardner Dunnan in 2018.As investigations continue, the Dalton community grapples with the fallout of yet another scandal tarnishing the reputation of the renowned institution.","Mara Naaman, a high school English teacher at the esteemed Dalton School in America, has resigned following allegations of sexual abuse involving a former student.

Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.Taiwan has for the last two years complained of delays to deliveries of US weapons, such as Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, as manufacturers supply Ukraine to support its defence against Russia.Michael McCaul , the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who promised those weapons would be delivered when he visited Taiwan last year, said the Chinese military's ""armada"" last week had sent a very strong message to the United States.""We are moving forward on those weapons systems. I'd like to see it faster, but they are forthcoming,"" McCaul told reporters after meeting Taiwan President Lai Ching-te.Taiwan needs to have sufficient weapons to show Chinese President Xi Jinping that the risk outweighs the rewards of invading the island, he added.""President Lai and I, as always, had a very sobering and yet very direct conversation about the threat that this island faces from its neighbour to the north, and it's a real one,"" McCaul said. ""Without deterrence, Chairman Xi has bold and aggressive ambitions.""The focus for Taiwan should be on maritime weapons like Harpoon anti-ship missiles, to stymie an invasion, he added.McCaul also offered reassurance that no matter who won the US presidential election in November, US support for Taiwan would remain.Lai, meeting McCaul earlier in the presidential office, said he would ""enhance national defence capabilities, and show the world the determination of the Taiwanese people to defend their homeland"".China has yet to comment on McCaul's visit.

Widespread power outages

More severe weather in forecast

VALLEY VIEW: Powerful storms killed at least 15 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction Sunday across Texas , Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter in a restroom during the latest deadly weather to strike the central US.The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas, and the system threatened to bring more violent weather to other parts of the Midwest later in the day. By Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City.Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas governor Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff.Storms also killed two people and destroyed houses in Oklahoma, where the injured included guests at an outdoor wedding, five people in Arkansas and one person in Kentucky. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region.In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, said Abbott, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest-hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph (217 kph), officials said.""The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,"" said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts ofsevere weather , including storms that killed eight people in Houston.Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot.""A firefighter came to check on us and he said, 'You're very lucky,'"" Parra said. ""The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.""Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas.No more deaths are expected and nobody was reported missing in Texas, said Abbott, though responders were doing one more round of searches just in case.At least five people were killed in Arkansas. One was a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county's emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said.In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said.In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed it was a storm-related death on social media.The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection.Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. ""If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!"" the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X.Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months.Brooks recommended that travelers passing through threatened areas over the Memorial Day weekend have a plan for a weather emergency.Travelers who have already chosen where to get food and other essentials ""probably ought to be thinking about what could I do if there's a dangerous situation to save my life,"" Brooks said.Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home.In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area.Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed.As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris, and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said.""They were conscious but severely injured,"" Dorantes said. ""The father's leg was snapped.""The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms.By late Sunday, more than 80,000 customers in Arkansas were without power. In neighboring Missouri, more than 90,000 were also without power. Texas reported 27,000 outages while 3,000 were reported in Oklahoma, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us.Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was ""shut down"" due to the damage.The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend.The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans.More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee.The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.","NEW: Death toll rises to 15 in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kentucky.

In Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh known for archaeological sites that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization built in 2500 BC, temperatures rose as high as 52.2C over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan meteorological department, Shahid Abbas said. The reading is the highest of summer so far, and approached the town's and country's record highs of 53.5C and 54C respectively.

The highest temperature recorded in Pakistan was in 2017 when temperatures rose to 54C in the city of Turbat, located in the southwestern province of Balochistan.

The Chinese were working on Dasu hydropower project, which is about 300km north of Islamabad. The 4,320MW project is being constructed by China Gezhouba with funding from World Bank.“China attaches great importance to the important progress made by the Pakistani side on the investigation of the terrorist attack,” PTI quoted Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. “China calls on countries in the region to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation, root out all terrorist organisations, remove their breeding ground, and protect the common security and development interests of all countries.”Earlier, Pakistani military authorities claimed the suicide bomber was an Afghan national. At a press conference in Lahore Sunday, interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said: “The attack was completely operated from Afghanistan and planned to specifically target Chinese personnel in Pakistan.” He blamed the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and “hostile foreign intelligence agencies”.Pakistan’s allegation further strains bilateral ties as Islamabad continues to urge Kabul to take action against Pakistani Taliban based in Afghanistan. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Afghan Taliban of allowing TTP terrorists to operate on its soil, a charge Kabul denies.Pakistan is under pressure from China as it has urged Islamabad to punish those involved in the attack on its citizens. Recently, Pakistan’s top economic body ECC approved a $2.58 million compensation package for the families of Chinese workers killed on March 26.Thousands of Chinese nationals are working on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a multibillion-dollar energy and infrastructure project under Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese workers have frequently been targeted, mostly by Baloch separatist groups in Baluchistan, who view CPEC as a Pakistani govt ploy to exploit the province’s natural resources.",Beijing backs Pakistan’s investigation into the recent suicide attack that killed five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistan to revive China Belt and Road initiative projects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-revive-china-belt-and-road-initiative-projects/articleshow/110470413.cms,"Pakistan ’s new government is hoping to inject some fresh momentum into projects that fall under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, as it tries to boost the country’s troubled economy.The South Asian nation is looking at joint ventures for renewable energy projects , agriculture collaboration and possibly enticing some Chinese companies to relocate to Pakistan, said Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s federal minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, who also co-heads the committee responsible for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , in an interview.“Yeah, I’m very hopeful because I was there in China recently and I had meetings with their senior leadership,” said Iqbal at his office in Islamabad, decorated with a large map showcasing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. “So I see great interest on the Chinese side to revive the momentum for CPEC and also to take it into the second phase.”Pakistan was seen as a flagship destination for BRI projects , with CPEC — which includes a port in the southern town of Gwadar and new power plants — the crown jewel. The progress on new projects stalled in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and amid Pakistan’s on-going economic difficulties that have required the International Monetary Fund’s intervention.Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was elected to a second successive term in February, has been looking to revive economic cooperation with China for the past two years. Sharif’s older brother, Nawaz, led the country when Pakistan signed on to the BRI in 2013.Projects worth about $25 billion came online in the first phase, including power plants that ended the nation’s chronic power deficit.A Pakistani committee approved a long-delayed railway upgrade project last week — but scaled it down from $10 billion to $6.8 billion.The project will be done in two phases “so there is not a big burden on Pakistan,” said Iqbal. The railway, in its first phase will run from Karachi, the southern coast city, to Multan, a little over halfway to the capital, Islamabad.The Sharif government has also finished some key BRI projects that were pending for years: a water-supply project in Gwadar, dredging work at the port and an electricity transmission line from Iran.“So all these things really help China see that the new government is again serious and it restored their confidence that now Pakistan is, you know, serious about CPEC initiatives ,” said Iqbal.China has also been a key financial lender, alongside the IMF, with its loans helping Pakistan avoid bankruptcy. The country is struggling with low growth and the fastest rising consumer prices in Asia. Islamabad’s difficulties have seen it fall behind on payments related to Chinese-funded power plants.To mark the tenth anniversary of CPEC last year, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng unveiled five new corridors including one focused on growth to boost economic activity in Pakistan. The others are related to livelihood, innovation, green energy and regional connectivity. Sharif is likely to visit China soon, said Iqbal.One change in the second phase would likely involve Islamabad taking a step back while urging the private sector to forge partnerships with Chinese firms.The other big focus, albeit a long-shot prospect, is to try and attract Chinese firms thinking of relocating from China amid rising labor costs and heightening geopolitical tensions.“That would be a success because at the moment more than 80 million jobs are being relocated from China to other countries because of the high level cost in China,” said Iqbal. “They have gone to Vietnam and you know, Laos and Cambodia. There is now overcrowding there. So they are certainly looking for new places.”","Pakistan is looking at joint ventures for renewable energy projects, agriculture collaboration and possibly enticing some Chinese companies to relocate to Pakistan.
