For the Future

The Democratic National Convention (DNC) is set to kick off in Chicago on Monday, where Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will formally accept their party's nomination for the 2024 Presidential race .This event follows President Joe Biden 's decision to step down from his re-election bid, leading the Democrats to rally behind Harris.The convention, which runs through Thursday, will feature key speeches from prominent Democratic leaders and is expected to attract over 50,000 attendees.Kamala Harris is generating significant voter enthusiasm as she prepares for the DNC. After securing the necessary majority of delegates earlier this month, Harris will be officially recognised as the Democratic nominee during the convention.Her choice of Tim Walz as her running mate has also bolstered the party's momentum, particularly in Midwestern states like Wisconsin and Michigan, which are critical for the Democrats' success in the upcoming election.The DNC will feature a lineup of high-profile speakers, including President Joe Biden, former First Lady Michelle Obama , and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . Each night of the convention will have a specific theme:The choice of Chicago as the host city is strategic, given its proximity to key battleground states like Wisconsin and Michigan. These states, which flipped between Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, are crucial for the Democratic Party's chances in November.The DNC aims to galvanize support in these regions by highlighting Harris's leadership and the party's vision for the future.The Democratic platform, unveiled earlier this year, focuses on contrasting the party's priorities with those of former President Trump and the Republican agenda.Key points include raising the federal minimum wage, making tax credits permanent, and reducing childcare and healthcare costs.The platform also addresses reproductive rights, climate change, and gun control, emphasising the party's commitment to progressive values.The DNC will culminate with Harris's acceptance of the presidential nomination on Thursday night.Her speech will focus on the theme, rallying the Democratic base and setting the stage for the 2024 election.As the convention unfolds, Harris and Walz will aim to solidify their positions as the leaders of the Democratic Party, ready to take on the Republican challengers in the upcoming race.","The Democratic National Convention (DNC) kicks off in Chicago on Monday.

A guy by the name of Trump.""Trump and Brown have been verbally sparring since Trump falsely claimed at a news conference August 8 at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida that he had once nearly died in a helicopter ride with Brown.Trump also said that Brown, who dated Vice President Kamala Harris in 1994 and 1995, said ""terrible things"" about Harris just before they almost plummeted to their deaths.""He was not a fan of hers very much, at that point,"" Trump said.Brown promptly called the tale a lie -- saying he had never ridden in a helicopter with Trump and had never told him disparaging things about Harris. In fact, he repeatedly told reporters that he respected her and desperately hoped that she would beat the man with whom he had never ridden in a helicopter.Trump repeated his claims on his social media site, Truth Social, and threatened to sue The New York Times for reporting that the helicopter story was made up. ""Now Willie Brown doesn't remember?""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced intensified efforts in the Kursk region , including the destruction of a second Russian bridge. This move aims to disrupt Russian logistics and stretch military resources following a surprise incursion last week. Ukrainian forces have made incremental gains, including control over 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory.Meanwhile, tensions rise in the Donetsk region as Russian forces advance toward Pokrovsk, prompting urgent evacuations and increased defensive measures .Zelenskyy declared that Ukraine is strengthening its position in the Kursk region by destroying a second bridge on Russian territory. Since launching a surprise cross-border incursion last week, Ukrainian forces have made incremental advances into Kursk, aiming to undermine Russian logistics, stretch Russia's military resources, and boost Ukrainian morale.“We are reinforcing our positions,” Zelenskyy announced in his latest address. On Sunday, Ukrainian forces conducted precision air strikes that destroyed another bridge over the Seym River in Kursk, just two days after a similar attack in the same region. Mykolaiv Oleshchuk, Ukrainian Air Force Commander, stated, “Air Force aviation continues to deprive the enemy of logistics capabilities with precision air strikes, which significantly affects the course of combat operations.”The Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState reported further gains on Sunday, sharing an image purportedly showing a Ukrainian tank in Olgovka village, about 20 km north of Sudzha. Kyiv’s forces took control of Sudzha earlier this month. A Ukrainian military commandant’s office has been established there, and they reportedly now control more than 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory in the southwestern region.Ukrainian armed forces also released a video on Sunday showing “Sivalka” flamethrower systems engaged in active combat operations in the Kursk direction. Meanwhile, Russia has advised residents in conflict zones to evacuate. Marina Degtyareva, head of the Kursk region’s Korenevsky district, emphasized, “The operational situation on the territory of our district remains complicated. Some citizens are not giving up their attempts to return home, thus hindering the work of our military.”Degtyareva also cautioned, “Returning to the area so far is impossible for local residents, and sometimes results in terrible tragedies. I appeal to all residents of Korenevsky district, let’s be patient and let our military deal with the enemy. Let’s not interfere with our defenders.”In eastern Ukraine, Russian forces are pushing closer to the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, a key hub for the Ukrainian military. With the city’s proximity to Kostiantynivka, it serves as a vital link for Ukrainian resupply lines and casualty evacuations. “The Russians are close, up to 11 kilometres from the outskirts of the town. The town is getting ready,” said Serhii Dobriak, head of the Pokrovsk city military administration.Dobriak added that the evacuation of civilians from Pokrovsk has been accelerated due to the approaching Russian forces, noting that nearly 1,800 people had been evacuated from the city over the past week. “The Russians are destroying our towns and villages, killing civilians, so we need to think about our safety and evacuate. Currently, missiles and MLRS are hitting the town, and there have been several guided aerial bomb attacks,” he said.Ukraine’s Vice Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk urged residents of Pokrovsk and other frontline settlements to evacuate to safer regions. “The lives and health of you and your children are more valuable,” Vereshchuk said, acknowledging the difficulties faced by residents but emphasizing their safety.Intense fighting is also occurring around Pivnichne and Zalizne in Donetsk, east of Pokrovsk. On Sunday morning, Russian forces launched “a massive assault” using an armoured group of 12 vehicles to break through Ukrainian positions. According to Ukraine’s General Staff, “The Russian invaders, supported by an armored group of 12 vehicles, attempted to break through Ukrainian military positions and advance towards Toretsk.”President Zelenskyy highlighted the scale of Russia’s recent military actions, noting that over the past week, Russia used more than 40 missiles, 750 guided aerial bombs, and 200 strike UAVs against Ukrainian cities and villages. “For such terror, the occupier must be held accountable before the courts and history. They are already facing the strength of our warriors,” Zelenskyy said.He also stated that Ukrainian units were “doing everything to hold the positions” amid the numerous attacks on the front lines in the Donetsk region. “And all this is more than just defence for Ukraine; it is now our primary task in defensive operations overall: to destroy as much Russian war potential as possible and conduct maximum counteroffensive actions.”Zelenskyy argued that inflicting losses on the Russian army and state helped to prevent the conflict from expanding. “Everything that inflicts losses on the Russian army, the Russian state, their military-industrial complex, and their economy helps prevent the war from expanding and brings us closer to a just end to this aggression—a just peace for Ukraine.”Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief General Syrskyi described the performance of Ukrainian forces as commendable across all fronts but called for faster supply deliveries from allied nations. “There are no vacations in war,” he said, addressing his remarks particularly to the United States, United Kingdom, and France.As fighting intensifies, Ukraine remains focused on its strategic objectives while ensuring the safety of its civilians through continued evacuations and defensive operations.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced intensified efforts in the Kursk region, including the destruction of a second Russian bridge.

Matthew Perry ’s personal assistant, two doctors, and two other people have been indicted for their roles in procuring ketamine that led to his death.According to federal court documents filed in California, Perry’s assistant and an acquaintance collaborated with two doctors and a drug dealer to obtain tens of thousands of dollars worth of ketamine for Perry, who had a long history of substance abuse.The indictment details how Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the ""Ketamine Queen,"" and Dr Salvador Plasencia were involved in obtaining and distributing ketamine. Sangha maintained a ""stash house"" in North Hollywood, reported NYT. Plasencia, a physician at an urgent care center, facilitated the drug distribution despite Perry's known history of drug abuse.Plasencia and Sangha are charged with conspiracy to distribute ketamine, distribution resulting in death, and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Court documents reveal Plasencia's derogatory texts about Perry, including ""I wonder how much this moron will pay"" and ""Let’s find out,"" reported NYT.Ketamine, used increasingly for mental health treatments, was also abused recreationally. Perry had sought treatment for depression and anxiety, leading to addiction to intravenous ketamine. The autopsy report showed that Perry’s ketamine levels were equivalent to those used in general anesthesia.Erik Fleming, an acquaintance of Perry’s, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute ketamine and distribution resulting in death. Dr Mark Chavez admitted to selling ketamine to Plasencia, while Kenneth Iwamasa, Perry’s assistant, injected him with ketamine. Iwamasa faces up to 15 years in prison, while Fleming faces up to 25 years. Chavez will be arraigned on August 30 and faces up to 10 years in prison.The DEA and US Postal Inspection Service are investigating the case. Sangha’s home was raided in March, resulting in the seizure of 79 bottles of ketamine, nearly 2,000 grams of methamphetamine, and other drugs.Plasencia and Sangha were accused of charging exorbitant prices for ketamine. At one point, they charged Perry $2,000 per vial, which cost about $12.Sangha and Plasencia have pleaded not guilty. Sangha is being held without bond, and Plasencia’s bond is set at $100,000. Their trials are scheduled for October.","Matthew Perry’s assistant, two doctors, and two other people have been indicted for their roles in procuring ketamine that led to his death.

Watch: Turkish parliament turns battlefront after heated discussion over ousted MP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/watch-turkish-parliament-turns-battlefront-after-heated-discussion-over-ousted-mp/articleshow/112580174.cms,"Legal battle

Punches flew unabated in the Turkish Parliament on Friday as lawmakers discussed the fate of a jailed opposition leader Can Atalay , whose parliamentary immunity was revoked earlier this year.However, Turkey's constitutional court earlier this month struck down Parliament's decision to oust Atalay from his parliament seat.The leaders were meeting following the court's order to determine the future of the leader.Atalay, who is a lawyer, won his seat last year after having campaigned from his prison cell.Ahmet Sik , a fellow member of the leftist Workers' Party of Turkey (TIP), defended Atalay against the attacks on him by ruling party lawmakers.""It's no surprise that you call Atalay a terrorist,"" he said.""All citizens should know that the biggest terrorists of this country are those seated on those benches,"" he added, indicating the ruling majority, according to news agency Reuters.Sik's comment infuriated the ruling party lawmakers, leading to chaos following which the chairman called for a break.That comment drew angry responses from ruling party lawmakers, prompting the chairman to call a break.Scuffles broke out after former footballer Alpay Ozalan, a lawmaker from Erdogan's ruling AKP party, walked to the rostrum and shoved Sik to the ground, said an AFP journalist in parliament.Sik was then punched on the ground several times by ruling party lawmakers.At least two opposition MPs were injured during the fistfight.In January, Atalay was stripped of his parliamentary seat following a heated session, despite efforts by fellow leftist deputies to halt the proceedings.He is one of seven individuals who were sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2022, following a controversial trial that also resulted in the philanthropist Osman Kavala being jailed for life.Despite being imprisoned, the 48-year-old Atalay campaigned and was elected as a member of parliament for the earthquake-stricken Hatay province in the May 2023 general election, representing the leftist TIP party, which holds three seats in the parliament.However, Atalay's election victory led to a legal confrontation between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's supporters and opposition leaders, pushing Turkey to the brink of a constitutional crisis last year. The decision to remove Atalay from parliament in January came after the Supreme Court of appeals upheld his conviction, paving the way for his parliamentary immunity to be revoked.On August 1, the constitutional court, responsible for reviewing the compliance of judges' rulings with Turkey's basic law, published its ruling on the case, declaring Atalay's removal from parliament as ""null and void"".

Which countries have confirmed mpox virus cases?

WHO warns more mpox to come in Europe after case in Sweden

What is mpox? What are its symptoms?

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has confirmed its first mpox (earlier known as monkeypox ) case of the year after a 34-year-old man who recently returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus, reported ARY News. The individual, a resident of Mardan, arrived in Pakistan on August 3 and began showing symptoms shortly after reaching Peshawar.The diagnosis was confirmed by Khyber Medical University in Peshawar, and the positive result was verified on August 13, marking the first report of monkeypox in Pakistan for 2024.Health officials have begun contact tracing efforts to identify and monitor individuals who were in close contact with the patient, including fellow passengers on his flight from Saudi Arabia.Earlier in 2023, three passengers were diagnosed with monkeypox at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. All three were Pakistani citizens aged between 30 and 45. The passengers were admitted to the infectious disease hospital.China will monitor individuals and goods entering the country for mpox over the next six months, according to a statement from its customs administration issued on Friday.Last year, China announced that mpox would be managed as a Category B infectious disease. This designation allows officials to take emergency measures such as restricting gatherings, suspending work and school, or sealing off areas during an outbreak.Category B infectious diseases in China currently include Covid-19, AIDS, and SARS.The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths from mpox have been recorded in Africa this year, surpassing last year's figures. More than 96% of these cases and deaths have occurred in Congo, where a new, potentially more transmissible variant is causing concern among scientists.Sweden's public health agency announced on Thursday that the new mpox variant has been identified in a person who recently traveled to Africa and sought healthcare upon returning to Stockholm.WHO warned further imported cases of the new, more dangerous mpox strain in Europe were likely, after Sweden announced the first such infection outside Africa in an outbreak that has killed hundreds in the DR Congo.The WHO's European regional office in Copenhagen said it was discussing with Sweden how best to manage the newly detected case. ""The confirmation of mpox Clade 1 in Sweden is a clear reflection of the interconnectedness of our world,"" it said in a statement.""There are likely to be further imported cases of Clade 1 in the European region over the coming days and weeks, and it is imperative that we don't stigmatise travellers or countries/regions. Travel restrictions and border closures don't work and should be avoided,"" it added.Mpox, also known as monkeypox, first identified in 1958 in monkeys, has recently spread to over 70 countries. The virus, which is similar to smallpox but milder, has caused outbreaks globally since it was confirmed to spread via sex in 2022.Initially, mpox was mostly seen in central and West Africa among people in close contact with infected animals. However, the 2022 outbreaks marked a significant shift, making it a global concern.Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox. It causes milder symptoms such as fever, chills, and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest, and genitals.",Pakistan has confirmed its first mpox case of the year.

A carefree attitude amidst chaos

Legal battle and denial

In a scandal that has rocked Hollywood, Jasveen Sangha—dubbed the "" Ketamine Queen "" — is accused of supplying the drugs that led to Matthew Perry 's tragic death last October. The extravagant lifestyle of this so-called "" celebrity drug dealer "" is now under the spotlight, revealing a life of opulence funded by a reportedly lucrative underground ketamine operation catering to the elite.As per reports, Sangha’s luxurious existence included foreign escapades to exotic destinations such as Mexico, Spain, Italy, and Dubai, alongside a fleet of high-end vehicles like a Range Rover and a leased 2024 BMW. Her opulent tastes extended to lavish beauty treatments, including Botox and IV drips, as revealed by court documents and sources close to the case. As per the POST, “She was known for her glamorous appearance, flaunting her wealth and connections in the celebrity world,” said a source.The Department of Justice recently uncovered a staggering drug cache in a raid on Sangha's high-end residence. Authorities reported seizing ""80 ketamine vials, thousands of methamphetamine and cocaine pills, Xanax, and other illicit medications."" This discovery came after months of Sangha evading law enforcement, while she continued to indulge in luxury shopping, parties, and travel.Despite the gravity of the allegations, those close to Sangha describe a chilling nonchalance about her situation. “She seemed carefree, like she didn’t have a worry in the world,” a longtime friend was quoted as saying by the POST. “She was always up for parties or dinners, acting as if nothing was amiss, even as the walls were closing in.”In the days leading up to her arrest on August 16, Sangha reportedly visited a hair salon, had her nails done, and attended Hollywood parties. Federal authorities allege that Sangha's brazen lifestyle continued unabated, reflecting a disturbing indifference to the deadly consequences of her alleged actions.Sangha, who has pleaded 'not guilty' to the charges, is facing a complex legal battle. Among those arrested in connection with Perry’s death were his doctors, an assistant, and other associates. The prosecution argues that Sangha’s lavish lifestyle demonstrates her financial ability to flee, adding further tension to the case.A pretrial motion noted, “Based on the defendant’s lifestyle and spending, she has the financial means to flee.” Sangha’s court appearance will be closely watched as the investigation into the fatal ketamine overdose continues to unfold.","Jasveen Sangha is accused of supplying the drugs that led to Matthew Perry's tragic death last October.

Harris's remarks came during a pivotal campaign stop in Pennsylvania , a key battleground state, alongside her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.In her speech, Harris emphasized a shift in the political landscape, criticizing what she described as a perversion of leadership values. ""Over the last several years, there's been this kind of perversion that has taken place, I think, which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down,"" she said. ""When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.

Harris, who is poised to become the first female president if elected, is expected to accept the Democratic presidential nomination later this week.Trump, who recently suggested that Harris would be an easier opponent than the now-withdrawn President Biden, is countering the convention's impact with a series of swing-state events. He will visit a manufacturing facility in York, Pennsylvania, on Monday to focus on the economy, and will later address safety and crime at a sheriff's office in Howell, Michigan. Trump and running mate Senator JD Vance will also travel to Asheboro, North Carolina, and Glendale, Arizona, to discuss national security and rally support, respectively.Republican supporters are hoping Trump will shift his focus back to policy discussions rather than personal attacks.

US elections 2024: The 47 seconds that saved Kamala Harris' political career,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-2024-the-47-seconds-that-saved-kamala-harris-political-career/articleshow/112616443.cms,"'I Earned It'

The Race to Cut a Powerfully Simple Ad

The Bid to 'Kill Hercules in the Crib'

A Contest That Stretched Past Election Day

The first thing to know about Kamala Harris ' campaign for California attorney general is that she was not necessarily favored to win.It was 2010 -- the pinnacle of the Tea Party's power -- and Harris was running statewide for the first time and struggling to shed the same San Francisco liberal label that Donald Trump is yet again wielding as an epithet.Harris, then 45, was already seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party. ""The female Barack Obama,"" Gwen Ifill had memorably tagged her the year before. But plenty of rising stars are snuffed out early, and Harris was facing a formidable Republican foe that year in Steve Cooley , the popular and moderate district attorney of Los Angeles County.Cooley's reputation as an evenhanded, corruption-busting prosecutor had put him tied or narrowly ahead of Harris entering October -- largely on the strength of his uncommon popularity for a Republican in Los Angeles. He had won election three times in what is the state's most populous Democratic stronghold.Harris was running out of both time and money when she arrived at their only debate on the first Tuesday of October. Then, about 45 minutes into the hourlong clash, Cooley gave an answer that was frank, fateful and foolish.It was a turning point in the campaign. Harris would escape a month later with one of the narrowest statewide victories in modern California history -- by less than 0.85% of the vote. Yet even on election night, Harris' chances had appeared so bleak that Cooley declared victory. The race remained unsettled for three weeks.""Everyone writes history like it's all inevitable,"" said Harris' chief strategist in the 2010 race, Averell ""Ace"" Smith. Her first statewide win, he said, was anything but.""That was as close to a near-death experience for a political career as you can get,"" said Chris Jankowski, a Republican strategist who then led a national GOP group that spent $1 million in a failed bid to end Harris' career before it could really get started. ""If she had lost that race, she would not be the nominee for president -- no chance.""Now, as Harris arrives this week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, seeking to become the first woman to serve as president in U.S. history, that long-forgotten moment at a debate nearly 14 years ago stands out as one of the least known yet most consequential pivot points in the arc of her political career.This is the story of those 47 seconds -- and what followed.To say the lone faceoff of the 2010 attorney general's race drew little fanfare would be an understatement.It was held at noon far from the state's biggest media markets and inside a practice courtroom at the law school of the University of California, Davis. To the best of anyone's recollection, it did not even air live on television. The moderator, a local television political reporter named Kevin Riggs, had sat down with three other journalists who served as panelists just that morning at a coffee shop to divide up topics.Dan Morain, who worked for The Sacramento Bee's editorial page, asked who would bring up double-dipping -- that is, taking both a public salary and a public pension. It had been an issue in the Republican primary, first raised by John Eastman, Cooley's primary opponent. Eastman is better known now for his efforts to keep Trump in office after the 2020 election, which resulted in an indictment and disbarment.""I'm going to ask that,"" replied Jack Leonard, a Los Angeles Times reporter who covered Cooley.Public pensions were a white-hot topic at the time, and Cooley was making waves for prosecuting public corruption in the city of Bell, where local officials were pulling in outlandish salaries in an impoverished municipality.Inside the practice courtroom, Leonard outlined that the $150,000 salary of the California attorney general was half of the $292,300 salary that Cooley was earning as the local district attorney. If he double-dipped by taking a taxpayer-paid pension as a former district attorney and a taxpayer-paid salary as the state attorney general, Cooley would be in line to make more than $400,000.""Do you plan to double-dip by taking both a pension and your salary as attorney general?"" Leonard asked.""Yes, I do,"" Cooley said without hesitation.He glanced at Harris. She said nothing.""I earned it.""But Cooley was not yet done. ""I definitely earned whatever pension rights I have, and I will certainly rely upon that to supplement the very low, incredibly low salary that's paid to the attorney general,"" he added.""It was tone-deaf,"" Riggs said. ""It was startling,"" Leonard said. ""It was awful,"" Morain said. ""It was jaw-dropping,"" Smith said.And it was, Cooley recalled in a recent interview, truthful.""The point is I answered honestly,"" Cooley said. ""It was a mistake. A lot of people said, 'You should have dodged that one, Steve.'""Kevin Spillane, Cooley's top strategist, blamed himself for not coaching Cooley to evade better. ""That's a credit to his character,"" Spillane said of his client's honesty. ""But that's a liability in politics.""For her part, Harris had stood in silence. Morain, who has since written a book about Harris' career, called it her ""Vin Scully moment,"" likening it to how the famous baseball broadcaster often let the sound of the game speak for itself.""Anything you'd like to add to that?"" Riggs offered.""Go for it, Steve!"" Harris said during the debate, letting loose her now familiar laugh. ""You earned it!""It was all over in less than a minute. The good news for Cooley was that practically no one had seen his answer. The bad news was that was about to change.Brian Brokaw, Harris' campaign manager, was sitting next to Smith, the chief strategist, at the debate site. ""We looked at each other,"" Brokaw said, ""and it's sometimes hard to tell in a room how something lands, and we said to each other, 'That was pretty bad, right?'""They agreed it was bad. They soon called the campaign's admaker, Mark Putnam, and told him to watch a video of the debate.There is some disagreement as to what exactly came next.""I called up Mark Putnam,"" Smith said, ""and I said, 'I think we just won the race. Can you get this in an ad?'""Putnam said he was asked to watch the debate to produce some social-media content and was floored with what he saw -- and that he was the one who told the team, ""We just won the campaign.""What both Putnam and Smith remembered is that -- to the admaker's delight -- Cooley's answer fit almost perfectly into a 30-second spot.""I looked at it and realized I didn't have to do any editing,"" Putnam said. Within a day, he cut an ad that was as bare-bones as it was devastating: just Leonard's question, Cooley's answer and quiz-show music. At the end, the screen faded to black with white text that read, ""$150,000 a year isn't enough?""The average California household earned $54,280 at the time.Putnam said there had been ""real reluctance"" to air the ad inside the campaign without having tested the message in a poll. ""It's important to know this ad almost didn't get made and almost didn't air,"" Putnam said. Smith called that nonsense. ""We didn't have money to test anything,"" he said, ""and we needed to take decisive action.""It was certainly true that the campaign was all but broke. The mid-October financial report revealed less than $850,000 in the bank -- and more than $100,000 in debts. That was not enough for a single week of television time statewide.So they decided to plow practically every last dollar into airing the double-dipping ad exclusively in Los Angeles -- hoping to cut into Cooley's home turf. They did not have enough cash to book the final three weeks all at once. ""We were spending it as it came in,"" Brokaw said.Still, the ad felt like it was ""everywhere,"" said Leonard, who stopped watching television with his wife to avoid his ""nasally British accent"" asking the double-dipping question.For her part, Harris had dreamed of closing the campaign on a high note, with advertising about her record or her vision. But they did not have enough money to do both.She ultimately greenlit the all-negative recommendation. ""This is eternally to Kamala Harris' credit,"" Smith said. ""She literally bought into shoving all the chips into the middle of the table. You will rarely find a candidate able to make that gutsy of a decision.""Around the same time, national Republicans, who foresaw the long-term threat Harris could pose, began a last-minute counterstrike against her -- a $1 million ad buy in Los Angeles that featured the brutal testimonial of the mother of a slain police officer in San Francisco who criticized Harris for refusing to seek the death penalty for the gang member who killed her son.Smith, the Harris strategist, surmised they were trying ""to kill Hercules in the crib.""He was right.""This was an intentional targeting of someone who was clearly a rising star,"" said Jankowski, who led the Republican State Leadership Committee at the time. ""That's the way we were thinking, and back then donors were buying it.""Harris had a cavalry of her own: a late-October visit from President Barack Obama for a Los Angeles rally. Obama was confronting congressional losses nationwide but still prioritized a splashy California event that featured Harris, who had been one of his earliest endorsers in 2008.""I want everybody to do right by her,"" Obama told a crowd of 37,000.Beyond the blitz of ads about his double-dipping, Cooley faced the collapse of the Republican ticket around him, led by Meg Whitman, the party's candidate for governor. Cooley recalled that he was leading 10 days out but that his team warned him of a coming Democratic surge.""The polling was just going south,"" said Spillane, the top Cooley strategist.The race was still a nail-biter on election night. Cooley jumped out to an early lead and, against Spillane's advice, declared victory. The San Francisco Chronicle followed suit, publishing a ""Cooley beats Harris"" story. A printout still hangs on Smith's office wall.At her party, Harris and her supporters huddled over laptops, tracking increasingly favorable returns deep into the night. ""People are falling asleep all around her, and she's still there,"" recalled Matt Haney, now an assembly member who worked as a campaign volunteer. ""We stayed there until the sun came out.""The later results in Los Angeles tilted ever more toward Harris, which Smith said had ""etched into the historic record"" the impact of her late advertising blitz.An internal Harris poll from early August had shown Cooley ahead by 10 percentage points in Los Angeles County. The final result: Harris carried the county by 14 points.""The ads were very effective,"" Cooley conceded. He still blamed Whitman's collapse for his defeat more than ""some clever ad,"" sounding sore about Harris and her qualifications.Harris ultimately won by less than 75,000 votes, and Cooley conceded to her three weeks after the election. No Republican has since come as close to winning statewide.""It's hard to go back and say she definitely wouldn't have won without that moment,"" Putnam said of the double-dipping episode. ""I can't play God. But the moment was decisive.""A few months after the race, Cooley called up Leonard and invited him to a meal at the Water Grill in downtown Los Angeles. Cooley would not tell him why.Partway through the meal, Leonard recalled that Cooley reached across the table and shook his hand to thank him.""If you hadn't asked that question,"" Cooley told him, ""I would have to be up in Sacramento.""",Kamala Harris was running for California attorney general in 2010.

Former Chicago probation officer kills daughter-in-law for custody of 4-year-old granddaughter for her son,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-chicago-probation-officer-kills-daughter-in-law-for-custody-of-her-4-year-old-granddaughter-to-her-son/articleshow/112613036.cms,"Kathleen Leigh, ex-Chicago probation officer, fatally shot her daughter-in-law, Marisa Galloway, before committing suicide in a plot to secure full custody of her 4-year-old granddaughter for her son, Zachariah Reed, according to new court filings , NY Post reported. The incident took place last month on a Manhattan street and has since led to a legal battle between the families over the custody of the child.Marisa Galloway, 45, a special-education teacher, was shot by Leigh, 65, while loading her car in Manhattan. Following the murder-suicide, Galloway's parents, Nancy and John Galloway, have filed an emergency petition in Manhattan Supreme Court, claiming that Reed has taken their granddaughter, Lili, to his Chicago home and has cut off all contact between the child and her maternal grandparents.“Clearly, [Reed’s] mother had a deliberate plan to kill Marisa in order to provide custody for her son,” the court papers allege. The grandparents, who reside in Cape May, NJ, are now seeking to inherit Marisa’s parenting time , as outlined in a 2022 custody agreement with Reed.The Galloways have also requested that Reed be required to live in New York City until Lili turns 18, to ensure she maintains a close relationship with her grandparents and her 1-year-old half-sister, Mariel, whom Marisa had with a sperm donor. The Galloways currently have custody of Mariel.In a poignant affidavit, Nancy Galloway detailed the close relationship she and her husband had with Lili, who they saw regularly. “‘When we did not see [Lili], we would Facetime almost every day,’” Nancy wrote. The grandparents were actively involved in Lili's upbringing, and each had special activities they shared with her, from gardening to baking.Nancy explained that she is “extremely uncomfortable” filing the petition but feared that Lili would become estranged from her mother’s side of the family without intervention. She also recounted the “tumultuous relationship” between Marisa and Reed, which she claims was complicated by Leigh’s interference.Marisa on the day of the event, was preparing to take her daughters to New Jersey to visit her parents. As she was loading her car, Leigh approached and shot her twice before turning the gun on herself. Leigh had left behind a seven-page letter for the police, accusing Marisa of alienating Lili from Reed and alleging child abuse—claims that had been dismissed by child services.Despite the horrifying circumstances, Reed has allegedly refused to allow the Galloways any contact with Lili since the incident. The grandparents are now urging the court to protect their relationship with their granddaughter and ensure she remains connected to her mother’s family.","Marisa Galloway, 45, a special-education teacher, was shot by Leigh, 65, while loading her car in Manhattan.

She claims that the airline failed to properly train its staff and ensure the safe operation of the beverage cart in the plane's aisle. Hamilton is seeking unspecified damages for her injuries.Neither Hamilton’s attorney nor a Delta spokesperson commented on the lawsuit.This lawsuit adds to Delta’s recent legal troubles. Last week, the airline faced another lawsuit in the US district court in Georgia for allegedly refusing to issue refunds following a major technology outage caused by a CrowdStrike snafu. The outage, which occurred last month, resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights across the United States.In a separate incident, a Delta flight was forced to make an emergency landing at JFK Airport after passengers were served contaminated food. The flight, traveling from Detroit to Amsterdam, was diverted after several passengers fell ill due to spoiled meals. Upon landing, 12 passengers were treated by medical personnel.

"'Abortion is murder': Mass killings in America karma for 'murder of infants', says North Carolina Lt Guv Mark Robinson",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/abortion-is-murder-mass-killings-in-america-karma-for-murder-of-infants-says-north-carolina-lt-guv-mark-robinson-over-abortion-in-gubernatorial-bid/articleshow/112612361.cms,"North Carolina lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (R) with his strong anti-abortion rhetoric as he campaigns for governor has compared supporters of reproductive rights to those who defended slavery, calling mass killings in America karma for the “murder of infants” and “chickens coming home to roost.”He has been vocal about his belief that “abortion is murder ,” a stance he reiterated despite advice to soften his language as a candidate.A review by Rolling Stone of Robinson’s public comments and social media posts reveals that he has labeled abortion as murder dozens of times. His extreme views on the topic have become a focal point of his gubernatorial campaign , drawing sharp criticism from his Democratic opponent, who has released ads featuring Robinson’s anti-abortion sound bites.In one clip, Robinson said, “Let’s say I was the governor, I had a willing legislature, we could pass a bill saying you can’t have an abortion in North Carolina for any reason.” In another, he declares, “For me there is no compromise on abortion, it makes no difference to me why or how that child ended up in that womb.” Robinson further argues, “Abortion in this country is not about protecting the lives of mothers. It’s about killing a child because you weren’t responsible enough to keep your skirt down.”Robinson, now the Republican nominee for governor in North Carolina, a key battleground state, has taken a new approach by sharing a personal story in his campaign. In a recent direct-to-camera ad, he and his wife recount their experience with abortion, which he uses to frame his opposition to the practice.“Thirty years ago, my wife and I made a very difficult decision. We had an abortion. It was like this solid pain between us that we never spoke of,” Robinson says in the ad. His wife adds, “It’s something that stays with you forever.” Robinson continues, “That’s why I stand by our current law, and it provides common sense exceptions for life of the mother, incest, and rape… When I’m governor, mothers in need will be supported.”North Carolina currently bans abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, with limited exceptions for rape, incest, “life-limiting” fetal anomalies, and medical emergencies. Despite his previous hardline stance, Robinson now emphasizes the importance of supporting women and families, stating that he has not changed his views on abortion but has altered his approach.“If I’m a person who is seen as an individual who’s standing on a stage pointing down at a young woman saying, ‘You can’t have an abortion,’ that is not the right approach,” Robinson said in a radio interview on Thursday. “The right approach is to come down off the stage, embrace that young woman, and tell them about the reasons why I believe she should choose life, and then ultimately leaving it up to her based on the laws that we have on the books. That’s the reason why we put that commercial out, and the reason why I was willing to do it. Because we feel like this is an issue of the heart. And if we’re going to ‘win on this issue,’ we’re going to win people over on this issue, we’ve got to show people that we care. Because we’ve got to show them how deeply it affects people.”Robinson’s communications director, Mike Lonergan, defended the candidate’s stance, saying, “He is pro-life because of the painful and difficult experience he and his wife had, and his faith.” Lonergan also criticized Democrats, accusing them of supporting “taxpayer-funded, late-term abortion on demand.”Robinson has previously acknowledged his wife’s abortion, stating in a 2022 video that his family is “adamantly pro-life” because of the experience. “We know what it’s like to be in that situation, and we know the pain that an abortion causes. For everyone that has had this experience and carries that burden, we want you to know you are not alone,” he said. “Furthermore, we have a savior who forgives us of our sins and offers us grace. No one is perfect, but no one is too far gone to be saved.”Despite his recent attempts to soften his approach, Robinson has continued to use strong language to describe abortion. In a speech last year, he referred to abortion as “an affront to the Almighty” and “a scourge on humanity.” He also argued that society is “murdering human beings in the womb, hand over fist,” while caring more about protecting animals like manatees and kangaroo rats.Robinson’s uncompromising stance on abortion is likely to remain a key issue in the upcoming gubernatorial , as both his supporters and opponents closely scrutinize his public statements and policy positions.","North Carolina Lt.

The statement was not about GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump but about his rival vice president Kamala Harris. He used Jeffrey Epstein as an analogy to explain 'Kamala Harris' ineffectiveness' in controlling inflation.“Giving Kamala Harris control over inflation policy, Shannon.It’s like giving Jeffrey Epstein control over human trafficking policy,” Vance said. ""The American people are much smarter than that. They don’t buy the idea that Kamala Harris represents a fresh start,"" the writer of bestselling Hillbilly Elegy said.“She is more of the same. It is doubling down on the failed policies of the Harris administration to give Kamala Harris a promotion rather than to fire her,” Vance said claiming that all the poll are wrong and that the insiders of the campaign are worried.An ABC/Washington Post/Ipsos poll of likely voters on Sunday showed Harris leading Trump nationally by 4 points, the first poll this cycle that showed Harris leading Trump outside the margin of error.JD was reacting to polls and also to Kamala Harris' economic plan that she recently unveiled proposing massive price control and price gouging.“I'm telling you, every single person who’s watching this, the Trump campaign is in a very, very good spot,” Vance said.JD reacted to Nikki Haley's suggestion that Trump should stop whining and said he agrees that the reach has to be broader. “I think Ambassador Haley is right that we have to reach a broader group of voters, but I think that we’re doing exactly that,” Vance argued.“We’re going to prosecute the case that Donald Trump caused peace and prosperity, Kamala Harris caused chaos and lower take home pay. I think that we get that message out there, Shannon (anchor Shannon Bream).

Roe V. Wade: Kamala Coronation: Free abortions and vasectomies at Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-coronation-free-abortions-and-vasectomies-at-democratic-national-convention-dnc-in-chicago/articleshow/112612022.cms,"10 things

to know before DNC:

In the past few weeks, Democrats in the U.S. have seen significant developments, starting with Joe Biden ’s decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race. Biden’s withdrawal was motivated by concerns about his age and his ability to defeat Donald Trump, the Republican challenger and former president. Kamala Harris, Biden’s Vice President, has since emerged as the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, gaining widespread support from party members and Congress. Harris chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate, which energized the party and led to a surge in donations. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19 to 22, aiming to unify the party behind the Harris-Walz ticket ahead of the election. Although Harris and Walz have already been confirmed as the candidates, the convention will include a ceremonial roll-call vote to celebrate the ticket. Joe Biden is expected to be the keynote speaker on the first night of the convention, endorsing Harris and setting the tone for the event. Both Harris and Walz will deliver speeches during the convention, with Harris closing the event on August 22. The convention will also see protests, particularly regarding Harris's stance on Israel and Gaza, with demonstrators planning marches outside the event. The protests are expected to draw large crowds, particularly from Chicago’s significant Palestinian American community, echoing the city's history of politically charged demonstrations during conventions.

Planned Parenthood is set to offer more than just promotional items at the upcoming Democratic National Convention (DNC). The organization announced that it will provide free vasectomies, medication abortions, and emergency contraception during the event.Planned Parenthood Great Rivers of St. Louis shared on X (formerly Twitter) that their mobile health clinic will be in Chicago's West Loop on August 19-20, partnering with the Chicago Abortion Fund and The Wiener's Circle to offer these services.The post highlighted that no appointment is necessary for emergency contraception, and there is already a waiting list for free vasectomies during the convention.Abortion has become a central issue in the Democrats' election campaigns, with warnings that Republican control of Congress and another term for former President Trump could lead to a nationwide abortion ban. Since the reversal of Roe v. Wade and the emergence of Vice President Kamala Harris as a leading voice, the Democratic Party has intensified its focus on protecting a woman's right to choose.A Quinnipiac University poll from April revealed that 66% of Americans support legal abortion in some or all cases, the highest level of support recorded by the poll in its 20-year history. With abortion set to be a major theme in the upcoming elections, Trump has moderated his stance, reflecting a more nuanced approach in the Republican Party platform. While the platform still opposes late-term abortion, it no longer calls for a federal abortion ban, instead emphasizing support for prenatal care, birth control access, and fertility treatments.",The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19 to 22. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz have been confirmed as the party's presidential candidates. The convention will include a ceremonial roll-call vote to celebrate the ticket.

'I want to study'

DADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan , 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.""I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,"" Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.""But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.""Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity .The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.""This has led to a new trend of ' monsoon brides ',"" said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.""Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.""Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.""Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,"" said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.""They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done"".Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.""My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,"" she said.""I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,"" she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.""Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.""Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.""We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,"" said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.""They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,"" she added.""The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.""Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.Unicef has reported ""significant strides"" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.""We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,"" it said in a report after the 2022 floods.Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.""When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities',"" the daily wage labourer told AFP.Mehtab was just 10 years old.""The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep,"" said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.""I have told my father I want to study,"" she said. ""I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself.""","Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years. But after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise. The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112579857,imgsize-1225816,width-400,resizemode-4/112579857.jpg"
"Amid outrage over internet slowdown, Pakistan government admits installing cybersecurity firewall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/amid-outrage-over-internet-slowdown-pakistan-government-admits-installing-cybersecurity-firewall/articleshow/112574986.cms,"ISLAMABAD: After weeks of hue and cry from internet users and digital rights activists over the disruption of digital platforms and slow internet speed, Pakistan government on Thursday confirmed that it was upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.Over the past few weeks, internet speed had dropped by 30-40 per cent, as Pakistan moved to implement its much-debated nationwide firewall to block malicious content, protect government networks from attacks, and allow government to identify IP addresses associated with what it terms “anti-state propaganda”.government sources said telecom authorities had completed a second trial run of the newly installed firewall. The first trial was carried out in July, which resulted in the slowing down of social media platforms.PM Shehbaz Sharif’s government had allocated more than 30 billion Pakistani rupees in the development budget for the acquisition and installation of this filtering system.However, the adverse impacts after installing the firewall drew criticism from netizens and digital rights groups, who expressed fear about the future of internet-based businesses in Pakistan.government authorities had so far feigned ignorance over the internet disruptions being linked to firewall installation, and had blamed telecom and internet service providers for connectivity issues.On Thursday, however, IT minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said her ministry was addressing complaints of slow internet speed, even though she did not link the problem with thecybersecurity firewall .“There have been complaints of slow internet and I have asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to provide data of the last two weeks to look at the data traffic to know the speed issue,” she told reporters.Asked about the installation of a firewall, the minister said it was a cybersecurity matter and that countries around the world used the technology. “Previously, government was managing the web system, but with increasing international cybersecurity attacks on the country, there is a growing need for the state to strengthen its ability to prevent these attacks,” Khawaja said.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.The association of internet service providers have blamed the slow internet speed and outages on increased security and surveillance. “It’s a very discouraging situation for our customers. Many are leaving the smaller ISPs because they cannot sustain the poor service quality any more. If this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan,” read a statement issued by service providers.","Pakistan government confirms that it is upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.

Pakistani minister says more arrests expected in retired ISI chief's court-martial case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-minister-says-more-arrests-expected-in-retired-isi-chiefs-court-martial-case/articleshow/112564172.cms,"LAHORE: More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed in a housing scam, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Friday, a day after three more retired military officers were arrested in the case. Hameed, who served as director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, was arrested following action in the complaint of a private property developer over alleged misuse of official authority.""Investigations are underway in the Faiz case. More arrests are likely in the army and elsewhere,"" Dawn News quoted the minister as saying here.""It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country's security… all those will come in its grasp,"" Tarar said.The minister's remarks came hours after the ISPR, the military's public affairs division, in a statement on Thursday said: ""In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.""The ISPR said more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests.The ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested and did not indicate when the arrests had been made, but media reports claimed they were identified as Brigadier (Retd) Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; Brig (Retd) Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and Colonel (Retd) Asim.Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the case, Tarar said the institution of the army had prioritised self-accountability.""We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.""Tarar said when a no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. ""[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,"" he alleged.Taking note of the ISPR statement, Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread. Attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were security attacks.""I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,"" he said, adding that jailed former premier Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but ""won't be able to save his neck"".The ISPR announcement follows speculation that numerous retired officers had been detained about Gen Hameed's trial for his post-retirement actions that violated the Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court.Hameed was arrested on August 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday.His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of the Pakistan Army.The unprecedented arrest of the top-ranking officer, who led the premier intelligence agency, broke the myth in the country that such powerful officers were beyond the reach of law.Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that Khan was not happy with Munir.Later, the army decided to replace Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Khan. It is believed that it was the beginning of the souring of his ties with the powerful military.Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has wielded considerable power in security and foreign policy matters.","More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed.

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.
