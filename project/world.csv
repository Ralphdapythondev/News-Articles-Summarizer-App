Watch: Turkish parliament turns battlefront after heated discussion over ousted MP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/watch-turkish-parliament-turns-battlefront-after-heated-discussion-over-ousted-mp/articleshow/112580174.cms,"Legal battle

Punches flew unabated in the Turkish Parliament on Friday as lawmakers discussed the fate of a jailed opposition leader Can Atalay , whose parliamentary immunity was revoked earlier this year.However, Turkey's constitutional court earlier this month struck down Parliament's decision to oust Atalay from his parliament seat.The leaders were meeting following the court's order to determine the future of the leader.Atalay, who is a lawyer, won his seat last year after having campaigned from his prison cell.Ahmet Sik , a fellow member of the leftist Workers' Party of Turkey (TIP), defended Atalay against the attacks on him by ruling party lawmakers.""It's no surprise that you call Atalay a terrorist,"" he said.""All citizens should know that the biggest terrorists of this country are those seated on those benches,"" he added, indicating the ruling majority, according to news agency Reuters.Sik's comment infuriated the ruling party lawmakers, leading to chaos following which the chairman called for a break.That comment drew angry responses from ruling party lawmakers, prompting the chairman to call a break.Scuffles broke out after former footballer Alpay Ozalan, a lawmaker from Erdogan's ruling AKP party, walked to the rostrum and shoved Sik to the ground, said an AFP journalist in parliament.Sik was then punched on the ground several times by ruling party lawmakers.At least two opposition MPs were injured during the fistfight.In January, Atalay was stripped of his parliamentary seat following a heated session, despite efforts by fellow leftist deputies to halt the proceedings.He is one of seven individuals who were sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2022, following a controversial trial that also resulted in the philanthropist Osman Kavala being jailed for life.Despite being imprisoned, the 48-year-old Atalay campaigned and was elected as a member of parliament for the earthquake-stricken Hatay province in the May 2023 general election, representing the leftist TIP party, which holds three seats in the parliament.However, Atalay's election victory led to a legal confrontation between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's supporters and opposition leaders, pushing Turkey to the brink of a constitutional crisis last year. The decision to remove Atalay from parliament in January came after the Supreme Court of appeals upheld his conviction, paving the way for his parliamentary immunity to be revoked.On August 1, the constitutional court, responsible for reviewing the compliance of judges' rulings with Turkey's basic law, published its ruling on the case, declaring Atalay's removal from parliament as ""null and void"". This is not the first time that Turkey's parliament has voted to lift the immunity of opposition politicians, many of whom are Kurds, who the government considers to be ""terrorists"".",Opposition leader Can Atalay was stripped of his parliamentary immunity earlier this year.

Which countries have confirmed mpox virus cases?

WHO warns more mpox to come in Europe after case in Sweden

What is mpox? What are its symptoms?

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has confirmed its first mpox (earlier known as monkeypox ) case of the year after a 34-year-old man who recently returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus, reported ARY News. The individual, a resident of Mardan, arrived in Pakistan on August 3 and began showing symptoms shortly after reaching Peshawar.The diagnosis was confirmed by Khyber Medical University in Peshawar, and the positive result was verified on August 13, marking the first report of monkeypox in Pakistan for 2024.Health officials have begun contact tracing efforts to identify and monitor individuals who were in close contact with the patient, including fellow passengers on his flight from Saudi Arabia.Earlier in 2023, three passengers were diagnosed with monkeypox at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. All three were Pakistani citizens aged between 30 and 45. The passengers were admitted to the infectious disease hospital.China will monitor individuals and goods entering the country for mpox over the next six months, according to a statement from its customs administration issued on Friday.Last year, China announced that mpox would be managed as a Category B infectious disease. This designation allows officials to take emergency measures such as restricting gatherings, suspending work and school, or sealing off areas during an outbreak.Category B infectious diseases in China currently include Covid-19, AIDS, and SARS.The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths from mpox have been recorded in Africa this year, surpassing last year's figures. More than 96% of these cases and deaths have occurred in Congo, where a new, potentially more transmissible variant is causing concern among scientists.Sweden's public health agency announced on Thursday that the new mpox variant has been identified in a person who recently traveled to Africa and sought healthcare upon returning to Stockholm.WHO warned further imported cases of the new, more dangerous mpox strain in Europe were likely, after Sweden announced the first such infection outside Africa in an outbreak that has killed hundreds in the DR Congo.The WHO's European regional office in Copenhagen said it was discussing with Sweden how best to manage the newly detected case. ""The confirmation of mpox Clade 1 in Sweden is a clear reflection of the interconnectedness of our world,"" it said in a statement.""There are likely to be further imported cases of Clade 1 in the European region over the coming days and weeks, and it is imperative that we don't stigmatise travellers or countries/regions. Travel restrictions and border closures don't work and should be avoided,"" it added.Mpox, also known as monkeypox, first identified in 1958 in monkeys, has recently spread to over 70 countries. The virus, which is similar to smallpox but milder, has caused outbreaks globally since it was confirmed to spread via sex in 2022.Initially, mpox was mostly seen in central and West Africa among people in close contact with infected animals. However, the 2022 outbreaks marked a significant shift, making it a global concern.Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox. It causes milder symptoms such as fever, chills, and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest, and genitals.",Pakistan has confirmed its first mpox case of the year.

A carefree attitude amidst chaos

Legal battle and denial

In a scandal that has rocked Hollywood, Jasveen Sangha—dubbed the "" Ketamine Queen "" — is accused of supplying the drugs that led to Matthew Perry 's tragic death last October. The extravagant lifestyle of this so-called "" celebrity drug dealer "" is now under the spotlight, revealing a life of opulence funded by a reportedly lucrative underground ketamine operation catering to the elite.As per reports, Sangha’s luxurious existence included foreign escapades to exotic destinations such as Mexico, Spain, Italy, and Dubai, alongside a fleet of high-end vehicles like a Range Rover and a leased 2024 BMW. Her opulent tastes extended to lavish beauty treatments, including Botox and IV drips, as revealed by court documents and sources close to the case. As per the POST, “She was known for her glamorous appearance, flaunting her wealth and connections in the celebrity world,” said a source.The Department of Justice recently uncovered a staggering drug cache in a raid on Sangha's high-end residence. Authorities reported seizing ""80 ketamine vials, thousands of methamphetamine and cocaine pills, Xanax, and other illicit medications."" This discovery came after months of Sangha evading law enforcement, while she continued to indulge in luxury shopping, parties, and travel.Despite the gravity of the allegations, those close to Sangha describe a chilling nonchalance about her situation. “She seemed carefree, like she didn’t have a worry in the world,” a longtime friend was quoted as saying by the POST. “She was always up for parties or dinners, acting as if nothing was amiss, even as the walls were closing in.”In the days leading up to her arrest on August 16, Sangha reportedly visited a hair salon, had her nails done, and attended Hollywood parties.

UFO: ‘We are not alone’: Ex-defense official claims home invaded by ‘glowing green orbs’ in new UFO memoir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-are-not-alone-ex-defense-official-claims-home-invaded-by-glowing-green-orbs-in-new-ufo-memoir/articleshow/112599615.cms,"In his newly released memoir 'Imminent: Inside the Pentagon's Hunt for UFOs', former senior defense official Luis Elizondo revealed that glowing green orbs , roughly the size of basketballs, mysteriously invaded his home. Elizondo, who spearheaded a top-secret Pentagon program investigating Unexplained Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), shared these unsettling experiences in a book that took a year to pass Department of Defense censorship.The memoir details his tenure at the Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Applications Program under the Defense Intelligence Agency and suggests ongoing government knowledge of UFOs dating back to the 1940s.Elizondo claims that his work at the Pentagon often spilled into his personal life. Over a period of seven years, his home in the DC area was allegedly visited by green, glowing orbs that appeared to be under intelligent control. These events were witnessed not only by Elizondo but also by his wife, their two daughters, and neighbors, who referred to the mysterious entities as “our friends from out of town.”“We can no longer stick our heads in the sand. We know we are not alone,” Elizondo says in his book.Elizondo's diverse background includes service in the Army in Afghanistan, involvement in counterterrorism operations, and work at Guantanamo Bay before being assigned to the UFO program. The extent of Pentagon knowledge and the secrecy surrounding it left him astonished.“I know that our US military takes very seriously their job of defending our nation, and I believe they will take the necessary actions to ensure our defense against all threats,” he told the Daily Beast after retiring.According to Elizondo, the Pentagon has been amassing a significant body of knowledge about UFOs since the 1950s, initially driven by the need to prevent the Soviet Union from gaining such information. “Whoever controlled such technology could control the world,” he writes. His program investigated Navy pilots’ encounters with unexplained aerial phenomena, capturing videos of mysterious craft performing seemingly impossible maneuvers. Three such videos, first reported by The New York Times, were later confirmed by the Pentagon in 2020 as authentic, though they did not confirm whether the craft involved alien intelligence.“The nonhuman intelligence controlling them presents, at best, a very serious national security issue, and at worst, the possibility of an existential threat to humanity,” Elizondo writes regarding the unknown spacecraft.Due to government censors, Elizondo was limited in what he could discuss in his memoir. However, he hinted that other secretive alien-hunting programs exist but have never been fully disclosed.Elizondo's program gained public attention in a unique way. Established by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in 2007, it received $22 million, discreetly inserted into other spending. Although the unit was officially shut down in 2012, Elizondo continued his work with the Navy until he resigned in 2017. In a letter to then-Defense Secretary James Mattis, Elizondo emphasized, “There remains a vital need to ascertain the capability and intent of these phenomena for the benefit of the armed forces and the nation.”Following his retirement, Elizondo became a prominent voice on UFO-related issues. He briefed his successors on the Pentagon’s crash retrieval program and named Harold E. Puthoff as the government’s chief scientist on alien matters for 50 years—a role that had remained unreported until the memoir. Puthoff, who holds a Stanford PhD, has also faced accusations of pseudoscience.Puthoff supported Elizondo's claims, stating, “He has briefed us on information that he obtained that appears to be firsthand data, and I have no reason to discount that. He certainly had clearances to get primary information.”Elizondo’s assertions about government knowledge extending back to the 1940s go beyond what official agencies have acknowledged. While the CIA has declassified many documents detailing its UFO investigations from that period, their findings are generally inconclusive.The Air Force’s Project Blue Book , which investigated 12,618 reported UFO sightings between 1947 and 1969, concluded, “There has been no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as ‘unidentified’ are extraterrestrial vehicles.”Despite such official statements, Elizondo remains convinced that extraterrestrial intelligence exists and poses significant implications for national security and humanity as a whole. His memoir seeks to shed light on his experiences and the broader scope of government knowledge on unexplained aerial phenomena.“We can no longer stick our heads in the sand. We know we are not alone,” he reiterates in his book, urging for greater public understanding and official disclosure of what he and others have encountered.","Former senior defense official Luis Elizondo claims that glowing green orbs invaded his home over a seven-year period.

No joke: The onion thinks print is the future of media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-joke-the-onion-thinks-print-is-the-future-of-media/articleshow/112599674.cms,"The Onion: 'Mild-mannered reporter suddenly transforms into incredible unemployed man'

The Onion: 'Major shift in media landscape occurs every 6 seconds'

The Onion: 'Americans demand new form of media to bridge entertainment gap while looking from laptop to phone'

The funniest writers at The Onion shuffled through dozens of news stories at a meeting last week, trying to discern which headline would make readers laugh harder.""Next Up: 911 Operator Calmly Talks Woman Through Macarena,"" suggested one writer, as his co-workers cackled. Another: ""JD Vance Doubles Down on Controversial Criticism of Childless Children.""The headlines -- all 52 of them -- were completely fake, possible fodder for the satirical news site.But the jokesters behind those stories are also hard at work on a genuine experiment in the media business, one so counterintuitive that it sounds as if it could have been published in The Onion.This week, The Onion began distributing a print edition for the first time in more than a decade and will soon deliver it monthly to everyone who subscribes to its site. The move is a throwback to the publication's roots as a campus weekly in the late 1980s.But it is also emblematic of a growing trend in the media industry -- trying new ways to attract and retain digital subscribers .The Onion is no stranger to the difficulties that face the publishing business. Its headlines have tracked the tumult in the media industry over the past several years, even occasionally poking fun at itself:The print edition is part of a variety of perks that the company plans to offer online subscribers, who pay $5 a month, said Ben Collins, the CEO of The Onion's parent company,Global Tetrahedron . The company plans to offer invites to live events, access to The Onion's archive of physical papers and sponsorship of ambitious editorial projects, such as a video titled ""The Perfect One-Pot, Six-Pan, 10-Wok, 25-Baking-Sheet Dinner,"" Collins said.""Do you know how much 10 woks cost these days?"" he asked. ""It's not pretty.""The Onion hopes to begin turning a profit later this year with the help of those subscription add-ons, said Collins, whose company took over the publication in April.At the same time, The Onion is reducing its reliance on certain kinds of advertising. A month ago, it stopped running digital ads from the company Taboola, a purveyor of attention-grabbing links. Most of the ads in this month's print edition -- for Ashley Madison, WeWork and Chick-fil-A -- are fake, but there are some genuine promotions for The Onion. One of the ads: ""It's That Sweater You Clicked On Once. We Found a Way to Follow You Into Print Media, Too.""Over the past 10 years, The Onion has changed hands three times. It was bought by Spanish-language television company Univision, digital publisher G/O Media and, this year, Global Tetrahedron. Along the way, there have been layoffs, tense contract negotiations and even the sale of The Onion's sister site, The AV Club.But its 15 staff members are hoping the worst is behind them. Under the owner of Global Tetrahedron, Jeff Lawson, a co-founder of the tech company Twilio, the publication has enjoyed a relatively calm period.Lawson said he had started joking with friends about buying The Onion after Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce, bought Time magazine in 2018. In early 2024, Lawson was introduced to a group interested in buying The Onion, including Collins; Leila Brillson, a former TikTok executive; and Danielle Strle, a product development executive.""I said, 'I have $600 -- who wants to help me buy this?'"" Collins said. He said he was lucky to be introduced to Lawson, ""the only regular person in Silicon Valley.""Lawson said he hoped to own The Onion for the rest of his life. The business could be turned around, he said, if it focused first on satisfying its paying customers.Lawson said he hadn't discussed his purchase of The Onion with Elon Musk -- the Tesla CEO, who at one point discussed a bid for the site -- despite their shared love of satire.""Unbelievably, not all Silicon Valley people hang out in an evil mountainside lair,"" Lawson said.The Onion will hand out its new print edition next week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago -- where The Onion is based -- though Collins joked that the publication was not credentialed to cover the event.The major influx of influential journalists will make it a perfect opportunity to debut the print edition, said Jordan LaFlure, The Onion's executive editor.LaFlure said he hoped the print newspaper would reach a younger generation of consumers who had already begun to show some affinity for analog substitutes of digital products.""I think for the same reason that 18-year-old kids are buying Taylor Swift on vinyl,"" LaFlure said, ""we can introduce those same kids to the notion that a print publication is a much richer way to consume media.""The staff doesn't seem to share that enthusiasm for all publications. One of the front-page headlines in The Onion this week: ""New York Times to Cease Publication.""",The Onion is distributing a print edition for the first time in more than a decade.

These ads will be concentrated in crucial battleground states that are expected to play a pivotal role in determining the election's outcome.In addition to the television spots, the campaign is investing more than $200 million in digital advertising across popular streaming platforms such as Hulu, Roku, and YouTube. Notably, this figure does not encompass spending on social media or search services, indicating that additional funds may be allocated to those areas as the campaign progresses.Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump's campaign has so far reserved advertising time after Labour Day in only two states: Pennsylvania and Georgia.

"Donald Trump set to rally Pennsylvania voters near Biden’s hometown, counter Harris' surge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-set-to-rally-pennsylvania-voters-near-bidens-hometown-counter-harris-surge/articleshow/112596026.cms,"Donald Trump is gearing up to rally voters on Saturday in northeastern Pennsylvania, aiming to secure the support of conservative, white working-class voters in a region close to President Joe Biden’s hometown of Scranton. Trump is banking on this area of the pivotal battleground state to boost his chances of reclaiming the White House.Trump dominated his Democratic opponents in the 2016 and 2020 elections in Luzerne County, home to the blue-collar city of Wilkes-Barre.This Rust Belt region, also home to Biden’s native Scranton, provides a glimmer of hope for Trump as he seeks to capitalize on perceived Democratic vulnerabilities following Biden's decision to step aside, paving the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to launch her presidential campaign.Trump is expected to speak at 4 pm EDT on Saturday, just as Democrats prepare for their four-day national convention starting Monday in Chicago. The convention will officially welcome Harris as the Democratic nominee, a move that has energized the party’s base and presented a fresh challenge for Trump.Throughout his campaign, Trump has been critical of Harris, particularly on economic issues. He has linked her to the Biden administration’s struggles with inflation and has likened her recent proposal to combat price gouging to measures seen in communist nations. Trump has warned that a federal ban on grocery price gouging, as proposed by Harris, would lead to food shortages, rationing, and hunger.In Pennsylvania, a state rich in natural gas, Trump has repeatedly cited Harris’ previous opposition to fracking, an oil and gas extraction process. Although her campaign has since softened her stance, asserting that she would not ban fracking, her earlier position during the 2020 presidential primary has left some voters wary.Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis said, “The energy has clearly shifted in a dramatic way toward Vice President Harris,” and accused Trump of merely engaging in “rambling rants” and personal attacks on Harris.Harris plans to embark on a bus tour starting in Pittsburgh on Sunday, with a stop in the small town of Rochester to the north. Meanwhile, Trump has scheduled a visit to a plant in York that manufactures nuclear fuel containers on Monday, with his running mate, JD Vance, expected to campaign in Philadelphia on the same day.Trump’s rally in Wilkes-Barre on Saturday will mark his fifth appearance at the arena in the city, the largest in Luzerne County, where he secured victories in the last two presidential elections. In contrast, Biden won in neighboring Lackawanna County, where he has often highlighted his working-class roots in Scranton.Some of Biden's supporters in the former industrial city of 76,000 residents expressed disappointment when party leaders pressured the president to step aside. Diane Munley, 63, said she called dozens of members of Congress to advocate for Biden. Although she eventually came to terms with his decision, she is now fully supportive of Harris.“I can’t deny the enthusiasm that’s been going on with this ticket right now. I am so into it,” Munley said. “It just wasn’t happening with Joe, and I couldn’t see it at the time because I was so connected to him.”Munley added that she doesn’t know a Democrat or independent in her circle who isn’t fully committed to Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. “We are all-in on Kamala Harris,” Munley said. “All in 110%.”However, not everyone shares Munley’s enthusiasm. Robert A. Bridy, 64, a laborer from Shamokin, Pennsylvania, traveled to Wilkes-Barre to support Trump. He acknowledged that the race feels tight in Pennsylvania and noted that his union and a close friend have tried to convince him to vote for Harris and other Democrats, but he remains steadfast in his support for Trump.“It’s close. You can’t change Democrats’ minds no matter what. They’ve got a one-track mind, and that’s it,” Bridy said.He described Trump as a “working-class guy like us,” despite Trump being a billionaire who made his fortune in real estate. “He’s a fighter,” Bridy said. “I’d like to see the closed borders. He doesn’t mess around. He goes at it right away and takes care of business the way it should be.”","Trump dominated his Democratic opponents in the 2016 and 2020 elections in Luzerne County, home to the blue-collar city of Wilkes-Barre.

Kamala Harris’s 'day one' price control plan draws conservative skepticism: 'You've spent three-and-a-half years raising prices',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harriss-day-one-price-control-plan-draws-conservative-skepticism-youve-spent-three-and-a-half-years-raising-prices/articleshow/112595703.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris faced backlash for her recent promise to address rising prices on ""day one"" of her potential presidency. In a Thursday night social media post, Harris declared, ""When I am President, it will be a day one priority to bring down prices. I’ll take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging and corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families.""Critics have questioned Harris’s track record in addressing inflation , noting that she has been part of the current administration for nearly four years.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pointedly asked, ""What have you been doing the last four years?""Collin Rugg, co-owner of Trending Politics, questioned the timing of Harris’s promise: ""Day 1 was 3.5 years ago for you. What are you talking about?""Jim Treacher, a Substacker, echoed the skepticism: ""'Day one.' We're supposed to vote for her because of the past four years, which we're supposed to pretend never happened.""Columnist Jon Gabriel criticised Harris’s approach, writing, ""You've spent three-and-a-half years raising prices.""Conservative writer Libby Emmons criticised Harris’s plan to institute price controls, stating, ""Kamala Harris wants to institute price controls across key areas like food and housing just like they do in socialist nations. And then she wants to make it harder for big corporations to create new jobs by destroying tax cuts, incentives for investment in the US.""Virginia Kruta, another conservative writer, warned of potential negative impacts on smaller businesses: ""If you run a small grocery store or own one house/building for rent, you're screwed and she doesn't care. If she puts a price control on larger corporate stores and landlords, they will be forced to charge less than the little guys, and the little guys will lose.""Strategist Yossi Gestetner noted the contradiction in Harris’s position, stating, ""You are VP now. Your day one was almost 4 years ago. You are simultaneously running as the current VP while running against the administration that you are VP of. Price Controls reduce incentives to produce which rescues supply which leaves more people with less. Genius.""Conservative commentator Paul Szypula argued that Harris is partially responsible for current economic issues: ""Kamala Harris has been Vice President for four years and has brought up prices 20% on average. Prices are high because inflation is high. Harris cast the vote to make it that way.""Finance and culture commentator Wall Street Silver criticised the policy's feasibility, stating, ""Price controls failed in the 1970s when Nixon tried them. Companies reduce production because they cannot make a profit at the govt ordered price. This results in shortages as companies respond to govt controls. Kamala is a socialist and will turn us into Venezuela.""Harris unveiled her economic plan during a speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, saying, ""When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans. As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food."" She acknowledged the pandemic's impact on prices but added, ""Our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high.""Harris concluded her speech by addressing business practices, saying, ""I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy, and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case.""","Vice President Kamala Harris promised to address rising prices on ""day one"" of her potential presidency.

Dangerously liberal ."" The video features a series of clips highlighting controversial statements and positions taken by Kamala Harris .The video opens with a tagline suggesting a glimpse into what Harris would do as President. The initial clip shows Harris saying, ""As President of the US, I am prepared to get rid of filibusters,"" followed by another segment where she says, ""There is no question that I am banning fracking.""Harris also expresses support for ""gun confiscation"" in the video.When questioned by a reporter about the impact on private insurance, Harris responds, ""Let’s eliminate all of that,"" which Trump’s video tagged as ""socialist health care.""Further into the video, another reporter asks Harris about her support for changing dietary guidelines. Harris replies affirmatively, with the video labeling it as ""Harris will reduce meat consumption.""The video continues with clips of Harris discussing defunding the police and drawing comparisons between Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).In a November 2018 confirmation hearing, then-Senator Harris questioned Ronald Vitiello, Trump’s nominee to lead ICE, about the perceived parallels between ICE and the KKK. Harris highlighted a 2015 tweet from Vitiello in which he compared the Democratic Party to a ""neo-Klanist"" entity. Vitiello later apologised for his remarks.The video also includes Harris’s support for the “defund the police” movement during a June 2020 radio interview. Harris said that the movement ""rightly"" critiqued the allocation of funds to police departments over community services such as education, housing, and healthcare. She emphasised the need to reassess budgets to reflect appropriate priorities, stating that increased policing did not necessarily equate to increased public safety.Donald Trump shared another video of Kamala in his X post saying, ""If you think things are expensive now, they will get 100 times WORSE if Kamala gets four years as President. Under her plan, Kamala will implement SOVIET Style Price Controls. She will abolish private health care, and make California's ridiculous tax policies the law of the land, meaning EVERY American will be taxed up to 80% of their income!

': What J D Vance said about wife Usha",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/once-a-democrat-voting-for-hillary-now-what-j-d-vance-said-about-wife-usha/articleshow/112595010.cms,"Usha Vance , wife of Ohio Senator JD Vance, has undergone a significant political transformation , moving from a former Democrat who supported Hillary Clinton to fully embracing the MAGA agenda.In January 2023, shortly after JD Vance was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris, he publicly acknowledged his wife’s crucial role in his political career. “I am going to try to not get too emotional here, but just say to get to represent the people of Ohio in the United States Senate is a dream come true for me, and I wouldn’t be here without Usha.So thank you, honey, from the bottom of my heart,” JD said during the ceremony.Usha’s shift in political alignment has attracted attention given her previous Democratic leanings. Around 2016, JD Vance mentioned to a friend that Usha planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. Usha, who was previously registered as a Democrat, comes from a family with Democratic ties. According to New York times her parents remain registered as Democrats, and her mother, Lakshmi Chilukuri, signed a letter urging then-President Trump to uphold the Paris Climate Accords.Usha has had a distinguished career, with extensive time spent at elite institutions including Yale and Cambridge, and working at the progressive law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson. Despite her background, she has publicly supported her husband’s MAGA agenda.The Vance’s partnership began at Yale Law School , where Usha, daughter of Indian immigrant academics, and JD, a Marine veteran from a working-class background, met. Their relationship quickly developed, with Usha playing a supportive role in JD’s career.In recent months, Usha’s shift to supporting the MAGA platform has been evident. Jai Chabria, an early political advisor to JD, stated, “There’s no daylight there,” highlighting her alignment with her husband’s current political position.Usha’s role has been significant behind the scenes. Following the success of JD’s book Hillbilly Elegy, Usha managed his schedule and communications while maintaining her career. After JD’s vice-presidential nomination, Usha resigned from her position at Munger, Tolles & Olson.Usha also contributed to JD’s RNC speech, which focused on family and working-class issues, reflecting themes from his book. Although she avoids public campaigning, her support for JD remains steadfast.JD’s campaign has faced challenges, including unfavorable ratings and a reception of his speeches that has not met expectations. Usha addressed these issues during a Fox & Friends appearance, noting, “That can be hard. Sometimes I don’t see it all and sometimes I do see it and I look at it and think well this is not the JD I know.”Usha’s experience with political controversies, including her clerkship with Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, has informed her approach to navigating political challenges. “I look back at it and I think about Mrs. Kavanaugh and the way that she carried herself and it showed a lot of strength and it’s a model for the way to proceed,” Usha said.","Usha Vance, wife of Ohio Senator JD Vance, has undergone a significant political transformation.

Artist who designed Obama poster releases similar one for Kamala,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections-hope-and-progress-in-america-as-donald-trump-totters/articleshow/112594382.cms,"WASHINGTON: The artist who designed the iconic 'hope' poster featuring Barack Obama in 2008 has released a similar Kamala Harris poster with a one-word exhortation, ' progress ', adding another dimension to a presidential election in which photos, images, and memes are playing a key role.Shepard Fairey 's stylized stencil portrait shows a radiant Kamala Harris in black, white, blue, and red colors, similar to the solid red, beige and blue colors in Obama's 'hope' poster that galvanised the Democratic campaign in 2008.The portrait, which one art critic called ""the most efficacious American political illustration since 'Uncle Sam Wants You' was eventually acquired by the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery.Fairey later expressed disappointment with Obama in 2015 towards the end of his presidency and did not make any portrait of Hillary Clinton in 2016 (saying he did not find her inspiring) or of Joe Biden in 2020. But he seems taken in by the Harris-Walz ticket.In an instagram post following the release of the Kamala portrait, he made no secret of his political orientation, saying, “I believe VP Kamala Harris and her VP pick Tim Walz are... our best chance to push back on encroaching fascism and threats to democracy, and our best chance for creating the world we all desire and deserve.”Fairey also explained that inspiration for the “forward” message came from a line Harris has been using at some of her rallies: “We are not going back.” He said the graphic was based on a photo taken by White House photographer Lawrence Jackson.The Kamala portrait comes in an election campaign where images and memes are playing a significant role. Trump himself highlighted a Time magazine cover of Kamala Harris, expressing irritation and pique that she looked so good in the pencil drawing, and clumsily comparing her to his wife Melania.Strangely, the iconic photo of Trump's bloodied ear and raised fist after surviving an assassination attempt last month is receding rather quickly from public memory, like the episode itself. Whether this is because public memory is even shorter in the electronic age that throws up millions of images every day or because of Trump's own shambolic campaign is hard to say, but the Kamala Harris campaign is clearly doing a better job of image-building currently.In fact, language mavens, body language experts, and style gurus are waxing eloquent about the positive and youthful vibes coming from Kamala Harris, who is nearing 60 (on October 20), compared to Donald Trump, who they say comes across as a surly old man.","Shepard Fairey's stencil portrait shows a radiant Kamala Harris in black, white, blue, and red colors, similar to the solid red, beige and blue colors in Obama's 'hope' poster that galvanised the Democratic campaign in 2008.

'I want to study'

DADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan , 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.""I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,"" Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.""But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.""Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity .The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.""This has led to a new trend of ' monsoon brides ',"" said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.""Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.""Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.""Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,"" said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.""They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done"".Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.""My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,"" she said.""I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,"" she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.""Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.""Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.""We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,"" said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.""They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,"" she added.""The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.""Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.Unicef has reported ""significant strides"" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.""We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,"" it said in a report after the 2022 floods.Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.""When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities',"" the daily wage labourer told AFP.Mehtab was just 10 years old.""The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep,"" said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.""I have told my father I want to study,"" she said. ""I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself.""","Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years. But after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise.

The first trial was carried out in July, which resulted in the slowing down of social media platforms.PM Shehbaz Sharif’s government had allocated more than 30 billion Pakistani rupees in the development budget for the acquisition and installation of this filtering system.However, the adverse impacts after installing the firewall drew criticism from netizens and digital rights groups, who expressed fear about the future of internet-based businesses in Pakistan.government authorities had so far feigned ignorance over the internet disruptions being linked to firewall installation, and had blamed telecom and internet service providers for connectivity issues.On Thursday, however, IT minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said her ministry was addressing complaints of slow internet speed, even though she did not link the problem with thecybersecurity firewall .“There have been complaints of slow internet and I have asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to provide data of the last two weeks to look at the data traffic to know the speed issue,” she told reporters.Asked about the installation of a firewall, the minister said it was a cybersecurity matter and that countries around the world used the technology. “Previously, government was managing the web system, but with increasing international cybersecurity attacks on the country, there is a growing need for the state to strengthen its ability to prevent these attacks,” Khawaja said.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.The association of internet service providers have blamed the slow internet speed and outages on increased security and surveillance. “It’s a very discouraging situation for our customers. Many are leaving the smaller ISPs because they cannot sustain the poor service quality any more. If this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan,” read a statement issued by service providers.","Pakistan government confirms that it is upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.

The system is now being upgraded.""She also called the process ""a routine exercise"" across the globe to enhance internet security, without giving any detail to substantiate her claims about which other countries have deployed this system.""It is the right of the government to take measures to protect its interests given the cyber security attacks that Pakistan is facing.""This was the first time an acknowledged the government's actions, which have been blamed for everything from slow browsing speeds, the arbitrary blocking of social media platforms and WhatsApp connectivity issues on mobile data, the paper said.Meanwhile, on Thursday, users continued experiencing pro­blems in accessing social media platforms, including WhatsApp.Downdetector, a website that provides real-time information about internet outages, received an unusually high number of complaints about disruptions in WhatsApp, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram between 12 noon and 1 pm.Meanwhile, a petition was filed in the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday against a ""nationwide internet shutdown"", seeking immediate restoration of internet access.",Pakistan government confirms it is upgrading its web management system to cope with cyber security threats.

Hameed, who served as director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, was arrested following action in the complaint of a private property developer over alleged misuse of official authority.""Investigations are underway in the Faiz case. More arrests are likely in the army and elsewhere,"" Dawn News quoted the minister as saying here.""It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country's security… all those will come in its grasp,"" Tarar said.The minister's remarks came hours after the ISPR, the military's public affairs division, in a statement on Thursday said: ""In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.""The ISPR said more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests.The ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested and did not indicate when the arrests had been made, but media reports claimed they were identified as Brigadier (Retd) Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; Brig (Retd) Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and Colonel (Retd) Asim.Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the case, Tarar said the institution of the army had prioritised self-accountability.""We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.""Tarar said when a no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. ""[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,"" he alleged.Taking note of the ISPR statement, Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread. Attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were security attacks.""I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,"" he said, adding that jailed former premier Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but ""won't be able to save his neck"".The ISPR announcement follows speculation that numerous retired officers had been detained about Gen Hameed's trial for his post-retirement actions that violated the Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court.Hameed was arrested on August 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday.His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of the Pakistan Army.The unprecedented arrest of the top-ranking officer, who led the premier intelligence agency, broke the myth in the country that such powerful officers were beyond the reach of law.Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that Khan was not happy with Munir.Later, the army decided to replace Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Khan. It is believed that it was the beginning of the souring of his ties with the powerful military.Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has wielded considerable power in security and foreign policy matters.","More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Friday, a day after three more retired military officers were arrested in the case. The ISPR said more retired officers were being probed for allegedly inciting instability.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112564119,imgsize-1002511,width-400,resizemode-4/112564119.jpg"

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.
