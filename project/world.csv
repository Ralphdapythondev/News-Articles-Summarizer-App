'Just give me my money' TikTok trend explained: Why it's taking over social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktok-trend-just-give-me-my-money-becomes-latest-social-media-sensation/articleshow/112274496.cms,"In the ever-evolving world of TikTok trends, a new viral sensation , the “Just Give Me My Money” trend is sweeping across the platform, leaving both participants and viewers in stitches.The trend's premise is refreshingly simple yet irresistibly entertaining. Participants gather in a circle or line and each takes turns saying the phrase “just give me my money” in an exaggerated, comical voice.As the phrase is uttered, the rest of the group showers the speaker with enthusiastic applause. However, the humor comes into play when an unsuspecting participant, who is not in on the joke, says the phrase and is met with dead silence and no applause.The prank’s charm lies in its unpredictability and the often hilarious reactions of the unprepared participant.One of the most talked-about instances of the trend involved none other than Will Smith. In a recent video, Smith's “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” co-stars orchestrated a playful prank, remaining silent and walking away after he delivered the phrase. The result was a bewildered Smith, whose confused reaction only added to the trend’s viral appeal.The origins of the “Just Give Me My Money” trend are somewhat murky, but many attribute its inception to popular streamer Kai Cenat.During a January 2024 livestream with rapper DreamDoll, Cenat is believed to have introduced the phrase, which bears a striking resemblance to a scene from the 2002 film Paid in Full. In the movie, the phrase is repeated several times, potentially sparking the initial idea for the trend.","The prank’s charm lies in its unpredictability and the often hilarious reactions of the unprepared participant.

Tropical storm Debby threatens Florida's Gulf Coast with historic rainfall and major flooding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tropical-storm-debby-threatens-floridas-gulf-coast-with-historic-rainfall-and-major-flooding/articleshow/112274490.cms,"Tropical Storm Debby intensified rapidly on Sunday as it approached Florida's Gulf Coast , with meteorologists warning that it could soon escalate to hurricane strength. The storm, churning through the unusually warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, poses a significant threat of life-threatening storm surge and unprecedented flooding.According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Debby is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday night and make landfall in Florida's Big Bend region around midday Monday.The NHC has issued dire warnings of a storm surge reaching six to ten feet (1.8 to 3.0 meters) above ground level in some areas, which could result in severe inundation.Governor Ron DeSantis, during an emergency briefing, emphasized the gravity of the situation. ""We are looking at potentially really, really significant flooding, particularly in north-central Florida,"" he said. He urged residents to complete their final preparations immediately as the storm's impact becomes imminent.As of 5:00 pm EDT, Debby was approximately 120 miles (190 kilometers) west of Tampa, with maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour and a northward movement of 12 miles per hour. The storm's intensification is expected to continue, heightening concerns about its potential impact.In anticipation of Debby’s arrival, mandatory evacuations were ordered late Saturday for parts of Citrus County. Additionally, voluntary evacuation orders were issued for eight other counties. Local authorities are stressing the importance of heeding these orders. ""Take the situation seriously,"" advised Paul Hasenmeier, Hernando County fire chief and public safety director. ""We know the water's going to come up as the storm passes.""The NHC forecasts that Debby could bring between six to twelve inches of rain to various parts of Florida, with coastal Georgia and South Carolina potentially receiving 20 to 30 inches by the end of the week. The prospect of ""potentially historic heavy rainfall"" raises fears of severe flash flooding, particularly in areas unaccustomed to such conditions.Governors of both Georgia and South Carolina have declared states of emergency as a precautionary measure. President Joe Biden has also approved an emergency declaration for Florida, facilitating expedited federal aid to support the storm response.DeSantis has activated the state's National Guard, positioning 3,000 service members on standby to assist with emergency operations and recovery efforts. The coordinated response aims to mitigate the impact of what could be a historic weather event.Residents along the Gulf Coast and the southeastern US are urged to remain vigilant and follow local advisories as Tropical Storm Debby continues its perilous path.",Tropical Storm Debby is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday night and make landfall in Florida's Big Bend region around midday Monday.

US election: Kamala Harris to interview these three candidates at her home for vice president pick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-kamala-harris-to-interview-these-three-candidates-at-her-home-for-vice-president-pick/articleshow/112274483.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris is set to interview three leading candidates for her running mate position at her Washington, DC, residence on Sunday. The candidates include Minnesota governor Tim Walz , US senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro .According to a report from Reuters, Harris is expected to make her decision public as early as Monday, with a social media announcement featuring the chosen candidate planned for Tuesday in Philadelphia.On Saturday, Harris met with her vetting team, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm provided detailed presentations on each of the finalists. She also held a 90-minute meeting with transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday and has been conducting virtual meetings with other candidates, including Kentucky governor Andy Beshear and Illinois governor J B Pritzker.The selection of a running mate is a crucial decision for Harris as she quickly assembles a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the November 5 election following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race last month. Her shortlist consists entirely of white men known for appealing to rural, white, or independent voters, and her choice will have an impact on the future direction of the Democratic Party.Governor Shapiro, a top contender, has faced criticism from progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests related to the Gaza war. Some argue that selecting Shapiro as a running mate could hinder progress on issues such as Gaza policy and a pro-working class agenda.Additionally, his handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a top aide and his support for voucher programs that direct public funds to private schools have drawn criticism from labour groups, including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.Senator Kelly has also faced criticism from labour groups for not supporting proposed legislation that they believe would strengthen union organising. Despite endorsing Harris for president, the UAW has said that it does not support either Kelly or Shapiro as potential running mates.Governor Walz, at 60 years old, has become a favourite among progressives and youth groups who appreciate his attacks on Trump. However, some critics argue that he appears much older than Harris, which could be a disadvantage for a campaign recovering from concerns about Biden's age. Walz addressed this criticism on X, attributing his appearance to his 20-year career as a high school teacher and lunchroom supervisor.","Kamala Harris is set to interview three leading candidates for her running mate position at her Washington, DC, residence on Sunday.

15 Russian 'neutrals' at Olympics are politically isolated & rarely in spotlight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/15-russian-neutrals-at-olympics-are-politically-isolated-rarely-in-spotlight/articleshow/112274275.cms,"PARIS: Rarely on the podium and barred from the opening ceremony, the 15 Russians competing at the Paris Olympics have an uneasy status as ""Individual Neutral Athletes "" following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Some in the Olympic Village opposed them taking part in the Summer Games, and Russian opinion is divided. In Russia, the Olympics aren't being shown on TV and some politicians and media figures have even described those willing to compete in Paris as traitors.It's a complex environment for the athletes, some of them teenagers, to navigate and they're wary of talking about politics or the war. ""My family is proud of me, that's all that matters,"" said tennis player Diana Shnaider.The 20-year-old former college player for North Carolina State said it was ""amazing"" to be at her first Olympics. ""There are still a lot of people from my country in the stands... I heard words of encouragement today,"" she said after winning in Thursday's quarterfinals.Tennis players like Shnaider and 2021 US Open winner Daniil Medvedev are used to dealing with the media and playing around the world without a Russian flag. Others seem a little overwhelmed. Anzhela Bladtceva, a 19-year-old trampolinist, placed fifth in her event Friday and clutched a stuffed animal as she spoke with media afterward. ""There are so many emotions, so many people, everyone is so kind and happy and so helpful,"" she said.National delegations sailed down the Seine River on a flotilla of boats in the opening ceremony, but the neutral athletes weren't included. ""It's upsetting that they didn't let us, but what can you do?"" said Bladtceva. Of the 32 ""neutral"" athletes in Paris, 17 previously represented Belarus and just 15 represented Russia. That's compared to more than 300 Russians at the last Summer Games in Tokyo. International Olympic Committee restrictions barred Russian athletes who are in the military or publicly supported the invasion of Ukraine. The IOC also blocked Russians from team sports. Track and field enforced its own blanket ban.In gymnastics and weightlifting, Russia's teams skipped qualifying events in protest of being forced to compete as neutrals or to undergo vetting, including checks of their social media. Some athletes even qualified, accepted their IOC invitations, then withdrew weeks before Olympics began. It wasn't clear whether they made that decision under pressure.When a neutral athlete wins a gold medal, an ""anthem"" commissioned by the IOC plays: More like the soundtrack to an inspirational video. Their medals don't count in Olympics' official table. At least 82 athletes at the Paris Olympics were born in Russia, including the neutral athletes. That leaves more than 60 competing for other nations. Some have lived outside Russia for years or moved abroad as children. Others switched their sporting allegiance since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Some Ukrainians view changes of allegiance with suspicion, too. Fencing champion Olga Kharlan said last month that Russian athletes who switched allegiance to other countries' teams after the invasion ""should be checked more"".","The 15 Russians competing at the Paris Olympics have an uneasy status as ""Individual Neutral Athletes "" Some in the Olympic Village opposed them taking part in the Summer Games, and Russian opinion is divided.

His initial reaction was confusion, as there was no apparent panic among the passengers.In a subsequent interview with the People, Judelson described the scene, noting that the woman’s rush seemed overly dramatic for the situation. He and another passenger wondered why she was so frantic, since everyone would be deplaning together.Judelson recounted, “I look around, no one’s on the ground, no one’s freaking out. I’m like, ‘it can’t be that dire.'” Upon landing, the situation became more peculiar. “As soon as we land, this woman across the aisle from me shoots up and rushes to the front of the plane,” he ewas quoted as explaing, noting that it seemed like an exaggerated urgency to be the first off the aircraft.The situation grew even stranger when passengers were told they would face a 12-hour delay and were given hotel vouchers. Judelson’s confusion deepened as he questioned whether they were stuck in Phoenix indefinitely.American Airlines confirmed in a statement that the flight was diverted due to a medical emergency. However, the specifics remained unclear until Judelson learned through word of mouth that the real cause was a lice outbreak. He overheard other passengers discussing how bugs had been spotted in the woman's hair, prompting the emergency landing.Despite the unusual interruption, passengers eventually continued their journey to New York, albeit with an unexpected detour.","A flight from Los Angeles to New York was forced to make an emergency landing in Phoenix.

This initiative follows a coordinated defense in April, during which Israeli air defenses , supported by the US and other allies, repelled an Iranian missile and drone attack.The current situation has heightened tensions, with fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East as Iran threatens retaliation for the recent assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, a political leader of Hamas.Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant stressed the need for a coalition to defend against Iran's proxies, highlighting recent security developments in talks with his American and British counterparts, Lloyd Austin and John Healey. Gallant said, ""Meeting with senior leaders across the region, including today in Israel, we urged all sides to show restraint and dial down the tension at this critical moment."" The discussions come amidst concerns of spillover from the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, which has persisted for nearly ten months.The Pentagon has indicated that the US is prepared to bolster its presence in the region, with defence secretary Austin stating, ""We certainly will help defend Israel if attacked."" President Joe Biden has assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of additional US military deployments, while also urging a cease-fire in Gaza to mitigate the humanitarian crisis.The potential for escalation is high, with Iran's options ranging from direct attacks on Israel to increased aggression by its regional proxies. This follows the killing of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut and the subsequent assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran. While Israel has not explicitly claimed responsibility for these killings, it has not denied involvement either.President Biden, in a statement, emphasising the importance of a cease-fire said, ""Meeting with senior leaders across the region, including today in Israel, we urged all sides to show restraint and dial down the tension at this critical moment."" The President has struggled to influence Netanyahu's war strategy, seeking to pressure him publicly and privately but stopping short of leveraging the billions of dollars in US military aid. UK defence secretary John Healey also called for restraint and urged the need for an immediate cease-fire and humanitarian aid for Gaza.

The NHC has cautioned about the potential for life-threatening storm surges.As of Sunday evening, Debby had sustained winds of 70 mph (112 km/h), just shy of hurricane status. The storm is expected to bring storm surges of up to 10 feet (3 meters) in certain areas.As it slowly progresses northward throughout the week, Debby may bring ""potentially historic rainfall"" of 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 cm) and devastating flooding to Georgia and South Carolina , with some local areas possibly receiving up to 30 inches of rain by Friday morning.Jamie Rhome, the deputy director of the hurricane centre, emphasised that the slow-moving nature of the storm will result in historic rainfall amounts and catastrophic flooding. He compared Debby to Hurricane Harvey, which caused extensive damage and over 100 deaths in Texas in 2017, primarily due to flooding in the Houston area.Rhome attributed Debby's strength to the exceptionally warm Gulf waters, which climate scientists believe have been influenced by man-made global warming from the burning of fossil fuels.In preparation for Debby, Florida governor Ron DeSantis has mobilised 3,000 National Guard troops and placed most of the state's cities and counties under emergency orders.Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in parts of the Gulf Coast counties of Citrus, Dixie, Franklin, Levy, and Wakulla. DeSantis also said that more than 17,000 linemen and other electric workers are ready to restore power if needed. The governors of Georgia and South Carolina have also declared states of emergency in anticipation of the storm.","Tropical Storm Debby has sustained winds of 70 mph (112 km/h), just shy of hurricane status.

Auto industry revival through tariffs

Commitment to swift action

In a bold declaration during a recent Fox News interview, former President Donald Trump referred to America's untapped energy resources as "" liquid gold ,"" asserting that the United States has more energy potential than any other nation, including Saudi Arabia and Russia . He promised to harness these resources to make the US energy-dominant on the world stage.""We have more energy — we have more liquid gold, as I call it, under our feet than Saudi Arabia, than Russia, than anybody,"" Trump was quoted as saying.""We're going to be energy-dominant, we're going to make a fortune, we're going to supply it all over Europe, all over the world,"" Trump said. He criticized current policies that restrict energy infrastructure, particularly in New England, where he noted residents face some of the highest energy prices globally due to pipeline development restrictions.Trump's energy policy forms the cornerstone of his broader economic strategy, which he believes will ease inflation and strengthen the economy. ""We're going to get energy way down. Drill, baby, drill,"" he said, emphasizing that reducing energy costs would help address broader economic challenges.Beyond energy, Trump laid out an aggressive plan to revive the American auto industry, which he claims has been significantly eroded by foreign competition. He pledged to bring back auto jobs through a tariff system designed to encourage domestic production and penalize countries like China and Mexico, which he says have ""stolen"" US manufacturing jobs.""Those people in Michigan that love me and that I love, they're going to give us a victory because their auto industry won't exist in two years if she [Harris] gets elected,"" Trump warned, predicting a dire future for the industry under current policies. He vowed that if elected, his administration would take immediate action to reverse this trend.Trump promised to prioritize the revival of the auto industry within the first two weeks of his term, assuring voters that his policies would lead to a surge in domestic auto production and job creation. ""We're going to have more auto jobs than we've ever had,"" he declared, underscoring his commitment to restoring American manufacturing.","Former President Donald Trump says the U.S. has more energy potential than any other nation, including Saudi Arabia and Russia.

Pelosi mentioned she and her husband have not discussed the incident, with doctors advising against revisiting the traumatic experience.The assailant had been targeting her, and Pelosi has expressed feelings of guilt about the event.In her book ""The Art of Power,"" she recalls her daughter suggesting she give up her political career following the attack, but Pelosi reflects on her family’s blame towards certain elements of the Republican Party for demonizing her over the years, reported CBS News.""My husband and I have never talked about this,"" Pelosi said. ""The doctors have supported that, because they don't want him to revisit it."" ""He was looking for me,"" she added. ""Imagine the guilt of all of that – it's just a horrible thing.""Pelosi's daughter, Alexandra Pelosi, urged her mother to leave public life after the attack. Pelosi reflects on this in her book and discusses the family's perspective on who is to blame. ""Well, I blame me. I mean, not blame me. I was the target. My family, frankly, blames certain elements of the Republican Party who had been demonizing me for about 20 years, every election and the rest – cloven feet, horns on the head, a horrible person, in flames, a devil, and all of that. The sad thing about my husband's assault was that they just made a joke of it. They thought it was funny. And people laughed. So, [Trump] was an instigator of violence and then made light of it.""In the interview with CBS News Correspondent, Pelosi addressed rumors about pressuring President Joe Biden to drop out of his re-election campaign. She denied leading any such effort, expressing confidence in Biden’s ability to make the right decision.""Well, I've never shared any conversations with a President of the United States publicly, no,"" Pelosi replied. ""Well, he knows that I love him very much,"" she said when asked if Biden was furious at her. ""No, I wasn't a leader of any pressure party. Well, let me say things that I didn't do. I didn't call one person. I did not call one person. I could always say to him, 'I never called anybody.' What I'm saying is, I had confidence that the president would make the proper choice for our country, whatever that would be, and I said that. 'Whatever that is, we'll go with.'""When asked about Biden’s performance, Pelosi emphasized the importance of a more vigorous campaign and highlighted his accomplishments, such as leading the Nato Summit. ""My whole point was, whatever he decides, but we have to have a more aggressive campaign."" ""He was in a good place to make whatever decision – the top of his game,"" Pelosi said. ""Such a consequential President of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of President of the United States.""Pelosi's legacy as a leader in Congress spans 20 years, and she looks back on pivotal moments in her new book, ""The Art of Power"". ""There's certain episodes of our history that I played a major role in. So, I wanted to write about that just to show my side of it, what happened in the room where it happened, where I was,"" she said.Pelosi recounted pivotal events such as the financial bailout, Covid relief, the Affordable Care Act, and the attack on the Capitol on January 6. She vividly remembers hearing the mob targeting her during the insurrection and saying, ""Nancy, we're coming for you, b****.""""It was an insurrection instigated by the President of the United States. He now tries to disassociate himself from it, blaming it on me and everybody else. But that's the way he is.

""If he comes, I'm gonna punch him out for trespassing on the Capitol grounds. I'm gonna punch him out, and I'm gonna go to jail, and I'm going to be happy."" ""I knew that I would have to pay a price, to go to jail,"" Pelosi said, ""but I would be happy to do that.""Pelosi remains determined to prevent Donald Trump from returning to the White House, considering him a motivator for Democratic organization and fundraising. ""He should never set foot again in the White House – never should have, and shouldn't again.""When asked about Trump’s choice of Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, Pelosi responded with amusement. ""I think it was a great choice!""Pelosi also offered advice to Kamala Harris on how to handle the campaign against Trump. She said, ""Just be yourself. It's the same advice I give to women – be yourself.""She then dismissed attempts to portray Harris negatively, suggesting a focus on everyday issues. ""The opposition – the Trump people and he and JD Vance – are trying to portray Kamala Harris as being 'weird.' 'She's a radical, left-wing, San Francisco crazy lady. She's weird and she's nuts.'"" ""Well, the thing is, there's no question that they understand I make people laugh at them. And that's what they don't like, is to be laughed at. On the other hand, what I have always said about Trump and now – I don't know that much about Vance, but what we do know is menacing."" ""So, what should Harris say? Just talk about kitchen-table issues – ignore him,"" said Pelosi.Though no longer in House leadership, Pelosi is running for re-election to her Congressional seat from San Francisco. On being asked if she had ever been asked to run for President, Pelosi said, ""I haven't been asked, but I was encouraged to put my name in there sometime for vice president. I said, 'Why would I want to be vice president?' I'm a legislator. I love legislating. People have to understand it's serious work. I mean, you really have to listen.

California nurse claims discrimination after being asked to leave Southwest flight over skin condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-nurse-claims-discrimination-after-being-asked-to-leave-southwest-flight-over-skin-condition/articleshow/112270737.cms,"Woman unfairly kicked off Southwest flight due to medical condition

Brianna Solari , a nurse from Roseville, California, said that she faced a distressing situation when she was asked to leave a Southwest Airlines flight over her skin condition.Solari explained that she lacks a certain enzyme, neurofibromin , which is a tumor suppressor . ""I lack an enzyme, which is neurofibromin, which is a tumor suppressor. So tumors grow along nerves and can be tiny, little pinpoint tumors, or they can be enormous.Some of them can be very disfiguring,” the nurse told KCRA.After its removal on Wednesday, Solari was prepared to fly back to Sacramento the next day on Southwest Flight 3471 at 12.10 pm (local time).Upon boarding the flight, a crew member allegedly asked her to step off the plane, reported the New York Post.“I exited the airplane, and they said there had been some concerns,” Solari recounted. “‘Do you have any, you know, medical conditions, or diseases?’ And I said, no, I had surgery,” she explained to KCRA. “That’s none of their business what’s going on. But I said, no, I had surgery. And they said, ‘OK.'”The crewmember also called a doctor contracted with the airline, but prevented Solari from speaking directly with the physician.Throughout the incident, Solari said that she experienced a range of emotions, feeling ""Humiliated, embarrassed, ashamed? It's already hard enough. It's already difficult enough with this condition because I did have some visible tumors on my face and my arms, and people would comment.""After missing her original flight, Solari had to obtain a letter from her surgeon clearing her to fly after which she was placed on a new flight back to Sacramento. However, this did not change her feelings toward the airline. “I don’t think I’ll ever fly them again. I think this could have been handled much more professionally,” Solari said. “They should have waited until they had all of the information before making a decision that ultimately impacted my day, my flight, my traveling, and my overall perspective on Southwest has changed.”Southwest Airlines issued an apology and in a statement to the Post said, ""We are disheartened to learn of the Customer's experience flying with us and extend our deepest apologies for the inconvenience."" “Even though our team ultimately received clearance for the customer to travel, we weren’t able to do so in time for the flight’s departure. We rebooked her on a later flight, offered a travel voucher for a future flight along with a meal voucher, and we’re following up with her directly to discuss the situation,"" the Airline spokesperson further said.The airline offered Solari a $500 flight voucher and a $45 meal voucher, but she is still considering legal action, according to KCRA.Solari believes the situation was discriminatory and violated her medical privacy , asserting, ""This is absolutely discrimination ! Violating my medical privacy. They don't have to know I just said I had surgery, and that should be it. They shouldn't be prying into my private medical information.""","Brianna Solari, a nurse from Roseville, California, said that she was asked to leave a Southwest Airlines flight over her skin condition.

Non-profit organisation CEO Sarah Kate Ellis faces criticism over spending and IRS concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/non-profit-organisation-ceo-sarah-kate-ellis-faces-criticism-over-spending-and-irs-concerns/articleshow/112269040.cms,"LGBTQ advocacy non-profit organisation GLAAD’s CEO Sarah Kate Ellis is facing criticism over extravagant spending on travel, accommodation, and office renovations revealed by a New York Times report .The report also raised concerns about potential IRS violations . Covering expenses from January 2022 to June 2023, the report highlighted first-class flights, stays at luxurious hotels, and a $20,000 home-office remodel that included ivory pillows and a chandelier.Ellis, who earns approximately $700,000 annually, allegedly utilized at least $18,000 of a $20,000 allotment to renovate her home office in Long Island.This revamp aimed to make the space “suitable” for television appearances and virtual events, as claimed by a GLAAD spokesperson. However, GLAAD reportedly did not declare these renovation costs as income on Ellis' tax forms, based on legal advice, potentially violating IRS rules.Additionally, other lavish expenses flagged were hotel stays at high-end properties like the Waldorf Astoria and a $15,000 summer rental in Cape Cod. The seasonal rental was defended as a business expense since it facilitated Ellis in raising millions of dollars during a typically slow fundraising season.Last year, these expenditures alarmed GLAAD’s then-Chief Financial Officer, Emily Plauche, who believed they conflicted with the organization's policies and were not adequately disclosed to the IRS.In response to the allegations, GLAAD defended the spending, with the chair of its board of directors expressing firm support for Ellis. Ellis herself said, ""I take my role as GLAAD's financial steward incredibly seriously, and we'll continue updating our procedures to keep pace with the organization's rapid growth."" She also emphasized the urgency of GLAAD's work, citing the increasing attacks on the LGBTQ community, according to the Hollywood Reporter.The organization defended the expenses and criticized the Times for utilizing ""significant resources to spin a negative story"", reported the New York Post.GLAAD has been openly critical of the Times' coverage of transgender people. In response, the Times maintained that their article was ""fair, accurate and based on objective information in GLAAD’s expense reports, employment contracts, tax filings, and other documents.""After an investigation conducted by a law firm into these concerns, GLAAD reportedly revised its travel policies.Established in 1985, GLAAD is a non-profit organization dedicated to advocating for the LGBTQ community and promoting cultural change.

Who's going to be Kamala Harris' running mate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/2024-us-elections-walz-kelly-or-shapiro-whos-going-to-be-kamala-harris-running-mate-as-vice-president/articleshow/112268214.cms,"Here is all you need to know about the Vice-presidential candidates:

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz

US Senator Mark Kelly

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro

Vice President Kamala Harris will interview three top candidates for her running mate at her Washington, DC, home on Sunday. The candidates are Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , US Senator Mark Kelly from Arizona, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Harris is expected to announce her choice by Monday, with a social media reveal planned for Tuesday in Philadelphia.Harris met with her team, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, who reviewed each candidate's background.She also had a meeting with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The selected candidate will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning.This choice is important for Harris as she prepares to run against Donald Trump in the November 5 election after President Biden withdrew. Her shortlist includes only white men who are seen as able to attract key voter groups. The choice will also impact the future of the Democratic Party.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, 60, has recently gained attention as a possible running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris. Walz, who used to be a high school teacher and a National Guard member, has been visible in supporting Harris and making appearances on major news channels. A notable moment was when he appeared at a St. Paul event in a grey T-shirt and camouflage hat, which went viral.Although Walz hasn’t confirmed if he’s received vetting materials from Harris's team, he’s grateful for the consideration. Political analyst David Schultz notes that Walz's rise as a candidate is surprising, given his previous low profile.While Walz's support among progressives and youth is strong, some critics are concerned that his age might be a disadvantage, as he is close in age to Harris and recent debates have focused on Biden’s age.Mark Kelly, a US Senator from Arizona, is considered a strong candidate for Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate. Kelly’s background as a Navy pilot and astronaut, along with his work on gun control with his wife Gabrielle Giffords, makes him stand out.He first won his Senate seat in a special election against Republican Martha McSally and was re-elected in 2024. Kelly’s centrist approach helps him appeal to a broad range of voters, which could be beneficial in swing states like Arizona.However, some progressives may criticize his centrist stance and his views on labour issues, which could affect his appeal within the Democratic Party. Kelly is criticised by labour groups for opposing union-friendly legislation.Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is a top candidate for Kamala Harris’s vice-presidential pick due to his strong performance and high approval ratings. At 51, Shapiro has held several important roles, including state representative, Montgomery County Board Chair, Attorney General, and now Governor.His victory in the gubernatorial race against a Trump-backed Republican and high approval ratings make him a strong contender, especially in the key state of Pennsylvania.Despite his success, Shapiro faces criticism from some progressives who are concerned about his decisions on issues like school choice and the environment. These critics worry that choosing Shapiro could cause problems for the Democratic ticket, even though they recognize his contributions to the party.Shapiro has faced criticism from progressives and pro-Palestinian activists over his support for Israel and handling of college protests related to Gaza. His support for private school vouchers and handling of a sexual harassment complaint have also been questioned.","Vice President Kamala Harris will interview three top candidates for her running mate at her Washington, DC, home on Sunday.

VP campaign launches 'Republicans for Harris' in push to win over GOP voters put off by Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vp-campaign-launches-republicans-for-harris-in-push-to-win-over-gop-voters-put-off-by-trump/articleshow/112268087.cms,"WASHINGTON: Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign on Sunday is launching “Republicans for Harris” as she looks to win over Republican voters put off by Donald Trump 's candidacy.The program will be a “campaign within a campaign,” according to Harris' team, using well-known Republicans to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N.Ambassador Nikki Haley. The program will kick off with events this week in Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Republicans backing Harris will also appear at rallies with the vice president and her soon-to-be-named running mate this coming week, the campaign said.The Harris campaign shared the details of the program first with The Associated Press before the official announcement.It is trying to create “a permission structure” for GOP voters who would otherwise have a difficult time voting for Harris. The effort will rely heavily on Republican-to-Republican voter contact, with the belief that the best way to get a Republican to vote for Harris is to hear directly from another Republican making the same choice.Trump's ""extremism is toxic to the millions of Republicans who no longer believe the party of Donald Trump represents their values"" and will vote against him again in November, said Harris' national director of Republican outreach, Austin Weatherford. He said the campaign would be ""showing up and taking the time every single day to earn the vote of Republicans who believe in putting country over party and know that every American deserves a president who will protect their freedoms and a commander in chief who will put the best interests of the American people above their own.”Weatherford is a onetime chief of staff to former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who had endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket before President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance against Trump. Kinzinger is backing Harris once more as part of the launch.“As a proud conservative, I never thought I’d be endorsing a Democrat for President,"" he said in a statement. “But, I know Vice President Harris will defend our democracy and ensure Donald Trump never returns to the White House.”Kinzinger developed a national profile as one of two Republicans on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The committee highlighted a number of Trump’s transgressions before and during the deadly attack as Congress tried to certify the results of the 2020 election that Biden won over Trump.Trump has done little to try to win over moderate Republican voters and on Saturday criticized anew Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who rebuffed Trump 's attempts to overturn the 2020 election in the battleground state.Last month, when Biden was still at the top of the ticket, the campaign went out with an ad highlighting former Trump staffers' criticism of their onetime boss. A separate ad highlighted Trump’s often-personal attacks against Haley, including his primary nickname of her as “birdbrain” and suggestion that “she’s not presidential timber.”Hundreds of thousands of registered Republicans voted in primaries for Haley even after she ended her bid for the 2024 Republican nomination and as Trump trounced her in almost every contest.Haley in May announced she would vote for Trump and appeared at last month's Republican National Convention.The Harris campaign's effort includes former Govs. Bill Weld of Massachusetts and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, and 16 former Republican members of Congress, including Kinzinger and Reps. Joe Walsh of Illinois and Susan Molinari of New York. All have been notable critics of Trump in the past.Former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham is also endorsing Harris.“I might not agree with Vice President Kamala Harris on everything, but I know that she will fight for our freedom, protect our democracy and represent America with honor and dignity on the world stage,"" Grisham said in a statement.","The program will be a “campaign within a campaign,’ according to Harris' team. It is trying to create “a permission structure’ for GOP voters who would otherwise have a difficult time voting for Harris. The program will kick off with events this week in Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112268092,imgsize-44538,width-400,resizemode-4/112268092.jpg"

While standing on a large rock, he fell into Avalanche Creek. It remains unclear whether he slipped on a wet portion of the rock or lost his balance. Friends and witnesses saw him fall into the creek, go underwater, resurface briefly, and then be swept away by the current into the gorge.""An alert helicopter conducted aerial searches of the creek, and rangers scoured the area on July 6, recovering personal items that had washed downstream.

"Pakistan plans to regulate VPN, Opposition-civil society cry foul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-plans-to-regulate-vpn-opposition-civil-society-cry-foul/articleshow/112257788.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others, according to PTA Chairman Maj General (retd) Hafeezur Rehman, Samaa TV reported.During the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat meeting, Rehman said that once the policy is in place, only whitelisted VPNs will be operational in Pakistan, while all others will be blocked.In 2024, the use of VPNs among local internet users surged significantly, primarily to access X, which has been banned in the country since February 19, according to the Samaa TV report. Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy. For a nation largely comprising very young people, this would be an unmitigated disaster as it could have repercussions that may spill over generations. Already struggling to compete, the Pakistpeople will end up being deprived of even more chances to realise their potential and contribute positively on a global scale,"" the editorial said.According to the website DataReportal, there were 71.70 million active social media user identities in Pakistan in January 2024. YouTube is Pakistan's most-used social media platform in 2024 with a potential ad audience of 71.70 million. Data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 54.38 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Pakistan at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 38.9 per cent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.Meanwhile, according to Samaa TV, the Pakistan government has made previous attempts to regulate VPN usage by requiring registration, but these efforts have not resulted in significant action. In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions. The PTA also passed VPN regulations in 2010, but enforcement has been inconsistent.","Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others.

Gulf employers sideline Pakistani workers due to 'deplorable standards',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gulf-employers-sideline-pakistani-workers-due-to-deplorable-standards/articleshow/112196238.cms,"The senate standing committee on overseas Pakistanis, chaired by senator Zeeshan Khanzada, was informed that employers in the Gulf region prefer hiring workers from countries like Bangladesh over Pakistan due to the 'deplorable standards' of Pakistani labour.During the committee meeting, it was underlined that the government is failing to recognise the potential in this sector.In response to criticism from committee members regarding the government's failure to leverage the potential of the Pakistani diaspora , secretary of the ministry of overseas Pakistanis and human resource development, Arshad Mahmood, provided a grim outlook on the situation, highlighting issues such as high crime rates and inappropriate behavior among Pakistani workers in the UAE, and a general lack of skills among the workforce.Mahmood disclosed that Pakistanis reportedly account for 50 percent of the crime rate among the labour force in the UAE. He mentioned that UAE authorities have raised concerns about inappropriate behavior, including making videos of women in Dubai without their consent.He also pointed out a declining trend in overseas employment for Pakistani workers, attributing this to the lack of skills despite technological advancements and modernisation efforts.Mahmood suggested that countries like Bangladesh serve as a model for Pakistan in terms of skilled labour force and recommended that Pakistan should follow their example.""The governments of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait have expressed various concerns regarding overseas Pakistanis,"" Mahmood informed the committee.He also said that the Pakistani diaspora consists of 10.7 million individuals, primarily employed in Saudi Arabia, UAE, the US, UK, and Canada.Another issue brought to light was the presence of organised gangs of Pakistani beggars operating in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, having entered these countries as pilgrims. Mahmood noted that many individuals travel to Saudi Arabia on Umrah visas, with Saudi authorities reporting that 90 percent of beggars arrested in the country are Pakistani.Senator Nasir Abbas raised concerns about Pakistanis living illegally in Iraq and questioned whether the ministry could assist them, as they are often subjected to poor treatment.Senator Zeeshan Khanzada also pointed out that many Pakistanis living illegally in Italy often deny their nationality, while the Pakistani embassy recognises them as citizens. He urged the ministry to take a more proactive role in obtaining a clear understanding of the situation and extending help to stranded Pakistanis.In response to the committee's queries, Mahmood said, ""A lack of resources and skill development among Pakistani workers has led to their replacement by workers from other countries.""","The senate standing committee on overseas Pakistanis was informed that employers in the Gulf region prefer hiring workers from countries like Bangladesh over Pakistan due to the 'deplorable standards' of Pakistani labour.
