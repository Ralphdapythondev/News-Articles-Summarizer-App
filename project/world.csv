Michelle Obama delivered a powerful and confrontational speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Tuesday, sharply criticizing former US President Donald Trump and reinforcing her support for Kamala Harris .In a direct attack on Trump, Michelle invoked his previous controversial comments about undocumented migrants taking ""Black jobs."" “Who’s going to tell him that the job he is currently seeking might be one of those Black jobs?” Michelle said, referencing Trump's remarks.This comment highlighted the former president’s history of racially charged rhetoric and his claims questioning President Barack Obama’s eligibility for office.“For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us,” Michelle continued. “His limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking and highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black.”Obama's criticism didn’t stop there. She also addressed Trump’s insinuations about Kamala Harris and other Democrats not being “real Americans,” asserting, “No one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American, no one.”The former First Lady’s speech was not solely focused on attacking Trump; she also issued a call to action for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation. “Look, I don’t care how you identify politically, whether you’re Democrat, Republican, independent, or none of the above, this is our time to stand up for what we know in our hearts is right,” Michelle said. “To stand up, not just for our basic freedoms, but for decency and humanity, for basic respect, dignity, and empathy for the values at the very foundation of this democracy.”Turning her attention to Kamala Harris, Michelle praised the vice president as one of the most qualified candidates ever to seek the presidency. “Kamala Harris is more than ready for this moment. She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency,” Michelle said, highlighting Harris’s accomplishments and her dignified representation, which she attributed to a legacy of strong women.Michelle opened her speech with a message of hope, reflecting on a nation fraught with uncertainty and subtly critiquing Trump’s tenure. “America, hope is making a comeback,” she declared, sparking a standing ovation from the crowd.","Michelle Obama delivered a powerful and confrontational speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Tuesday.

Michelle Obama made a dramatic return to the political spotlight, delivering a rousing speech at the Democratic National Convention ( DNC ) that resonated with echoes of her husband’s historic campaigns.Opening her address, Michelle painted a picture of a nation grappling with uncertainty, subtly criticizing former President Donald Trump without naming him directly.“America, hope is making a comeback ,” she declared, a statement that ignited a standing ovation from the crowd.Michelle's speech turned its focus to Kamala Harris , praising her as a candidate of exceptional caliber. “Kamala Harris is more than ready for this moment. She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency,” she asserted. Michelle highlighted Harris’s dignity, attributing it to a legacy of strong women, including her own mother.In a further rebuke to Trump’s insinuations about Harris and other Democrats, Michelle asserted, “No one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American, no one.” This comment underscored her support for Harris while challenging Trump’s divisive rhetoric.Michelle Obama has largely stayed away from partisan politics since leaving the White House in 2017, focusing instead on her bestselling memoirs and voter engagement initiatives. However, her appearance at the DNC was a potent reminder of the hope and unity that characterized Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns.The enthusiastic reception Obama received highlighted a renewed vigor within the Democratic Party. Don Scott, minority leader of the Virginia House of Delegates, noted that the energy surrounding Harris's campaign mirrored the excitement of Barack Obama's 2008 run. Similarly, Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire observed the vibrant display of Harris-themed merchandise, reflecting the palpable enthusiasm among convention-goers.Michelle's address was a key moment at the DNC, serving to both invigorate the Democratic base and reaffirm the hopeful message that has long been a hallmark of Democratic campaigns.

Deep seas and tight spaces impede search for 6 missing after yacht sinks off Sicily,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deep-seas-and-tight-spaces-impede-search-for-6-missing-after-yacht-sinks-off-sicily/articleshow/112666561.cms,"PORTICELLO: Police divers resumed searching Tuesday for six people believed trapped in the hull of a superyacht that sank in deep seas off Sicily , including British tech magnate Mike Lynch , who was celebrating his recent acquittal on fraud charges with the people who had defended him at trial.The luxury sailboat, off Porticello near Palermo, was about 50 meters (164 feet) underwater - far deeper than most recreational divers are certified for and a depth that requires special precautions.Recovery crews could only stay for 12-minute shifts, a measure that slowed efforts to reach the cramped inside of the wreck.Divers tag-teamed the shifts and were using a remote-controlled underwater vehicle, or ROV, to help in the search . They hadn't been able to access the below-deck cabins because they were blocked by furniture that shifted during the violent storm that struck the vessel early Monday. Rescue crews said they assume the missing six are in those cabins because the storm struck when most would be sleeping, but the teams haven't verified their presence there through portholes.The Bayesian, a 56-meter (184-foot) British-flagged yacht, was moored about a kilometer (a half-mile) offshore when a storm rolled in before 4 a.m. Monday. Civil protection officials said they believed the ship was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout, and sank quickly.Grainy film from closed-circuit cameras from shore, broadcast on the website of the Giornale di Sicilia, showed the majestic, illuminated 75-meter (246-foot) mast of the Bayesian weathering the storm and then disappearing over the course of a minute.Fifteen of the 22 people aboard survived, including a mother who reported holding her 1-year-old baby over the waves to save her. One body was recovered, identified by officials as the Antiguan-born on-board chef. The rest of the 10-person crew survived, including the captain whom prosecutors reportedly sought to interview.The survivors were rescued by a nearby sailboat after getting into a lifeboat.Lynch, who was once hailed as Britain's king of technology, was cleared in June of fraud and conspiracy charges in a U.S. federal trial related to Hewlett Packard's $11 billion takeover of his company, Autonomy Corp. His wife, Angela Bacares, survived the sinking. Hannah Lynch, the couple's 18-year-old daughter, is reportedly unaccounted for.Also unaccounted for are Christopher Morvillo, one of Lynch's lawyers, and his wife, Neda; and Jonathan Bloomer, a chairman at Morgan Stanley International and the former head of the Autonomy audit committee who testified in Lynch's defense, and his wife.Karsten Borner, the captain of the Sir Robert Baden Powell, which rescued the survivors, said he was close enough to see the Bayesian as the storm came in.""A moment later, she was gone,"" he said.""It's a great, great tragedy,"" said Britain's ambassador to Italy, Edward Llewellyn, who visited Porticello on Tuesday. Britain sent four investigators to the scene, given the disaster involved a British-flagged ship and British citizens were among the missing.Luca Cari, a spokesman for the rescue teams, said the search was proceeding much more slowly than another big shipwreck in Italy, the 2012 Costa Concordia cruise ship that flipped on its side off Tuscany's coast, because of the depth of the wreck and the limited space divers have to maneuver.""That was much simpler. Here everything is more tight,"" he said.The outing was intended at least in part as a celebration of Lynch's acquittal and a ""looking forward to what was coming next,"" said Reid Weingarten, a Washington attorney and a member of Lynch's defense team who was not on the yacht.""A lot of people went, a lot of people were planning to go and then, of course, this happened,"" Weingarten said.Weingarten worked with Morvillo and said he ""was like a brother.""Aki Hussain, CEO of international insurer Hiscox Group, where Bloomer was chairman, said the company was ""deeply shocked and saddened by this tragic event.""""Our thoughts are with all those affected, in particular our Chair, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife Judy, who are among the missing, and with their family as they await further news from this terrible situation,"" he added.Among the survivors, the Emslie family was released from Palermo's pediatric hospital on Tuesday. Charlotte Golunski had reported that she momentarily lost hold of her 1-year-old daughter, Sofia, in the water but then managed to hold her up over the waves until they were both pulled to safety, doctors said.The father, identified by ANSA news agency as James Emslie, also survived.""They don't talk much, primarily because they consider themselves survivors and they don't understand why they survived given what they went through,"" said Dr. Domenico Cipolla, head of the emergency room at Di Cristina pediatric hospital.Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Cipolla said the parents had been in touch with other survivors, who are being housed at a nearby hotel and were waiting for other family members to arrive in Sicily.The Bayesian, built in 2008 by the Italian firm Perini Navi, is registered to Revtom Ltd., according to online maritime database Equasis. Bacares, Lynch's wife, is listed as Revtom's sole owner, according to corporate registration documents from the Isle of Man.According to online charter companies, it had been available for charter for 195,000 euros (about $215,000) a week and was notable for its massive 75-meter-tall (246-foot-tall) aluminum mast, one of the tallest in the world.The coast guard said to date there was no trace of fuel leaks from the wreckage.In an unrelated event, Lynch's co-defendant in the Autonomy trial who was also cleared, Stephen Chamberlain, was killed Sunday when he was hit by a car while running in Cambridgeshire, England, said Chamberlain's lawyer, Gary Lincenberg.","Divers tag-teamed the shifts and were using a remote-controlled underwater vehicle.

In a surprising turn, Donald Trump praised former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, during an interview with CNN on Monday. Trump, who has previously clashed with Obama, described him as a “nice gentleman” and expressed respect for both the former president and his wife.“I think he's a nice gentleman, but he was very weak on trade. If you take a look at what happened to our country trade-wise, it was a disaster,” Trump remarked.Despite his criticism of Obama’s trade policies , Trump emphasized his personal respect, stating, “I happen to like him. I respect him and I respect his wife.”Trump’s comments come in stark contrast to his earlier stance, where he fueled birtherism conspiracy theories against Obama and cited Obama’s mockery at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner as a catalyst for his own presidential ambitions.On the same day, Trump denounced the Democratic National Convention (DNC) programming as ""lies"", as quoted by the New York Post. He criticized the DNC's coverage, predicting that Obama would continue to propagate the same misinformation during his keynote address.“I think it was about lies. It was lies about me, all night long they were saying things that weren't true,” Trump stated. His remarks were made in the context of a broader criticism of the convention’s content, which includes a formal roll call to affirm Vice President Kamala Harris's nomination as the party's presidential candidate.The DNC’s second day will feature speeches from Obama and Michelle, alongside other prominent Democratic lawmakers. Their addresses follow President Joe Biden’s emotional speech on Monday, where he reflected on his political career and endorsed Harris as his successor.","Donald Trump praised former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, during an interview with CNN on Monday.

"US elections: Tight race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, new poll shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-tight-race-between-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-new-poll-shows/articleshow/112667101.cms,"A recent Roanoke College poll reveals a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump among likely Virginia voters . Conducted before this week’s Democratic National Convention, the survey shows Harris with a narrow lead of 47% compared to Trump’s 44%. However, this margin falls within the poll’s margin of error of ±4.5 percentage points, reported the Washington Post.When additional candidates are considered, Harris maintains a slim three-point advantage over Trump, leading 45% to 42%.An additional 13% of voters express support for other candidates, including 6% for Robert F Kennedy Jr and 2% for Cornel West.Harry Wilson, a senior political analyst for the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research, noted that the transition from President Joe Biden to Harris has had an impact, but not as significant as anticipated. Previously, Biden was in a similar position against Trump, with a marginal lead in May before his exit from the race.In the Senate race, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine holds a commanding lead, receiving 49% support against Republican challenger Hung Cao’s 38%. Kaine’s strong performance contrasts with the broader dissatisfaction reflected in the poll, reported the Washington Post.Republicans, led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, argue that Virginia remains a competitive battleground, despite Trump’s previous losses in the state by five points in 2016 and ten points in 2020. Nationally, Harris holds a slight edge over Trump, an improvement over Biden’s performance.President Biden’s approval ratings in Virginia remain low, with only 37% of voters viewing him favorably and 61% unfavorably. Harris fares somewhat better, though she remains a net negative, with 43% favorable and 53% unfavorable. Trump’s ratings are between the two, with 40% favorable and 57% unfavorable.Both parties’ vice-presidential candidates also face negative ratings, with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz at 34% favorable and 51% unfavorable, and GOP Sen. JD Vance at 32% favorable and 55% unfavorable. In contrast, Kaine enjoys a favorable rating of 50%, while Youngkin scores 54% favorable with high job approval.The poll indicates a polarized electorate, with 51% of voters viewing Trump as a “threat to democracy” and 47% expressing similar concerns about the process leading to Harris’s nomination. Dissatisfaction is also noted regarding Walz and Vance, reflecting a broader sense of discontent.Wilson emphasized the ongoing polarization between party lines, with diminishing third-party support potentially influencing the election outcome. The survey, conducted from August 12 to August 16, included 691 likely voters, with data collected through phone calls, text messages, and an online panel.","A recent Roanoke College poll reveals a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

The National Board of Revenue (NBR) on Monday instructed banks to unfreeze the accounts of BNP Chairperson Zia, the Daily Star newspaper reported.In August 2007, the NBR's Central Intelligence Cell directed banks to freeze the accounts of the BNP Chairperson, who has been elected Bangladesh's prime minister twice since 1990.The decision was based on a recommendation of a panel formed during the then Army-backed caretaker government, said a senior official of the NBR.Since then, her accounts have remained blocked. The BNP has on several occasions demanded that they be unfrozen.Later, she was allowed to withdraw a certain amount of money every month from Rupali Bank's Shaheed Moinul Road branch of Dhaka Cantonment for running regular expenses.The then caretaker government also blocked Sheikh Hasina's bank accounts but they were unfreezed after she became prime minister.The latest move comes after a mass uprising toppled Hasina, a long-time rival of Khaleda, on August 5, ending the Bangladesh Awami League's 15-year rule. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was sworn in on August 8.Zia, 79, was released from jail after Hasina, 76, fled to India on August 5. Zia served as the prime minister of Bangladesh from March 1991 to March 1996, and again from June 2001 to October 2006.The NBR said they received an application from Khaleda's lawyer on Sunday seeking to unfreeze the accounts.""As there are no tax-related issues pending investigation relating to her, we have advised banks to unlock all her accounts. We have asked them to take immediate action and provide a compliance report,"" the official was quoted as saying.","Tax authorities in Bangladesh have decided to unfreeze the bank accounts of Bangladesh Nationalist Party Chairperson Khaleda Zia.

King Charles III terminates security for Prince Andrew at Royal Lodge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/king-charles-iii-terminates-security-for-prince-andrew-at-royal-lodge/articleshow/112610762.cms,"King Charles III has reportedly terminated the security team stationed at Prince Andrew 's residence, the Royal Lodge , as the Duke of York continues to resist calls to downsize from the property. The decision has fueled speculation that the disgraced royal may soon be forced to vacate his longtime home.According to The Sun, Charles informed the ten-man security detail that their contracts would not be renewed after October.“They are all working the final weeks of their contract till the end of October. It’s not thought anyone is being lined up to replace them,” a palace insider told the outlet. The source added, “Everyone is speculating this means the Duke will have to leave the Royal Lodge because what other reason could there be to take his security away?”Prince Andrew, 64, has resided at the 31-room Royal Lodge, located on the grounds of Windsor Castle , since 2004, after signing a 75-year lease agreement the previous year. The property, valued at $38 million, has been Andrew's home despite the mounting controversy surrounding his association with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein . Since 2019, Andrew has faced eviction pressures following revelations of his ties to Epstein.Further compounding his troubles, Andrew has reportedly neglected to pay for the maintenance of the property, which requires an annual upkeep of $503,000, as reported by Us Weekly in May. The financial strain on the Duke has been significant, with King Charles reportedly paying his younger brother $5.1 million annually to keep him financially afloat.Additionally, the King has been covering the cost of private security at the Royal Lodge since Andrew's $3.8 million Metropolitan Police protection was removed when he was stripped of his royal roles by Queen Elizabeth II.“It isn’t a secret that the King wants him out,” the insider told The Sun.The latest security move comes after reports that Andrew has refused to vacate the Royal Lodge for the smaller Frogmore Cottage, the former residence of his nephew Prince Harry, who was forced to leave the property in June 2023.Despite the tensions, Andrew traveled to Scotland on Friday to join his brother and the rest of the royal family at Balmoral Castle. He will be accompanied by his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, and their grandchildren, according to Express.co.uk. Notably absent from the official guest list were Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle.Andrew has been described as a “recluse,” rarely leaving the Royal Lodge since December. A source told Express.co.uk, “Andrew has hardly left Royal Lodge since Christmas so he’s very much looking forward to getting away with the rest of the family at Balmoral. The King is keen for it to be a happy family occasion which will see members of the family come together for just over a week to discuss plans for the future and to unwind.”","King Charles III has reportedly terminated the security team stationed at Prince Andrew's residence, the Royal Lodge.

In 2007, the greater adjutant stork, locally known as the hargila , faced imminent extinction in Assam, India, with fewer than 450 individuals remaining. Biologist Dr. Purnima Devi Barman spearheaded a groundbreaking conservation effort, rallying 10,000 rural women to protect the storks and reframe them as cultural symbols rather than omens of ill fortune.This initiative, known as the Hargila Army , has led to a remarkable recovery, with the stork’s population now exceeding 1,800. Recognized by the 2024 Whitley Gold Award, Barman is expanding her efforts to ensure the stork’s continued resurgence and global conservation impact.Dr. Barman enlisted the help of 10,000 rural women, forming what would become known as the 'Hargila Army' or 'Stork Sisters'. These women played a crucial role in protecting the storks' nests and shifting the perception of these prehistoric-looking scavengers from symbols of bad omen to positive cultural icons.The success of this grassroots movement was evident when the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reclassified the stork from Endangered to Near Threatened in December 2023. Since 2007, the population in Assam has surged to over 1,800.In recognition of her remarkable efforts, Dr. Barman was honored with the 2024 Whitley Gold Award by the Whitley Fund for Nature (WFN). This prestigious accolade celebrates grassroots conservation leaders and provides vital support for future initiatives. With the funding from this award, Dr. Barman plans to double the Hargila Army to 20,000 women and extend the conservation efforts to the Indian state of Bihar and Cambodia, targeting all remaining breeding grounds of the stork.Dr. Barman’s conservation efforts extend beyond safeguarding the storks. Her work has empowered thousands of women, enhancing their livelihoods and catalysing social change in their villages. Educational programs in local schools are integral to her strategy, fostering a new generation of allies for the stork.The Hargila army's vision for the futureThe Hargila Army’s expansion aims to increase the stork population to 5,000 by 2030. This ambitious goal includes extending the conservation work to Cambodia and Bihar, emphasizing community involvement and education. As Dr. Barman puts it, “Magic happens when we involve communities. The Hargila Army is like a sisterhood network among the women.”The Hargila Army’s expansion aims to increase the stork population to 5,000 by 2030.

Hamilton is seeking unspecified damages for her injuries.Neither Hamilton’s attorney nor a Delta spokesperson commented on the lawsuit.This lawsuit adds to Delta’s recent legal troubles.

Presidential Election: Harris packs the Wisconsin arena that hosted the RNC while the Obamas address the DNC in Chicago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harris-packs-the-wisconsin-arena-that-hosted-the-rnc-while-the-obamas-address-the-dnc-in-chicago/articleshow/112668574.cms,"CHICAGO: Kamala Harris rallied thousands of voters in one packed arena as former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama energized millions more on Harris' behalf inside another on a Tuesday night designed to demonstrate the energy and breadth of the Democratic nominee 's evolving coalition.""I am feeling hope,"" Obama told the Democratic National Convention in Chicago just minutes after his wife, the former first lady Michelle Obama, told the same crowd that, ""Something wonderfully magical is in the air, isn't it?""""America, hope is making a comeback,"" she said.Harris, speaking earlier in battleground Wisconsin - at a rally in the arena where Republicans held their convention last month - declared that she was running ""a people-powered campaign.""""Together we will chart a new way forward,"" the vice president said in remarks that were partially broadcast to the DNC. ""A future for freedom, opportunity, of optimism and faith.""The raucous night of events spanning two states underscored the diversity of the coalition that Harris' campaign is working to stitch together in her bid to defeat Trump this fall. She is drawing on the party's biggest stars, leaders from the far left to the middle, and even some Republicans to boost her campaign.And while the theme of the night was ""a bold vision for America's future,"" the disparate factions of Harris' evolving coalition demonstrated, above all, that they are connected by a deep desire to prevent a second Trump presidency.Obama, the nation's first Black president, returned to the convention stage 20 years after making his first appearance at a national convention, a 2004 appearance in Boston that propelled him into the national spotlight ahead of his successful presidential run.""History will remember Joe Biden as a president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger,"" Obama said on Tuesday as the crowd chanted, ""Thank you, Joe."" ""I am proud to call him my president, but even prouder to call him my friend.""Sens. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent beloved by progressives, both praised Harris.And in an appearance perhaps intended to needle Trump, his former press secretary Stephanie Grisham - now a harsh critic of her former boss - also took the convention stage.Trump ""has no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth,"" Grisham said. ""I love my country more than my party. Kamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people. And she has my vote.""Still, it was not all serious on the second night of the four-day convention.A symbolic roll call in which delegates from each state pledged their support for the Democratic nominee turned into a party atmosphere. A DJ played a mix of state-specific songs - and Atlanta native Lil Jon ran out during Georgia's turn to his hit song with DJ Snake, ""Turn Down for What,"" to the delight of the thousands inside the cavernous United Center.Second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who would become the nation's first gentleman if his wife wins the presidency, shared personal details about his relationship with Harris - their cooking habits, their first date and her laugh, which is often mocked by Republican critics.""You know that laugh. I love that laugh!"" Emhoff said as the crowd cheered. Later, he added, ""Her empathy is her strength.""Trump, meanwhile, was out on the campaign trail as part of his weeklong swing-state tour during the Democratic convention. He went to Howell, Michigan, on Tuesday and stood aside sheriff's deputies as he labeled Harris the ""ringleader"" of a ""Marxist attack on law enforcement"" across the country.""Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death,"" Trump said in one of many generalizations about an America under Harris.Harris, meanwhile, cast the election in dire, almost existential terms. She implored Americans not to get complacent in light of the Supreme Court decision carving out broad presidential immunity, a power she said Trump would abuse.She has also seized on Trump's opposition to a nationally guaranteed right to abortion.""They seemingly don't trust women,"" she said of Trump and his Republican allies. ""Well, we trust women.""The vice president's speech evoked some of the same themes that underlaid Biden's case for reelection before he dropped out, casting Trump as a threat to democracy. Harris argued that Trump threatens the values and freedoms that Americans hold dear.Trump said he would be a dictator only on his first day in office, a quip he later said was a joke, and has vowed as president to assert more control over federal prosecutions, an area of government that has traditionally been left to the Justice Department.Someone with that record ""should never again have the opportunity to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States,"" Harris said. ""Never again.""","Kamala Harris is drawing on the party's biggest stars, leaders from the far left to the middle, and even some Republicans to boost her campaign.

My fellow Americans, while 60 per cent of our people live paycheck to paycheck, the top 1 per cent have never had it so good. These oligarchs tell us we shouldn't tax the rich; we shouldn't take on price gouging; we shouldn't expand medicare to cover dental, hearing, and vision; and we shouldn't increase social security benefits for struggling seniors,"" he said.""Well, I've got some bad news for them.

And let me tell you what else we must do. We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all as a human right, not a privilege,"" he said.""We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, and pass the PRO Act so that workers can organise in unions for decent pay and decent benefits, Sanders said at the DNC.He said public education needed to be strengthened, teacher salaries should be raised and added that every American receives higher education regardless of income.""We need to take on 'Big Pharma' and cut prescription drug costs in half, so that we pay no more than other countries,"" the senator said.","Sanders spoke of the critical importance of delivering a progressive economic agenda for the working-class Americans and taking on rampant corporate greed.

In 2021, Vance was asked whether there should be exceptions for rape and incest in abortion cases. It was then that JD Vance used the term ""inconvenience"". Appearing on NBC's 'Morning Joe', Beshear referred to that comment and said inconvenience is traffic, ""make him go through this"".What exactly did Vance say in 2021 on this? ""It’s not whether a woman should be forced to bring a child to term but whether a child should be allowed to live even though the circumstances of that child’s birth are somehow inconvenient or a problem to society.""“It is someone being violated, someone being harmed, and then telling them that they don’t have options after that, that fails any test of decency, of humanity,"" Andy said reacting to that statement.Vance expressed his disgust and asked why Andy Beshear was wishing that a member of Vance's family should get raped. “His comments are disgusting, vile, and should not be tolerated in American politics.

JD Vance knows that he and Donald Trump are so wrong on this issue, and so he’s trying to make himself the victim,” Beshear said.“As a man, JD Vance will never have to face any of this personally, but it’s sad that he lacks the empathy to be able to put himself in a different position and to understand why having exceptions, having reproductive freedom, is so important in the first place,” Andy added. “Obviously, I never wish harm on anyone. It [is] just again, deflection, trying to make himself and Donald Trump the victims.”","Kentucky Gov Andy Beshear said 'Make him go through this"" on Republican VP candidate JD Vance's past comment of calling pregnancy from rape an ""inconvenience"" In 2021, Vance was asked whether there should be exceptions for rape and incest in abortion cases.

But now Tim Walz's wife Gwen clarified that it was not in vitro fertilization but a different procedure called intrauterine insemination.

""Today it came out that Tim Walz had lied about having a family via IVF. Who lies about something like that?"" JD Vance said.Gwen said the fertility process was a difficult and personal experience. “Like so many who have experienced these challenges, we kept it largely to ourselves at the time – not even sharing the details with our wonderful and close family. The only person who knew in detail what we were going through was our next-door neighbor,” she said in the statement. “She was a nurse and helped me with the shots I needed as part of the IUI process. I’d rush home from school and she would give me the shots to ensure we stayed on track,” she continued.In IVF, egg is removed from a person's body and combined with a sperm in the lab and then it's implanted in the womb but in intrauterine insemination, sperm is placed directly in the uterus.Harris campaign, however, dismissed the IVF, IUI row and said Tim Walz referred to it as IVF like a normal person as IVF is the commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.Gwen said that they decided to formally speak about their struggles with infertility and their journey after seeing the extreme attacks on reproductive health care.","Tim Walz's wife Gwen clarified that it was not in vitro fertilization but a different procedure called intrauterine insemination.

'I want to study'

DADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan , 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.""I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,"" Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.""But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.""Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity .The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.""This has led to a new trend of ' monsoon brides ',"" said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.""Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.""Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.""Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,"" said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.""They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done"".Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.""My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,"" she said.""I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,"" she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.""Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.""Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.""We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,"" said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.""They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,"" she added.""The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.""Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.Unicef has reported ""significant strides"" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.""We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,"" it said in a report after the 2022 floods.Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.""When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities',"" the daily wage labourer told AFP.Mehtab was just 10 years old.""The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep,"" said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.""I have told my father I want to study,"" she said. ""I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself.""","Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years.

The first trial was carried out in July, which resulted in the slowing down of social media platforms.PM Shehbaz Sharif’s government had allocated more than 30 billion Pakistani rupees in the development budget for the acquisition and installation of this filtering system.However, the adverse impacts after installing the firewall drew criticism from netizens and digital rights groups, who expressed fear about the future of internet-based businesses in Pakistan.government authorities had so far feigned ignorance over the internet disruptions being linked to firewall installation, and had blamed telecom and internet service providers for connectivity issues.On Thursday, however, IT minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said her ministry was addressing complaints of slow internet speed, even though she did not link the problem with thecybersecurity firewall .“There have been complaints of slow internet and I have asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to provide data of the last two weeks to look at the data traffic to know the speed issue,” she told reporters.Asked about the installation of a firewall, the minister said it was a cybersecurity matter and that countries around the world used the technology. “Previously, government was managing the web system, but with increasing international cybersecurity attacks on the country, there is a growing need for the state to strengthen its ability to prevent these attacks,” Khawaja said.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.The association of internet service providers have blamed the slow internet speed and outages on increased security and surveillance. “It’s a very discouraging situation for our customers. Many are leaving the smaller ISPs because they cannot sustain the poor service quality any more. If this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan,” read a statement issued by service providers.","Pakistan government confirms that it is upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.

Hameed, who served as director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, was arrested following action in the complaint of a private property developer over alleged misuse of official authority.""Investigations are underway in the Faiz case. More arrests are likely in the army and elsewhere,"" Dawn News quoted the minister as saying here.""It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country's security… all those will come in its grasp,"" Tarar said.The minister's remarks came hours after the ISPR, the military's public affairs division, in a statement on Thursday said: ""In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.""The ISPR said more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests.The ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested and did not indicate when the arrests had been made, but media reports claimed they were identified as Brigadier (Retd) Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; Brig (Retd) Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and Colonel (Retd) Asim.Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the case, Tarar said the institution of the army had prioritised self-accountability.""We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.""Tarar said when a no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. ""[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,"" he alleged.Taking note of the ISPR statement, Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread. Attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were security attacks.""I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,"" he said, adding that jailed former premier Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but ""won't be able to save his neck"".The ISPR announcement follows speculation that numerous retired officers had been detained about Gen Hameed's trial for his post-retirement actions that violated the Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court.Hameed was arrested on August 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday.His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of the Pakistan Army.The unprecedented arrest of the top-ranking officer, who led the premier intelligence agency, broke the myth in the country that such powerful officers were beyond the reach of law.Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that Khan was not happy with Munir.Later, the army decided to replace Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Khan. It is believed that it was the beginning of the souring of his ties with the powerful military.Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has wielded considerable power in security and foreign policy matters.","More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Friday, a day after three more retired military officers were arrested in the case. The ISPR said more retired officers were being probed for allegedly inciting instability.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112564119,imgsize-1002511,width-400,resizemode-4/112564119.jpg"

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's main opposition party BNP on Tuesday urged India to extradite deposed PM Sheikh Hasina to face trial in murder and other cases registered against her since she took flight on August 5 in the face of a student-led uprising. ""It is our call to you that you should hand her over to government of Bangladesh in a legal way.The people of this country have given the decision for her trial.Let her face that trial,"" BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said in Dhaka after paying tribute to the party's founder president Ziaur Rahman.Alamgir said Hasina being allowed to take refuge in India isn't aligned with the country's commitment to upholding democratic principles. ""Staying there, she has started various plots to thwart the revolution that happened in Bangladesh.""Bangladesh and India have extradition treaty based on which they are required to hand over people against whom proceedings have been initiated in courts for any ""extraditable crime"", including financial offences liable to invite a minimum punishment of a year in jail.BNP, whose ailing chairperson and ex-PM Khaleda Zia was freed from house arrest after Hasina fled, said the murder and extortion cases filed against the latter were in the ""extraditable"" category.The bilateral treaty isn't applicable to cases that are ""political in nature"", although this exemption is not available to those charged with serious crimes like murder, sources said.India can turn down any request for Hasina's extradition by citing Article 8 of the treaty, which allows the signatories to refuse requests that have ""not been made in good faith and in the interests of justice"". The BNP secretary general alleged that Hasina's Awami League was ""still conspiring in New Delhi to falsify the victory"" of students and other citizens of Bangladesh. ""I am saying this strongly, and we want to make it clear that I do not think that India can get much love from the people by sheltering the enemy of the people of Bangladesh, who had to flee from the country,"" Alamgir said.Awami League has criticised Bangladesh's interim government for cases registered against Hasina, terming them ""false and politically motivated"".","Bangladesh and India have extradition treaty based on which they are required to hand over people against whom proceedings have been initiated.
