Delta Air Line sues CrowdStrike over 'catastrophic' software update that prompted mass flight cancellations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/delta-air-line-sues-crowdstrike-over-catastrophic-software-update-that-prompted-mass-flight-cancellations/articleshow/114605684.cms,"Representative Image

What happened on July 19

Delta Air Line on Friday sued the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike following a global outage in July that resulted in widespread flight cancellations , disrupted travel plans for 1.3 million customers, and cost the airline over $500 million in losses.The air line filed the lawsuit in the Georgia state's Fulton County Superior Court where it described the faulty software update from CrowdStrike as ""catastrophic,"" and said that the firm forced the customers to do the untested and faulty updates. This caused over 8.5 million Microsoft Windows-based computers around the world to ""crash.""The July 19 incident led to worldwide flight cancellations and hit industries around the globe including banks, health care, media companies and hotel chains, according to Reuters.CrowdStrike responded to the allegations late on Friday, stating, ""Delta's claims are based on disproven misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.""Delta, which has been a customer of CrowdStrike products since 2022, reported that the outage forced the cancellation of 7,000 flights and impacted 1.3 million passengers over a five-day period. The airline is seeking to recover over $500 million in out-of-pocket losses, as well as additional compensation for lost profits, expenditures, including attorneys' fees, ""reputational harm and future revenue loss.""The incident has also prompted an investigation by the US Transportation Department. Delta's lawsuit asserts, ""If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed."" The airline further stated that because the faulty update could not be removed remotely, ""CrowdStrike crippled Delta's business and created immense delays for Delta customers.""Delta emphasized that as part of its IT planning and infrastructure, it has invested billions of dollars ""in licensing and building some of the best technology solutions in the airline industry."" CrowdStrike has questioned why Delta was more severely affected than other airlines and claimed minimal liability, which Delta has rejected.Last month, Adam Meyers, a senior vice president at CrowdStrike, apologized before Congress for the faulty software update. Meyers explained that the company had released a content configuration update for its Falcon Sensor security software, which led to system crashes worldwide. He stated, ""We are deeply sorry this happened and we are determined to prevent this from happening again.""On July 19, a widespread technology disruption, seemingly connected to issues at global cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and Microsoft, has impacted various industries worldwide, including airports, airlines, financial institutions, and media outlets.Numerous airports and airlines have been affected by the outage. Berlin airport suspended all flights until 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) due to a technical issue.Spanish airport operator Aena reported a computer systems ""incident"" at all Spanish airports, potentially causing flight delays. Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, a major European air transport hub, confirmed it was impacted by the global cyber outage and advised travelers to contact their airlines directly. KLM, the Netherlands' flagship airline, suspended most of its operations, while its parent company, Air France, also experienced disruptions, Reuters reported.Turkish Airlines encountered problems with ticketing, check-in, and booking due to the global technical issue. Major U.S. carriers, including American Airlines, Delta Airlines , and United Airlines, issued ground stops citing communication problems. SAS, Qantas, and Cathay Pacific also reported delays and technical difficulties.The financial sector has also been impacted by the outage. Commonwealth Bank, Australia's largest bank, reported that some customers were unable to transfer money. Several major oil and gas trading desks in London and Singapore struggled to execute trades. Macquarie Capital was unable to provide liquidity for unexpired warrants on HKEX due to technical problems. South Africa's Capitec said card payments, ATM, and app services were fully restored following significant nationwide disruptions linked to CrowdStrike. LSEG Group's Workspace news and data platform suffered an outage, causing disruption across financial markets.Media outlets have also been affected. Sky News, a major British television news channel, went off air. Australia's state broadcaster ABC experienced a ""major network outage,"" while regular programming at Sky News Australia was disrupted.The outage has also impacted emergency services and healthcare. A health booking system used by doctors in England went offline. Several hospitals in the Netherlands had to scale down their operations. Victorian state police in Australia reported that some internal systems were affected, but emergency services were operating normally. Copenhagen's fire department experienced problems receiving automatically transmitted fire alarms and urged people to call 112 in case of a fire.","Delta Air Line on Friday sued cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike following a global outage in July that resulted in widespread flight cancellations.

America the Beautiful has become a 'garbage can' for the world: Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections-america-the-beautiful-has-become-a-garbage-can-for-the-world-says-trump/articleshow/114587869.cms,"Image credit: Reuters

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Next only to the America's national anthem Star Spangled Banner, the songs American the Beautiful and God Bless the USA, often played at Trump rallies, are widely regarded as the country's top patriotic national songs. But according to the MAGA supremo, America has now become “a garbage can for the world” because of illegal border crossings.In campaign speeches on Thursday, the former President took his dark dystopian view of what America has become and carried his screed against illegal immigrants to a new low, while blaming the Biden-Harris administration border policies for turning the US into a ""garbage can.""“We’re like a garbage can, you know, it’s the first time I’ve ever said that. And every time I come up and talk about what they’ve done to our country, I get angry. First time I’ve ever said garbage can, but you know what, it’s a very accurate description,” Trump raged at a rally in Tempe, Arizona, a battleground state on the border with Texas, in a clear effort to whip up his supporters.In other rallies through the day, Trump ramped up his tirade against illegal immigrants, who he has previously said are ""poisoning the blood of our country,"" calling them animals, who needed to be evicted from the country quickly.He also used new epithets for his political rivals, calling President Biden a ""stupid fool"" and saying former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is ""crazy as a bedbug,"" while continuing to disparage his opponent Kamala Harris.The MAGA supremo also ratcheted up his threats of retribution against journalists, whom he characterized as “the enemy of the people,” with a caveat that ""some reporters are good"" and ""we have to free them from the left.""Trump's dark vision of an America overrun by illegal immigrants, first expressed during his 2016 presidential campaign when he spoke of Mexico sending rapists to the US, has now taken a ominous tone. His speeches are laced with graphic description of immigrant crimes, despite studies showing immigrants -- legal or illegal -- are more law-abiding than people born in the US.Crimes, including homicides and assaults, is also falling nationwide, but the former President also cherrypicks data to argue that the US is going to the dogs, with violent illegal immigrant gangs overrunning American cities. He has dialed down on the hoax about Haitian immigrants eating dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio, but has now picked up more authentic, established stories of murders and rapes by illegal immigrants, which are fewer than what happens in everyday America.Trump's dark rhetoric and his advocacy of strong-arm methods against not just illegal immigrants, whom he wants deported en masse, but also against political rivals, is triggering alarms about an imminent civil war in the US, graphically portrayed in a recent movie titled ""Civil War.""Stephen Marche, a Canadian writer whose book the movie is based on, has said in recent interviews that he thought the next civil war would take place in 2040, but he now feels he is wrong and it feels closer than that.In the book, Marche quotes a retired army colonel saying a new American civil war would not be like the first one, with armies maneuvring on the battlefield. “I think it would very much be a free-for-all... neighbor on neighbor, based on beliefs and skin colours and religion. And it would be horrific,"" he says.So far there have been no reported attacks on immigrants or neighbor-on-neighbor clashes due to political differences. If anything, battleground states have political mixed neighborhoods with Trump and Harris supporters living side by side quite amicably.But there are growing apprehensions that passions could explode in the hours and days after November 5 when Trump is expected to claim victory regardless of whether he wins or loses. The MAGA supremo has said he will only accept a result that shows him as the winner and it would not have been an honest election if the result is adverse.","In campaign speeches on Thursday, the former President took his dark dystopian view of what America has become.

Halifax regional police have confirmed that the victim's body was discovered in a walk-in oven.“We urge the public to be mindful of sharing speculative information on social media,” HRP said in a Tuesday release.According to a GoFundMe , Kaur, who came to Canada with big dreams, was working along with her mother at Walmart for the last two years.In the evening of the incident, like any watchful mother tried to locate her after not seeing for one hour. She went on asking people about her daughter's whereabout but everyone brushed aside thinking that she may be somewhere helping a customer, Walmart is a superstore after all!. Her phone was not reachable.According to the website, Gursimran's father and brother are in India and communities are trying to get them here as soon as possible. ""This family's sufferings are unimaginable and indescribable.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Microsoft has terminated the employment of two individuals who organised an unauthorised vigil at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, to honour Palestinians killed in Gaza during the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas .The employees, Abdelrahman Mohamed and Hossam Nasr, were part of a group called ""No Azure for Apartheid"" that opposed Microsoft's sale of cloud-computing technology to the Israeli government.The employees argued that the event was similar to other Microsoft-sanctioned employee gift campaigns for people in need.Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist from Egypt, expressed disappointment in Microsoft's failure to provide a space for employees to come together and grieve for those who lost their lives. He now faces the challenge of finding a new job within two months to avoid deportation due to his work visa status.Nasr, an Egyptian-raised 2021 graduate of Harvard University and co-organiser of Harvard Alumni for Palestine, said that the vigil's purpose was twofold: to honour the victims of what he called the ""Palestinian genocide in Gaza"" and to draw attention to Microsoft's alleged complicity in the conflict through the use of its technology by the Israeli military.Nasr's firing was made public on social media by the watchdog groupStop Antisemitism before he received the official call from Microsoft.This incident follows a similar situation at Google, where more than 50 workers were fired in the aftermath of protests over the company's involvement in ""Project Nimbus,"" a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 for Google and Amazon to provide cloud computing and artificial intelligence services to the Israeli government.Microsoft has declined to provide specific details about the firings, citing privacy and confidentiality considerations, but maintains its commitment to maintaining a professional and respectful work environment.",Two Microsoft employees were fired for holding an unauthorised vigil.

The Washington Post ’s decision not to endorse any candidate in the 2024 presidential election has sparked criticism and resignations, even as The Post’s leadership attempts to justify it.The Post’s 36-year tradition of endorsing presidential candidates was reportedly called off by the billionaire owner Jeff Bezos , according to The New York Post.The editorial page staffers had reportedly drafted an endorsement for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris over former President Donald Trump The decision seems to have caused divisions within The Post. Veteran editorial board member Robert Kagan , a vocal Trump critic, resigned in protest. Former editor Marty Baron condemned the move as “cowardice, with democracy as its casualty,” arguing it undermines The Post's role in holding political leaders accountable.Critics, including some staff, have questioned Bezos’s motives, noting his vast business interests. They speculate his decision may stem from Trump’s past criticisms of Bezos and Amazon, given the company’s reliance on government contracts.Publisher Will Lewis announced that The Washington Post would be “returning to its roots” by refraining from endorsements in this and future elections. In a note to readers, Lewis acknowledged that some might see this as “a tacit endorsement or condemnation” of one candidate over another. However, he argued that the decision reflects commitment to “integrity and courage in public service.”Bezos, worth an estimated $209 billion, hasn’t commented publicly, fueling further speculation. Former Washington Post editor Karen Attiah voiced frustration, calling the decision “a stab in the back to all of us who value democracy.”Numerous subscribers took to social media, with some cancelling subscriptions and accusing Bezos of prioritizing his business agenda over public service. Many commenters saw it as a betrayal of The Post’s readers, who’ve long relied on the paper for guidance on political endorsements.This trend isn’t unique to The Post, as The Los Angeles Times also recently announced a similar policy, reportedly directed by owner Patrick Soon-Shiong.The policy has led to resignations and raised concerns over the growing influence of wealthy media owners on editorial decisions. Critics argue these choices mark a troubling shift in how news organizations engage with democratic processes, especially during divisive times.","The Washington Post will not endorse any candidate in the 2024 presidential election.

Army releases redacted police report on altercation during controversial Trump's Arlington cemetery visit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/army-releases-redacted-police-report-on-altercation-during-controversial-trumps-arlington-cemetery-visit/articleshow/114600776.cms,"The US Army on Friday disclosed a almost entirely redacted police report detailing an incident in which a member of Donald Trump's campaign staff allegedly pushed an Arlington National Cemetery employee.The report released under a court order, obscures a crucial word that seems to describe the Trump campaign staffer shoving the cemetery worker aside.According to the visible portions of the report, the Trump staffer used both hands while trying to get past the cemetery employee. The names of both individuals are redacted, and the cemetery worker's sworn statement to the police is entirely blacked out. Officials had previously stated that the former president's staffer pushed the cemetery worker when she was trying to prevent two people from filming and photographing Trump's visit to gravesites in Section 60, a sacred area where US forces killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried.The report indicates that the cemetery worker declined medical treatment and did not wish to press charges. American Oversight , a Washington-based government transparency group, filed a lawsuit demanding the release of the police report, and a federal judge ordered it to be made public by Friday. The group has posted the report on its website.Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is in a close race against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, and the altercation raised concerns about his campaign's politicization of the military. Trump was at the cemetery at the invitation of service members' families and brought staff to document the visit. He later shared a video from the visit on TikTok, which included scenes of him at the cemetery and a voiceover blaming theBiden administration for the ""disaster"" of the Afghanistan withdrawal in August 2021.Chioma Chukwu, interim executive director of American Oversight, expressed satisfaction that the report was released, allowing the public to see ""that there is still an ongoing federal law enforcement investigation into the August incident at Arlington National Cemetery."" Chukwu emphasized that Trump and his staff's conduct ""aligns with his history of politicizing the military and violating clear ethical boundaries, and it's time for the public to have all the facts.""In a letter accompanying the report, Army senior counsel Paul DeAgostino explained that the redactions were made to protect personal privacy and information compiled for law enforcement purposes.He said that the records are part of an ongoing investigation and their release ""could reasonably be expected to interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings.""The Army reiterated DeAgostino's comment, stating that it released the report to comply with the court order and that the police investigation ""remains open and we are therefore unable to provide further information at this time.""It is unclear what law enforcement proceedings are ongoing, as the employee declined to press charges. Families of three service members killed in a suicide bombing during the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal had invited Trump to a ceremony marking the third anniversary of the attack. They said the former president knew their children's stories and have blamed the Biden administration for their deaths.A defense official had previously stated that the Trump campaign was warned about not taking photographs in Section 60 before their arrival and the altercation. During a campaign event in Michigan several days after the incident, Trump complained that family members had asked to take a photo with him at the cemetery, saying, ""They ask me to have a picture, and they say I was campaigning,"" without addressing the TikTok video.",The US Army on Friday disclosed a almost entirely redacted police report detailing an incident in which a member of Donald Trump's campaign staff allegedly pushed an Arlington National Cemetery employee.

Democrats burn through cash while outraising Republicans in final weeks of fight for the Senate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democrats-burn-through-cash-while-outraising-republicans-in-final-weeks-of-fight-for-the-senate/articleshow/114599494.cms,"Democratic candidates outspent their republican rivals in during the first two week of October in closely contested Senate race in US.According to a recent Federal Election Commission filings, Democrats spent more than three times as much as their their GOP opponents during this critical period of the election in states like Ohio, Montana and Michigan.According to a report in Politico , Despite facing a challenging Senate map, Democrats have benefited from this financial edge, enabling them to allocate significant resources to defend multiple states.Colin Allred , who is running against GOP Senator Ted Cruz in Texas, raised an impressive $11.3 million in just 16 days, surpassing Cruz's $9.9 million. Cruz, however, was the highest-raising Republican senator and the only GOP candidate in a high-profile race to outspend his rival.Vulnerable Democratic incumbents Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio raised $9 million and $7.8 million, respectively, while their Republican challengers only brought in $2.3 million and $1.9 million. This fundraising advantage allowed the Democratic incumbents to maintain a higher cash balance for the final days of the campaign, even after substantial spending in recent weeks, Politico reported.In Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Democratic Senate candidates also raised at least three times more than their Republican opponents in the first half of October. Meanwhile, in Nebraska, independent candidate Dan Osborn raised just over $3 million compared to incumbent GOP Sen. Deb Fischer's $560,000, making the race unexpectedly competitive and prompting last-minute defensive spending from national Republicans .To counter Democrats' financial advantage, Republicans have depended heavily on outside groups to support their candidates in competitive states. For example, the Senate Leadership Fund, the largest Republican super PAC, recently started spending in Nevada, reflecting growing optimism about Sam Brown's challenge to Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen.Additionally, Republicans have utilized innovative fundraising strategies, such as a joint fundraising committee affiliated with GOP candidate Tim Sheehy in Montana, which spent over $1 million on advertising in early October, exploiting a campaign finance law loophole to reduce Tester's cash advantage.","Vulnerable Democratic incumbents Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio raised $9 million and $7.8 million, respectively, while their Republican challengers only brought in $2.3million and $1.9million.

Chinese hackers targeted data from the phones used by former president Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, a New York Times report said citing people familiar with the matter. Investigators are yet to determine what communication data was taken or observed by the hackers.""The type of information on phones used by a presidential candidate and his running mate could be a gold mine for an intelligence agency: Who they called and texted, how often they communicated with certain people, and how long they talked to those people could be highly valuable to an adversary like China. That sort of communications data could be even more useful if hackers could observe it in real time,"" the NYT report said.The Donald Trump campaign was informed that Trump and Vance's phones were among a number of people inside and outside of the government whose phone numbers had been targeted through the infiltration of Verizon phone systems .Data about the communications of a presidential and vice-presidential candidate — even absent the content of the calls and messages — could also help an adversary like China better identify and target people in Trump’s inner circle for influence operations, the report said.A Trump campaign spokesman did not directly address whether the phones used by Trump and Vance had been targeted. But in a statement, the spokesman, Steven Cheung, criticized the White House and Vice President Kamala Harris and sought to blame them for allowing a foreign adversary to target the campaign.Earlier this year, security officials discovered the presence in American telecommunications systems of a China-affiliated hacking group called Salt Typhoon by Western cybersecurity experts. But investigators determined only recently that the hackers were targeting specific phone numbers, the officials said.The investigation into the extent of the hacking and any national security damage is in its early stages. Whether such an attack could monitor or record phone conversations is difficult to know, and whether the hackers could read or intercept texts, for example, would depend in no small part on which messaging apps the targets used and how that data moved over the phone company’s systems.","Chinese hackers targeted data from the phones used by former president Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, a New York Times report said.

Why Donald Trump's appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast could decide the race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-joe-rogan-white-house-kamala-harris/articleshow/114591075.cms,"Not Your Average Broadcast: Rogan’s Unique Appeal

Rogan’s Influence in the Political Landscape

Clearing the Air: Reaching Out to Disaffected Voters

Building the Anti-Woke Coalition

Engaging with the Podcast Generation

What’s Next?

With a planned appearance on ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" former president Donald Trump has seized on an influential platform to further his appeal ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. This move marks a noteworthy turn in Trump’s outreach strategy, as the former president seeks to resonate with Rogan's diverse and often contrarian audience, many of whom don’t traditionally align with mainstream political affiliations. Rogan, known for his eclectic guest lineup and a conversational format that runs for hours, offers Trump an unconventional avenue to discuss his views in an unrestricted setting—a strategic choice that may reflect Trump’s goals of expanding his appeal, countering criticism, and tapping into cultural currents outside traditional conservative circles.Joe Rogan’s podcast, as a medium, is distinctly different from the typical press circuits or debate stages. With approximately 14.5 million Spotify followers, Rogan’s show regularly reaches a massive, diverse listenership that spans age groups and political spectrums. His reputation as a ""regular guy"" offering straightforward commentary has bolstered his popularity, especially among younger men, a demographic Trump has struggled to mobilise.Furthermore, the format itself is unique. A podcast conversation allows for depth and nuance beyond what campaign rallies or mainstream interviews offer, which plays to Trump’s unfiltered, conversational style. On Rogan’s show, guests often find space to express themselves freely—sometimes drifting into contentious territories, yet benefiting from the relatively non-confrontational environment. Trump’s objective here may be to use Rogan's platform to showcase a less formal, more relatable persona, which could be advantageous in reaching undecided voters or those traditionally disengaged from politics.Rogan’s political stance is famously elusive, often defying labels. Though he initially supported Bernie Sanders in 2020, he has also voiced support for figures like Ron DeSantis and briefly endorsed independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who later endorsed Trump after suspending his campaign. This varied alignment reveals a nuanced and complex political viewpoint that resonates with his audience’s desire for authenticity and independent thinking, far removed from partisan echo chambers.With this in mind, Trump likely hopes to use the platform to bridge ideological divides by positioning himself as an anti-establishment candidate—someone willing to challenge the norms, just as Rogan’s show often does. Rogan’s audience includes listeners disillusioned by both ends of the political spectrum, and Trump might aim to leverage this by focusing on topics that resonate with Rogan’s core themes, like critiques of mainstream media, “woke culture,” and governmental overreach.One of Trump’s strategic aims may be to address criticisms that paint him as divisive or out of touch. In the past, Rogan has expressed critical views on Trump, calling him an ""existential threat to democracy itself"" and noting he had declined Trump’s requests to appear on the show. This past reluctance from Rogan and the publicised clash between the two over issues like the 2020 election and Trump’s response to COVID-19 form a complicated backdrop. By appearing on Rogan’s show, Trump might hope to demonstrate his ability to address critics directly, presenting himself as willing to engage even with those who don’t initially support him.Further, Rogan’s audience, drawn to his anti-establishment stance, may see Trump’s willingness to confront criticism as a sign of resilience, appealing to the large segment of voters feeling alienated from conventional political discourse. Here, Trump might also address issues such as vaccine mandates or media bias, aligning himself with Rogan's critiques of perceived ""woke"" overreach while trying to reframe himself as a defender of personal freedoms—a strategy that could resonate among Rogan’s younger, independence-valuing listeners.As the campaign season intensifies, Trump has sharpened his rhetoric around so-called “woke” culture, a theme Rogan’s podcast frequently touches on. Rogan’s show provides a relaxed environment for Trump to discuss his views on cultural and social issues without the scrutiny typical of a news interview. In recent years, cultural topics like identity politics, free speech, and government intervention have emerged as central to Rogan’s discourse, and Trump is likely to lean into these discussions.By delving into these subjects, Trump may hope to energise an anti-woke coalition, extending beyond traditional conservative voters to include independents and moderate liberals weary of political correctness. This strategic alignment with Rogan’s brand could allow Trump to speak to shared grievances over cancel culture and “woke” ideology, potentially broadening his support base among those who might otherwise lean politically neutral or even left-leaning.Podcasts are a potent medium for connecting with younger generations, particularly millennials and Gen Z, who increasingly turn to them for information and entertainment. Trump’s appearances on traditional media platforms have often focused on his core messages but may not reach the demographics that dominate Rogan’s listener base. Through this podcast, Trump can attempt to appeal to young men who may be less interested in traditional political messaging but are tuned into Rogan’s unfiltered format.By joining Rogan’s show, Trump may hope to transcend the polarised image that his critics have painted. For example, he could use this platform to address issues like economic anxiety or criticism of Big Tech’s influence on free speech, topics that resonate across political divides. In doing so, he might hope to create a more relatable image for himself as someone attentive to the challenges facing the younger workforce.Despite their ideological differences, both Trump and Rogan have established themselves as cultural disruptors who openly challenge the status quo. By engaging with Rogan, Trump signals a willingness to reach new audiences on their terms, appealing to those disillusioned by mainstream media and conventional political platforms. This podcast appearance may mark a turning point in Trump’s outreach strategy, blending his populist appeal with Rogan’s influential, independent platform to reinforce his image as an outsider ready to disrupt American politics once again.Ultimately, Trump's appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” may not convert all of Rogan’s listeners into supporters, but it holds potential for reframing his image. Whether discussing policy, personal freedom, or the future of American identity, Trump stands to gain by embracing Rogan’s loyal, diverse audience as he navigates the 2024 campaign. For Trump, stepping into Rogan’s arena is more than just an interview—it’s a bid to redefine the campaign conversation on his terms.","Former president Donald Trump has planned to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan authorities Thursday released Bushra Bibi , wife of jailed former PM Imran Khan , from prison in Rawalpindi, a day after Islamabad high court granted her bail in an alleged graft case involving purchase and sale of state gifts.Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31. She and her husband were convicted of corruption and illegal marriage just ahead of the Feb 8 polls in Pakistan. The Islamabad-based accountability court had sentenced the couple to 14 years in jail in what is known as the “toshakhana” (state repository) case.The case over allegations of illegal marriage had collapsed on appeal and Bibi’s graft sentence was suspended in July, allowing her to walk free from Adiala Jail where Imran remains imprisoned.She was, however, arrested again in a fresh graft case. In the new case, dubbed as “Toshakhana 2,” the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bvlgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader at a low price, causing a significant loss to the national exchequer. The gift set included a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings.A day earlier, HC judge Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb approved Bushra’s bail in the case, following which a special court issued her release orders, ending nearly nine months of her detention. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) hailed her release, with slogans of “welcome back Bushra Bibi.”“You have faced extremely difficult times, disgusting campaigns and character assassination attempts against you during your illegal time in jail. The Pakistani nation salutes your bravery,” PTI said in a post on X, confirming that Bibi had reached her Bani Gala residence in the federal capital.Meanwhile, the Islamabad HC on Thursday also ordered the jail administration to produce Imran by 3pm in court to facilitate his meeting with his lawyers. “I know you won’t implement my orders, but let me issue directions,” Justice Ijaz Ishaq Khan remarked during the hearing. The judge later softened his stance after jail authorities assured him that they would arrange Imran’s meeting with his counsels in prison.Imran and his party have been at crosshairs of an ongoing tussle between the executive and the judiciary, with the latter accusing the country’s powerful military and intelligence agencies of exerting pressure to secure favourable verdicts in political cases, particularly those involving the PTI chief.Imran has not physically appeared in a court since Aug last year, with all hearings being held in the high-security Rawalpindi prison.","Bushra Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31.

Fake news of rape sparks real protest in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fake-news-of-rape-sparks-real-protest-in-pakistan/articleshow/114538687.cms,"The recent reports of a college campus rape that went viral on social media have sparked a heated debate in Pakistan . While the police dismiss the reports as "" fake news "" designed to incite unrest, protesting students see them as a rare opportunity to publicly address the issue of sexual assault.Despite the conflicting narratives, both sides acknowledge that the case has exposed legitimate concerns. Khadija Shabbir, a 21-year-old protester in Lahore , asserts that girls on campuses feel threatened. Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi, the senior officer investigating the case, admits that harassment is an extremely sensitive subject that most women in Pakistan have experienced to some degree.The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore. When authorities were unable to identify a victim, they dismissed the claims as a hoax. However, student protests erupted, leading to arrests and the closure of educational institutes across Punjab province.Students, who have been banned from officially organizing in unions for the past four decades, continue to protest, driven by a deep-rooted frustration with the lack of trust in authorities to take the matter of harassment seriously. Many protesters cite personal experiences of harassment as their primary motivation for participating in the movement.The Lahore High Court has announced a new committee of judges to investigate campus sexual harassment , indicating that authorities are acknowledging the validity of the protests. However, the confrontation between students and police is taking place amidst a broader crackdown on dissent in Pakistan, with student social media pages and online chat groups disappearing and officials pledging to prosecute those spreading misinformation.As the protests continue, women who have shared their experiences with harassment find themselves sidelined as the demonstrations sometimes turn violent, often led by men. Despite this, young female students remain determined to stand up for their rights and fight against sexual harassment on college campuses.","The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore.

ISLAMABAD: A court in Pakistan granted bail to the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in a case pertaining to the illegal sale of state gifts, his party said on Wednesday - a relief for the embattled politician who could see his spouse released from prison for the first time in months.Both Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , are currently in jail on multiple charges including illegally selling gifts worth more than 140 million rupees ($501,000) received during his 2018-2022 premiership from a state treasury known locally known as the "" Toshakhana "".The Islamabad High Court said Bibi was granted post-arrest bail for ""reasons to be recorded later,"" according to an order shared by the media office of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party.The Khans deny the charges and say they are trumped up by the government to victimise the 72-year-old former cricket star, who remains widely popular and whose candidates won the most seats in February's general election.PTI said a surety bond had been submitted for Bibi's release and hoped she would be freed from prison on Wednesday after ""264 days of unlawful incarceration"".Bibi, Khan's third wife, was first arrested in January. She was acquitted on charges of her marriage with Khan violating Islamic injunctions, but quickly arrested again in the state gifts case before she would be released.Khan has faced dozens of cases since he was removed as premier in 2022 and launched a protest movement against a coalition of his rivals led by current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .The Sharif-led government says it does not interfere in the judicial process.Khan's standoff with powerful military generals, who he says back Sharif, has spawned the worst political turmoil in decades in the nation of 241 million people.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, are currently in jail on multiple charges.

Marriage apps in Pakistan challenge traditional 'rishta aunties',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/marriage-apps-in-pakistan-challenge-traditional-rishta-aunties/articleshow/114491653.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: Lexica AI)

In Pakistan, the traditional matchmaking system is facing competition from marriage apps specifically designed for Muslims. These apps are being adopted as an alternative to the longstanding tradition of using "" rishta aunties ,"" or matchmakers, who facilitate arranged marriages .Ezza Nawaz, a textile designer in Lahore, decided to try an app after witnessing a friend's successful marriage through an online introduction . ""When I saw my colleague happy after being married to someone she met online... I thought, since we have tried rishta aunties for four or five years, let's try this too,"" she told AFP. Nawaz married Waseem Akhtar just three months after meeting him on an app called Muzz.Traditionally, rishta aunties prepare women and present them to potential suitors' families in Pakistan, where dating is often seen as dishonorable. More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey, with families taking the lead in deciding unions.Despite offering features like the option to blur profile pictures and providing message transcripts to a relative, marriage apps still face stigma, according to an AFP report. They are seen by some as comparable to casual dating apps like Tinder, which is banned in Pakistan.Waseem Akhtar, married to Nawaz, admits to being discreet when discussing their meeting. ""I do not tell people how I met my wife until I am sure that the person would not judge us,"" he said.In Pakistani culture, marriage is viewed as an alliance between families, and choosing a spouse independently is seen as challenging traditional structures. Rida Fatima, who used a rishta auntie, found the advice limiting and invasive. She was told to list ""cooking and cleaning"" as her hobbies instead of her interests like hiking and photography. ""They had the audacity to talk about how I looked, what I did, how much I earned, who my family is, how many brothers I have, and what my future aspirations are. So every little thing is judged,"" she said.Marriage apps continue to rise in popularity, with 1.2 million Pakistanis signing up since the launch of some apps last year, according to an AFP report. Despite this, traditional matchmaking remains strong, reflecting deep-rooted cultural practices . Matchmaker Fauzia Aazam dismisses marriage apps, stating, ""People waste time on these apps. Chatting together all through the night, I just don't like it.""Feminist author Aisha Sarwari points to control issues in the traditional matchmaking process and suggests a balanced approach. ""I would say that we need to find a good middle ground, where the respect is equal on both sides and there is no sense of demeaning a human being just because they look a certain way or they are from a particular race,"" she said.Aneela, a digital media artist, experienced different challenges on marriage apps. She found men lying on profiles and admitted to using fake details herself to avoid being identified. Eventually, she considered returning to arranged marriage options.","More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey.

We have taken a number of initiatives to address the matter and now we are planning for artificial rain in the city.""She, however, did not declare any date for it.The Punjab government , led by Maryam Nawaz, has launched the 'Anti-Smog Squad' to monitor areas affected by smog as this hazardous pollution has caused significant health problems for city residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation, and skin infections.These squads will be educating farmers about alternative methods for residue disposal, the hazards of burning crop residues and promoting the use of super seeders.Smog is a specific phenomenon that arises from a mixture of smoke and fog, occurring when certain polluting microparticles combine with cold, moist air and linger near the ground. This results in reduced visibility and can lead to various health problems.Previously, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had also called for ""climate diplomacy"" with India to mitigate smog impact in the province.She said that stubble burning in Punjab, India also impacts across the border because of air direction and hence both sides should make joint efforts to combat smog.""This issue needs to be taken up with India forthwith,"" she said.""Obstacles to environmental improvement must be removed. Smog causes breathing difficulties and damages eyesight,"" the CM added.Meteorology plays an important role in determining the level of air pollution in north Pakistan, just as it is a major factor in the neighbouring region of northwest India. After the rainy season crop is harvested, farmers from both sides tend to burn stubble adding to the existing causes of pollution caused due to industrial emissions and transport.Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, the Environment Ministry said,""The positive effects of the measures taken to combat smog will become visible in 8 to 10 years. Environmental protection has been included as a subject in the curriculum in the province.”She also urged the farmers to avoid burning the crop residues, as it harms not only the crops but also their children's health.","Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world on Monday with an alarming AQI of 394.

Pakistan Parliament: Pakistan parliament clips powers of judiciary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-clips-powers-of-judiciary/articleshow/114436941.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s parliament clipped the powers of the Supreme Court in the early hours of Monday by empowering the executive through an amendment to the constitution passed with a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the National assembly.With full backing from the powerful military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ’s govt had been attempting since last month to introduce a set of constitutional changes in parliament apparently aimed at granting more powers to the executive in making judicial appointments.The 26th Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2024, passed during a late-night session of parliament, aimed at taking away the SC’s suo motu powers, setting the chief justice of Pakistan’s term at three years, and empowering the PM to appoint the next top judge from among the three most senior SC judges. It states that a 12-member parliamentary committee, comprising eight NA members and four from the Senate, will appoint the chief justice from a panel of the three most senior judges of the top court for a period of three years. The panel will forward the name to the PM who will then send it to the president for appointment.The bill, tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, was approved by the NA with 225 votes, one more than required for a two-thirds majority, after a handful of turncoats from jailed former PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) voted against the party’s policy. In the Senate, the required number for two-thirds was 64 and 65 members voted in favour. Hours later, President Asif Ali Zardari gave formal assent to the new law. Imran’s party, however, abstained from voting.An earlier attempt, in Sept, by the governing PML-N to bulldoze the amendments did not succeed as it failed to win the support of some opposition lawmakers and the legislation could not be tabled despite the two Houses being in session.Sharif’s govt said the constitutional amendment has ensured that parliament will not remain a rubber stamp in future. The current govt’s tensions with the judiciary have been on the rise since controversial nationwide general elections were held in Feb this year.The new legislation, specifically about judicial reforms, was passed just days ahead of the retirement of chief justice Qazi Faez Isa . Khan’s PTI has been accusing Isa of being aligned with govt, an allegation govt has repeatedly rejected.Under the previous law, Justice Isa would have been automatically replaced by the senior puisne judge, currently Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, who has consistently issued verdicts deemed favourable to Khan and PTI.PTI assailed the “conscience” of lawmakers affiliated with it who voted in favour of the amendment. “They won votes on Imran Khan’s name and sold their vote to the same mafia against whom the public gave them the mandate!” the party said on its ‘X’ account, sharing pictures of the said lawmakers and terming them “seditious”.“These conscience-sellers would be counted among the darkest characters in Pakistan’s history,” it added.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan criticised the bill, saying it would make the judiciary “subservient” for all time.",Pakistan's parliament clipped the powers of the Supreme Court in the early hours of Monday by empowering the executive.

The Hindu community in Narowal, numbering over 1,453 people, has since lacked a proper place to conduct their rituals.Narowal district once had 45 Hindu temples, all of which have fallen into disrepair over time.The restoration work is currently focused on constructing a boundary wall around the four kanals of land, after which the temple will be handed over to the Pak Dharamsthan Committee.Hindus represent the largest minority group in Pakistan.

Controversy over the amendments



Row over how Bill was passed

Historical achievement: PM Shehbaz Sharif



Charter of Democracy



In a late-night session that began at 11.36pm on Sunday and extended well past midnight, the Pakistan National Assembly passed at 5am on Monday the highly controversial 26th Constitutional Amendment that critics say effectively neuters the judicial system of the country.In another sign of the desperate hurry, President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the law mere hours after the approval of both houses of parliament.The Constitution (26th Amendment) Act, 2024, was introduced to address perceived issues within the judicial system of Pakistan, particularly focusing on the powers of the Supreme Court and the appointment of its Chief Justice.While proponents argue that these reforms are necessary for improving judicial efficiency and accountability, opponents contend that they threaten judicial independence and may pave the way for increased political interference in legal matters.The timing and nature of this amendment have raised suspicions about political motivations behind it.Critics argue that this move is an attempt by the ruling coalition led byShehbaz Sharif to exert control over an independent judiciary, particularly in light of ongoing tensions with former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).The PTI has vehemently opposed these changes, viewing them as a direct threat to judicial independence and an effort to undermine checks and balances within government institutions.Many legal experts and political analysts have expressed concern that limiting the CJP's tenure could lead to politicisation within the judiciary. By establishing a commission that includes political appointees, there are fears that judicial appointments may become more susceptible to political influence rather than being based solely on merit and legal expertise.The legal community has also voiced strong opposition against these amendments, stating that the changes could lead to a judiciary that is less willing to challenge government actions or uphold constitutional rights if they are perceived as beholden to political interests.There are serious allegations of coercion surrounding the passage of the 26th Constitutional Amendment.Local media reports suggested that members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) faced intimidation tactics, including threats of abduction, to ensure their support for the Bill. PTI leaders have claimed that their lawmakers were pressured into voting in favor of the amendment or faced consequences for non-compliance.The process leading up to the amendment has also been criticised for its lack of transparency and consensus among political parties. While some coalition members gave broad support for the amendment, others, particularly from PTI, expressed their refusal to participate in what they describe as a coerced vote.The hurried nature of this legislative process has raised questions about whether adequate deliberation occurred among lawmakers regarding such significant constitutional changes.The government required 224 votes to pass the Bill. As voting commenced under the chairmanship of NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, 225 members of the National Assembly supported the motion, while 12 members from the PTI and the Sunni-Ittehad Council (SIC) opposed it.The Bill comprised 27 clauses. After the passage of the first clause, the PTI members walked out of the assembly.Following the passage of the bill, PM Shehbaz Sharif delivered a speech and congratulated the parliament for the ""historical achievement"", said a report by Dawn.""This amendment, the 26th, is not just an amendment, but an example of national solidarity and consensus. A new sun will rise, emanating across the nation,"" PM Shehbaz said.PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari thanked the PML-N, MQM-P, IPP, JUI-F, ANP, and other parties for their contributions to the Bill.He also extended his gratitude to the PTI, stating: ""I also thank the PTI for playing a part in this historic achievement. This is a political success, and I wish you wouldn't have portrayed your own victory as a loss.""PTI's Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, took over the floor of the NA and criticised the amendments, arguing that they did not reflect the will of the Pakistani people.Taking a jab at law minister Tarar and Bilawal, he said that those who had ""gone missing"" should have been thanked as well during the note of thanks. Ayub detailed how PTI lawmakers were ""tortured and harassed"".""These were all tactics to pressure us. The mistreatment of Imran Khan in jail is also an example,"" he said.Ayub also questioned the urgency behind passing the amendments, asking: ""What would have happened had it been passed on October 31?""He also said that the amendments were an attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary.Meanwhile, Defence minister Khawaja Asif said the amendment had been passed by the Senate ""to restore respect and dignity of the parliament and the House"". ""There must be consistency in our political behaviour otherwise we will not get the respect and dignity we seek,"" he said.As per the report by Dawn, Asif went on to say that the constitutional amendments were not something that the government had ""newly invented"" but it was a continuation of the Charter of Democracy that all political leaders, including Imran, had unanimously signed.The Charter of Democracy was signed in London on May 14, 2006, by major political parties in response to the military dictatorship of General Pervez Musharraf, with the aim of promoting democratic norms and preventing the abuse of power by unelected institutions such as the military and judiciary.",The amendment limits the tenure of the Chief Justice of Pakistan to three years.

Mohamed Muizzu: Maldives president to take 50% pay cut under new austerity move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/maldives-president-to-take-50-pay-cut-under-new-austerity-move/articleshow/114561946.cms,"Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu

MALE: The president of cash-strapped Maldives will take a 50% pay cut as part of an austerity drive that will see public sector salaries reduced to prevent a debt crisis in the tourist hotspot, his office said Thursday. Mohamed Muizzu is introducing a mandatory 10% pay cut to most public sector jobs, leading the belt-tightening with the biggest salary reduction , his office said in a statement.A government source told AFP that Muizzu's annual salary will be reduced to 600,000 rufiyaa ($39,087) from next year - down from 1.2 million rufiyaa but nearly double the average household income of 316,740 rufiyaa per year, according to a 2016 census. Judges and lawmakers in parliament will be exempt from the cuts, though Muizzu's office said he expects them to share the burden by agreeing to a 10% cut voluntarily.Two weeks ago, Muizzu sacked more than 225 political appointees , including ministers, in a bid to reduce expenditure. Among those sacked were seven state ministers, 43 deputy ministers, and 178 political directors. The move is expected to save the country about $370,000 a month. The Maldives said in September that its financial troubles were ""temporary"" and that it had no plans to seek an IMF bailout .","Mohamed Muizzu is introducing a mandatory 10% pay cut to most public sector jobs.
