Anti-Haitian wall: Dominican president's reelection trump card,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/anti-haitian-wall-dominican-presidents-reelection-trump-card/articleshow/110222524.cms,"PEDERNALES: A prison-like watchtower casts a pall over an otherwise idyllic tropical beach in the Dominican Republic 's extreme southwest.It is the starting point of a 164-kilometer (102-mile) wall the Caribbean nation is building between itself and violence-plagued Haiti , its only neighbor on the shared island of Hispaniola.As Dominicans cast their ballots in the presidential election on Sunday, the wall -- a flagship project of incumbent Luis Abinader -- stands as a symbol of his tough, and popular, stance on migration .Under Abinader, who polls show will likely be reelected for a second four-year term, the country has boosted immigration raids and deported hundreds of thousands of Haitians, many of whom had lived there for decades.Abinader closed the 340-kilometer border last September in a dispute over a shared river and partially reopened it in October -- though only to goods, not people.Construction on the wall started in 2022, and Abinader has boasted it will ""forever change the Dominican Republic"" -- a tourist paradise with a fast-growing economy.Haiti, by contrast, is one of the world's poorest and most violent countries.Abinader has vowed to speed up construction of the wall, most of which remains unfinished.- 'Necessary' -The beach city of Pedernales is home to the southernmost of four Haiti-Dominican border crossings, each with a so-called ""free zone"" where people from both sides can buy and sell goods at the marketplace before returning to their respective homes.The wall -- built in concrete up to 1.5 meters above ground with two meters of wire fencing on top -- links the four crossings as it zig-zags across the landscape from south to north.Abinader claims theft of cattle and motorcycles has dropped 80 percent in some areas on the Dominican side since construction began, and argues the wall protects jobs and trade.Seventy percent of Dominicans support the project, polls show.""It will help to have certain controls... (It is) necessary,"" said Odanis Grullon, 29, the owner of a beach restaurant in Pedernales.At the nearby border crossing, children play as trucks cross back and forth with clothes, food and household items for the market.A rudimentary barrier resembling an old farm gate stands mostly open as armed soldiers observe the comings and goings without interfering much.The people of Pedernales point out that theirs is not the most fraught border crossing, being the furthest from Haiti's crime-riddled capital Port-au-Prince.""Gang members don't come here. Sometimes things happen, but they are cool, they are brothers,"" community leader Eleodoro Matos said.He is, however, in favor of the wall -- citing cattle theft in particular.- 'It's a business' -Further north, at the Jimani border crossing, the situation is quite different.Haitian Creole rather than Spanish is the dominant language, and the gates are made of steel.There are military patrols and many checkpoints on the roads. Even approaching the wall is off limits: ""These are our orders,"" the soldiers say.But for Juan Enrique Matos, a trader at the local ""free zone"" market: ""The wall doesn't work here.""Haitians, he told AFP, ""give their money to the guards and they let them through. It's a business.""Residents say it's also relatively easy to cross at other points, far from the official posts, through the mountains and valleys along the border.Dominican trader Brian Baptista, 25, told AFP that Haitians ""go through where they want, through the countryside or through the gate.""Some believe a wall may not be the best approach to the very real problems plaguing the island.""Migration pressure is not reduced by... infrastructure,"" Juan Del Rosario, a university expert in economic integration, told AFP.While the wall may have reduced cross-border theft, he added, ""illicit goods such as drugs and weapons"" continue to get through.","The Dominican Republic is building a 164-kilometer (102-mile) wall between itself and Haiti. The wall is a flagship project of incumbent President Luis Abinader, who is running for re-election. The country has deported hundreds of thousands of Haitians, many of whom had lived there for decades. Some residents say the wall is necessary, while others say it is not the best approach.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110222624,imgsize-1447012,width-400,resizemode-4/110222624.jpg"

Nato mulling sending trainers into Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/nato-mulling-sending-trainers-into-ukraine/articleshow/110220092.cms,"Nato allies are inching closer to sending troops into Ukraine to train Ukrainian forces , a move that would be another blurring of a previous red line and could draw the US and Europe more directly into the war.Ukraine's manpower shortage has reached a critical point, and its position on the battlefield in recent weeks has seriously worsened as Russia has accelerated its advances to take advantage of delays in shipments of US weapons.As a result, Ukrainian officials have asked their US and Nato counterparts to help train 150,000 new recruits closer to the front line for faster deployment. So far, the US has said no, but General Charles Brown Jr, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that a Nato deployment of trainers appeared inevitable. ""We'll get there eventually, over time,"" he said.For now, he said, an effort inside Ukraine would put ""a bunch of Nato trainers at risk"" and would most likely mean deciding whether to use precious air defences to protect the trainers instead of critical Ukrainian infrastructure near the battlefield. Brown briefed reporters on his plane en route to a Nato meeting in Brussels.As a part of Nato, the US would be obligated under the alliance's treaty to aid in the defence of any attack on the trainers, potentially dragging America into the war. The White House has been adamant that it will not put US troops, including trainers, on the ground in Ukraine, a position that an administration official reiterated Thursday. The administration has also urged Nato allies not to send its troops.But in Feb, Prez Emmanuel Macron of France said that ""nothing should be ruled out"" when it comes to sending Western troops to Ukraine. Macron has doubled down on his comment since, including after senior American diplomats asked him to stop.The govt of Estonia has not ruled out the possibility of sending troops to western Ukraine to take over rear roles that could free Ukrainian troops to go to the front, Estonia's national security adviser said this week. Lithuania's foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, too backed Macron's stance in an interview with the 'The Guardian' last week.The US military has done training for Ukrainian troops in Poland, Germany and the US, but pulling troops out of Ukraine is time-consuming. US officials now acknowledge the current training by Ukrainian forces is not sufficient and that they need better and faster training to push back on Russian drive this summer.","Nato allies are inching closer to sending troops into Ukraine to train Ukrainian forces.

Robert Fico: All you need to know about Slovak PM targeted in assassination attempt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-robert-fico-all-you-need-to-know-about-slovak-pm-targeted-in-assassination-attempt/articleshow/110162816.cms,"Who is Robert Fico?

Fico, who is serving as a premier for the third time, along with his leftist party Direction – Social Democracy (Smer), emerged victorious in Slovakia’s parliamentary elections held on September 30, 2023. This victory marked a political resurgence for him, as he campaigned on a platform supporting Russia and opposing America.

Critics were concerned that under Fico, Slovakia might deviate from its pro-Western path and align with the direction taken by Hungary under the populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

The victory in 2023 signifies Fico serving his fourth term as the prime minister, after previously occupying the position from 2006 to 2010, from 2012 to 2018, and once more from 2023. Fico's political career is remarkable due to his achievement as the prime minister with the longest tenure in Slovakia's history, spanning more than ten years.

Rise to political prominence

In 1992, Fico started his political career by winning a seat in the Slovak Parliament when Czechoslovakia was still united.

In his early career, he was appointed to the Council of Europe, where he acquired valuable political experience. In 1999, Fico established the Direction – Social Democracy (Smer) party, a political movement that he has been leading since it started.

Fico rose to power after his party won the 2006 parliamentary election, resulting in the establishment of his initial cabinet. His political position is commonly characterized as populist, attracting a wide range of voters through a combination of social welfare policies and nationalistic language.

After the 2010 parliamentary election, Fico moved into a position as a member of parliament in the opposition, ultimately becoming the leader of the opposition. His political strength was shown in 2012 when a vote of no confidence in the Iveta Radičová cabinet resulted in early elections. Fico's Smer party achieved a significant win, obtaining 83 seats and establishing a government with an overwhelming majority, the first of its kind in Slovakia since the end of communism in 1989.

In 2013, Fico announced that he was running for the 2014 presidential election. However, he lost to his political rival Andrej Kiska in the second round of voting. Despite this defeat, Fico continued to be an important figure in Slovak politics.

Fico's third term as prime minister ended suddenly in March 2018 during a political crisis that occurred after the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak. This crisis resulted in extensive protests and demands for government accountability. As a response, Fico stepped down, and Deputy PM Peter Pellegrini took over.

The parliamentary election of 2023 signified the comeback of Fico to a position of authority. His campaign centered on ending military assistance to Ukraine during the Russian invasion, a position that struck a chord with a large segment of the voters. Smer emerged victorious in the election, securing the highest number of votes at 22.95% and 42 seats.

Fico established a coalition government with Voice – Social Democracy (Hlas) and the Slovak National Party, commencing his fourth tenure as prime minister on October 25, 2023.

In his current term, the government led by Fico has adopted a controversial position on global matters, particularly by declining to participate in a coalition led by the Czech Republic consisting of approximately 20 countries to offer military assistance to Ukraine.

Europe on edge

In a disturbing incident that has sent shockwaves across Europe, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was targeted in an assassination attempt that left him seriously injured. The event unfolded on a seemingly ordinary day in Handlova, Slovakia, when Fico was approached by a gunman as he was engaging with supporters. The assailant fired five times at close range, critically wounding the prime minister.The PM's bodyguards swiftly intervened, tackling the gunman and whisking Fico away in a government vehicle.He was subsequently airlifted to a hospital for emergency medical treatment.""I was very shocked ... fortunately as far as I know the operation went well - and I guess in the end he will survive ... he's not in a life-threatening situation at this moment,"" Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Environment Minister Tomas Taraba told the BBC's Newshour.The attacker, identified as 71-year-old Slovak poet Juraj Cintula, was arrested at the scene. The motivations behind the attack appear to be politically charged, reflecting deep divisions within Slovakia and broader regional tensions. Cintula reportedly made a ""confession"" in custody, blaming Fico's media policies for his drastic actions.A seasoned figure in Slovakian politics, Fico was born in 1964 and began his political career as a member of the Communist Party before Slovakia became its independent nation. With a law degree and vast experience in legal and governmental roles, Fico has been a dominant force in Slovak politics.Fico's political journey is marked by significant milestones, including his first election to Slovakia's parliament in 1992 and his subsequent rise to become the chairman of the Smer (Direction) party in 1999. His tenure is characterized by a left-populist ideology, though comparisons have been drawn with right-wing leaders like Viktor Orbán of Hungary.After a hiatus, Fico reclaimed the prime ministerial position last year, marking his third term and establishing him as the longest-serving head of government in Slovakia's history. His recent electoral victory was fueled by a platform that controversially aligned more closely with pro-Russian stances and criticized US and Nato policies, especially regarding the situation in Ukraine.This assassination attempt occurs against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tension. Fico, known for his pro-Putin stance, has been a controversial figure in European politics, especially regarding his opposition to supporting Ukraine against Russian aggressions.Starting his fourth term as prime minister, Fico administration stopped arms shipments to Ukraine, and critics are concerned that he might steer Slovakia — a Nato member with a population of 5.4 million — away from its pro-Western trajectory towards a path similar to that of Hungary under populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.Russian President Vladimir Putin , who has shown support for Fico in the past, condemned the attack. Describing the shooting as a ""monstrous"" crime, Putin said in a telegram sent to Slovakia's President Zuzana Caputova: ""I know Robert Fico as a courageous and strong-minded man. I very much hope that these qualities will help him to survive this difficult situation.""The implications of this attack are far-reaching, raising concerns about the stability of not only Slovakia but the entire European region. Fico’s policies and his alignment with Russia have been divisive, and this incident may further inflame political tensions.World leaders, including US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , have condemned the attack. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized that such acts of violence undermine democracy and have no place in society.Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of UK's 1st Royal Tank Regiment, expressed his concerns to Daily Mail, saying, ""There are high stakes in Europe and the threat of a wider war only benefits Putin.""He further warned, ""This is yet another wake-up call to the West. If we ignore this latest threat to Western security the chances of getting drawn into a wider war in Europe are manifestly greater.""(With inputs from agencies)","Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was targeted in an assassination attempt that left him seriously injured.

This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and the second in just over six months to China.

However, this is Putin's 19th visit to China since he became the Russian president.

In February 2022, China and Russia announced a ""no limits"" partnership during Putin's visit to Beijing, occurring just days before he deployed tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, sparking the most severe land conflict in Europe since World War Two.

Putin's decision to choose China for his first overseas visit after being inaugurated for a new six-year term, extending his leadership until at least 2030, underscores the significance he places on his bond with Xi and his global strategic priorities.

In a discussion with China's Xinhua news agency, Putin commended Chinese President Xi Jinping for fostering a ""strategic partnership"" between Russia and China, which he described as rooted in national interests and profound mutual trust.

This visit is not just a routine diplomatic engagement but a strategic display of defiance against Western pressures.

The frequency and depth of military collaborations, such as joint naval drills near strategic global areas, signal a growing military camaraderie.

However, these maneuvers signal more about the depth of their partnership than actual operational military alliances. The joint naval patrols near American waters and the inclusion of Russia in Chinese-led military drills are significant developments that the West views with increasing concern.

Moreover, the economic interdependence, highlighted by China’s role as a critical supplier to Russia’s defense sector, showcases the depth of their bilateral ties, which are becoming increasingly consequential in the global arena.

Why it matters

The strengthening bond between China and Russia is pivotal as both nations seek to assert their power on the global stage against a backdrop of American dominance.

This alliance is particularly critical for Russia as it continues to face extensive economic sanctions from the West.

China’s support not only bolsters Russia’s economy but also enhances its military capabilities through joint exercises and technology transfers.

As per a report in the Economist, the flow of Chinese technology and other valuable goods to Russian weapons manufacturers has become a significant concern for the United States. According to US secretary of state Antony Blinken China was the ""top supplier"" of various items considered be ""dual use,"" including machine tools, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose, a vital component in artillery shells. These items have both civilian and military applications.

""Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China's support,"" Blinken said. In a later conversation with Borge Brende, the president of the World Economic Forum, Blinken said that over the past year, Chinese technology had been facilitating Russia's production of weapons and ammunition, such as missiles and tanks, at an unprecedented rate in its modern history, surpassing even the levels seen during the Cold War era, the Economist report added.

What they are saying

""It was the unprecedentedly high level of the strategic partnership between our countries that determined my choice of China as the first state that I would visit after officially taking office as president of the Russian Federation,"" Putin said.

""We will try to establish closer cooperation in the field of industry and high technology, space and peaceful nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy sources and other innovative sectors,"" Putin said.

""This is Putin's first trip after his inauguration, and it is therefore intended to show that Sino-Russian relations are moving up another level,"" independent Russian political analyst Konstantin Kalachev told AFP.

""The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it,"" Xi told Putin.

""China is willing to ... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world,"" said Xi.

""The United States still thinks in terms of the Cold War and is guided by the logic of bloc confrontation, putting the security of 'narrow groups' above regional security and stability, which creates a security threat for all countries in the region,"" the joint statement said. ""The US must abandon this behaviour.""

The 'big brother' role reversal

The relationship between Russia and China has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, with Moscow becoming increasingly dependent on Beijing as it faces Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine.

Once a partnership of equals, the Russia-China dynamic has become increasingly asymmetrical, with China holding the upper hand. While China accounts for around 33% of Russia's overall trade, Russia makes up only 4% of China's trade, according to data provider CEIC Data.

China has emerged as a critical source of essential goods for Russia, supplying everything from electronics to washing machines to tractors.

However, Russia's arms exports to China have fallen precipitously in recent years, while China has become a significant provider of optics, microelectronics, drone engines, and other materials that enable Russia's weapons production. The energy trade between the two countries has also shifted in China's favor.

""It's a strategic partnership where both sides need each other but it's increasingly asymmetrical in China's favor,"" Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, told the Wall Street Journal. ""China is not only the more powerful partner, but also the one that has many more options than Russia and the war has exacerbated that.""

Russia, with its oil and gas now shunned in Europe, has had to sell at significant discounts to China.

China’s upper hand is evident in negotiations over new projects like the Power-of-Siberia 2 gas pipeline, where Beijing's reluctance to finalize terms highlights its leverage over Moscow.

Putin, who is sometimes known for his haughty displays of making other leaders wait during their visits to the Kremlin, has adopted a noticeably deferential tone towards Xi Jinping, a LA Times report said.

No wonder, an Economist report described the visit as ""Vladimir Putin will meet his big brother in Beijing.""

What next

China, once the junior partner of Moscow in the global Communist hierarchy, has emerged as by far the most powerful of Russia's friends in the world.

Consequently, in the evolving personal relationship between the two ""presidents for life"", Xi has emerged as the ""big brother"" to Putin.

At the same time, the strengthening ties between China and Russia represent a significant shift in global alliances and power structures. The implications of their collaboration will undoubtedly extend far beyond their own borders, challenging the current international order and testing the diplomatic resilience of the Western powers.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a two-day state visit to China, underscoring the solidarity between the two allies as Russia continues its new offensive in Ukraine.Upon his arrival at dawn, Putin was greeted by an honor guard from the People's Liberation Army, the military branch of China's ruling Communist Party.His motorcade, flanked by a brigade of military police on motorcycles, proceeded into the city.

The G7 industrial democracies are the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.Yellen had previously pushed for full confiscation of the largely euro-denominated assets, but Europe has balked, opting instead for a more conservative plan to put the earnings -- estimated at around $3.5 billion per year -- into a fund for Ukraine.Since then, the US has proposed a plan to bring forward the interest on the assets to back a bond or a loan that would provide Ukraine perhaps $50 billion in the near term as it battles increasing Russian military pressure in its east and north.The US official said there was a unified goal among the G7 officials to provide more money to Ukraine, and to demonstrate to Russian President Vladimir Putin that he cannot simply ""wait out our coalition.""""What we are involved in is trying to engage in hard, detailed economic diplomacy to make sure we can all get on the same page.

Potential conflicts of interest

Historical context

NEW DELHI: An investment group led by Jared Kushner , the son-in-law for former US President Donald Trump , has secured a deal to build a $500 million luxury hotel in Serbia on the site of a military complex bombed by Nato in 1999.The Serbian government signed a 99-year lease deal on Wednesday with Affinity Global Development , a Kushner-affiliated investment firm backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.Working in partnership with Richard Grenell , former acting director of national intelligence under the Trump administration, Kushner plans to convert the heavily damaged former Yugoslav army headquarters into a luxury hotel.Grenell, who served as the US ambassador to Germany and a special envoy to the Balkans in 2019, initially suggested that US investors redevelop the bombed-out army complex. Kushner, who also has luxury hotel projects planned in neighboring Albania, said the redevelopment will ""further elevate Belgrade into the premier international destination it is becoming.""The Serbian project will include apartments, retail space, and a memorial to those killed during Nato’s bombing campaign. The agreement involves redeveloping a three-block area and sharing profits with the Serbian government. The government will retain ownership of the site and may nullify the lease if the development isn’t completed on time.Opposition party politicians protested the venture on Thursday, displaying signs saying, ""Stop giving army HQ as a present to American offshore companies."" Lawmaker Dragan Jonic, attending the protest, commented, ""Somebody is trying to clear up the mess that they did, and they are not those who should do anything in this place.""A Serbian official defended the Kushner-Grenell deal, stating, ""The government of Serbia has chosen a reputable American company as a partner in this venture, which will invest in the revitalization of the former Federal Secretariat for National Defense complex.""Kushner’s investment funds are primarily backed by foreign investors, including those from Israel, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates. Critics suggest that projects like the Serbian hotel create potential conflicts of interest, especially if Trump wins back the presidency, potentially advancing the financial interests of his family members.In March, Congressional Democrats called for an investigation into Kushner’s overseas ventures following a New York Times report on his development plans in the Balkans. Representatives Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) and Robert Garcia (D-California) stated, ""Jared Kushner is pursuing new foreign business deals just as Donald Trump becomes the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidency.""Kushner argues that as a private citizen, he is free to pursue overseas business opportunities, including those involving foreign governments.In 1999, Nato intervened in the conflict between the Serbian government and Albanian separatists in Kosovo. Western planes bombed targets in Serbia and Montenegro for 78 days, forcing Belgrade to withdraw police and the army from Kosovo. Nato-led peacekeepers were subsequently deployed in the province.The Western-backed Albanian authorities declared Kosovo’s independence in 2008. However, Serbia and several countries, including Russia and China, still consider Kosovo Serbian territory.",An investment group led by Jared Kushner has secured a deal to build a $500 million luxury hotel in Serbia.

US taxpayers money used for controversial virus research in Wuhan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-taxpayers-money-used-for-controversial-virus-research-in-wuhan/articleshow/110214383.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Institutes of Health (NIH) principal deputy director Lawrence Tabak admitted to Congress on Thursday that US taxpayers funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.Rep Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz) of the select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic questioned Dr Tabak, asking, “Did NIH fund gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology through [Manhattan-based nonprofit] EcoHealth [Alliance]?” Tabak replied, “If you’re speaking about the generic term, yes, we did.”This admission comes after more than four years of evasions from federal public health officials, including Tabak himself and former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director Dr Anthony Fauci, regarding the controversial research practice that modifies viruses to make them more infectious.Tabak clarified that this type of research is widespread and poses no threat or harm, which is why it is not regulated, a New York Post report said.Dr Bryce Nickels, a genetics professor at Rutgers University, criticized Tabak's response, describing it as “obfuscation and semantic manipulation.” He accused the NIH official of resisting accountability for risky research that could create pathogens of pandemic potential.In July 2023, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) barred the Wuhan Institute of Virology from receiving federal grants for the next 10 years. Additionally, EcoHealth Alliance , which had its funding pulled by HHS for the next three years, has faced scrutiny for its involvement in the research.Tabak previously acknowledged in an October 2021 letter to Congress that NIH funded a ""limited experiment"" at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which tested whether spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses could bind to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model. This experiment, which involved modifying bat coronaviruses with SARS and MERS viruses, was not described as gain-of-function research, despite EcoHealth's failure to report that the modified viruses became 10,000 times more infectious, violating grant terms.Despite repeated denials by Dr Anthony Fauci, Republicans have consistently challenged the NIH's involvement in gain-of-function research. Sen Rand Paul (R-Ky) notably grilled Fauci in several hearings, demanding clarity on the NIH's funding practices.The House subcommittee continues to investigate whether Covid-19 accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan, which several US intelligence agencies and experts have suggested as the most likely cause of the pandemic. Dr. Robert Redfield, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe have both supported this theory.Nickels concluded that the hearing underscored the lack of oversight for scientific research on pathogens, highlighting the need for stricter controls and accountability to prevent future pandemics.Dr Fauci is scheduled to testify about gain-of-function research and the origins of the pandemic in a public subcommittee hearing on June 3.","National Institutes of Health (NIH) principal deputy director Lawrence Tabak admitted to Congress on Thursday that US taxpayers funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.

$12.5 billion pledge: How Melinda French Gates may change the game of billionaire philanthropy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/12-5-billion-pledge-how-melinda-french-gates-may-change-the-game-of-billionaire-philanthropy/articleshow/110213600.cms,"Pivotal ventures

MacKenzie model

After her divorce from Jeff Bezos in 2019, MacKenzie Scott changed the game of billionaire philanthropy , writing huge checks to small charities at a breakneck pace from her newly independent $36 billion fortune.Now, the philanthropy world is hoping for another seismic shift from Melinda French Gates , who’s armed with $12.5 billion to deploy for her own charity work independent of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.French Gates will get that vast sum directly from her ex-husband, Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates , after leaving the Gates Foundation next month. It’s still not clear when or in what form she’ll receive those billions, and representatives for French Gates declined to elaborate.But that hasn’t slowed the speculation.“I’m excited,” said Latanya Mapp, chief executive officer of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors. “She’s a good friend of MacKenzie, so all we can hope for is more of that kind of thinking, like we trust our partners. We know how little goes to domestic grassroots women’s organizations.”French Gates, 59, spent more than two decades helping build the Gates Foundation — which will change its name after she leaves in June — into one of the biggest and most influential charities in the world. In 2024 alone, the foundation’s budget is $8.6 billion, dispersing money to its 42 program strategies, including global health and gender issues, which is French Gates’ flagship cause.Mapp said she suspects French Gates only stayed at the Gates Foundation for three years after the couple’s 2021 divorce because she wanted to expand its gender program. Soon after announcing their divorce, the Gateses said they were committing $2.1 billion to advance gender equality.French Gates helped build up “real infrastructure and a place for gender there,” Mapp said. “I don’t think this was an ‘I woke up this weekend and I decided to leave’ kind of decision.”In 2015, French Gates started a charitable limited liability company called Pivotal Ventures, which uses grants as well as venture capital to focus on empowering women, including getting more females into technology jobs and elected to public office. Pivotal has committed $1 billion to “expanding women’s power and influence” in the US, according to its website.Some see French Gates taking a more political turn after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade. In her note on X announcing her departure, she wrote, “This is a critical moment for women and girls in the US and around the world — and those fighting to protect and advance equality are in urgent need of support.”Ben Soskis, senior research associate at the Urban Institute, said French Gates possibly wants to focus her energy on Pivotal because of its form. An LLC “has more freedom to give to politics and to make for-profit investments than does a private foundation,” said Soskis, who has received Gates Foundation funding.In 2022, French Gates started an offshoot called Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation with $626 million in assets. A spokesperson for Pivotal said the foundation form “gives [French Gates] the ability to support more organizations aligned with Pivotal’s mission to advance social progress.”To put the scale of French Gates’s new power into context, her foundation — if starting from scratch with $12.5 billion — would be the sixth-largest in the US, according to Elizabeth Dale, associate professor of public affairs and nonprofit leadership at Seattle University.The Pivotal foundation made $8.8 million in grants in 2022, including $500,000 to Me Too International to “strengthen the capacity of a global and survivor-led movement against sexual violence,” and $75,000 to Neo Philanthropy Inc. to “raise public awareness for women of color transforming democracy.” The biggest grants were $2 million — a small amount compared with the tens of millions of dollars Scott sometimes gives at a time. One of the groups that received $2 million was Allied Media Projects, to support the Decolonizing Wealth Project, “a racial equity education program.”Edgar Villanueva, CEO of the Decolonizing Wealth Project, said the way Pivotal does its funding is closer to the MacKenzie Scott model. While Scott is prone to catch nonprofits by surprise with huge checks and little in the way of reporting requirements or spending restrictions, the Gates Foundation is known to be more bureaucratic, he said.“Gates can be very rigid and require a lot from grantees in terms of reporting and data,” Villanueva said. “Pivotal has really been more of the model of a co-investor, taking bets on communities and not requiring the most in terms of reporting.”French Gates and Scott, 54, have worked together before. In 2020 they partnered on the Equality Can’t Wait Challenge, which made calls for pitches on how organizations should spend $10 million to speed up women’s empowerment. The pair, along with other partners, are now funding the initial $45 million for construction of a parks improvement plan in Seattle.Scott, who didn’t respond to a request for comment, has a fortune of $38.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. French Gates has a net worth of $13.4 billion.Mapp said she hopes the women will collaborate more and is excited to see how this chapter of French Gates’ independent giving will play out.“She can be more risky, she can be louder and she can be more uninhibited because she’s not beholden to the bureaucracy,” Mapp said. “We’ll hopefully see more of her working with MacKenzie.”Villanueva agrees. “I see her teaming up more with MacKenzie Scott,” he said. “I’ve been a big fan of how MacKenzie does her giving.”","Melinda French Gates will get $12.5 billion from her ex-husband, Bill Gates, next month.

NEW YORK: After the arrests of pro-Palestine student protesters occupying a Columbia University building last month, New York Mayor Eric Adams and senior police officials repeatedly said there were ""no injuries,"" no ""violent clashes"" and minimal force used.But at least nine of the 46 protesters arrested inside the barricaded Hamilton Hall on April 30 sustained injuries beyond minor scrapes and bruises, according to medical records, photographs shared by protesters, and interviews.The documented injuries included a fractured eye socket, concussions, an ankle sprain, cuts, and injured wrists and hands from tight plastic flexicuffs.All of the 46 protesters arrested inside Hamilton were charged with third-degree trespass, a misdemeanor. The arrests came after Columbia President Minouche Shafik, in a hotly debated decision, called in police hours into the occupation at the epicenter of a student protest movement that has spread to campuses around the world. Other university officials across the country also have called in police to quell pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel protest camps.Reuters shared details of the protesters' injuries and accounts with the mayor's office, New York police and Columbia. None disputed the injuries. The mayor's office and the police said officers acted professionally.At least three injured protesters arrested inside Hamilton were taken by police to hospitals that night while still in custody, time-stamped hospital records show.Other protesters, who are demanding Columbia divest from arms makers and other companies that support Israel's government, had their injuries documented by volunteer doctors who provide support to people arrested by police and met them outside moments after their release from custody on May 2. Some then sought medical attention at clinics.""I was slammed downward to the ground and, when I turned my head to see if there were any comrades who needed assistance, an officer kicked me in the eye and I went straight down, and there was that buzzing and sharp ringing in the ears,"" said Christopher Holmes, a 25-year-old graduate student at the Columbia affiliate college Union Theological Seminary. Moments later, an officer slammed the left side of his forehead into the floor of Hamilton Hall, Holmes said.His eye still swollen days after his release, a friend took him to a Manhattan hospital. Hospital records show doctors determined his eye socket was fractured and that he was concussed.Kayla Mamelak, a spokesperson for the mayor, declined to say when the mayor first learned that protesters had been injured. At a May 1 press conference with police leaders, Adams said the arrests were ""organized, calm, and that there were no injuries.""Mamelak wrote in an email that the arrests, which involved hundreds of armed officers in riot gear, were ""a complicated operation"" handled ""with professionalism and respect.""A police spokesperson, who declined to give their name, also did not dispute the protesters' injuries, writing in an email that officers responded ""swiftly, professionally, and effectively.""Both spokespeople declined to provide unedited videos from officers' body-worn cameras and use-of-force and injuries reports from the arrests. That night, police ordered students outside Hamilton into dormitories and forced journalists off campus.Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said he would answer Reuters queries by May 10, but did not send replies by that date and did not respond to subsequent emails and phone calls.As police used electric saws to cut through barricades of heavy furniture and bike chains, several protesters said they sat on the floor in Hamilton's lobby, hands raised. Police threw in a flash-bang grenade, setting off disorienting loud bangs and bursts of light, before rushing through the doors.Gabriel Yancy, a 24-year-old research assistant who has since been fired from his job in a Columbia neuroscience laboratory, said he watched officers throw some protesters to the ground, step on at least three protesters, and kick at least one in the torso.Aidan Parisi, a 27-year-old student in Columbia's social work department, recalled police ""stepping on top of people, throwing people,"" and said that several protesters yelled, ""We are unarmed!""Several students said officers knelt forcefully on their backs. New York City passed a law in 2020 prohibiting police from using knee restraints that compress the diaphragm.Gideon Oliver, a civil rights lawyer who now represents some of the arrested students, was involved in a reform agreement that the New York state attorney general reached with the New York Police Department last year to end its ""pattern of excessive force"" against protesters.""Now is the time for the city and for the police department to deescalate and to stop engaging in tactics on the streets that appear designed to chill protests,"" Oliver said.","At least nine of the 46 protesters arrested inside the barricaded Hamilton Hall on April 30 sustained injuries. The documented injuries included a fractured eye socket, concussions, an ankle sprain, cuts, and injured wrists and hands from tight plastic flexicuffs. The mayor's office and the police said officers acted professionally.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110206319,imgsize-1241806,width-400,resizemode-4/110206319.jpg"

US military says first aid shipment has been driven across a newly built US pier into the Gaza Strip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-military-says-first-aid-shipment-has-been-driven-across-a-newly-built-us-pier-into-the-gaza-strip/articleshow/110198552.cms,"WASHINGTON: Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip rolled across a newly built US floating pier into the besieged enclave for the first time Friday as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hinder food and other supplies reaching people there.The shipment is the first in an operation that American military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day entering the Gaza Strip as Israel presses in on the southern city of Rafah as its 7-month offensive against Hamas rages on.But the US and aid groups also warn that the pier project is not considered a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza. Before the war, more than 500 truckloads entered Gaza on an average day.The operation's success also remains tenuous due to the risk of militant attack, logistical hurdles and a growing shortage of fuel for the trucks to run due to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel's offensive since then has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, local health officials say, while hundreds more have been killed in the West Bank.The US military 's Central Command acknowledged the aid movement in a statement Friday, saying the first aid crossed into Gaza at 9 a.m. It said no American troops went ashore in the operation.“This is an ongoing, multinational effort to deliver additional aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza via a maritime corridor that is entirely humanitarian in nature, and will involve aid commodities donated by a number of countries and humanitarian organizations,” the command said.Troops finished installing the floating pier on Thursday. Hours later, the Pentagon said that humanitarian aid would soon begin flowing and that no backups were expected in the distribution process, which is being coordinated by the United Nations.The U.N., however, said fuel deliveries brought through land routes have all but stopped and this will make it extremely difficult to bring the aid to Gaza’s people.“We desperately need fuel,” U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said. “It doesn’t matter how the aid comes, whether it’s by sea or whether by land, without fuel, aid won’t get to the people.”Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the issue of fuel deliveries comes up in all US conversations with the Israelis. She also said the plan is to begin slowly with the sea route and ramp up the truck deliveries over time as they work the kinks out of the system.Aid agencies say they are running out of food in southern Gaza and fuel is dwindling, while the US Agency for International Development and the World Food Program say famine has taken hold in Gaza’s north.Israel asserts it places no limits on the entry of humanitarian aid and blames the U.N. for delays in distributing goods entering Gaza. The U.N. says fighting, Israeli fire and chaotic security conditions have hindered delivery. Israel also fears Hamas will use the fuel in its fight against Israeli troops.Under pressure from the US, Israel has in recent weeks opened a pair of crossings to deliver aid into hard-hit northern Gaza and said that a series of Hamas attacks on the main crossing, Kerem Shalom, have disrupted the flow of goods. There's also been violent protests by Israelis disrupting aid shipments.Israel recently seized the key Rafah border crossing in its push against Hamas around that city on the Egyptian border, raising fears about civilians' safety while also cutting off the main entry for aid into the Gaza Strip.US President Joe Biden ordered the pier project, expected to cost $320 million. The boatloads of aid will be deposited at a port facility built by the Israelis just southwest of Gaza City and then distributed by aid groups.US officials said the initial shipment totaled as much as 500 tons of aid. The US has closely coordinated with Israel on how to protect the ships and personnel working on the beach.But there are still questions on how aid groups will safely operate in Gaza to distribute food, said Sonali Korde, assistant to the administrator of USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, which is helping with logistics.“There is a very insecure operating environment” and aid groups are still struggling to get clearance for their planned movements in Gaza, Korde said.The fear follows an Israeli strike last month that killed seven relief workers from World Central Kitchen whose trip had been coordinated with Israeli officials and the deaths of other aid personnel during the war.Pentagon officials have made it clear that security conditions will be monitored closely and could prompt a shutdown of the maritime route , even just temporarily. Navy Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, a deputy commander at the US military’s Central Command, told reporters Thursday that “we are confident in the ability of this security arrangement to protect those involved.”Already, the site has been targeted by mortar fire during its construction, and Hamas has threatened to target any foreign forces who “occupy” the Gaza Strip.Biden has made it clear that there will be no US forces on the ground in Gaza, so third-country contractors will drive the trucks onto the shore. Cooper said “the United Nations will receive the aid and coordinate its distribution into Gaza.”The World Food Program will be the UN agency handling the aid, officials said.Israeli forces are in charge of security on shore, but there are also two US Navy warships nearby that can protect US troops and others.The aid for the sea route is collected and inspected in Cyprus, then loaded onto ships and taken about 200 miles (320 kilometers) to a large floating pier built by the US off the Gaza coast. There, the pallets are transferred onto the trucks that then drive onto the Army boats. Once the trucks drop off the aid on shore, they immediately turn around the return to the boats.",Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip rolled across a newly built US floating pier into the besieged enclave for the first time Friday. The shipment is the first in an operation that American military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day.

He emphasized the importance of China and Russia as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and major emerging markets.Prior to Putin's visit, Chinese President Xi Jinping concluded a five-day tour of Europe, visiting France, Serbia, and Hungary. During his trip, he promoted Beijing's vision of a multipolar world and engaged in discussions on trade, investments, and Russia's war in Ukraine. In France, President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Xi with luxury cognac and a trip to his childhood haunt in the Pyrenees mountains, while in Serbia, President Aleksandar Vucic organized a grand welcome with a large crowd chanting ""China, China"" and waving Chinese flags.Analysts suggest that Xi's primary objective with the European visit was to advocate for a world with reduced US dominance and to manage the damage to China's ties with the European Union amidst growing trade tensions. These tensions arise from the threat of European tariffs and an investigation into Chinese subsidies for electric vehicles, which officials claim are harming local industries.(With inputs from agencies)","The United States has expressed its disapproval of China's stance on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

US proposes reclassifying marijuana as low-risk drug,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-proposes-reclassifying-marijuana-as-low-risk-drug/articleshow/110194549.cms,"NEW DELHI: Biden administration on Thursday officially proposed to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a significant change that would align federal policy more closely with public opinion. President Biden emphasized in a video statement, ""No one should be in jail merely for using or possessing marijuana. Period,"" and expressed his commitment to correcting the wrongs caused by a failed approach to marijuana.Currently, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), alongside heroin, ecstasy, and LSD, indicating no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.The proposal would downgrade it to a Schedule III drug , similar to ketamine and codeine-containing painkillers, which are considered to have a moderate to low likelihood of dependence.The issue of marijuana reclassification is seen as a potential vote-winner for Biden in the upcoming November election, particularly among younger voters. A Pew Research Center survey found that 88 percent of Americans believe marijuana should be legal for medical or recreational use, with only 11 percent opposing legalization entirely. The decision to outlaw cannabis at the federal level in 1937 is criticized for being based largely on racist ideas, as the drug was associated with jazz music, the Black community, and Mexican immigrants, reported AFP.The "" War on Drugs "" in the 1970s also disproportionately affected minorities, particularly Black Americans, who are overrepresented in marijuana-related arrests.The reclassification of marijuana would have significant implications for businesses in the industry, allowing them to access banking services, receive federal funding for medical marijuana research, and engage in interstate commerce. It would also enable companies to deduct their operating expenses from their taxes, which is currently prohibited. The decision has been praised by industry leaders and civil rights organizations, with the NAACP stating, ""Far too many Black Americans have fallen victim to a system designed for their demise.""",Biden administration officially proposed to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.

On the same screen, there is news that India landed on the moon, and just after two seconds, the news is that a child died in an open gutter in Karachi,"" Kamal said.Highlighting the scarcity of fresh water in Karachi and the staggering number of children deprived of education, Kamal emphasized the urgent need for attention to Karachi's infrastructure and social welfare. The MQM-P leader also said citing a report that there are 70 lakh children in Karachi and over 2.6 crore children in Pakistan, who are not able to go to schools.""Karachi is the revenue engine of Pakistan. The two seaports operational in Pakistan since its inception, are both in Karachi. We (Karachi) are the gateway to the entire Pakistan, Central Asia to Afghanistan...For 15 years, Karachi was not given even a bit of fresh water. Even the water that came, the tanker mafia hoarded it and sold it to the people of Karachi,"" Kamal said.""We have a total of 48,000 schools, but a new report says that out of that 11,000 are 'ghost schools'. 70 lakh children in Sindh don't go to school and a total of 2,62,00,000 children in the country don't go to school...if we just focus on this, the leaders of the country shouldn't even get proper sleep,"" the Pakistani Parliamentarian added.Kamal also criticized the neglect of Karachi's development despite its pivotal role as Pakistan's economic powerhouse. He condemned the failure to provide basic amenities such as fresh water, which has exacerbated the city's challenges.Meanwhile, Pakistan is grappling with economic hardships, including high inflation and mounting debt. The government has sought a new loan program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to address these pressing issues. Talks between Pakistan and the IMF are underway, with the IMF urging Islamabad to implement comprehensive reforms in the energy sector and tax system.Last month, Pakistan completed a short-term $3 billion program, that helped stave off sovereign default, however, the government has highlighted the need for a fresh, longer-term program, according to Dawn.","Pakistani lawmaker drew a stark disparity between India's space achievements and the pressing issues faced by Karachi.

"Pakistanis own 23,000 properties worth $11 billion in Dubai, reveal property leaks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistanis-own-23000-properties-worth-11-billion-in-dubai-reveal-property-leaks/articleshow/110156743.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Prominent Pakistani politicians, retired generals, bureaucrats, bankers and money launderers have been named in the latest property leaks containing details of individuals who own residential properties in upscale areas of Dubai. The combined value of these properties is around $11 billion.“Dubai Unlocked”, an investigative project by over 70 media outlets around the globe, has revealed ownership of hundreds of properties of prominent global figures, including corrupt politicians,money launderers and drug lords, in Dubai.The data covers records of residential properties from 2020 till 2022.Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaksowning 23,000 properties in Dubaiare President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly, former PM Nawaz Sharif’s son Hussain Nawaz, home (interior) minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife, and several national and provincial lawmakers.While Zardari’s elder daughter, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, is a Dubai resident, his son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and daughter, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, were listed as owners of four properties. Through her lawyers, Aseefa said that all assets owned by her in Dubai have been duly declared to the relevant authorities in Pakistan, including the electoral watchdog.The Pakistani list also features the late former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, former PM Shaukat Aziz, ex-army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa’s son, and more than a dozen retired army generals as well as a police chief, an ambassador and a scientist, all of whom owned properties either directly or through their spouses and children.The Altaf Khanani network, which was sanctioned by the US for involvement in money laundering, has also surfaced in the leaks. Moving illicit funds for organised crime groups, including drug cartels and violent terrorist organisations, the network raked in an estimated turnover of between $14 billion and $16 billion annually. Altaf Khanani, the international face of the organisation, was ultimately convicted and spent nearly six years in a US prison; he was blacklisted by the US on money-laundering charges along with his son, Obaid Khanani, and nephew, Hozaifa Khanani. In Dubai, a country where, reportedly, investing in real estate with bags of cash raises few questions, the Khananis are listed owners of a massive real estate portfolio. Obaid himself is linked to around 30 properties, while the family as a whole were listed owners of 85 properties in early 2020, including around a dozen villas.Notably, several Pakistani families involved in politics and business were absent from the data, despite it being well known that they have bases and family residences in Dubai. This underscores that although the data is solid, it is neither a historical record of property ownership nor a comprehensive representation of all properties purchased by Pakistanis in Dubai . Many owners, according to data, still remain undetected, especially those who purchased property via a third party, or lesser-known company.","Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaks are President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly.

However, he remains incarcerated as he is serving sentences in the cipher and iddat cases. Notably, his sentences in two distinct Toshakhana cases were suspended by the IHC.During Tuesday's court session, NAB Special Prosecutor Amjad Pervaiz had indicated that the trial of the former premier and his spouse was nearing completion in his closing remarks.Last December, the National Accountability Bureau launched an inquiry against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and others, regarding the alleged acquisition of numerous acres of land under the guise of Al Qadir University Trust. This purportedly resulted in a reported loss of 190 million pounds to the national treasury.In a bail petition filed in November of the same year, Khan asserted that the NAB, allegedly acting as a tool of the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, was politically targeting him through this case, as per Dawn.The Al-Qadir Trust matter revolves around the settlement of 190 million pounds (approximately Rs 50 billion), transferred to Pakistan by the UK's National Crime Agency following its recovery from a Pakistani real estate magnate. During his tenure as prime minister, Khan opted to allow the businessman to utilize the funds to partially settle a fine of around Rs 450 billion, previously imposed by the Supreme Court, instead of depositing it into the national treasury.","Imran Khan was granted bail by Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday in a land corruption case.

The list also includes late Gen Pervez Musharraf , former prime minister Shaukat Aziz, retired generals, a police chief, an ambassador, and a scientist, all of whom have owned properties directly or through their spouses and children.Furthermore, the leaks highlight discrepancies in property declarations, such as Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife owning a villa in Dubai that was not disclosed in his Senate election nomination papers. The investigation also reveals the involvement of individuals like the Altaf Khanani network, sanctioned for money laundering, and Hamid Mukhtar Shah, a physician involved in criminal activities, as property owners in Dubai.The data reveals properties ranging from studio apartments to lavish six-bedroom villas owned by Pakistan's elite, including political, military, and business figures, across premium locations like Dubai Marina, Emirates Hills, and Palm Jumeirah.The leaked data provides insights into the offshore real estate wealth of Pakistanis, with over 23,000 properties listed as belonging to Pakistani nationals up to the spring of 2022.

The protesters were killed on Monday evening after the Rangers, en route to Muzaffarabad, opened fire on them when they were attacked, a local govt official said.The recent protests coincided with the visit of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission to negotiate a new long-term loan with Pakistan.

According to Dawn.com, the leaked data provides a detailed overview of hundreds of thousands of properties in Dubai and information about their ownership or usage, largely from 2020 and 2022.It was obtained by the Centre for Advanced Defence Studies (C4ADS), a non-profit organisation based in Washington, DC, that researches international crime and conflict.The data was then shared with Norwegian financial outlet E24 and the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which coordinated an investigative project with media outlets from around the world. Titled 'Dubai Unlocked', the collaboration includes 74 partners from 58 countries.The website reported that the details of ""an astounding volume of leaked property data that includes over 17,000 properties listed as belonging to Pakistani nationals up to the spring of 2022"" were known to journalists from scores of media outlets around the world.It stated that while 17,000 Pakistani citizens are listed owners in the 2022 leak, academics using the data and additional sources put the actual number of Pakistani owners of residential property in Dubai at 22,000.They further estimate that the apartments and villas may have been worth more than USD 10 billion at the start of 2022, but with the more than 25 per cent increase in property prices over the last two years, the real worth of Pakistanis' residential properties in Dubai could now be well above USD 12.5 billion.""If we have the data you are talking about, as well as the information on residence status, we will make sure those who are eligible to pay tax in Pakistan on rental income or capital value are doing so,"" Malik Amjed Zubair Tiwana, chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), was quoted as saying by the news portal.""It may be a sensitive matter, and perhaps the law will have to change, but with political will we will go all out against tax evaders.

Nor does the data contain information such as residence status, sources of income, tax declarations of rental income or capital gains. In fact, several of those approached for comment on their properties said they were declared to the tax authorities.""But it does paint an astonishing picture of contrasts.

""On the morning of May 9, 2023, my illegal abduction from the High Court was part of the London Plan (to topple the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government and impose a hybrid system led by the Sharif family on the country), for which General Asim Munir should apologize to me,"" Khan said on X.It is believed that his family is running his social media account.Criticising Gen Munir, Khan said: ""It is the misfortune of this country that a self-proclaimed King (Gen Munir) has taken hold of all the decision-making. I am currently in prison because if I am free, it will challenge the power of that one person.""Khan said the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) - the media wing of the armed forces - and the Chief of Army Staff are making threatening political statements and involving the army in politics which is tarnishing the image of the army.The powerful Army, which has ruled the coup-prone country for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy.ISPR DG Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharif last week said that any dialogue with the PTI could happen only if it ""earnestly apologizes publicly in front of the nation, promises to adopt constructive politics, and forgoes politics of anarchy"".Khan said when political statements and press conferences are held, political parties have the right to respond to them.""When the government is given to people lacking democratic mandate, the country becomes an epicenter of corruption and chaos. The chaos that is seen in (Pakistan-occupied) Kashmir today is likely to spread across Pakistan. Form 47 (fake result) non-democratic governments have been established in the entire country.""When a government is elected democratically, it is backed by the people. People value their elected government and if any issues arise, it is resolved through dialogue,"" he said, adding that people place no trust in the imposed governments in Gilgit-Baltistan, PoK, Punjab, and Pakistan; hence the widespread unrest and frustration.He said further backlash will ensue against Form 47 governments when the budget is announced.He further said an artificial set-up has been imposed on the people in the country.""This government has absolutely no authority. An unconstitutional institution like SIFC (Special Investment Facilitation Council, an initiative of the army) has been imposed on Pakistan and no one dares to question it. It was established with the sole purpose of bringing investments, while the Pakistan Business Council has openly stated that investors are withdrawing their investments instead of investing in the country.""On the one hand, the nation was misled with the false hopes of the agricultural revolution and on the other hand, wheat importation to embezzle billions of rupees, has devastated the wheat farmer economically,"" he added.Khan said in this bogus setup, the government is given to those who have all their wealth lying outside in the form of dollars.""A leader has to make sacrifices and this group of Nawaz and Zardari will not sacrifice under any circumstances nor will they bring their money back to the country. General Musharraf and later ISI provided details to everyone including me on their looted money and today they have been imposed on us and their corruption charges are being cleared. The purpose of imposing this fake system on the nation is only to increase the power of this one man (Gen Munir) who has destroyed the entire country for his personal power,"" he said and vowed not to cut a deal with the military.""This country is my country and I will never leave it. Moreover, any deal is also out of the question. Pakistan is being run in a dictatorial manner. Our total revenue is 13.9 trillion rupees, while we have to pay 9.8 trillion rupees annually as interest. The country can never progress with such a punitive use of coercive measures,"" Khan said.","Imran Khan has been in jail since August last in different cases.
