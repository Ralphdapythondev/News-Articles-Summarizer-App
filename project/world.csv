Kamala Harris: 'My crowds are pretty big': Kamala Harris mocks Trump during fundraiser,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/my-crowds-are-pretty-big-kamala-harris-mocks-trump-during-fundraiser/articleshow/113799476.cms,"File photo: US Vice-President and Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris (Picture credit: Reuters)

Vice President Kamala Harris took a jab at Republican frontrunner Donald Trump during a high-profile fundraiser on Sunday, boasting about the large crowds she draws as she campaigns across the country, reported the news agency AP.She also aimed to reinforce her support in battleground states like Arizona and Nevada, as she then went to Nevada for a rally at the same location where Trump spoke two weeks prior.Trump has been actively criticising her in these states, especially on immigration.Harris knows that the stakes are high but she also acknowledged the margins to be low. She called it a “margin-of-error” race, but confidently added, “The election is here, and let me be clear. We are going to win.""Harris quipped to the audience, “My crowds are pretty big,” as she prepared to speak in Nevada, at the same venue where Trump had held a rally earlier. During the presidential debate, Harris appeared to get under Trump's skin by pointing out that people were leaving his rallies early due to his rambling speeches. She has continued with this line of attack on the campaign trail.Her four-day West Coast trip combined campaign fundraising in California with stops in battleground states, shows that the race to the White House is going to be a close one.Harris’s visit to the US-Mexico border in Douglas, Arizona, her first since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, was likely intended to address immigration. Trump has spent days attacking her, claiming she would allow a border ""invasion"" and lead to lawlessness.Harris brushed off his accusations, responding, “We just see the same old tired show from the same old tired playbook,” as some in the audience shouted ""boring!"" in agreement.Notably, the star-studded fundraiser, which was held in Los Angeles , featured performances by Halle Bailey and Alanis Morissette and was attended by celebrities like Stevie Wonder, Keegan-Michael Key, Sterling K. Brown, Demi Lovato, and Jessica Alba. Harris has also been gaining Republican support, with former Arizona Sen Jeff Flake endorsing her, praising her “fine character and love of country.”Flake joins other anti-Trump Republicans, such as Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz, in backing Harris. However, Maryland Senate candidate Larry Hogan, another critic of Trump, said Harris has yet to earn his vote, although Trump won’t receive his support either.In Nevada, where Harris held a rally Sunday night, she highlighted her promise to eliminate federal taxes on tips for service industry workers, echoing a similar pledge made by Trump.However, Harris went further by promising to tackle the “sub-minimum wage” practice, where employers pay workers lower salaries and rely on tips to meet wage requirements. Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer of Nevada's Culinary Union , said, “That shows us she's serious.”Harris will return to Nevada on October 10 for a town hall with Hispanic voters, further emphasising the importance of the state’s six electoral votes in an election that is expected to be exceedingly close. Both she and Trump have made frequent visits to Nevada, which shows its significance in the race for the White House.","US Vice-President Kamala Harris took a jab at Republican frontrunner Donald Trump during a high-profile fundraiser on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden was asked by reporters on Sunday if he believes that an all-out war in the Middle East needs to be avoided. Tensions have escalated in the Middle East as Israel 's conflict with Hamas has now moved to Lebanon's Hezbollah .Biden on Sunday told reporters that the possibility of an all-out war 'has to' be avoided. While boarding Air Force One, Biden said, ""It has to be.We really have to avoid it.""This statement followed Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, which resulted in numerous casualties as well as the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, that has potentially brought the possibility of pulling both Iran and US directly into the conflict.The White House views Nasrallah's death as a significant setback for Hezbollah. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel ’s war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out regional conflict.Biden indicated he plans to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though he did not specify when.","US President Joe Biden was asked by reporters on Sunday if he believes an all- out war in the Middle East needs to be avoided.

Is mathematics the path to AI chatbots that don’t make stuff up?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/is-mathematics-the-path-to-ai-chatbots-that-dont-make-stuff-up/articleshow/113798125.cms,"Representative image

SAN FRANCISCO: On a recent afternoon, Tudor Achim gave a brain teaser to an artificial intelligence bot called Aristotle. The question involved a 10-by-10 table filled with a hundred numbers. If you collected the smallest number in each row and the largest number in each column, he asked, could the largest of the small numbers ever be greater than the smallest of the large numbers? The bot correctly answered “No.” But that was not surprising.Popular chatbots may give the right answer, too. The difference was that Aristotle had proved that its answer was right. The bot generated a detailed computer program that verified “No” was the correct response.Chatbots including ChatGPT and Gemini can answer questions, write poetry, summarise news articles and generate images. But they also make mistakes that defy common sense. Sometimes, they make stuff up — a phenome non called hallucination.Achim, CEO and co-founder of a Silicon Valley startup cal led Harmonic, is part of growing effort to build a new kind of AI that never hallucinates. Today, this technology is focused on mathematics . But many researchers believe they can extend the same techniques into computer programming and other areas. Because Maths is a rigid discipline with formal ways of proving whether an answer is right or wrong, companies such as Harmonic can build AI technologies that check their own answers and learn to produce reliable information.Some researchers feel they can eventually build an AI system that is better at math than any human. That’s the goal of Achim and his co-founder Vlad Tenev. Their company Harmonic has raised $75 million in funding from Sequoia Capital and other investors. Others believe these techniques can extend further, leading to AI systems that can verify physical truths as well as mathematical.As Aristotle checks its own answers, it becomes a way of generating enormous amounts of trustworthy data that can be used to teach AI systems. Researchers call this “synthetic data” — data produced by AI that can be used to train AI. Researchers believe this concept will be a vital part of AI development. Achim and Tenev believe that after years of training, Aristotle will be better at Maths than any human. “We want it to solve problems that have never been solved,” Tenev says.","Chatbots including ChatGPT and Gemini can answer questions, write poetry, summarise news articles and generate images.

Islamabad, In an effort to minimise administrative expenditures, cash-strapped Pakistan on Sunday announced to abolish about 150,000 government posts , close six ministries, and merge two others, as part of reforms agreed upon with the IMF under USD 7 billion loan deal . The International Monetary Fund on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to cut expenditures, increase tax-to GDP ratio, tax non-traditional sectors like agriculture and real estate, limit subsidies and transfer some fiscal responsibilities to provinces.Addressing the media on his return from the US, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that a programme had been finalised with the IMF, which would be the last programme for Pakistan.""We need to implement our policies to prove that it will be the last programme,"" he said, and emphasised that in order to join the G20, the economy must be formalised.The minister said right-sizing within ministries was going on and the decision to close six ministries is set to be implemented, while two ministries will be merged. ""Additionally, 150,000 posts across various ministries will be eliminated,"" Aurangzeb said.He dwelt at length on increasing tax revenues, noting that there were approximately 300,000 new taxpayers last year, and so far this year, 732,000 new taxpayers have registered, increasing the total number of taxpayers in the country from 1.6 million to 3.2 million.Aurangzeb also said that the non-filers category will be abolished and those not paying taxes will no longer be able to purchase property or vehicles.The minister claimed that the economy was moving in the right direction and the country's foreign exchange reserves had increased, reaching their highest level. He highlighted significant growth in both national exports and IT exports, and stated that investor confidence regarding the strength of the economy is a major success.Aurangzeb stated that the policy rate has been reduced by 4.5 per cent by the government after coming to power, and expressed optimism that the exchange rate and policy rate will remain as expected.""Our claim that the economy is improving is not a hollow claim because inflation has decreased due to government policies. Inflation has dropped to single digits,"" he said.Pakistan has been struggling to fix its economy for the last many years and it was close to default in 2023 but a timely loan of USD 3 billion by the IMF saved the situation.Pakistan has negotiated a long-term loan with the global lender with the hope and commitment that it would be the last loan. However, many doubt this claim as the country has already secured about two dozen loans from the Fund but failed to address the economy on a permanent basis.","Pakistan to abolish about 150,000 government posts, close six ministries, and merge two others.

"Israel's Netanyahu adds rival to Cabinet, strengthens hold on office",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israels-netanyahu-adds-rival-to-cabinet-strengthens-hold-on-office/articleshow/113797606.cms,"Gideon Saar

JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed a former rival, Gideon Saar , as a member of his Cabinet on Sunday, expanding his coalition and strengthening his hold on office. Under their agreement, Netanyahu said Saar would serve as a minister without portfolio and serve in the security cabinet, the body that oversees the management of the ongoing war against Israel 's enemies across the Middle East.Saar (57) had hoped to replace defence minister Yoav Gallant, another rival of Netanyahu's. But a deal to become defence minister fell through several weeks ago after fighting intensified with Hezbollah along Israel's northern border, leaving the popular Gallant in office for the time being.Saar has had a strained relationship with the prime minister. He was once a rising star in Netanyahu's Likud party but angrily left it four years ago after accusing the prime minister of turning it into a ""cult of personality"" as he battled corruption charges.Since then, however, Saar has struggled as leader of a small conservative party, enjoying little support with the broader public. While he and Netanyahu have little love for one another, they share a hard-line ideology toward Israel's Arab adversaries.In recent months, Saar has said Israel must fight until Hamas is destroyed. He also has called for tougher action against Hezbollah's sponsor, Iran. And like Netanyahu, he strongly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state .In a joint statement, they said they had put their differences aside for the good of the nation.Netanyahu's decision appears to have been driven in part by domestic politics.He faces a number of key political battles in the coming weeks -- including the contentious issue of drafting ultra-Orthodox men into the army, passing a budget and taking the stand in his long-running corruption trial. Saar is expected to help Netanyahu on many of these issues.His appointment also will likely scale back the influence of ultranationalist members of his coalition. Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's minister of national security, are religious ideologues who have threatened to bring down the government if Netanyahu makes too many concessions in any cease-fire deal. Ben-Gvir has also drawn international criticism for provocative visits to a contested Jerusalem holy site.Sunday's agreement gives Saar, who hopes to be prime minister one day, an opportunity to revive his political career, while expanding Netanyahu's majority coalition to 68 seats in the 120-seat parliament.","Gideon Saar will serve as a minister without portfolio and serve in the security cabinet.

Malcolm Gladwell , the best-selling author ofone of the most important non-fiction books of the 21st century, is back with its dark sequelWhile discussing the new book with the Guardian, Gladwell calls out what he calls Harvard’s admission officers’ “bias towards affluent white students”.Pointing out the disparity between Harvard and an institution with a merit-based admissions process like Caltech compared to Harvard, he writes: “My suspicion is that for many people it’s unconscious, but there must be a point at which [Harvard admissions tutors] are confronting the fact that they have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their campus hasn’t become dominated by Asians and Indians.”In the book, Gladwell notes that Caltech, a highly competitive university with a merit-based admissions system, saw the proportion of Asian American students rise from 25% to 43% between 1992 and 2013.In contrast, at Harvard, where the admissions process is influenced by factors such as legacy, donor contributions, and athletic scholarships, the percentage of Asian American students has remained consistently between 15-20% during the same period. Indian applicants are even more likely to be excluded by Harvard’s application process.Gladwell goes on to argue: ""Meritocracy is one of the most beautiful inventions of the 20th century – it is a foundation of a free society.""Here are 10 other key points aboutand Malcolm Gladwell:Malcolm Gladwell was initially reluctant to revisit his debut work but ultimately chose to create an entirely new version, one that reflects today's more anxious world rather than simply updating the original.The foundational idea that social trends behave like epidemics, initially growing slowly before suddenly taking off, still holds true. However, some of Gladwell's original examples have not aged well.Gladwell now finds his earlier chapter on crime ""embarrassing,"" as he once credited New York City's crime reduction to 'broken windows' policing. He has since acknowledged that this approach led to over-policing in minority neighbourhoods and wasn't actually responsible for the drop in crime rates.Gladwell values the process of learning from errors, a trait he respects in his father. He proposes that authors should periodically reassess their original works every 25 years to stay aligned with new insights.The new book is darker and more nuanced than the original. It delves into how a small number of individuals can disproportionately influence significant events, such as the opioid crisis, where a minority of doctors were responsible for nearly half of all prescriptions.While The Tipping Point became a cultural phenomenon, Gladwell’s latest book explores how individuals with substantial influence can shape societal changes, both positively and negatively.Gladwell reflects on how male leadership failures over the past eight years make a strong case for female leaders, particularly in the current political climate.Gladwell has expressed his support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, noting a personal connection through his mother, who shares Jamaican heritage with Harris's father.He argues that recent examples of male leadership failures have made it increasingly difficult to justify misogynistic attitudes and believes that America is ready for a female president.Now living with his partner and two young daughters, Gladwell views parenting as a journey of intellectual humility. He continuously adapts his understanding of his children as they grow and sees this phase of his life as a ""productivity mechanism"" that shapes his evolving perspective.","Malcolm Gladwell's new book, ""Revenge of the Tipping Point,"" is darker and more nuanced than the original.

According to an affidavit, multiple witnesses witnessed the incident.Urban and Ehlers reportedly signed a letter relinquishing custody of their child to another man, Cody Nathaniel Martin. The letter said: “I, Darien Urban and Shalene Ehlers are signing our rights over to Cody Nathaniel Martin of our baby boy [redacted] for $1,000 on 09/21/2024. Disclaimer: After signing this there will be no changing yall two’s minds and to never contact again.”A cellphone video of the couple signing the contract was reportedly obtained by investigators. Witnesses also reported that a heavily intoxicated resident of the campground, Ricky Crawford, had earlier offered to take the baby for the night in exchange for several cans of beer. He later handed the baby to Martin, after Urban and Ehlers agreed to the exchange.The affidavit revealed that when a deputy arrived at the scene, the child was found to be in poor condition, requiring medical attention. Emergency services transported the infant to the hospital, where he was evaluated for signs of neglect. Witnesses reported a strong smell of ammonia and faeces emanating from the baby, who had a dirty diaper, severe diaper rash, blisters, and swelling.Martin told deputies that while no money had been exchanged at the time, he planned to bring the couple a $1,000 cheque on September 23. The couple said they intended to “legalise” the agreement on the following Monday.Urban was released on a $50,000 bond, while Ehlers remains in custody on a $30,000 bail.

Calvin Robinson , a British Anglican catholic priest and conservative commentator, has issued a warning to Americans about the potential direction of their culture, urging them to learn lessons from the UK, according to the New York Post . In an interview with The Christian Post , Robinson said, ""Please don't do what we did. Please don't just sit back and let the liberals deteriorate the rest of everything that you know and love.""Robinson expressed concern over the 'spiritual' and 'political' forces he believes are undermining traditional British and Christian values .He sees troubling parallels emerging in the United States. ""Be careful. American culture is a fantastic culture. Hold on to it, promote it, encourage it,"" he said, adding that while multiculturalism can be beneficial, it should not come at the expense of American identity.Robinson's comments come after unrest in the UK, which saw riots erupt after the tragic murder of three children by a 17-year-old. He criticised the government for threatening to imprison individuals for sharing inflammatory posts about the riots while at ehs same time releasing criminals from custody to address overcrowding. ""The UK seems to have imploded and entirely lost its common sense,"" he said.He has previously claimed that the UK is on the brink of a ""civil war"" due to rising tensions surrounding diversity and multiculturalism.

We also have vital and indispensable allies. I want to support a president who understands and appreciates the difference,” he said.Flake's relationship with the Republican Party has been debatable, particularly after announcing he would not seek re-election in 2018 due to the rising influence of Trump. “There may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party,” he remarked at the time.In an interview with ABC News, Flake expressed the sentiments shared by many conservative Republicans regarding Trump’s actions post-election, saying, “It's difficult to support a candidate who, having lost an election, tries to use the powers of the presidency to overturn that election.

"Florida Doctor: Staff left 'shocked' as Florida surgeon mistakenly removes liver instead of spleen, leading to fatality",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/staff-left-shocked-as-florida-surgeon-mistakenly-removes-liver-instead-of-spleen-leading-to-fatality/articleshow/113790017.cms,"A Florida doctor had his medical licence suspended after being accused of mistakenly removing a patient's liver instead of the spleen, resulting in the ""immediate and catastrophic death"" of a 70-year-old Alabama man, according to the New York Post. The doctor, Thomas J. Shaknovsky, was found to have made “repeated egregious surgical errors” and allegedly falsified medical records to cover up the fatal mistake, according to an emergency order filed on September 24 by Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo.The incident occurred on August 21 at Ascension Sacred Heart Emerald Coast Hospital, where William Bryan was admitted after experiencing severe abdominal pain while on holiday with his wife in Miramar Beach. Imaging revealed an enlarged spleen, and despite initially refusing surgery , Bryan eventually agreed to undergo a splenectomy after Dr Shaknovsky insisted on him.Hospital members doubted Shaknovsky’s ability to perform complex surgery, as the team operated with a reduced “skeleton staff.” According to the surgeon general’s order, Shaknovsky began the procedure laparoscopically, surgical technique that uses specialised instruments to treat conditions in the abdomen or pelvis, but quickly converted to an open operation because of poor visibility caused by Bryan’s “distended colon and blood in the abdomen.” However, Shaknovsky failed to document this decision properly.Shaknovsky then reportedly began dissecting what he believed to be the spleen but instead was handling the liver. The doctor is said to have severed multiple ligaments attached to the liver, “that’s scary,” he said, after he felt a pulse under his finger. He then fired a surgical stapler into a vessel, causing a haemorrhage that sent Bryan into cardiac arrest.Operating room staff began emergency efforts, performing CPR and suctioning blood, but while the team worked to save Bryan, Shaknovsky continued to dissect the liver, eventually removing the organ, which weighed 4.6 pounds. Witnesses said that Shaknovsky insisted it was the spleen, leaving staff “shocked” and “sick to their stomachs.”Shaknovsky claimed Bryan died of a splenic artery aneurysm. He reportedly pressured staff to label the removed liver as a spleen and send it to pathology. The order further noted that Shaknovsky returned to the operating room three times, each time reiterating his assertion that Bryan had died of a splenic artery aneurysm.Surgeon general Ladapo condemned Shaknovsky’s actions, “Each attachment severed was another opportunity for Dr Shaknovsky to recognise he was handling the wrong organ,” Ladapo said.Bryan’s death has been ruled a homicide , and his family is expected to file a malpractice lawsuit.","Dr Thomas J.

Trump says Harris is 'mentally impaired' and should be disqualified,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-kamala-is-mentally-impaired-and-should-be-disqualified/articleshow/113789366.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US Presidential elections took an ugly and ominous turn this weekend with MAGA Supremo Donald Trump calling Democratic candidate Kamala Harris ""mentally impaired"" and demanding she be disqualified for letting in foreign criminals into the country to win the elections.Trump made a series of wild and unsubstantiated charges at a rally in Wisconsin and a college football game he attended in Alabama, doubling down on his racist rhetoric and taking US political discourse into unchartered territory.'Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way...And if you think about it only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country,"" Trump told a fanboy interviewer who egged him on the sidelines of a game where spectators gave him a raucous reception when he was shown on the jumbotron.The Harris campaign in turn trolled him with an ad that called him a ""loser"" for running away from a second debate after he self-destructed in the first, which he maintains he won. Bad weather reportedly thwarted an airplane banner that was to carry the message ""Trump’s Punting on 2nd Debate"" over one of the biggest college football games involving Georgia and Alabama that attracted over 100,000 spectators.Trump has previously called Harris ""crazy,"" ""nuts"" and ""dumb as a rock,"" and endorsed allegations that she is successful only because she slept her way to the top. He has claimed that the Jamaican-Indian origin vice president conveniently adopted a black heritage recently for electoral gains.But his latest line of attack suggesting that she should not be allowed to run on grounds of mental disability, coming amid growing legal challenges to the poll process in places where Democrats are expected to win, marks sinister turn in the most fractious US election in modern history.Trump's ramped up attack on Harris, including personal denigration, was triggered by new data purportedly provided by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official to a Republican lawmaker, revealing more than 650,000 non-citizens with criminal history, including more than 13,000 individuals accused or convicted of homicide, are currently in the US. The data did not say when or from how far back the alleged criminals came in or how the purported criminality was determined.“As of July 21, 2024, there were 662,566 noncitizens with criminal histories on ICE’s national docket —13,099 criminally convicted MURDERS. Americans deserve to be SAFE in our own communities,"" Congressman Tony Gonzales, who represents a border district in Texas, tweeted.But Trump and his MAGA cohorts are going with the narrative that the Biden-Harris administration is willfully bringing in criminals from across the world to ""destroy America"" and win the elections despite little evidence that illegal immigrants, much less criminals, are being registered to vote.Trump himself has become more graphic in the language he is using, ostensibly to put fear into American voters. ""They will walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your throat,...they will rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill,"" he foamed.The ICE data was made public just before Harris went to visit the border in Arizona to make the case that having staunched the migrant crossing from Mexico, she will get tougher on the border issue, and it is Trump who is sabotaging it for electoral gains. She has repeatedly said Trump wants to run on a problem rather than work toward a solution, pointing to the former President spiking immigration and border legislation proposed by lawmakers from the Republican Party.Trump has denied killing the legislation even though Republican lawmakers have publicly confirmed this and Trump himself boasted having done so. His effort to pin the illegal immigration issue on Harris, demonize immigrants, otherize her as an outsider, and try and disqualify her is also transparent.“Nobody who has allowed this to happen to our Country is fit to be President of the United States! Bad timing for her to show up to the Border today, after not going for four years. Why didn’t she release these numbers earlier?” Trump asked, as the MAGA echo-chamber went into overdrive with the new data.

Daylight saving time 2024 to end in November: What is it and its history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/daylight-saving-time-to-end-in-november-what-is-it-and-its-history/articleshow/113787690.cms,"Representative Image

What is daylight saving time?

History of daylight saving time?

Why is it controversial?

When it is ending this year?

The daylight saving time will end in the next five weeks, which means that after that the US civilians will get an extra hour of sleep in the process.It is quite a controversial process as it allows the moving of the clock twice a year, either to allow for more daylight in the winter mornings or for more daylight in the summer evenings. It's a practice that most, but not all US states and territories, observe, and some lawmakers have recently contemplated passing legislation to end daylight saving time once and for all, US Today reported.Let's better understand about the 'daylight saving time.'Daylight saving time and time zones in the US are defined in the U.S.Code, Title 15, Chapter 6, Subchapter IX - Standard Time . Congress has mandated that most regions of the United States set their clocks forward by one hour during the summer months, known as daylight saving time, and then set them back by one hour during the winter months, referred to as standard time. The specific dates for the beginning and end of daylight saving time have been modified through new legislation passed by Congress over time, according to the US navy.As of 2007, daylight saving time begins in the United States on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. On the second Sunday in March, clocks are set ahead one hour at 2:00 am local standard time (which becomes 3:00 am local daylight saving time). On the first Sunday in November, clocks are set back one hour at 2:00 am local daylight saving time (which becomes 1:00 am local standard time).The origins of standard time zones in the US and Canada can be traced back to the railroads in 1883. However, it wasn't until the passage of The Standard Time Act on March 19, 1918, that standard time was officially recognized in US law. This act also introduced daylight saving time, which was met with controversy at the time. In 1919, daylight saving time was repealed, but standard time zones remained in effect, with daylight time becoming a local issue. During World War II, daylight saving time was reinstated nationwide from February 9, 1942, to September 30, 1945. Following the war, its implementation varied among states and localities. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 provided standardization for the start and end dates of daylight saving time in the US, while allowing for local exemptions.Congress implemented earlier starting dates for daylight saving time during the ""energy crisis"" years. In 1974 and 1975, daylight saving time began on January 6 and February 23, respectively. After these two years, the starting date returned to the last Sunday in April. A law passed in 1986 moved the starting date to the first Sunday in April, beginning in 1987, while the ending date remained the last Sunday in October. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 further modified both the starting and ending dates, with daylight saving time now beginning on the second Sunday in March and concluding on the first Sunday in November, effective from 2007 onward.A common myth is that the US adopted daylight saving time to benefit farmers, but in reality many farmers are opposed to the practice for being disruptive to their schedules. The original motivation to conserve fuel is also under debate, as studies have found little, if any, energy savings from the shift, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service. Opponents point to other studies that have found adverse health effects linked to daylight saving time, such as a spike in fatal traffic accidents, heart attacks, strokes and sleep deprivation in the days after clocks are moved forward an hour every March.A March 2023 YouGov poll found that 62% of Americans want to end the practice of changing clocks, though only 50% preferred to keep permanent daylight saving time, as per Reuters.daylight saving time will end for the year at 2 am local time on Sunday, November 3 and gain an extra hour of sleep.","The daylight saving time will end in the next five weeks, which means that after that the US civilians will get an extra hour of sleep in the process.

Who is Erika Diarte-Carr? Utah mom plans her own funeral after being given 3 months to live,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-erika-diarte-carr-utah-mom-plans-her-own-funeral-after-being-given-3-months-to-live/articleshow/113788280.cms,"Erika Diarte-Carr, 33, learned she has Stage 4 small cell lung carcinoma, a rare form of cancer.

Erika Diarte-Carr , a 33-year-old mother of two from Utah, is facing a heart-wrenching reality after being given just three months to live. The young mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 small cell lung carcinoma in May 2022 while undergoing shoulder surgery. Her journey has been both physically and emotionally taxing, and in January, she received another devastating diagnosis: Cushing Syndrome .This rare disorder, caused by an overproduction of cortisol, affects only a small fraction of the population—between 40 to 70 people out of every million, according to the National Institutes of Health. The syndrome, if left untreated, can be life-threatening, adding further complexity to Erika's already difficult battle with cancer.On her GoFundMe page, Erika recently shared the grim news from her oncologist. “I have been given 3 months to live,” she wrote. “3 months to spend with my babies and loved ones. 3 months to make the best of what time I have left.” Her children, Jeremiah, 7, and Aaliyah, 5, are at the forefront of her thoughts as she faces the unimaginable task of planning her own funeral.With financial concerns weighing heavily, Erika explained that she has been unable to work and has no life insurance or savings. “I need to make sure my kids will be okay after I am gone,” she wrote. Her initial goal was to raise $5,000 to cover funeral costs and leave something behind for her children.In an extraordinary show of support, Erika’s story has touched the hearts of many. As of this week, her GoFundMe has raised over $840,000 from more than 29,000 donors, far surpassing her initial goal. Humbled by the generosity, she plans to set up a trust fund for her children. “That way, I can leave behind something for them and still ensure they are going to be ok as they grow up,” Erika shared.Her gratitude shines through as she reflects on the kindness of strangers. “Me and my family thank you ALL from the bottom of our hearts,” she wrote, adding, “[My children] are my whole life, light, and soul. My children are my fight and what keep me going.”In the little time she has left, Erika hopes to create lasting memories with her children. The three will soon embark on a special trip together, and she’s hopeful they will spend one final Christmas as a family.","Erika Diarte-Carr, 33, was diagnosed with Stage 4 small cell lung carcinoma.

Their trucks were stopped, or they were forcibly removed from buses.The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), an ethnic insurgent group fighting against the central government, claimed responsibility for the August attacks.

Citing Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 's United Nations General Assembly ( UNGA ) speech where he accused New Delhi of ""escalating tensions"" in Kashmir, Jaishankar also warned that Islamabad's ""actions will most certainly have consequences"".Addressing the UNGA, Jaishankar said that the ""issue to be resolved between the two countries is only the vacation of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir by Islamabad and the abandonment of its long-standing attachment to terrorism.""""Some make conscious choices with disastrous consequences. A premier example is our neighbor Pakistan. Unfortunately, the mystics affect others as well, especially the neighbors.

On the contrary, actions will certainly have consequences. The issue to be resolved between us is only the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan and of course, abandonment of Pakistan's long-standing attachment to terrorism,"" he added.This comes a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif remarks, calling India to reverse its ""unilateral and illegal"" actions in Jammu and Kashmir, referring to the 2019 revocation of Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu & Kashmir.""India spurned Pakistan's proposals for a mutual strategic restraint to the regime. Its leadership has often threatened to cross the line of control and take over Azad Kashmir,"" Shehbaz Sharif claimed.Soon after his remarks, the first secretary of India’s permanent mission to the UN Bhavika Mangalanandan also responded sharply in UNGA and, in turn, highligted Pakistan's usage of cross-border terrorism as a key strategy against India, citing numerous incidents, including the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001 and the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.""The list is long,"" Mangalanandan said in retort to Islamabad's unfounded assertions. She further said that there can be ""no compact with terrorism"" and that Pakistan's cross-border terrorism against India will ""inevitably invite consequences"". ""We are talking about a nation that for long hosted Osama bin Laden. A country whose fingerprints are on so many terrorist incidents across the world, whose policies attract the dregs of many societies to make it their home,"" Mangalanandan said during India’s right of reply.Mangalanandan in her response called Pakistan a ""country run by the military"" with a ""global reputation for terrorism, narcotics, and transnational crime.""She expressed disbelief that Pakistan, a nation known for these issues, would attack India, the world’s largest democracy, in such a forum.""It is even more extraordinary for a country with a history of rigged elections to talk about political choices in a democracy,"" Mangalanandan said.","India's External affairs minister S Jaishankar tore into Pakistan at the United Nations.

ISLAMABAD: At least 64 people have been killed this week in a fresh outbreak of violence involving the Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan 's militancy-prone Kurram district along the Afghanistan border in the northwest, where a ceasefire had been signed just over a month ago.Governor Faisal Karim Kundi of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said dozens on either side were wounded in the fighting, which continued Friday amid reports of higher casualties than the official figure.Police said the clashes started after the Boshehra Shias of upper Kurram started setting up bunkers on land belonging to the Sunni Ahmadzai community last week. The dispute quickly engulfed other areas and became a full-blown sectarian conflict , they said.In Aug, the warring sides signed a truce after clashes resulted in 50 deaths and injuries to over 200 people.Security officials said the renewed fighting led to closure of roads, triggering a shortage of food, medicines and fuel. Educational institutions have also remained shut for a week.Kurram, a mountainous area that shares a long border with Afghanistan, is home to about 700,000 people, of which more than 42% belong to the Shia community. The district's Parachinar town is one of the few Shia-dominated areas in largely Sunni Pakistan. The region has seen frequent tribal and sectarian clashes in recent years.","At least 64 people killed in fresh outbreak of violence involving Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan's militancy-prone Kurram district.

36 killed in days of clashes between warring tribes in northwest Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/36-killed-in-days-of-clashes-between-warring-tribes-in-northwest-pakistan/articleshow/113702293.cms,"PESHAWAR: At least 36 people have been killed and 80 others injured in clashes between two warring tribes over a piece of land during the last six days in Pakistan 's restive northwestern Kurram district , bordering Afghanistan, police said on Thursday. According to police, the clashes started over a land dispute despite the efforts of the government and tribal elders to calm down the situation.""So far, 36 people have been killed and 80 others injured in clashes during last six days,"" police said.Locals, however, claimed much higher casualty figures.The fighting spread to areas such as Balishkhel, Sadda, Khar Kallay, Peewar and Maqbal in the district, which borders Afghanistan's Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered strongholds of the ISIS and the Pakistan Taliban.In July, at least 50 people were killed and more than 225 injured in week-long clashes between Boshehra and Maleekhel tribes in the same region.A jirga (tribal council) consisting of tribal elders from both sides met with the Deputy Inspector General of Police and Commissioner Kohat to contain the clashes, without much success.The violent clashes entered their sixth consecutive day on Thursday, with fresh exchanges of heavy gunfire across Upper, Lower, and Central tehsils, resulting in six more fatalities and ten injuries.According to police, both sides continue targeting each other with small and large weapons. The intensity of the fighting has led to the closure of the Parachinar-Peshawar main road and the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border, disrupting transportation and movement.The road blockade has caused a shortage of essential items, including food, fuel, and medicines, worsening the situation for residents. Both private and public schools in the affected areas, including Parachinar City, have been closed for six days.Deputy Commissioner Javedullah Mehsud said that efforts are ongoing for a ceasefire, with district administration, police, military leadership, and tribal elders working together to bring peace to the region. He said that the Jirga members had been dispatched to different areas to talk with stakeholders.Meanwhile, the Kurram Bar Association has moved a local court over the frequent tribal clashes and lawlessness, which has made the lives of the common people miserable.Kurram, a mountainous area in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that shares a long border with Afghanistan, has witnessed deadly conflicts among tribes and religious groups as well as sectarian clashes and militant attacks in the past.The fighting in July turned into sectarian skirmishes and spread to other areas, including Peewar, Tangi, Balishkhel, Khaar Kalay, Maqbal, Kunj Alizai, Para Chamkani, and Karman. It stopped after the two sides agreed on a peace agreement brokered by Jirga leaders.","At least 36 people have been killed and 80 others injured in clashes between two warring tribes over a piece of land.

Nepal Floods: Nepal's monsoon floods toll reaches 170 as Kathmandu struggles to recover,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepals-monsoon-floods-toll-reaches-170-as-kathmandu-struggles-to-recover/articleshow/113793610.cms,"Nepal's monsoon floods

Residents of Nepal's flood-hit capital returned to their mud-caked homes on Sunday, dealing with the aftermath of devastating floods that have claimed at least 170 lives across the country as per AFP news agency. As monsoon rains battered the Himalayan republic, flash floods and landslides demolished entire neighbourhoods in Kathmandu , injuring several and displacing thousands.Kumar Tamang, a 40-year-old resident of a slum area near a riverbank, described the scene. ""This morning we returned and everything looks different,"" he said. ""We couldn't even open the doors to our house; it was jammed with mud. Yesterday we were afraid that the water would kill us, but today we have no water to clean.""Nepal's Home Ministry reported 170 confirmed fatalities, with an additional 42 individuals still missing. Ministry spokesman Rishi Ram Tiwari claimed that over 3,000 people have been rescued as rescue teams worked tirelessly to clear blocked highways and restore access to the capital.At least 35 of the deceased were killed when a landslide buried three vehicles on a highway south of Kathmandu. The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology reported record rainfall, with one station at Kathmandu airport recording about 240 millimetres (9.4 inches) of rain—the highest since 2002.The Bagmati River and its tributaries overflowed, submerging homes and vehicles as residents battled their way through chest-deep water in search of higher ground. A local resident, Bishnu Maya Shrestha, said, ""We jumped from one roof to another to safety and finally they came with boats to rescue us.""Over 3,000 security personnel were deployed, using helicopters and motorboats to assist in rescue operations amid the disaster. Humanitarian organisations joined the effort, providing supplies and setting up evacuation centres.By Sunday morning, domestic flights had resumed in and out of Kathmandu after weather-related disruptions led to the cancellation of more than 150 departures.

Hindu minority's quest for political representation in Bangladesh as it mulls the idea of a political party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/hindu-minoritys-quest-for-political-representation-in-bangladesh-as-it-mulls-the-idea-of-a-political-party/articleshow/113777936.cms,"Representative image

DHAKA: Hindu community leaders in Bangladesh are advocating the formation of a dedicated political party, reflecting a call for political representation to protect their rights and ensure their safety. Hindu leaders from the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council ( BHBCOP ) and other groups are now discussing the possibility of establishing a separate political party or demanding reserved parliamentary seats.""There are currently three opinions that are being discussed in detail: first, going back to the separate electorate system from 1954; second, establishing a separate political party for Hindus; and third, reserving seats in Parliament for minorities,"" BHBCOP presidium member Kajal Debnath told PTI.The discussions came after the violence against the Hindu community following the resignation of the Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina as prime minister on August 5 following a student movement.Debnath said the data collected by the BHBCOP points to 2,010 incidents of attacks on the Hindu community, ranging from murder and physical assaults to sexual assaults, attacks on temples, and destruction of property.There are no official figures from the Bangladesh government on the number of attacks.""The discussions and exchanges of opinions regarding forming a political party are at the top of our priority. Although nothing has been finalised, let's see how it pans out,"" said Ranjan Karmakar, a leader from the Hindu community.""The proposed political party could serve as a critical vehicle for change, ensuring their concerns are represented and addressed,"" he pointed out.Historically, Hindus made up about 22 per cent of Bangladesh's population during the 1971 Liberation War, but today they represent only approximately 8 per cent.The community members attributed this decrease in the Hindu population to socio-political marginalisation and sporadic violence, intensifying the urgency for political mobilisation.However, Debnath said that forming a party for Hindus may not work in favour of minorities, as it might divide the secular votes and not result in victory.""The Hindu population is scattered across Bangladesh. In some areas, it comprises 35 per cent of the voters, while in most places it is 6-8 per cent of the voters. Those Hindu leaders from the Awami League who won in the last election garnered both Hindu votes and votes from Awami League supporters of other communities.""""But if the same person contests as a candidate of a Hindu party, he or she may not be able to garner votes from other communities. So, the goal of sending representatives to Parliament won't be served,"" he said.There are different opinions within the community on whether to form a separate political party or to collaborate with existing secular parties.""We must focus on our common goals. Only by standing united can we make a significant impact. This is our moment to rise and reclaim our place in the political landscape. But as a large section of Hindus are identified with the Awami League, we too are facing attacks,"" said Gobinda Chandra Pramanik, also general secretary of the Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mohajote.Debnath said that reserving parliamentary seats similar to how it is done for women could be a solution.The demand for reservations is not new, as the government has previously allocated seats for women in both national and local politics, and Hindu community leaders argue that similar reservations for Hindus would give them a platform to influence policies that directly impact their safety and rights.""If we have representatives in Parliament, they can actively advocate for our safety, security, and cultural preservation. Without representation, we risk being forgotten in political discussions, left to navigate a hostile environment alone,"" he said.Another BHBCOP presidium member, who did not wish to be named, said that the political parties - whether the Awami League, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), or the Jatiya Party - have failed the Hindu minorities in the country since its birth following the Liberation War of 1971.""Since 1971, minorities have failed to feature in the political discourse of the country. This is mainly because minorities have depended on mainstream political parties, who have time and again failed us, except when reaching out to us during elections,"" he said.Historically, the Awami League, recognised for its secular stance, received substantial support from Hindus, but the sudden power vacuum after Hasina's ouster resulted in a wave of violence in which businesses of the minority community were vandalised, properties destroyed and temples desecrated, leaving many in the community feeling vulnerable and disenfranchised.Muhammad Yunus, the interim government's Chief Adviser, downplayed the severity of the violence against Hindus, characterising it as politically motivated rather than communal and suggesting that the attacks stemmed from political upheaval due to the perception that most Hindus supported the now-deposed Awami League regime.""This issue has several dimensions. When the country went through an upheaval following the atrocities by (Sheikh) Hasina and the Awami League, those who were with them also faced attacks,"" the Nobel laureate told PTI during an interview earlier this month.Yunus had described the attacks as ""political in nature and not communal.""Leaders of BHBCOP had met Yunus after he took charge on August 8 and submitted a memorandum requesting him to ensure the stopping of attacks on Hindus.Political analyst Zillur Rehman expressed doubts about the number of attacks on Hindus given by the BHBCOP but asserted that the proposal of reservation of seats in parliament can be discussed.""Right now a process is on to relook at our Constitution so this idea of allocation of parliamentary seats for the minorities can be discussed and debated. But the idea of forming a new political party won't be feasible in the binary of BNP and Awami League,"" he said.","Hindu community leaders in Bangladesh are advocating the formation of a dedicated political party. Hindus made up about 22 per cent of Bangladesh's population during the 1971 Liberation War, but today they represent only approximately 8 per cent. There are different opinions within the community on whether to form a separate political party or to collaborate with existing secular parties.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113777960,imgsize-1273400,width-400,resizemode-4/113777960.jpg"
