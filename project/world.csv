North Korea flies trash-carrying balloons to South Korea in another retaliation against leafletting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-flies-trash-carrying-balloons-to-south-korea-in-another-retaliation-against-leafletting/articleshow/110830799.cms,"SEOUL: North Korea flew hundreds of trash-carrying balloons to South Korea again in its third such campaign since late May, the South's military said, just days after South Korean activists floated their own balloons to scatter propaganda leaflets in the North.North Korea has so far sent more than 1,000 balloons to drop tons of trash and manure in the South in retaliation against South Korean civilian leafletting campaigns, adding to tensions between the war-divided rivals amid a diplomatic stalemate over the North's nuclear ambitions.In response, South Korea suspended a 2018 tension-easing agreement with North Korea. The move allows the South to restart live-fire military exercises and anti-North Korean propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts in border areas, actions that are certain to anger North Korea and prompt it to take its own retaliatory military steps.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the North launching around 330 balloons toward the South since Saturday night and about 80 were found in South Korean territory as of Sunday morning. The military said winds were blowing eastward on Saturday night, which possibly caused many balloons to float away from South Korean territory.The South's military said the balloons that did land dropped trash, including plastic and paper waste, but no hazardous substances were discovered.The military, which has mobilized chemical rapid response and explosive clearance units to retrieve the North Korean balloons and materials, alerted the public to beware of falling objects and not to touch balloons found on the ground but report them to police or military authorities.Saturday's balloon launches by North Korea were the third of their kind since May 28. In North Korea's previous two rounds of balloon activities, South Korean authorities discovered about 1,000 balloons that were tied to vinyl bags containing manure, cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, waste batteries and waste papers. Some were popped and scattered on roads, residential areas and schools. No highly dangerous materials were found and no major damage has been reported.The North's vice defense minister, Kim Kang Il, later said his country would stop the balloon campaign but threatened to resume it if South Korean activists sent leaflets again.In defiance of the warning, a South Korean civilian group led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak, said it launched 10 balloons from a border town on Thursday carrying 200,000 anti-North Korean leaflets, USB sticks with K-pop songs and South Korean dramas, and $1 U.S. bills. South Korean media reported another activist group also flew balloons with 200,000 propaganda leaflets toward North Korea on Friday.South Korean officials called the North Korean trash balloon launches and other recent provocations as ""absurd, irrational"" and vowed strong retaliation.North Korea is extremely sensitive to South Korean civilian leafletting campaigns and front-line propaganda broadcasts as it forbids access to foreign news for most of its 26 million people. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a third generation of his family to rule North Korea with an iron fist since 1948.Experts say North Korea's balloon campaign is also meant to cause a divide in South Korea over its conservative government's tough approach on North Korea.Liberal lawmakers, some civic groups and front-line residents in South Korea have called on the government to urge leafleting activists to stop flying balloons to avoid unnecessary clashes with North Korea. But government officials haven't made such an appeal in line with last year's constitutional court ruling that struck down a law criminalizing an anti-North Korea leafletting as a violation of free speech.","North Korea has so far sent more than 1,000 balloons to drop tons of trash and manure in the South. South Korea suspended a 2018 tension-easing agreement with North Korea. The move allows the South to restart live-fire military exercises and anti-North Korean propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110830839,imgsize-1655606,width-400,resizemode-4/110830839.jpg"
Haiti's new prime minister hospitalized days after being selected to lead country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/haitis-new-prime-minister-hospitalized-days-after-being-selected-to-lead-country/articleshow/110830695.cms,"PORT-AU-PRINCE: Haiti's newly selected prime minister, Garry Conille , was hospitalized late Saturday in the capital of Port-au-Prince just days after arriving in the country, the government said.It wasn't immediately known why Conille was hospitalized.The office of the prime minister said in a statement that Conille was feeling slightly unwell ""following a week of intense activities."" It did not provide further details except to say that Conille was stable and that he thanked those who visited him and wished him well.Louis Gerald Gilles, a member of the transitional presidential council that recently chose Conille as leader of the troubled Caribbean country, told The Associated Press that he was at the hospital but unable to provide further information.A person close to Conille, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, told AP that he was with the prime minister when he noticed Conille appeared to have trouble breathing. The person said he called high-ranking officials and told them Conille needed to be taken to the hospital.A spokesman for Conille did not return messages for comment.AP journalists observed high-ranking officials entering the hospital, including Frantz Elbe, director of Haiti's National Police. Also present was Bruno Maes, Unicef's representative in Haiti.A handful of curious onlookers gathered outside the hospital as authorities blocked the street with tinted-glass SUVs.Conille was chosen as prime minister May 28 after a convoluted selection process. He faces an arduous task as Haiti's newest leader, including quelling widespread gang violence as the country prepares for the U.N.-backed deployment of a Kenyan police force, a move that was delayed in part because Haiti lacked a premier after former Prime Minister Ariel Henry stepped down April 25.Henry was on an official visit to Kenya when gangs launched coordinated attacks Feb. 29, burning police stations, shooting at the country's main international airport and storming Haiti's two biggest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates. The violence left Henry locked out of the country and eventually led to his resignation.Conille arrived in Haiti on June 1, having worked outside the country until recently as UNICEF's regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, a post he assumed in January 2023. He previously served as Haiti's prime minister from October 2011 to May 2012 under then President Michel Martelly.Conille has been meeting with multiple officials and visiting various parts of Port-au-Prince since arriving, including climbing into an armored vehicle wearing a helmet and flak jacket to go along on a patrol with officers from Haiti's National Police.Earlier Saturday, Conille toured Haiti's main international airport, which recently reopened after gang violence forced it to close for nearly three months. On Friday, he met with leaders of the private business sector as well as the country's two telecommunications companies.Conille also had been meeting regularly with the transitional council as they debated who should be appointed to Haiti's new Cabinet.","Garry Conille was feeling slightly unwell ""following a week of intense activities,"" the prime minister's office said.

Cargo ship hit by missile in Gulf of Aden in suspected attack by Yemen Houthi rebels.

A second missile fired at the ship missed and people ""on board small boats in the vicinity opened fire on the ship during the incident,"" Ambrey added, though no one was hurt onboard.The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center similarly reported an attack late Saturday in the same area off Aden, but provided no further details.Suspicion for the attack immediately fell on the Houthis. The rebels did not immediately claim the assault, though it can sometimes take hours or even days for them to acknowledge their attacks.The Houthis, who seized Yemen's capital nearly a decade ago and have been fighting a Saudi-led coalition since shortly after, have been targeting shipping throughout the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. They say the attacks are aimed at stopping the war and supporting the Palestinians, though the attacks often target vessels that have nothing to do with the conflict.The war in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there, while hundreds of others have been killed in Israeli operations in the West Bank. It began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration. A US-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say.But while gaining more attention internationally, the secretive group has cracked down at dissent at home. Eleven Yemeni employees of United Nations agencies and others working for aid groups have been detained by the Houthis under unclear circumstances, as the rebels face increasing financial pressure and airstrikes from the US-led coalition. The rebels also recently sentenced 44 people to death.","A missile struck an Antigua and Barbuda-flagged cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden on Sunday.

Aid deliveries to Gaza resume through rebuilt pier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/aid-deliveries-to-gaza-resume-through-rebuilt-pier/articleshow/110829893.cms,"Ceasefire 'essential'

'Challenges remain'

Humanitarian aid began trickling back into the devastated Gaza Strip on Saturday via a rebuilt, temporary pier, US forces said.The pier, built by the US military to boost the delivery of direly needed relief supplies, was only briefly operational before it suffered storm damage at the end of May. After repairs, the pipeline was reestablished on Friday.Crews delivered about 492 tonnes (1.1 million pounds) of ""much needed humanitarian assistance"" via the pier on Saturday morning, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) wrote in a social media post.Aid groups and the United Nations have accused Israel of delaying the entry of water, food, medicines and fuel into Gaza, depriving the territory's 2.4 million people of lifesaving supplies.The resumption of the pier comes the same day that Israel mounted an operation in central Gaza to rescue four hostages from a refugee camp where a Hamas-run media office reported the attacks killed 210 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more.CENTCOM stressed that the pier, its personnel and assets were in no way connected to the hostage rescue operation.The Israeli military said the four hostages, who were in ""good medical condition"", had been kidnapped from the Nova music festival during Hamas's October 7 attack that sparked the war, now in its ninth month.Noa Argamani, 26, Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 41, had been rescued from two separate buildings ""in the heart of Nuseirat"" camp in a ""complex daytime operation"", the military said.They are among seven captives that Israeli forces have freed alive since Palestinian militants seized 251 people in their October attack on southern Israel.There are now 116 hostages remaining in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.Footage posted on social media showed beachgoers erupting into cheers in Tel Aviv when a lifeguard announced the news.""We have had these hostages in our thoughts for every day for the better part of a year now -- to have even a few of them rescued against all odds, it means the world,"" 42-year-old Israeli Uriya Bekenstein told AFP.In Gaza, the Hamas media office said ""the number of victims from the Israeli occupation's massacre in the Nuseirat camp has risen to 210 martyrs and more than 400 wounded"".Israeli police said an officer was mortally wounded during the rescue operation.It was carried out despite growing international pressure on Israel after a deadly strike on a UN-run school in Nuseirat where displaced Gazans were sheltering.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced regular protests demanding a ceasefire deal to bring the captives home, with demonstrators rallying again on Saturday in Tel Aviv.""Noa (Argamani) is home! We want all of them!"" read one banner at the protest.On Saturday Netanyahu pledged to return the rest of the captives.His office also released a video of him speaking with Argamani on a mobile telephone.She said she was ""very excited"" to return home, adding: ""I haven't spoken Hebrew in such a long time.""US President Joe Biden welcomed the rescue operation, saying: ""We won't stop working until all the hostages are home and a ceasefire is reached. That's essential to happen.""He was speaking in Paris alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, who said: ""We rejoice at the release of the four Israeli hostages.""Near Nuseirat on Saturday, an photographer saw scores of Palestinians fleeing the Bureij camp on foot, fearing further Israeli strikes.The operation came days after the Israeli strike on the Nuseirat school run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, which a Gaza hospital said had killed 37 people and the military said targeted ""terrorists"".UNRWA condemned Israel for striking a facility it said had been housing 6,000 displaced people.Israel accuses Hamas and its allies in Gaza of using civilian infrastructure, including UN-run facilities, as operational centres, charges the militants deny.The war has brought widespread devastation to Gaza, with one in 20 people dead or wounded, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.4 million inhabitants are displaced.Gaza City resident Yussef al-Dalu said his neighbour's house had been reduced to rubble in an overnight air strike. Emergency services reported five dead.""Only defenceless civilians live in this house who are not part of any resistance (group),"" Dalu told AFP.The Hamas attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 36,801 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.Israel faces growing diplomatic isolation, with international court cases accusing it of war crimes and several European countries recognising a Palestinian state.Thousands of people marched through London on Saturday calling for a ceasefire, and demonstrators gathered outside the White House to protest against Washington's support for Israel amid Gaza's deadliest-ever war.Facing political pressure, Netanyahu called on war cabinet minister Benny Gantz to ""not leave the emergency government"" after threats last month to quit unless a post-war plan for Gaza was approved by June 8.Gantz had earlier cancelled a news conference scheduled for Saturday where Israeli media had speculated he would announce his resignation.In brief remarks on Israeli television, Gantz on Saturday evening urged his colleagues in government to ""look responsibly"" into ""how we can continue from here"".Efforts to mediate the first ceasefire in the conflict since a week-long pause in November appear to have stalled after Biden offered the latest plan for a multi-phase truce and hostage release.Major sticking points include Hamas insisting on a permanent truce and full Israeli withdrawal from all parts of Gaza -- demands Israel has rejected.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Israel and key regional partners Egypt, Jordan and Qatar from Monday.",U.S. forces deliver 492 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Gaza via a rebuilt pier.

'Shaken' Danish PM cancels appointments after street attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/shaken-danish-pm-cancels-appointments-after-street-attack/articleshow/110829358.cms,"'Despicable act'

COPENHAGEN: Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Saturday cancelled her appointments after suffering a whiplash injury in a street attack that left her ""shaken"".Frederiksen's office told AFP that she he had been taken to a hospital for a check-up after the attack on Friday evening in a Copenhagen square.The assault has caused a ""minor whiplash injury,"" it said, adding that the prime minister was ""otherwise safe but shaken by the incident"" and her Saturday schedule had been cancelled.French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday became the latest European leader to denounce the attack as ""unacceptable"", in a statement on X.""I strongly condemn this act and wish Mette Frederiksen a speedy recovery,"" Macron added.Danish police on Saturday said ""a 39-year-old man will be brought before the Copenhagen district court for questioning"" to decide if he is to be remanded in custody.The hearing is expected at 1:00 pm (1100 GMT) and would be held in Frederiksberg in Copenhagen, they added.Two witnesses, Marie Adrian and Anna Ravn, told newspaper BT they had seen Frederiksen arrive at the square while they were sitting by a nearby fountain, just before 6:00 pm on Friday.""A man came by in the opposite direction and gave her a hard shove on the shoulder, causing her to fall to the side,"" the two women told the newspaper.They added that while it was a ""strong push"", Frederiksen did not hit the ground.They described the man as tall and slim, and said he had tried to hurry away but had not got far before being grabbed and pushed to the ground by men in suits.The attack was widely condemned by leading European politicians, including EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who said it was a ""despicable act which goes against everything we believe and fight for in Europe.""In 2019, Frederiksen became the country's youngest prime minister, and kept the post after emerging victorious in the 2022 general election.The incident follows a spate of attacks on politicians from across the political spectrum at work or on the campaign trail in Germany ahead of this week's EU elections -- with Danes headed to the polls for their vote on Sunday.On May 15, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was shot four times at close range as he greeted supporters after a government meeting in the central town of Handlova.Fico, who survived the assassination attempt, was taken to a hospital in a nearby city after the shooting, where he underwent two lengthy surgeries.On Saturday, Fico published a photo of him voting in hospital in the European elections and blasted the West for fomenting tensions with Russia.""I voted in hospital"", the 59-year-old said, adding: ""It is necessary to elect European members of parliament who back peace initiatives and not war"".","Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen suffered a whiplash injury in a street attack.

French President Macron hosts Joe Biden as two leaders try to move past trade tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/french-president-macron-hosts-joe-biden-as-two-leaders-try-to-move-past-trade-tensions/articleshow/110829086.cms,"PARIS: President Joe Biden is being feted by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit Saturday as the two allies aim to show off their partnership on global security issues and move past trade tensions . Biden and Macron attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday and met separately the following day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris. The leaders both used those engagements to underscore the urgent need to support Kyiv's fight against Russia's invasion.But Macron and Biden have often chafed at the pace of support for Ukraine, especially as the United States, by far the largest contributor to Kyiv's defence, was forced to pause aid shipments for months while congressional Republicans held up an assistance package.The state visit began with a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, including a wreath-laying at France's tomb of the unknown soldier, and a military parade along the Champs-Elysees leading to the Elysee Palace, where the two held official meetings and were delivering public statements. Later, there is a state dinner at the palace for Biden and his wife, Jill.""Proud to be here,"" Biden said at the Arc de Triomphe. ""A great honour.""Biden hosted Macron in December 2022 at the White House for the first state visit of his presidency as the Covid-19 pandemic receded.Jill Biden flew back to Paris aboard a US government plane after spending Friday in Delaware to support their son, Hunter Biden, who is standing trial on federal gun charges.As the president's trip draws to a close, the far right is likely to emerge as one of the biggest winners in Sunday's European Parliament election while Macron's pro-European Union movement is flagging.A top French official said Macron and Biden have a friendly and warm relationship and stressed that the US president is spending five days in France, reflecting the importance he attaches to the visit. The official spoke anonymously, in line with customary practices for Macron's office.The official said the US presidential campaign was not a factor in the discussion.Macron hosted then-President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee this year, for Bastille Day in 2017, and he came to Washington for a state visit in 2018 before their relationship soured.US and French officials said Ukraine would be at the top of Saturday's agenda, but the centrepiece of the weekend event would be the strength of the alliance, fortified at Normandy 80 years ago, but with roots far deeper.""It's probably a good thing for us to remember that we didn't win our independence either without some foreign help or foreign assistance, specifically from France,"" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Friday.Max Bergmann, a former US State Department official who leads Europe research at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the US-French relationship is strong despite occasional disagreements.""There's always tension in Franco-American relations because the French try to do stuff,"" he said. ""They're bold, they throw up proposals, and that leads to some friction when we push back.""For example, he said, France proposed putting Western trainers on the ground in Ukraine, leading to questions of whether this is ""really giving Ukraine a major, tangible benefit"" or has the ""potential to be escalatory and dangerous.""Regarding Macron, Bergmann said, ""he's the one that pushes the boundaries and throws up ideas.""Kirby said the two leaders would have an announcement Saturday on deepening maritime law enforcement cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. They also were to discuss economic and climate challenges.While praising the Biden administration's commitment to supporting Ukraine, Macron said earlier this year that Europe must become ""capable of defending its interests, with its allies by our side whenever they are willing, and alone if necessary,"" arguing the continent should rely less on the US for its own defence.He also warned Western powers against showing any signs of weakness to Russia as he repeatedly said that sending Western troops into Ukraine to shore up its defence should not be ruled out.The leaders were also set to discuss their efforts to bring about a cease-fire to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, as the US and Israel await Hamas' response to a Biden-promoted cease-fire proposal that would allow a surge of humanitarian assistance into the territory.Macron is expected to raise US trade practices that he has often criticised, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which favours American-made climate technology such as electric vehicles. Macron said the US, like China, has ""decided not to respect the rules of global trade"" by shoring up protections and subsidies while Europe's industry remains open and is stuck in overregulation.The French official said Europe has to defend European interests, after watching the US do the same with its own, but said Macron hopes to find a mutually acceptable outcome.Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said trade with China is a sticking point between the US and Europe, particularly France. The US has been more eager to restrict trade, particularly regarding technology.Biden is also moving toward tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and batteries, which could affect European cars that include Chinese parts.Overall, Hufbauer said, ""Europe wants to maintain much more trade with China than the US wants.""",President Joe Biden is being feted by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit.

Watch: Sunita Williams dances upon reaching International Space Station after Starliner mission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-sunita-williams-dances-upon-reaching-international-space-station-after-starliner-mission/articleshow/110781478.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Boeing Starliner , piloted by Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore, successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday. This mission marks a historic milestone as Williams becomes the first woman to pilot and test a new crewed spacecraft on its maiden voyage.Upon arrival, Williams celebrated her third trip to the ISS with a joyful dance, a gesture of her excitement and happiness. She was warmly welcomed by the seven astronauts aboard the station, who greeted her and Wilmore with the traditional ringing of a bell. Describing the crew as ""another family,"" Williams expressed her gratitude for the warm reception.After launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, the spacecraft docked with the ISS 26 hours later, despite a one-hour delay due to minor technical issues such as helium leaks. The mission's primary objective was to validate the Boeing Starliner as a viable alternative to the SpaceX Crew Module for ferrying astronauts under NASA's commercial crew program.The astronauts monitored the Starliner as it autonomously navigated a series of maneuvers to dock with the ISS. They also completed crucial tests, including manually flying the spacecraft for the first time in space. During their week-long stay, Williams and Wilmore will assist with tests and conduct scientific experiments.Reflecting on the mission, Williams said, ""It feels like going back home."" She is known for previously carrying an idol of Lord Ganesh and the Bhagavad Gita to space. Before liftoff, Williams, who helped design the Starliner, admitted to some pre-launch nerves but expressed excitement about the spacecraft she had named ""Calypso"" after the ship of the famed French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau.The astronauts' return journey will conclude with a landing on solid ground, unlike previous missions that ended with ocean landings.","The Boeing Starliner successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday.

"Rio Grande: After 34 million years, scientists discover Antarctica's lost river",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/rio-grande-after-34-million-years-scientists-discover-antarcticas-lost-river/articleshow/110775221.cms,"A recently discovered ancient river in Antarctica , referred to as the Rio Grande , is providing new insights into the continent's climatic history. This groundbreaking find is crucial for understanding how climate change has shaped the landscape over millions of years.The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Arizona , led by geoscientist Dr Stewart Jamieson. ""The Rio Grande is unlike anything we have seen in Antarctica,"" Dr Jamieson said. ""This river system was buried under ice for millions of years and offers a unique window into the past.""The Rio Grande, which rivals some of the world's largest rivers, was identified through satellite imagery and radar data. The river's channels stretch over 680 miles, and it likely played a significant role in transporting water and sediment across the continent during a warmer period in Earth's history, a Newsweek report.The presence of the Rio Grande suggests that Antarctica once had a much milder climate, with conditions that could support flowing water. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the continent's glacial history and indicates that parts of Antarctica may have been ice-free during certain periods.""The implications of this discovery are profound,"" said Dr Jamieson. ""It changes our understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet and its stability. Knowing that such a large river system existed implies that the ice sheet was much smaller than we thought.""The research team plans to conduct further studies to determine the age of the river system and the climatic conditions that allowed it to form. These investigations could provide valuable data for predicting future changes in the Antarctic ice sheet in response toglobal warming .The discovery of the Rio Grande also raises questions about the potential for similar hidden river systems in other parts of Antarctica. ""We are just scratching the surface,"" Dr Jamieson noted. ""There could be other river systems buried beneath the ice, waiting to be discovered.""As climate change continues to impact the polar regions, understanding the history of Antarctica's ice and water systems becomes increasingly important. The findings from the Rio Grande will help scientists develop more accurate models of ice sheet dynamics and sea-level rise.This discovery highlights the importance of continued exploration and research in Antarctica. It underscores the need for international collaboration to uncover the secrets of this remote and largely unexplored continent.","The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Arizona.

Iran helicopter crash shows Tehran's reliance on an aging fleet as well as its challenges at home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-helicopter-crash-shows-tehrans-reliance-on-an-aging-fleet-as-well-as-its-challenges-at-home/articleshow/110813054.cms,"DUBAI, By the time Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi boarded his window seat on a helicopter ferrying him, the foreign minister and six others, thick clouds already had begun forming around the mountaintops along the Azerbaijan-Iran border. Despite the worsening weather, the helicopter lifted off for a trip about 145 kilometers (90 miles) southwest to a new oil pipeline near Tabriz.Within an hour, the Bell 212 helicopter had crashed into a cloud-covered mountainside.While the cause of the May 19 crash remains unknown, the sudden death of the hard-line protege of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei exposed the contradictions and challenges facing the country's Shiite theocracy.The Iranian military investigators probing the crash have previously faced international criticism over their report on troops shooting down a Ukrainian airliner in 2020. The hourslong desperate rescue attempt after the helicopter crash saw Tehran even reach out to the United States for help, just weeks after launching an unprecedented attack on Israel and as it enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. Even the type of helicopter that crashed links back to Iranian history, both before and after the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution.""Iran is a culture of dualities,"" said Farzin Nadimi, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy who studies Iran's military. ""Some aspects, they seem so good and well-managed, well-oiled and very capable. ... In many levels, it's quite lacking.""Iranian military investigators have released two statements on the crash, largely ruling out possibilities rather than offering a suspected cause. They've rejected the possibility of an onboard ""explosion caused by sabotage"" or a ""cyberattack"" targeting the Bell 212, a two-blade, twin-engine helicopter more widely known as the Huey for its use by the US military in the Vietnam War.""The recorded conversations between the flight crew show that the last contact with the pilots up to the time of the incident and when they stopped responding lasted 69 seconds,"" the investigators said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. ""No emergency declaration was recorded during that time.""In conspiracy-minded Iran, some officials still insist foul play could have caused the crash. However, some other officials have begun to ask why the helicopter took off from the site of the new Giz Galasi Dam when the weather had started to turn.Mostafa Mirsalim, a member of the country's Expediency Council, wrote on the social platform X that he had asked prosecutors to ""address the mistakes that led to the loss of the president and his delegation,"" without elaborating.Abbas Abdi, a prominent journalist, also wrote on X that the flight path taken by Raisi's helicopter suggested the pilot didn't follow a standard Iranian practice of shadowing main roads in rural areas. That can both help navigation and provide a safe landing area in an emergency. Former Iranian Presidents Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Abolhassan Banisadr both survived helicopter crashes while in office.The helicopter involved in the crash, nearly 30 years old, came directly from a Bell manufacturing plant in Montreal, Canada, to the Iranian air force, according to data from the firm Cirium. It counts 12 Bell 212 aircraft registered in Iran that are still in service.Bell Textron Inc. , based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it ""does not conduct any business in Iran or support their helicopter fleet, and we do not have knowledge about the active state of the helicopter involved in this accident.""But despite being decades old, the Bell 212 and its military counterpart the Huey still are flown around the world. In the United States, Hueys still fly as part of America's nuclear forces to support its silos and for some VIP missions, said Roger D. Connor, an aeronautics curator at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington. Over 440 still fly worldwide, according to Cirium.""It's a simple aircraft to fly by medium helicopter standards. It doesn't typically have much automation which can have both positive and negative implications for operators,"" Connor said. ""More automation means more opportunities for pilot confusion in certain circumstances, but also better capabilities in low-visibility conditions.""Iran's use of the Bell 212 remains pervasive, in part due to the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who struck deals to purchase hundreds of the helicopters and had plans to build a local variant, Nadimi said. Those already in the country at the time of the Islamic Revolution ended up being a key component of Iran's bloody war against Iraq in the 1980s.But as Western sanctions dried up the supply of parts, fewer of the aircraft were airworthy, despite efforts to locally overhaul them. That saw Iran engage in covert means to secure parts, sparking several U.S. criminal cases for those involved, who sought everything from safety equipment to full engines and night-vision goggles for the aircraft.Former Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sought to blame sanctions for the crash. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller responded by saying America was ""not going to apologize for our sanctions regime at all"" as Iran has used aircraft to ""transport equipment to support terrorism.""""Ultimately, it's the Iranian government that is responsible for the decision to fly a ... helicopter in what was described as poor weather conditions, not any other actor,"" Miller said.Meanwhile, questions remain over why Iran couldn't find the helicopter for hours, even though one of the victims reportedly talked by cellphone with officials. Such calls, in theory, can be triangulated by security services. Also, it remains unclear if the helicopter had any emergency trackers, which are common on aircraft.While the investigation continues, Nadimi said he believed that the Bell 212 that flew Raisi did not have advanced avionics that could have been useful for low-visibility flight. However, he stressed that the major issue in the crash likely involves who allowed the flight to take off as the weather turned poor and whether the pilot faced pressure from his VIP passengers to make the journey no matter what.""Pilot error, human error might be to blame, but there was a chain of events that caused this crash, not just pilot error,"" Nadimi said. ""That helicopter should have been able to clear that terrain and fly safely to its destination. They should not have been dispatched for flying.""","Iranian military investigators have released two statements on the crash. They've rejected the possibility of an onboard ""explosion caused by sabotage"" or a ""cyberattack"" The helicopter involved in the crash, nearly 30 years old, came directly from a Bell manufacturing plant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110813717,imgsize-52934,width-400,resizemode-4/110813717.jpg"

Pakistan's Punjab Assembly allows lawmakers to use of Punjabi language in house,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-punjab-assembly-allows-lawmakers-to-use-of-punjabi-language-in-house/articleshow/110783754.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Lawmakers in Pakistan 's Punjab Assembly would now be able to speak in at least four indigenous languages , including Punjabi, in the house apart from English and Urdu after an amendment was made. A special committee of the Punjab Assembly, led by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan , approved on Thursday amendments allowing lawmakers to address the House in Punjabi, Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati in addition to English and Urdu, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.

Previously a member needed permission from the Speaker to use any language other than English and Urdu, which was not always granted.

The amendment in the assembly rules aimed to enhance accessibility for constituents who speak these languages, fostering a more representative and responsive legislative body, while the change reflects the multilingual nature of the province, enabling legislators to communicate and fully participate in legislative discussions effectively.

The Speaker stated that recognising and incorporating regional languages into official proceedings also demonstrates cultural respect and acknowledgement of the linguistic heritage of Punjab, thereby strengthening the connection between the Assembly and the people.

There is a controversy over whether Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati are just dialects of Punjabi and separate languages. Those using them consider that these were separate languages but hardcore Punjabi brand them as dialects.","Lawmakers in Pakistan's Punjab Assembly would now be able to speak in at least four indigenous languages.

Putin issues dire warning to countries aiding Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-issues-dire-warning-to-countries-aiding-ukraine/articleshow/110775363.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stark warning to countries assisting Ukraine, signaling severe consequences for those who continue to support Kyiv in its ongoing conflict with Moscow. In a public address on Friday, Putin cautioned, ""Anyone who tries to intervene in the Ukraine war will be met with 'lightning-fast' retaliation."" This statement underscores the escalating tensions in the region as international support for Ukraine remains strong.Speaking from the Kremlin , Putin emphasized Russia 's readiness to respond decisively to any foreign involvement. ""We have all the instruments for this, ones that no one can boast of now,"" he stated. ""We will use them if we have to. I want everyone to know that."" The Russian leader's remarks were broadcast during a meeting with lawmakers in St. Petersburg, reflecting his unwavering stance on the Ukraine conflict.Putin's comments come as Ukraine continues to receive significant military and economic aid from Western nations, particularly the United States and European Union countries. This support has been crucial for Ukraine's defense efforts against the Russian invasion, which began in February 2022. Despite international sanctions and diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict, Russia's military actions have persisted, leading to widespread devastation and loss of life.The Russian president's address included a veiled reference to Russia's nuclear capabilities, although he did not explicitly mention nuclear weapons. The warning aligns with previous threats made by Russian officials, who have suggested that any significant interference could escalate to a nuclear confrontation.In response to Putin's warning, NATO and allied countries have reiterated their commitment to supporting Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated, ""Our support for Ukraine remains steadfast. We will not be deterred by threats, and we continue to stand united in defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty.""The international community remains divided on how best to address the conflict. While Western nations continue to supply arms and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Russia has condemned these actions as provocations and escalations. Putin's recent rhetoric suggests that any further support for Ukraine could trigger a severe and unpredictable reaction from Russia.The conflict in Ukraine has drawn global attention, with numerous calls for peace negotiations and ceasefires. However, diplomatic efforts have so far failed to produce a lasting resolution. The war has caused a significant humanitarian crisis, displacing millions and creating widespread instability in the region.As the situation continues to evolve, the risk of further escalation looms large. Analysts warn that Putin's latest comments could signal a new phase in the conflict, with potentially far-reaching implications for global security.""We are at a critical juncture,"" said military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer. ""The stakes are incredibly high, and any misstep could lead to a wider confrontation.""With tensions running high, the international community is watching closely for any signs of escalation or attempts at de-escalation. Putin's warning serves as a reminder of the volatile nature of the conflict and the challenges ahead in finding a path to peace.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stark warning to countries assisting Ukraine.

His arrival was meant to address financial struggles and a significant drop in digital readership since 2020.Recently, Lewis implemented a restructuring plan at the Post, which led to the exit of Sally Buzbee , the top news executive, who had led the newsroom for three years. Buzbee has not commented on her departure.According to The New York Times, Lewis advised Buzbee not to cover a development in Prince Harry's litigation related to the phone hacking scandal. Allegations in the civil case suggest that Lewis played a role in concealing the scandal by destroying evidence, which he denies. The Post later published the story, and Lewis has denied pressuring Buzbee not to run it.NPR media reporter David Folkenflik reported that Lewis, prior to joining the Post, offered an exclusive interview in exchange for Folkenflik dropping a story about his involvement in the phone hacking case. Lewis dismissed Folkenflik as an activist, insisting their conversation was off-the-record. Folkenflik refuted this, stating the offer was not off-the-record and emphasizing the importance of his reporting.In a Friday email to staff, Lewis admitted a need to improve communication and invited them to discussions on his restructuring plan, acknowledging lost trust and urging a fresh start.Lewis, who began his career in British journalism , adopted a more aggressive reporting style.

On Friday, temperatures continued to soar past 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) from California to Arizona , following a day of unprecedented heat.Although summer is still two weeks away, about half of Arizona and Nevada were under an excessive heat alert, which the National Weather Service extended through Friday evening. In Las Vegas , where it has never been this hot so early in the year, the alert was extended through Saturday.Temperatures are expected to gradually decrease over the weekend but will remain above average into early next week.Las Vegas set a new record of 111 F (43.8 C) on Thursday, matching the earliest point in the year that the city has reached 110 F (43.3 C). On Friday afternoon, temperatures in Las Vegas climbed to 110 F (48.3 C), breaking another record set in 2013. The National Weather Service warned that it could get even hotter before sunset.In Phoenix, a new record high of 113 F (45 C) on Thursday surpassed the previous record of 111 F (44 C) set in 2016. Forecasters described the conditions as “dangerously hot.”Eleanor Wallace, a 9-year-old visiting Phoenix from northern Utah to celebrate her birthday with a hike, remarked on the intense heat, saying, “It’s so hot.”There have been no immediate reports of heat-related deaths or serious injuries. However, at a campaign rally for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in Phoenix on Thursday, 11 people were hospitalized for heat exhaustion. Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, where the high is expected to reach 104 F (40 C).The National Weather Service predicts slight cooling across the region this weekend, but temperatures in central and southern Arizona and parts of southern Nevada will still hit triple digits, possibly reaching up to 110 F (43 C).Other areas also saw record-breaking heat on Thursday, including Death Valley National Park, where temperatures hit a record 122 F (50 C), surpassing the previous record of 121 F (49.4 C) set in 1996. Records at Death Valley date back to 1911.The heat wave arrived earlier than usual, even in higher-elevation areas typically cooler by about a dozen degrees. Reno, for instance, recorded a high of 98 F (37 C) on Thursday, well above the normal high of 81 F (27 C) for this time of year. Records in Reno date back to 1888.In Phoenix on Thursday, despite the sweltering heat, Oscar Tomasio from Cleveland, Ohio, proposed to his girlfriend, Megan McCracken, during a sunrise hike on Camelback Mountain. They each carried three liters of water, attempting to beat the heat and avoid a trail closure.“It was a grueling hike,” Tomasio told The Associated Press. “It was extra hot, so we started extra early. The views were beautiful. We didn’t make it quite to the top because she was a little nervous with the heat. So I proposed to her when the sun rose.”McCracken noted that they had planned the hike to start at sunrise, waking up around 5 am to try to avoid the intense heat. “Probably not early enough,” she added.(With agency input)","Temperatures continued to soar past 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) from California to Arizona.

Outside her courtroom, international media strain to get a glimpse of members of the first family as they come and go.In her Senate confirmation hearing, Noreika said she admires judges who are prepared and ""willing to listen and give litigants an opportunity to be heard. ... They want to make people feel like they've been listened to and been given a fair shot.""If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.In a written answer to questions about sentencing from now-Vice President Kamala Harris, Noreika said she ""would listen to arguments from the parties, including requests for leniency, and consider statements made by victims. If confirmed, I would do my best to impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary.""'Born in Pittsburgh, the 57-year-old Noreika graduated from Lehigh University in 1988 before earning her master's degree in biology from Columbia University in 1990. She earned her law degree in 1993 from the University of Pittsburgh with magna cum laude honors.Noreika spent the next 25 years at the Delaware law firm of Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell, where she earned partner in 2001. According to her Senate confirmation questionnaire, most of her work was in federal civil litigation involving intellectual property. It said she tried ""at least 30″ cases to verdict or final decision and most were nonjury trials. She also listed no criminal law experience.Asked to list ""all professional business, fraternal scholarly, civic or charitable"" organizations she had belonged to since law school, Noreika answered, ""None.""For pro bono work, Noreika wrote she had spent 15 years as a guardian ad litem for children in Delaware Family Court.""These cases have involved difficult custody issues, including allegations of sexual and physical abuse, neglect and abandonment,"" Noreika wrote. She described ""taking children out to lunch and to dinner and fun activities to get them to engage with me and trust me.""Her position as judge in the Hunter Biden criminal trial put her in the national spotlight and made her a target of speculation over political partisanship.It was Noreika who torpedoed a plea deal that would have settled the gun case when she raised concerns about the terms of the agreement in 2023.Noreika has presided over a Biden-related case before: In March 2023, she dismissed part of a defamation lawsuit brought by the owner of a Delaware computer repair shop where Hunter Biden left his laptop in 2019.Federal campaign finance records show she had donated at least $15,000 to political candidates between 2005-2014, most of it going to Republicans, including current US Sens. Tom Cotton and Mitt Romney. But she also donated to the presidential campaigns of both Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican John McCain in 2008.",District Judge Maryellen Noreika was recommended for the bench by the two Democratic senators. She has a brief history of political donations to both parties - mostly Republicans - and had not worked on criminal cases or presided over a courtroom before getting the nod as a federal judge.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110812357,imgsize-514871,width-400,resizemode-4/110812357.jpg"

France is ... our oldest and one of our deepest allies. And this will be an important moment to affirm that alliance and also look to the future and what we have to accomplish together,"" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters earlier this week.Sullivan said talks between the two men would touch on Russia's war with Ukraine, Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, and policy issues ranging from climate change to artificial intelligence to supply chains.White House spokesperson John Kirby said the countries would announce a plan to work together on maritime law enforcement and the US Coast Guard and French navy would discuss increased cooperation.Biden and Macron are also expected to discuss strengthening Nato, and both have pledged their countries' support for Ukraine, though they have not agreed yet on a plan to use frozen Russian assets to help Kiev. A US treasury official said on Tuesday the United States and its G7 partners were making progress on that.Biden met with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Paris on Friday, apologizing for a months-long delay by the US Congress in approving the latest package of aid, and Zelenskiy addressed France's National Assembly.During a speech at the American Cemetery in Normandy (Sp) on Thursday, the anniversary of the allied assault against Nazi German occupiers on French beaches in World War Two, Biden called on Western powers to stay the course with Ukraine.Macron and Biden will also confer on the situation in the middle east.Biden has been a staunch supporter of Israel, which is pursuing Hamas after it attacked the country in October, but tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths have soured Biden's left-leaning political base on Israel, hurting him as he runs against Republican Donald Trump for re-election in November.Beyond Ukraine, trade issues between the two sides of the Atlantic are likely to loom large.The US Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in August 2022, has incensed European officials; they see it as a protectionist move that siphons off investments from EU companies.Macron said during his state visit to Washington in 2022 that the package of subsidies could ""fragment the West"" and weaken the post-COVID European recovery at a time Washington is seeking allies against China and both sides confront Russia.He and European allies have won little concessions from Washington since, however, and French officials say their aim for this visit is still to try to ""re-synchronise"" the US and EU economic agendas.","French President Emmanuel Macron will host US President Joe Biden on Saturday.

New York governor defends blocking plan that would toll Manhattan drivers to pay for subway repairs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-governor-defends-blocking-plan-that-would-toll-manhattan-drivers-to-pay-for-subway-repairs/articleshow/110811659.cms,"ALBANY: New York governor Kathy Hochul on Friday defended her decision to block a plan to reduce New York City traffic and raise billions for its ailing subway system through a new toll on Manhattan drivers - but offered little detail on how she would replace the program's financial and environmental benefits.In her first public appearance since announcing she was indefinitely pausing the "" congestion pricing "" toll, Hochul maintained the move was driven by economics and conversations with New Yorkers, particularly people at a Manhattan diner she frequents.""I can't do anything right at this time that would also suck the vitality out of this city when we're still fighting for our comeback,"" she told reporters at a news conference announced four minutes before it was set to start Friday night in Albany.Hochul this week suggested raising taxes on businesses to make up for the toll revenue. The proposal immediately sparked criticism that higher taxes would hurt the city's ongoing rebound from COVID-19 and run counter to her rationale for halting the program. Lawmakers eventually rejected the tax hike plan.The governor, who released a pre-recorded video statement on Wednesday pausing the program, had previously been a staunch advocate for the toll and had described it as ""transformative"" as of about two weeks ago.The program was set to begin June 30. It was signed into law by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2019 following years of work from transit and environmental advocates who argued it would result in better public transitand cleaner air in the city. Drivers entering the core of Manhattan would have had to pay a toll of about $15, depending on vehicle type.The Metropolitan Transportation Authority , which would oversee the plan, has already installed cameras, sensors and license plate readers for the program, and reached a contract worth more than $500 million with a private vendor to operate the tolling infrastructure, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office.Overall, revenues from congestion pricing were expected to reach $1 billion per year and finance $15 billion in capital projects for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, many of which are desperately needed upgrades to the city's beleaguered subways.It was not clear from Hochul's remarks how she planned to replace that money. But she told reporters, ""We gave a lot of thought to this.""""No one should question my commitment or the leaders' commitment to ensure that these projects are properly funded,"" the governor said.State lawmakers are set to end their legislative session Friday and do not appear poised to take up legislation to replace the congestion pricing revenue.""Derailing this important program at the last possible moment and asking the legislature to come up with an alternative funding mechanism in less than 48 hours is irresponsible and inconsistent with principles of good governance,"" said Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, a DemocratHochul, at her news conference, said she had the legal authority to halt the law without the approval of the MTA board, saying ""it's not necessary for them to take action"" because she was pausing the plan, not terminating it. She did not make clear if or when she would potentially reinstate the program.Some board members have said they were not briefed before the governor's announcement and were confused about how certain projects would now be funded with the toll on pause.""This was not waking up one day and saying 'let's do this,' "" Hochul said. ""That's not how I operate.""","New York governor Kathy Hochul defends her decision to block a plan to reduce New York City traffic.

"Harvey Weinstein was denied fair trial in appeal of LA rape conviction, says his legal team",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvey-weinstein-lawyers-argue-he-was-denied-fair-trial-in-appeal-of-la-rape-conviction/articleshow/110811603.cms,"NEW DELHI: Harvey Weinstein ’s legal team filed an appeal, asserting that he did not receive a fair trial in his 2022 Los Angeles conviction for rape and sexual assault, which resulted in a 16-year prison sentence.This appeal, submitted to California's second district court of appeal, follows the overturning of his significant 23-year #MeToo conviction in New York by the state's highest court six weeks prior.The appeal argues that the trial judge erred by not allowing evidence that the Italian model and actor he was convicted of raping had a sexual relationship with the director of a film festival that brought Weinstein and the woman to Los Angeles at the time of the alleged incident.Weinstein's lawyers argued that the judge deprived him of ""his constitutional rights to present a defence and led to a miscarriage of justice.""Weinstein’s attorneys argue that the trial judge erred by permitting the jury to learn about Weinstein's prior, now-overturned conviction in New York, and by allowing testimony from women regarding alleged assaults for which he was not charged, which unfairly biased the jury. This type of testimony had also contributed to the overturning of his conviction in New York, where he remains in custody as Manhattan prosecutors prepare for a retrial.""The introduction of this excessive, cumulative, and remote evidence of prior sexual assaults' simply signaled to the jury that the Defendant was a bad man who should be convicted of something irrespective of whether the prosecution proved its case,"" the filing said.In his California trial, Harvey Weinstein faced charges for sexually assaulting four women but was convicted solely for the assault on Evgeniya Chernyshova. Chernyshova testified that Weinstein unexpectedly appeared in her hotel room during the 2013 LA Italia Film Festival.Weinstein's legal team contends that Superior Court Judge Lisa B. Lench wrongly barred them from presenting Facebook messages as evidence, which they argue would have demonstrated that Chernyshova and Pascal Vicedomini, the festival's founder, were not merely friends and colleagues, as they testified, but had a sexual relationship. These messages, according to the defense, would have shown that both were lying under oath and supported the argument that Chernyshova was not in her hotel room but with Vicedomini during the alleged attack.These arguments mirror those presented in a motion for a new trial that Judge Lench had previously denied before sentencing.Weinstein has since enlisted appellate attorneys, including Jennifer Bonjean, a Chicago lawyer noted for her successful appeal that resulted in Bill Cosby's sexual assault conviction being overturned in Pennsylvania.During the trial, Chernyshova was identified only as Jane Doe 1, but she later publicly revealed her identity and consented to being named in reports by the Associated Press through her lawyer.""Weinstein's appeal makes the same tired arguments that he previously made multiple times, without success, to the trial court,"" Chernyshova's attorney, David Ring, said in an email Friday. ""We are of the strong opinion that the trial court vetted the evidence appropriately and made all the correct decisions in its evidentiary rulings. We are confident that Weinstein's appeal will be denied and he will spend many years in prison.""The defense's appeal brief reveals that three jurors have signed affidavits expressing regret over their unanimous guilty verdict. The brief argues that these jurors stated they did not believe Evgeniya Chernyshova and Pascal Vicedomini were romantically involved. They indicated that access to evidence of their relationship would have influenced their judgment on the occurrence of the alleged rape.Weinstein’s attorneys also argue that Chernyshova's lawsuit, filed shortly after the verdict, suggests she may have had financial motives influencing her testimony, and they should have been allowed to question her about these motives during the trial.The defense had initially filed a notice of appeal in April 2023 and, after several extensions, submitted the brief on Friday. The prosecution has until August 6 to respond.","Weinstein’s attorneys argue that the trial judge erred by permitting the jury to learn about Weinstein's prior, now-overturned conviction in New York.

William Anders: Former Apollo 8 astronaut who captured iconic 'Earthrise' photo dies in plane crash at 90,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-apollo-8-astronaut-william-anders-dies-in-plane-crash-at-90/articleshow/110811389.cms,"William Anders, the astronaut who captured the iconic ""Earthrise"" photograph during the historic Apollo 8 mission.

WASHIGTON: William Anders , the astronaut who captured the iconic ""Earthrise"" photograph during the historic Apollo 8 mission, died in a plane crash on Friday at the age of 90, according to his family.Anders was piloting a small aircraft when it went down off the coast of Washington state on Friday morning. His son confirmed to US media that Anders was the sole occupant of the plane. Sheriff Eric Peter stated that search teams were combing the crash site, but no body had been recovered at the time of the report.Anders gained global recognition as part of the Apollo 8 mission in December 1968. He, along with Frank Borman and James Lovell, became one of the first humans to orbit the Moon, completing ten laps around the lunar surface without landing.During one of these orbits, Anders took the ""Earthrise"" photo, which famously shows the Earth rising over the Moon's horizon. The image has been hailed as one of the most significant photographs in history and was featured in Life Magazine's ""100 Photographs that Changed The World."" An original print of the photograph fetched 11,800 euros at a Copenhagen auction in 2022.Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson honored Anders' legacy on social media platform X, stating, ""In 1968, during Apollo 8, Bill Anders offered to humanity among the deepest of gifts an astronaut can give. He traveled to the threshold of the Moon and helped all of us see something else: ourselves. He embodied the lessons and the purpose of exploration. We will miss him.""Born on October 17, 1933, in Hong Kong, Anders graduated from the US Naval Academy and later earned a master's degree in nuclear engineering. After his illustrious career as an astronaut, Anders held several significant government roles, including serving as the first chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and as the US ambassador to Norway. In the early 1990s, he led the defense and aerospace firm General Dynamics as CEO and chairman before retiring.Anders' passing leaves James Lovell, 96, as the last surviving member of the Apollo 8 crew. Lovell, who also played a critical role in the near-catastrophic Apollo 13 mission, remains a revered figure in space exploration history. Frank Borman, the other Apollo 8 astronaut , passed away in November 2023 at the age of 95.The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the last time humans set foot on the Moon. However, Nasa is planning future missions aimed at returning to the lunar surface, including plans to send the first woman and person of color.(With agency inputs)","Anders was piloting a small aircraft when it went down off the coast of Washington state.

Two members of Ahmadi community shot dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-members-of-ahmadi-community-shot-dead/articleshow/110826007.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Two members of the minority Ahmadi community were shot dead in Pakistan ’s central Punjab province on Saturday, days after a vicious campaign was launched against the Supreme Court order releasing a person from the persecuted sect in a 2022 case.

The incident occurred in Sadullapur area of Mandi Bahauddin district.

The victims, a 50-year-old man and another 25 years old, were targeted by an unknown assailant when they were en route to a nearby market.

District police officer Ahmad Mohiuddin said the suspected attacker has been arrested from the same locality and the murder weapon seized. “He was involved in both shootings,” he claimed.

Following the incident, a large police force was deployed in the area.

Police said they first took both bodies into custody and moved them to a local government-run hospital for post-mortem analyses, after which the bodies would be handed over to the victims’ relatives.

There are an estimated four million Ahmadis in Pakistan, a country of over 220 million people. They live in fear in a Muslim majority country due to intimidation and threats of death. A sustained hate campaign has been on against them for decades. The community’s members avoid revealing or speaking about their faith in public.

Over the last few decades, Pakistan’s minority communities have borne the brunt of mob brutality, bomb attacks, arsons, lynchings and other forms of violence. Last month, a district president of the Ahmadi community was killed by unknown assailants.

Shockingly, even children as young as 0-5 years old fell victim to sexual abuse, as reported by Geo News.The report delves into the categorisation of abusers, highlighting that acquaintances remain the primary perpetrators of child sexual abuse, followed by relatives, family members, strangers, and women abettors. Geographically, Punjab reported the highest number of cases, accounting for 75 per cent of the total, followed by 13 per cent in Sindh, 7 per cent in Islamabad, 3 per cent in KP, and 2 per cent in Balochistan, PoK, and GB combined.The report, termed 'Cruel Numbers 2023,' revealed that 91 per cent of the total reported cases were registered with the police, indicating an active role played by law enforcement in addressing the issue. Of the reported cases, 2,021 specifically involved child sexual abuse, with an equal distribution between genders. Shockingly, 61 cases reported murder following sexual abuse, 1,833 cases of abduction, 330 cases of missing children, and 29 cases of child marriages, with 27 cases involving girls and 2 involving boys, according to Geo News.In addition to cases of abuse, NGOs monitored incidents involving children up to 18 years old who suffered injuries or death. Out of 2,184 cases monitored, the highest numbers were attributed to drowning (694), accidents (401), murder (286), torture (121), injuries (111), suicide (110), and deaths from electric shocks (103).The NGO further compiled 'Cruel Numbers 2023' by monitoring 81 national and regional newspapers daily, to present comprehensive data on the situation of violence against children and contribute to existing information on child sexual abuse in Pakistan. The report also seeks to raise awareness and disseminate information about various forms of child sexual abuse across all segments of society, Geo News reported.","A seminary teacher has been arrested for allegedly raping his two minor students and threatening them with dire consequences if they disclosed the assault.

Imran Khan takes responsibility for '1971 tweet' but denies knowledge of associated video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khan-takes-responsibility-for-1971-tweet-but-denies-knowledge-of-associated-video/articleshow/110816058.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan stepped forward to accept accountability for a controversial tweet likening the current political landscape to the fall of Dhaka in 1971, however, he distanced himself from an accompanying video shared on his social media account, stating his unawareness of its contents, Dawn reported.The contentious post, disseminated on Imran's social media platform on May 26, featured a montage alongside a quote attributed to Khan urging the populace to examine the Hamoodur Rahman Commission report to discern the true betrayer between General Yahya Khan and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.Addressing journalists following a session at the accountability court in Adiala Jail, where he faces a 190 million Pounds corruption charge, Khan expressed remorse for his past references to Mujibur Rahman, conceding his failure to peruse the Hamoodur Rehman Commission Report at the time, as reported by Dawn.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder elucidated that the report delineated two objectives: averting the recurrence of similar errors and ascribing accountability for the debacle in Dhaka. He underscored the commission's indictment of General Yahya Khan for orchestrating actions to retain power, likening it to contemporary circumstances where the economy teeters on the brink of collapse.Attributing a staggering loss of PKR 1,100 billion to amendments in accountability laws introduced by the opposition coalition, Khan emphasised the dire consequences for a nation already grappling with economic challenges.Regarding his acquittal in the Cypher case, Imran called for an apology from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for baseless allegations.When queried about potential negotiations with political factions, prompted by a suggestion from the Supreme Court, Khan rebuffed the notion, asserting a preference for dialogue with genuine power brokers over intermediaries.Responding to criticism of his earlier stance on references to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Hamoodur Rahman Commission report, Khan clarified that he had since familiarized himself with the report, leading to a shift in perspective.In regard to the contentious video associated with the social media post, Khan expressed bewilderment, asserting his inability to view the video while incarcerated and consequently refraining from commenting.Meanwhile, during interrogation by the FIA, Khan reiterated his commitment to cooperation, contingent upon the presence of legal representation, according to Dawn.In a parallel development, objections were raised during the corruption case hearing regarding the presiding judge's tenure, necessitating further deliberation on the matter.Conversely, PTI leader Omar Ayub lambasted the FIA's summons pertaining to Khan's tweet, denouncing the agency's director general and questioning his jurisdiction. Accusing the agency of overstepping its bounds, Ayub demanded scrutiny of the FIA's conduct.Amidst these developments, concerns were raised regarding the treatment of incarcerated PTI members, including Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, Yasmin Rashid, and Aliya Hamza, alleging violations of their human rights and inadequate facilities.Ali Muhammad Khan, another PTI stalwart, lamented the humiliation inflicted upon the nation through the incarceration of its leaders, underscoring the need for a dignified resolution to their predicament, Dawn reported.","Imran Khan apologises for past references to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Hamoodur Rahman Commission report.

This unrest stems from discontent over government regulations restricting border crossings to individuals with valid passports and visas, a departure from previous practices allowing passage based on identity cards, as reported by Dawn.Consequently, business activities halted, with banks and government offices shuttered, exacerbating economic strains. Notably, the National Bank relocated staff to ensure continuity amid the chaos.Security forces responded to the escalating violence with tear gas, seeking to disperse protesters attacking law enforcement personnel. Despite arrests and law enforcement efforts, the situation remains tense, prompting a stern warning against highway blockades, preserving vital transit routes between Pakistan and Afghanistan.Efforts to quell the unrest through dialogue have thus far yielded limited success, with protesters demanding the release of detained leaders and a resolution to their grievances.Meanwhile, Balochistan's Chief Minister Mir Safraz Bugti chaired a high-level meeting to address the crisis, emphasizing the imperative of upholding state authority while advocating for dialogue to address underlying grievances. However, attacks on security forces and property damage remain non-negotiable.In solidarity with the Chaman protesters, political parties staged demonstrations, advocating for the acceptance of demonstrators' demands and condemning the heavy-handed response to protests.Simultaneously, calls for a parliamentary committee in the National Assembly to address the situation underscored the urgency of dialogue and de-escalation. PTI leader Asad Qaisar appealed for a compassionate approach, advocating for dialogue over violence.Amidst the unrest, the Foreign Office reiterated visa regulations for border movement between Pakistan and Afghanistan, emphasising the need for strict adherence to visa requirements, Dawn reported.","Chaman, a border town in Pakistan's Balochistan, remains in turmoil.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently jailed, invoked the case of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal receiving bail ahead of Lok Sabha elections as he protested his mistreatment in jail before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.Appearing on Thursday before a five-member bench led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Khan decried the ""victimisation"" he has faced since being ousted from power in April 2022.The bench, which included Justices Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhel, Athar Minallah, and Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, heard Khan's grievances regarding amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO). Justice Minallah expressed sympathy, acknowledging the misfortune of Khan being in jail despite leading a major political party with millions of supporters, as per reports.Khan, 71, argued that his conviction within five days was a deliberate attempt to sideline him from the general elections held on February 8. He contrasted his situation with that of Kejriwal, who was granted bail by India's Supreme Court, enabling him to campaign. Khan contended that Pakistan is operating under an undeclared ""martial law,"" further oppressing his political activities.Expressing disappointment over the Supreme Court's rejection of a request from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's government for live streaming the case, Khan questioned the judgment's implication that he was engaging in political point-scoring. Chief Justice Isa responded that a judge need not explain their verdicts, advising Khan to file a review petition instead.Khan urged the Supreme Court to appoint a chairman for the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), criticizing the current appointment process as being influenced by a ""third umpire"" when consensus between the Opposition and government fails. Justice Minallah countered, stating there was no justification to invalidate the NAB amendments.The PTI founder called for reforms in NAB, citing ongoing inquiries against him. Justice Minallah's reminder about the Chief Election Commissioner appointment led Khan to argue that restoring the amendment would benefit his NAB cases but potentially bankrupt the country.Chief Justice Isa prohibited Khan from referencing the Islamabad High Court (IHC) verdict in the cipher cases, as appeals might be pending in the Supreme Court. Justice Rizvi questioned Khan's failure to oppose the NAB amendments in Parliament, to which Khan replied that his government was overthrown through a conspiracy, making it futile to engage with the current ""conspiratorial government.""Khan also sought a comparison of his jail conditions with those afforded to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. In response, Justice Mandokhel humorously noted that Sharif is not currently in jail, asking if Khan wished for his incarceration. Chief Justice Isa concluded the session by mentioning the possibility of a surprise visit by a judicial officer to inspect Khan's jail conditions.",Imran Khan appeared before the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday.

Sharif is currently on a visit to China at the invitation of President Xi Jinping, seeking to upgrade cooperation under the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a key part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative .In a statement, the Pakistan Prime Minister's Office said during the meeting, the two sides discussed the significance of Gwadar as an important pillar of the CPEC and agreed to expedite the timely completion of all related infrastructure projects to transform Gwadar in Balochistan province into a regional economic hub.""They also expressed their firm commitment to protect CPEC from its detractors and adversaries and to upgrade CPEC in the form of enhanced cooperation,"" the statement said.The two leaders reaffirmed unwavering support for each other on core issues and expressed continued commitment and support for the high-quality development of the CPEC, Geo News reported.They also emphasised the timely completion of all ongoing projects with a special focus on industrial development, agriculture modernisation, Science & Technology and the development of Special Economic Zones for mutually beneficial and socio-economic development of Pakistan.Sharif also reaffirmed Pakistan's unflinching resolve to ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel and projects in Pakistan.Chinese investment and financial support since 2013 have been key for the South Asian nation's struggling economy, including the rolling over of loans so that Islamabad can meet external financing needs at a time when foreign reserves are critically low.China has also invested billions in various power projects and road networks in Pakistan under the USD 65 billion CPEC plan, but the implementation of various projects has slowed in recent months.The CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Pakistan's Balochistan with China's Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI is seen as an attempt by China to further its influence abroad with infrastructure projects funded by Chinese investments across the world.The recurring attacks on the Chinese personnel working on the CPEC projects by militant groups in Pakistan have become a major concern for China.In March, five Chinese and one Pakistani nationals were killed in a terrorist attack on their vehicle of the Dasu Hydropower Project undertaken by a Chinese company in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.During the talks, the two leaders discussed the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and discussed regional and global developments of mutual interest.They noted that the Pakistan-China All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership was characterised by mutual trust, shared principles and strategic convergence. Premier Li congratulated Prime Minister Sharif on Pakistan's election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.The two sides agreed to maintain high-level exchanges including strengthening institutional linkages at all tiers and in all spheres of bilateral cooperation. Pakistan and China will also continue to consult closely on issues of regional and global significance and multilateral fora, especially during the two-year tenure of Pakistan as a non-member of the UNSC.The delegation-level talks were followed by an MoU signing ceremony. Both signed 23 MoUs and agreements deepening cooperation in transport infrastructure, industry, energy, agriculture, media, health, water, socio-economic development and others of mutual interest.","Pakistan and China vow to protect the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) from its ""detractors and adversaries"" Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured Beijing of providing complete security to Chinese personnel working on the USD 65 billion project.

"Pakistan HC acquits Imran, Qureshi in state secrets leak case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-hc-acquits-imran-qureshi-in-state-secrets-leak-case/articleshow/110676116.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani high court acquitted Monday former PM Imran Khan and ex-foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , who were serving 10-year sentences after being convicted of leaking state secrets, known as the cipher case. An Islamabad HC division bench, comprising justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, delivered a short verdict, accepting their appeals against the convictions.

“The state had badly failed in proving its case and even its prosecutors had abandoned the case. Hats off to the honourable judges. It was a case of first impression. Imran and Qureshi did not do any anti-state activity,” remarked Imran’s counsel Salman Safdar following the verdict.

Despite the acquittal, Khan will remain imprisoned to serve his sentence in the “iddat” case, related to his alleged unlawful marriage to Bushra Bibi, his third wife. Both are serving seven-year jail terms after a trial court ruled that their 2018 marriage broke the law by not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called “Iddat”, after Bibi divorced her previous husband.

Qureshi remains on physical remand until June 5, accused of inciting violence on May 9 last year when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters stormed military and civilian govt assets following Imran’s arrest.

The 71-year-old former cricket star has faced a series of political and legal challenges since being ousted as PM in April 2022 after losing a confidence vote in parliament. A special court, constituted under Official Secrets Act, 1923, had convicted the two PTI politicians for sharing classified communication between Washington and Islamabad, which Khan claimed was part of a US conspiracy to overthrow his govt in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Washington and Pakistan’s military dismissed the allegation.

Khan’s conviction in the cipher case was one of three charges against him leading up to the Feb 8 elections this year, which he alleged were orchestrated to prevent his return to office. Last year, the same court overturned his conviction in a corruption case involving the unlawful sale of state gifts during his term from 2018 to 2022. The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes — the most expensive being $304,000.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was found guilty of leaking classified information to his ex-wife. The pair were also convicted of giving each other gifts worth more than $100,000.
