Panama community pushed from Caribbean island by rising sea levels moves into new houses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/panama-community-pushed-from-caribbean-island-by-rising-sea-levels-moves-into-new-houses/articleshow/110781542.cms,"ISBERYALA : Hammocks began appearing this week in the doorways of 300 new houses built in what was previously a yucca field along Panama 's Caribbean coast for families from the country's first low-lying island evacuated due to rising sea levels .Indigenous Guna families from the island of Gardi Sugdub ferried stoves, gas cylinders, mattresses and other belongings first in boats and then in trucks to the new community of Isberyala.They quickly saw some differences.""Here it's cooler,"" said 73-year-old Augusto Walter, hanging his hammock on Wednesday in the tidy two-bedroom house with a backyard. ""There (on the island) at this time of day, it's an oven.""He was waiting for his wife who had stayed a bit longer on the island to prepare food. They will share the government-constructed house with three other family members.Most of Gardi Sugdub's families had moved or were in the process of moving, but Isberyala's freshly paved and painted streets named after historic Guna leaders were still largely empty.The Indigenous community surrounded by jungle is about a 30-minute walk from the port where a few more minutes aboard a boat brings them to their former homes. Government officials said they expected everyone to be moved in by Thursday.However, that doesn't mean everyone is leaving the island. Seven or eight families numbering about 200 people have chosen to stay for now. Workers were even building a two-story house on the island Wednesday.Among those staying was Augencio Arango a 49-year-old boat motor mechanic.""I prefer to be here (on the island), it's more relaxing,"" Arango said. His mother, brother and grandmother moved to Isberyala.""Honestly, I don't know why the people want to live there,"" he said. ""It's like living in the city, locked up and you can't leave and the houses are small.""He didn't think climate change was responsible for the move, but rather decisions made by people. ""Man is who harms nature,"" Arango said. ""Now they want to cut down all the trees to build houses on solid ground.""Tiny Gardi Sugdub is one of about 50 populated islands in the archipelago of the Guna Yala territory.Every year, especially when the strong winds whip up the sea in November and December, water fills the streets and enters the homes. Climate change isn't only leading to a rise in sea levels, but it's also warming oceans and thereby powering stronger storms.The Gunas of Gardi Sugdub are only the first of 63 communities along Panama's Caribbean and Pacific coasts that government officials and scientists expect to be forced to relocate by rising sea levels in the coming decades.Ernesto Lopez, 69, moved Tuesday with his wife Digna. Two more relatives were expected soon.""We feel like we're more comfortable here, there's more space,"" Lopez said, sitting on his own hammock Wednesday. ""On Gardi Sugdub we were really squeezed in houses with a lot people. We didn't fit anymore and the sea was coming in every year.""Like most of the families who had moved in, Lopez, a Guna leader, and his wife still didn't have electricity or water. The government said electricity was available in the community but families had to set up their own accounts. They made do their first night with a battery-powered lantern and the gas burners they brought from the island.Mangos, unripened bananas and sugar cane that Lopez had brought that morning from his farm plot some two hours away lay in a pile on the house's floor. Like most families, they didn't plan to completely abandon the island where generations had spent their entire lives.""Once in a while we are going to cross to the island,"" Lopez said.Late in the day, many of Isberyala's new residents did just that because their new homes didn't yet have electricity.Betsaira Brenes, 19, moved with her mother, grandmother and an aunt Wednesday. Carrying two gallons of water into the house that they brought from the island, she said it would be enough space for their family after living on the crowded island.They planned to continue straddling between mainland and island too, she said. ""The good thing in all of this is that now we have a new house and the other one where the other aunts stayed.""","Families from the island of Gardi Sugdub ferried stoves, gas cylinders, mattresses to the new community of Isberyala.

Watch: Sunita Williams dances upon reaching International Space Station after Starliner mission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-sunita-williams-dances-upon-reaching-international-space-station-after-starliner-mission/articleshow/110781478.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Boeing Starliner , piloted by Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore, successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday. This mission marks a historic milestone as Williams becomes the first woman to pilot and test a new crewed spacecraft on its maiden voyage.Upon arrival, Williams celebrated her third trip to the ISS with a joyful dance, a gesture of her excitement and happiness. She was warmly welcomed by the seven astronauts aboard the station, who greeted her and Wilmore with the traditional ringing of a bell. Describing the crew as ""another family,"" Williams expressed her gratitude for the warm reception.After launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, the spacecraft docked with the ISS 26 hours later, despite a one-hour delay due to minor technical issues such as helium leaks. The mission's primary objective was to validate the Boeing Starliner as a viable alternative to the SpaceX Crew Module for ferrying astronauts under NASA's commercial crew program.The astronauts monitored the Starliner as it autonomously navigated a series of maneuvers to dock with the ISS. They also completed crucial tests, including manually flying the spacecraft for the first time in space. During their week-long stay, Williams and Wilmore will assist with tests and conduct scientific experiments.Reflecting on the mission, Williams said, ""It feels like going back home."" She is known for previously carrying an idol of Lord Ganesh and the Bhagavad Gita to space. Before liftoff, Williams, who helped design the Starliner, admitted to some pre-launch nerves but expressed excitement about the spacecraft she had named ""Calypso"" after the ship of the famed French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau.The astronauts' return journey will conclude with a landing on solid ground, unlike previous missions that ended with ocean landings.","The Boeing Starliner successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday.

Nine of those calls ended with a patient needing treatment in a hospital. A spokesperson for the county said the number is likely higher, as the heat can also play a role in other types of calls to the fire department, including those related to alcohol intoxication or when conditions like fainting, dizziness, or nausea are reported.New record highs Thursday included 113 F (45 C) in Phoenix, breaking the old mark of 111 F (44 C) set in 2016, and 111 F (44 C) in Las Vegas, topping the 110 F (43 C) last reached in 2010. Other areas of Arizona, California, and Nevada also broke records by a few degrees.The heat has arrived weeks earlier than usual even in places farther to the north at higher elevations — areas typically a dozen degrees cooler. That includes Reno, Nevada, where the normal high of 81 F (27 C) for this time of year soared to a record 98 F (37 C) on Thursday.The National Weather Service in Reno forecasted mild cooling this weekend, but only by a few degrees.

Hunter Biden told lover he was a ‘drunk and an addict’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hunter-biden-told-lover-he-was-a-drunk-and-an-addict/articleshow/110781328.cms,"Hunter Biden , the only surviving son of President Joe Biden , admitted to being a drug and alcohol addict to his former lover and sent her texts within hours of purchasing a gun indicating that he was buying and using crack cocaine .The dramatic testimony highlighted the fourth day of Hunter Biden’s trial in Delaware on the charges brought by Special Counsel David Weiss over his purchase of a gun in mid-October 2018. Separately, Biden’s father said he doesn’t intend to pardon his son if he’s convicted of federal firearms violations.Hallie Biden , Hunter’s sister-in-law who later became his lover, testified that she regularly begged him to go into treatment for crack cocaine and alcohol addiction. But he kept “running away like a child,” she said.“This has all got to stop,” Hallie Biden said she told Hunter. “Check yourself into a rehab.” She had been married to Hunter’s brother Beau, who died of cancer in 2015. She later had a romantic relationship with Hunter, who is accused of illegally buying and possessing a gun while using drugs.Hallie Biden said she personally saw him smoke crack on several occasions and even joined him in using the drug during the summer of 2018. But she became fearful after finding the pistol in his car. She said she didn’t want him to hurt himself or for her children to get their hands on the weapon, so she threw it in a grocery store trash can.Hunter Biden acknowledged in a text to her shortly after buying the pistol that he was a “drunk and an addict.” That’s potentially useful testimony for prosecutors trying to convince jurors that he was in the throes of drug use when he bought the gun and checked “no” on a federal form asking if he was a user of illegal drugs.Prosecutors pointed to two texts that Hunter Biden sent Hallie after he bought the gun on Oct. 12, 2018. In one Oct. 23 text, Hunter Biden said he was waiting for a “dealer named Mookie” in Wilmington, Delaware. In a text on Oct. 14, he wrote, “I was sleeping on a car smoking crack.” Hunter’s lawyers have argued that perhaps he was lying in the texts.In testimony that could help his defense, Hallie Biden wasn’t able to say whether Hunter Biden was on drugs the day he bought the gun. She said she couldn’t recall seeing Hunter Oct. 6 to Oct. 12. She also said she did not see him use drugs between Oct. 12 and Oct. 23.Meanwhile, the president said he’d respect the jury’s verdict in the case and had ruled out a pardon for his son if he’s convicted, according to a transcript of an interview the elder Biden did with ABC World News Tonight anchor David Muir.Prosecutors in the gun case say they only have to show that Hunter Biden was a user of illegal drugs around the time he bought the gun. Hunter Biden’s lawyers argue that Hunter didn’t knowingly lie when he filled out the form and bought the gun.Hallie Biden is a key witness for the prosecution. After her husband’s death, she had an affair with Hunter Biden while he was married to another woman.Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter’s vehicle 11 days after he bought it. She said she had gone into the car to clean it out, but discovered “some remnants of crack cocaine and some paraphernalia” and then the gun. She put the gun in a pouch she found in the vehicle, which prosecutors say later was tested and determined to have traces of cocaine.In describing how she disposed of the gun, she said, “I realize it was a stupid move now, but I was in a panic.”Hallie Biden said she wasn’t sure if Hunter Biden was using drugs on the day she found the gun, but said he exhibited signs of it that included looking like he hadn’t slept in awhile.As for her own drug use, Hallie Biden said she stopped in August 2018.“It was a terrible experience that I went through and I’m embarrassed and ashamed,” she said. “I regret that portion of my life.”Hunter Biden’s gun was found in a trashcan by an elderly man who regularly picked through trash for recyclable materials he could sell. Prosecutors called the man, Edward Banner, as a witness. Banner said after he found the gun and the pouch, he took them home, put them in a closet and never touched them again. He later turned the gun and pouch over to a police detective who tracked him down.Prosecutors asked Banner if anyone in his house used cocaine, to which he said no. That’s a potentially important piece of evidence if Hunter Biden’s defense tries to argue that the trace cocaine found on the pouch was put there after the gun was thrown away.",Hunter Biden admitted to being a drug and alcohol addict to his former lover. He sent her texts within hours of purchasing a gun indicating that he was buying and using crack cocaine. The dramatic testimony highlighted the fourth day of Hunter Biden’s trial in Delaware.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110781333,imgsize-50014,width-400,resizemode-4/110781333.jpg"
Nato stands with Ukraine like US backed Europe against Nazis: Biden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nato-stands-with-ukraine-like-us-backed-europe-against-nazis-biden/articleshow/110780368.cms,"NORMANDY: US Prez Joe Biden observed the 80th anniversary of D-Day on the beaches of Normandy on Thursday by asserting that the allied effort to stand up to Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine is a direct extension of the battle for freedom that raged across Europe during World War II.Addressing 180 surviving veterans of the Normandy operation and thousands of other guests, Biden said that the world must defeat another “tyrant bent on domination” and meet “the test of ages” to defend Ukraine — just as the heroes who stormed the beaches and dropped behind enemy lines did eight decades ago.“Isolation was not the answer 80 years ago and is not the answer today,” Biden said, with WWII veterans seated in wheelchairs behind him. “We know the dark forces that these heroes fought against 80 years ago. They never fade. Aggression and greed, the desire to dominate and control, to change borders by force — these are perennial. The struggle between dictatorship and freedom is unending.”In an energetic address, Biden declared that “Nato is more united than ever” and insisted that the alliance would stand by Ukraine in its own hour of need just as the US had stood by Europe against the Nazis. “We will not walk away,” Biden said. “Because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there.”The president spoke just steps from where 9,388 members of the American military are buried, most of whom participated in the Allied invasion at Omaha Beach. Their graves are marked with rows of stark white marble crosses or Stars of David, which gleamed under the bright sunlight and blue skies.Biden, 81, who was a toddler when American, British and Canadian troops poured onto the beaches here on June 6, 1944, will almost certainly be the last US president to speak at a Normandy remembrance who was alive at the time Allied forces began to push Adolf Hitler out of Europe.Now, eight decades later, Biden is leading a coalition of European and other nations in a very different war on the continent, but for a very similar principle — pushing back against the attempted seizure of a neighbouring country, in this case Ukraine, by Prez Vladimir Putin of Russia.In his remarks on Thursday at the Normandy American Cemetery, Biden drew a direct line between the two, connected by the defence of a rules-based international order. “The men who fought here became heroes not because they were the strongest, the toughest or the fiercest — although they were,” Biden said, “but because they were given an audacious mission, knowing — every one of them knew — the probability of dying was real.” “They knew beyond any doubt there are things that are worth fighting and dying for,” Biden added. “Freedom is worth it. Democracy is worth it. America is worth it. The world is worth it. Then, now and always.”",US Prez Joe Biden observed the 80th anniversary of D-Day on the beaches of Normandy on Thursday.

‘Smoked crack every 20 min’: US prez son’s drug-fuelled past laid bare in court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/smoked-crack-every-20-min-us-prez-sons-drug-fuelled-past-laid-bare-in-court/articleshow/110780418.cms,"Brother’s widow details tossing the revolver

(With AP/Reuters inputs)

Hunter Biden ’s ex-wife and a former girlfriend testified Wednesday in his gun trial about finding his crack pipes and other drug paraphernalia , and jurors saw photos of the prez’s son bare-chested in a bubble bath and heard about his visit to a strip club.As first lady Jill Biden sat in the front row, the courtroom grew quiet when Kathleen Buhle , who was married to Hunter for 20 years, walked in. She testified that she discovered her husband was using drugs when she found a crack pipe in an ashtray on July 3, 2015, a day after their anniversary. When she asked him, “he acknowledged smoking crack,” she said. “I was definitely worried, scared,” said Buhle, who divorced him in 2016 after his infidelity and drug abuse became too much.The trial, about whether he lied on a gun purchase form in Oct 2018 when he said he wasn’t using drugs, has become a highly personal and detailed tour of the mistakes and drug use of Hunter, whose struggles have been tabloid fodder for years and were used publicly by Republicans, including for an impeachment bid against US prez.The proceedings are unfolding as the 2024 election looms, and allies worry about the toll it will take on Prez Biden. Hunter has been charged with three felonies: Lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days. Prosecutors have said Hunter was a habitual user, unable to stay clean for long and had been kicked out of the US navy after testing positive for cocaine.Prosecutors also called Zoe Kestan, who testified about meeting Hunter in 2017 at a strip club where she worked. She described Hunter’s drug-fuelled lifestyle during 2018, including when they stayed at an expensive hotel for a month. Kestan said he was often smoking crack about every 20 minutes. The prosecution showed photos of him with crack pipes, including one of him in a soapy bathtub. But she conceded she didn’t see Hunter using drugs during the month when he bought the gun because the two were estranged at that time. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years in jail, though first-time offenders get a far more lenient punishment.The widow of Hunter Biden’s brother told jurors in his federal gun trial on Thursday about the moment she found the revolver in his truck, describing how she put it into a leather pouch, stuffed it into a shopping bag and tossed it in a trash can outside a market near her home. “I panicked, and I wanted to get rid of them,” Hallie Bidentestified about finding the gun and ammunition in Oct 2018.“I didn’t want him to hurt himself, and I didn’t want my kids to find it and hurt themselves.” The purchase of the Colt revolver by Hunter — and Hallie’s frenzied disposal of it — are the fulcrum of the case against him. Prosecutors say the prez’s son was in the throes of a heavy crack addiction when he bought the gun. Hallie, who had a brief romantic relationship with Hunter after Beau Biden died, said she considered hiding the gun but thought her kids might find it, so she decided to throw it away. “I realise it was a stupid idea now.” Asked by the prosecutor if Hunter was using drugs around then, she said, “He could have been.”","Hunter Biden’s ex-wife and a former girlfriend testified Wednesday in his gun trial about finding his crack pipes and other drug paraphernalia.

Donald Trump quickly surpasses Joe Biden on TikTok with just one video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-quickly-surpasses-joe-biden-on-tiktok-with-just-one-video/articleshow/110752526.cms,"In a move that has quickly gained traction, former US President Donald Trump made his debut on TikTok last Saturday. The video, featuring Trump alongside Dana White, the CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, was captured before their attendance at the recent UFC fights in Newark. Despite being his inaugural post, it has already amassed an impressive 5.9 million likes, while his account has attracted 5.6 million followers in just four days.

Content on TikTok about Trump has generally outperformed posts focused on Biden in recent months.

Former President Donald Trump posted his first video to TikTok on Saturday, and has already amassed more followers and likes than President Joe Biden ’s campaign account as the two men vie for attention before November’s general election.

Trump’s first post, which showed him standing next to Ultimate Fighting Championship Chief Executive Officer Dana White before attending this past weekend’s slate of fights in Newark, has garnered 5.9 million likes, and his account has 5.6 million followers after just four days. Biden’s campaign account, which has posted hundreds of videos since its debut in February, has just 361,000 followers and 4.7 million likes.

Trump’s campaign trumpeted the contrast in a press release on Wednesday, highlighting his popularity on an app that he tried to ban four years ago while he was in office.

He has since come out in support of TikTok, which faces a possible ban in the US if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance Ltd., does not divest its ownership stake in the platform by Jan. 19. Biden, who signed the law that could eventually ban TikTok on grounds that the app poses a security risk to American users, is still using the platform to campaign.

Content on TikTok about Trump has generally outperformed posts focused on Biden in recent months, although performance varies based on the news cycle, according to Ben Darr, the founder of CredoIQ, a social media analytics firm.

The Biden campaign said it was continuing to bolster its presence on social media platforms, including TikTok and Instagram, and committed to spending millions of dollars on digital investments as well as forging bonds with influencers.

Both candidates are using TikTok to appeal to young voters. TikTok claims it has 170 million monthly users in the US, and its parent company is vigorously fighting in court the divest-or-ban law.

WHO confirms first fatal human case of H5N2 bird flu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/who-confirms-first-fatal-human-case-of-h5n2-bird-flu/articleshow/110751897.cms,"A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant , the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday. The patient passed away on April 24 after experiencing fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and nausea. Despite having no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, the individual had multiple underlying medical conditions, including chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, according to a statement from Mexico's health ministry.The WHO reported that the patient, who had been bedridden for three weeks prior to developing acute symptoms, was hospitalized in Mexico City and succumbed to the illness the same day. This case marks the first laboratory-confirmed human infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus globally and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico.""Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,"" the WHO said. Mexican health authorities conducted laboratory tests and reported the confirmed case to the UN health body on May 23.In March, H5N2 cases were detected in a backyard poultry farm in Michoacan state, with other outbreaks identified in the State of Mexico. However, establishing a link between the human case and the poultry infections has been challenging. The WHO estimates the risk to the general population as ""low.""The Mexican health ministry emphasized that there is no risk of contagion for the population, noting that all samples from identified contacts of the patient have tested negative. Authorities are closely monitoring farms near the victim's home and have set up a permanent monitoring system to detect other cases in wildlife in the area.Andrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University, highlighted the complexity of the situation, saying, ""How this individual got infected is a big question mark that at least this initial report doesn't really address thoroughly.""The WHO and Mexican health officials continue to investigate the source of the infection. Bird flu has been known to infect various mammals, including seals, raccoons, bears, and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds. Scientists remain vigilant for changes in the virus that could signal its adaptation to spread more easily among humans.In the United States, a different variant of bird flu, H5N1, has been spreading among dairy cow herds, with a small number of human cases reported. However, none of these cases involved human-to-human transmission.Australia also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, with no signs of transmission, while noting more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.Pekosz added, ""Since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus. So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans.""(With inputs from agencies)","A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant.

Ukraine has used US weapons to hit inside Russia: Western official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ukraine-has-used-us-weapons-to-hit-inside-russia-western-official/articleshow/110751731.cms,"Ukraine has recently used US-supplied weapons to carry out strikes inside Russia, according to a well-informed Western official. These actions were carried out under new guidance approved by President Joe Biden. This guidance permits the use of American arms for the defence of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, revealed this information.

WASHINGTON: Ukraine has used US weapons to strike inside Russia in recent days, according to a Western official familiar with the matter. The weapons were used under recently approved guidance from President Joe Biden allowing American arms to be used to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv , Ukraine’s second-largest city. The official was not authorised to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Biden’s directive allows for US-supplied weapons to be used to strike Russian forces that are attacking or preparing to attack. It does not change US policy that directs Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia, US officials have said.

Ukrainian officials had stepped up calls on the US to allow Kyiv’s forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv sits just 20km from the Russian border and has come under intensified Russian attack.

On Tuesday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that he could not confirm that Ukraine had used US weapons at targets in Russia. “We’re just not in a position on a day-to-day basis of knowing exactly what the Ukrainians are firing at what. It’s certainly at a tactical level.”

","The weapons were used under recently approved guidance from President Joe Biden allowing American arms to be used to strike inside Russia. This guidance permits the use of American arms for the defence of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The official was not authorised to comment publicly on the sensitive matter.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110751732,imgsize-1364542,width-400,resizemode-4/110751732.jpg"

Police officers arrested 13 pro-Palestinian protesters Wednesday who had barricaded themselves in the office of the prez of Stanford University and demanded that administrators meet several demands, including a vote by the university trustees on whether to divest from companies that are said to support Israel’s military.

The administration offices, located in Building 10, were cleared within about three hours, according to a campus spokesperson, who said that there was “extensive damage.” Several walls and pillars on the exterior were covered in graffiti that criticised the police, Stanford and Israel. One officer was injured during the arrests, the spokesperson said, adding that any students who were arrested will be suspended and those who are seniors will not be allowed to graduate.Wednesday is the final day of classes for spring.

Israel ‘targets’ US lawmakers with covert influence drive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-targets-us-lawmakers-with-covert-influence-drive/articleshow/110751699.cms,"Gaza offensive won’t stop for talks: Israel

(With Reuters inputs)

TEL AVIV: Israel organised and paid for an influence campaign last year targeting US lawmakers and the American public with pro-Israel messaging , as it aimed to foster support for its actions in the war in the Gaza Strip , according to officials involved in the effort and documents related to the operation.The covert campaign was commissioned by Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs , a govt body that connects Jews around the world with the state of Israel, four Israeli officials said. The ministry allocated about $2 million to the operation and hired Stoic , a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv, to carry it out, according to the officials and the documents.The campaign began in Oct and remains active on the social platform X. At its peak, it used hundreds of fake accounts that posed as real Americans on X, Facebook and Instagram to post pro-Israel comments. The accounts focused on US lawmakers, particularly ones who are black and Democrats, with posts urging them to continue funding Israel’s military.ChatGPT, the AI-powered chatbot, was used to generate many of the posts. The campaign also created three fake English-language news sites featuring pro-Israel articles.The Israeli govt’s connection to the influence operation, which NYT verified with four current and ex-members of ministry of diaspora affairs and documents about the campaign, has not previously been reported. FakeReporter, an Israeli misinformation watchdog, identified the effort in March.Last week, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, said they had also found and disrupted the operation. The campaign didn’t have a widespread impact, the two companies had said. The fake accounts accumulated more than 40,000 followers across X, Facebook and Instagram, FakeReporter found. But many of those followers may have been bots and didn’t generate a large audience, Meta said.The secretive drive signals the lengths Israel was willing to go to sway American opinion on the war in Gaza. The US has long been one of Israel’s staunchest allies, with Prez Biden recently signing a $15 billion military aid package for the country. But the conflict has been unpopular with many Americans, who have called for Biden to withdraw support for Israel in the face of mounting civilian deaths in Gaza. Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs denied involvement. Stoic didn’t respond for comment.Israel reiterated on Wednesday its refusal to halt the Gaza offensive for a resumption of hostage-release talks with Hamas, after mediator Qatar said it had given the Palestinian militants a US-backed truce proposal. “Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,” defence minister Yoav Gallant, said in remarks after he flew abroad a warplane to inspect the Gaza front. On the other hand, Hamas political head Ismail Haniyeh said the group will deal “seriously and positively” with any agreement that is based on the total halt of war, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.","The covert campaign was commissioned by Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs.

BERLIN: A municipal candidate for the far-right Alternative for Germany party was slashed with a box cutter in the German city of Mannheim , authorities said Wednesday. While police said the incident on Tuesday night did not appear to be politically motivated, it came four days after a knife attack on members of an anti-Islam party in the same city, which raised concerns about more violence in the prelude to Sunday’s vote in Germany for the European Parliament .

Tuesday’s attack occurred after Heinrich Koch , running for municipal office in Mannheim, noticed a man “taking down and slashing” AfD posters. After Koch confronted him, the man attacked Koch with a box cutter.

Koch was taken to a hospital for stitches but is expected to make a full recovery.

Taiwan strongly objects to China's sovereignty claims and says only the island's people can decide their future.The United States has expressed concern about Chinese military activity near Taiwan, including after the island's presidential election and the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te last month. China has warned the US should not interfere in China's affairs with Taiwan.Taiwan and the United States have no official diplomatic relationship, as Washington formally recognises Beijing but is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and is the island's most important international backer.The United States recognized that if China was successful in annexing Taiwan it would impact US credibility and have ""profound, and potentially irreversible effect on the perceived reliability of US alliances worldwide"", Rudd said.The United States, China and Taiwan have a common interest in avoiding open military confrontation on the future of Taiwan, said Rudd, a China scholar who was president of the Asia Society in New York until last year.""The economic costs, domestic political impacts, and unknowable geo-strategic consequences that such a war would generate would likely be of an order of magnitude that we have not seen since the Second World War,"" he said.""Whatever the outcome (an American victory, a Chinese victory, or a bloody stalemate), the world is likely to become a radically different place after such a war than it was before.""","Kevin Rudd, Australia's ambassador to the U.S., says a war over Taiwan would be as great as the impact of the Second World War.

Netanyahu the opportunity to share the Israeli government's vision for defending their democracy, combating terror, and establishing just and lasting peace in the region,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson and top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said in a statement.The visit comes after Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called in March for Israel to hold new elections in a rare example of strident criticism from a senior American official of the country's handling of the war in Gaza.In a statement Thursday evening, Schumer said he invited Netanyahu to speak despite ""clear and profound disagreements because America's relationship with Israel is ironclad and transcends one person or prime minister.""The rebuke from Schumer, the highest-ranking elected Jewish American in history, came amid expressions of dismay from progressive Democrats who have condemned Netanyahu over his handling of the military response and vowed to snub the right-wing leader's speech.The war was sparked when Hamas attacked Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.Militants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 36,654 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.A Gaza hospital said Thursday at least 37 people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a UN-run school that the Israeli military alleged housed a Hamas compound.US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have resumed talks aimed at securing a truce and hostage-prisoner swap in the nearly eight-month war.But the nation has faced a mounting diplomatic chill, with international court cases accusing it of war crimes and several European countries recognizing a Palestinian state.US media reported on Monday that Netanyahu had agreed to visit on June 13, but his office told Israeli media the date had ""not been finalized"" and would not be on that date because it interferes with a Jewish holiday.",Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will address lawmakers in the US Congress on July 24.

Boeing’s new capsule arrived at the International Space Station Thursday, delayed by last-minute thruster trouble that almost derailed the docking for this first test flight with astronauts .

The Starliner capsule already had one small helium leak when it rocketed into orbit with two Nasa astronauts — Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams — Wednesday. Boeing and Nasa managers were confident they could manage the propulsion system despite the problem and that more leaks were unlikely. But just hours into the flight, two more leaks cropped up. Later, four of the capsule’s 28 thrusters went down. The pilots managed to restart three of them, providing enough safety margin to proceed. It was not known whether the thrusters issue was tied to the leaks. Helium is used to pressurise fuel lines of the thrusters, essential for maneuovering.

Asked about ways he would curb the flow of migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally, Trump said: ""We have tremendous economic power."" Trump said if a country, such as China, does not help to curb the flow of immigrants in to the U.S., ""we have these things called tariffs.""

Trump added he hoped he would not need to use tariffs to curb illegal immigration , but warned if other countries do not help to reduce it, then he could ""tariff the hell out of that country"" if re-elected.

Nasa astronauts gear up for Moonwalk with Artemis mission testing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nasa-astronauts-gear-up-for-moonwalk-with-artemis-mission-testing/articleshow/110774529.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nasa is preparing for a monumental milestone as astronauts gear up to walk on the Moon for the first time since 1972. Under the Artemis program, the space agency, in collaboration with industry partners, is developing new rockets, spacecraft, landers, and spacesuits to ensure the success of this ambitious mission.Recently, Nasa astronaut Doug “Wheels” Wheelock and Axiom Space astronaut Peggy Whitson conducted a crucial test involving full-scale developmental hardware of SpaceX’s Starship Human Landing System (HLS). This test, conducted on April 30 at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, marked the first interaction between astronauts in pressurized spacesuits and a test version of the Starship HLS hardware.“With Artemis, Nasa is going to the Moon in a whole new way, with international partners and industry partners like Axiom Space and SpaceX. These partners are contributing their expertise and providing integral parts of the deep space architecture that they develop with Nasa’s insight and oversight,” said Amit Kshatriya, Nasa’s Moon to Mars program manager. “Integrated tests like this one, with key programs and partners working together, are crucial to ensure systems operate smoothly and are safe and effective for astronauts before they take the next steps on the Moon.”The day-long test provided valuable feedback on various aspects of the Starship HLS, including its layout, physical design, mechanical assemblies, and clearances. The test also evaluated the flexibility and agility of the spacesuits, known as the AxEMU (Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit).To begin the test, Wheelock and Whitson donned the spacesuits in the full-scale airlock on Starship’s airlock deck. The suits were pressurized using an external system that supplied air, electrical power, cooling, and communications. Each AxEMU included a full-scale model of the Portable Life Support System on the back of the suits. The astronauts assessed how easily the suits could be put on, taken off, and stowed in the airlock.Nasa and SpaceX engineers also evaluated the placement of mobility aids, such as handrails and ceiling straps, to assist astronauts in moving through the hatch and airlock. The astronauts practiced interacting with a control panel in the airlock to ensure the controls were accessible and functional while wearing gloves.“Overall, I was pleased with the astronauts’ operation of the control panel and with their ability to perform the difficult tasks they will have to do before stepping onto the Moon,” said Logan Kennedy, lead for surface activities in NASA’s HLS Program. “The test also confirmed that the amount of space available in the airlock, on the deck, and in the elevator, are sufficient for the work our astronauts plan to do.”The astronauts also tested the elevator designed to transport them from Starship’s airlock deck to the lunar surface. Whitson and Wheelock practiced opening the elevator gate, evaluating the dexterity of the AxEMU suit gloves, and lowering the ramp that will be used to take the next steps on the Moon.These steps are vital in preparing for the Artemis III mission, where SpaceX’s Starship HLS will dock with Orion in lunar orbit to transport two astronauts to and from the Moon’s surface. Axiom Space is providing next-generation spacesuits designed to accommodate a wider range of astronauts.With the Artemis program, Nasaaims to explore more of the Moon than ever before, learn how to live and work away from Earth, and prepare for future human exploration of Mars.","Nasa is preparing for a monumental milestone as astronauts gear up to walk on the Moon for the first time since 1972.

FBI director warns of Moscow-like attack in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-director-warns-of-moscow-like-attack-in-us/articleshow/110774536.cms,"NEW DELHI: FBI director Christopher Wray has alerted lawmakers to the increasing risk of a coordinated jihadist attack on American soil , akin to the deadly assault at Russia's Crocus City Hall . Speaking to a US Senate committee on Tuesday, Wray emphasized the need for heightened funding to bolster counter-terrorism efforts.

Wray's testimony outlined the severity of the terrorist threat, citing the March 22 attack at the Crocus concert venue near Moscow, which resulted in 145 deaths and over 500 injuries. The assailants, identified as Tajikistani nationals, used firearms and explosives to wreak havoc, leading to a devastating fire that trapped many victims. Russian authorities have implicated Ukrainian military intelligence, alleging the use of Islamist proxies.

""Just in the time that I’ve been FBI director, we’ve disrupted multiple terrorist attacks in cities and communities around the country,"" Wray stated. ""We need funding to continue protecting America from terrorism."" The FBI has requested a 6.2% budget increase to $11.3 billion for the next fiscal year, a move that comes amid Republican efforts to cut spending, a Russia Today report said.

Wray also highlighted the escalation of terrorist threats in the US following the onset of the Israel-Hamas war last October. He pointed to a ""rogues’ gallery of terrorist groups"" that have called for attacks on the US and its allies. ""Given those calls for action, our most immediate concern has been that individuals or small groups will draw a twisted inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks here at home,"" Wray explained. ""But now, on top of that, increasingly concerning is the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, not unlike the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russian concert hall back in March.""

The US has experienced a 60% increase in hate crimes, primarily targeting Jewish individuals, since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Wray noted that Jewish communities have been particularly vulnerable, facing threats from both domestic extremists and jihadists influenced by foreign terrorist organizations. ""They have the tragic distinction of really being targeted by almost every type of terrorist organization there is out there, foreign and domestic, across the spectrum,"" Wray said. ""And so, they desperately need our help, and we’re going to give it to them.""

Trump is scheduled to speak at a town hall in Phoenix organised by Turning Point, a conservative youth organisation that has seen its influence rise alongside Trump's takeover of the GOP.Trump responded defiantly to the verdict against him a day after a New York jury found him guilty last week of a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor. But he has not spoken directly to the swing-state voters who will decide the November election.He is likely to find a friendly audience at Turning Point. Led by Charlie Kirk , the group has harnessed the energy of young people drawn to Trump's Make America Great Again movement by cultivating conservative influencers and hosting glitzy events. And it's made Kirk and his allies wealthy.Nowhere is Turning Point's influence greater than in Arizona, the group's adopted home state where its loyalists have taken on prominent roles in the state GOP but have struggled to win general elections. Turning Point's slate of conservative candidates lost in the 2022 midterms, including Kari Lake, who lost the race for governor and is now running for US Senate.The group is looking to expand its influence this year to other battleground states and got a boost when Trump ousted former Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel in February. She was replaced by Trump's hand-picked successor, his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, who has spoken positively about working with Turning Point.President Joe Biden won Arizona in 2020 by about 10,000 votes. It was, along with Georgia, one of two states decided by less than half a percentage point and is expected to be close again this year.Arizona Republicans have enthusiastically embraced Trump's lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. State lawmakers commissioned an unprecedented partisan recount that confirmed his loss. Cochise County officials in southern Arizona are facing criminal charges for refusing to certify the 2022 midterm election results.Hours before Trump is scheduled to speak, Jake Hoffman, a Republican state senator who is also a top Turning Point consultant, will be arraigned for his role in an alleged plot to overturn Trump's loss in Arizona. Hoffman is accused of being a fake elector who signed a document falsely claiming to represent Arizona in the Electoral College.Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, is scheduled for arraignment in the same case on Friday.Despite the state's importance on the presidential map, Trump has not campaigned in Arizona since 2022, when he held a rally to support his slate of midterm candidates, all of whom ended up losing.Trump's trip west includes several private fundraisers and a rally on Sunday in Nevada, another battleground state he lost narrowly in 2020.",Trump is scheduled to speak at a town hall in Phoenix organised by Turning Point.

"Pakistan HC acquits Imran, Qureshi in state secrets leak case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-hc-acquits-imran-qureshi-in-state-secrets-leak-case/articleshow/110676116.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani high court acquitted Monday former PM Imran Khan and ex-foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , who were serving 10-year sentences after being convicted of leaking state secrets, known as the cipher case. An Islamabad HC division bench, comprising justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, delivered a short verdict, accepting their appeals against the convictions.

“The state had badly failed in proving its case and even its prosecutors had abandoned the case. Hats off to the honourable judges. It was a case of first impression. Imran and Qureshi did not do any anti-state activity,” remarked Imran’s counsel Salman Safdar following the verdict.

Despite the acquittal, Khan will remain imprisoned to serve his sentence in the “iddat” case, related to his alleged unlawful marriage to Bushra Bibi, his third wife. Both are serving seven-year jail terms after a trial court ruled that their 2018 marriage broke the law by not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called “Iddat”, after Bibi divorced her previous husband.

Qureshi remains on physical remand until June 5, accused of inciting violence on May 9 last year when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters stormed military and civilian govt assets following Imran’s arrest.

The 71-year-old former cricket star has faced a series of political and legal challenges since being ousted as PM in April 2022 after losing a confidence vote in parliament. A special court, constituted under Official Secrets Act, 1923, had convicted the two PTI politicians for sharing classified communication between Washington and Islamabad, which Khan claimed was part of a US conspiracy to overthrow his govt in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Washington and Pakistan’s military dismissed the allegation.

Khan’s conviction in the cipher case was one of three charges against him leading up to the Feb 8 elections this year, which he alleged were orchestrated to prevent his return to office. Last year, the same court overturned his conviction in a corruption case involving the unlawful sale of state gifts during his term from 2018 to 2022. The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes — the most expensive being $304,000.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was found guilty of leaking classified information to his ex-wife. The pair were also convicted of giving each other gifts worth more than $100,000. They were both sentenced to five years in jail.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110676153,imgsize-766298,width-400,resizemode-4/110676153.jpg"

The video referred to purported crimes by the Pakistani military during the civil war in East Pakistan and claimed former military dictator General Yahya was responsible.Strong backlash followed the posts, especially from government ranks who called it “alarming” and accused PTI of fuelling a narrative of “hatred and incitement” by drawing comparisons between Imran and Mujib.On Friday, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials visited the prison where Imran has been kept to quiz him over the post but he refused to meet them without lawyers. FIA has sent a notice to Imran on the matter.This was followed by a meeting of army commanders, which vowed to defeat what it termed “digital terrorism” by trying to induce despondency and sowing discord by peddling “blatant lies, fake news, and propaganda”. “The nation is fully cognisant of their ugly and ulterior motives and the designs of these nefarious forces,” General Munir was quoted army’s media wing as saying.Imran’s PTI had until recently been trying to disassociate itself from the controversial posts but “owned” them on his directions.

NEW DELHI: A Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country. His statements were made in the case of poet and journalist Ahmed Farhad Shah, who the lawyer said cannot be brought to the federal capital for court proceedings from PoJK, as he was in 'foreign territory' that does not come under the country's jurisdiction.During the session, additional attorney general Munawar Iqbal Duggal said that Farhad faced charges in PoK and was in custody until June 2. Duggal mentioned that Farhad's family had met him, suggesting that the habeas corpus petition should be dismissed.Presiding over the proceedings, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani considered the plea filed by Arooj Zainab, Farhad's spouse, as reported by Dunya News.Petitioner's counsel Imaan Mazari emphasised that her client sought not only her husband's return but also action against those responsible for his enforced disappearance.The HC emphasised that the case would only conclude upon Farhad's appearance in court.AAG Duggal argued that PoJK, with its own constitution and courts, was considered foreign territory. Judgments from Pakistani courts were treated akin to those from foreign courts, as per Dunya News.The petitioner's attorney informed the court that Farhad's family had traveled from Islamabad to the Dhirkot police station but were told upon arrival that he had been moved to Muzaffarabad due to terrorism-related charges. When questioned about Farhad's whereabouts before his May 29 detention, the Islamabad prosecutor general deferred to the PoK court.Justice Kayani remarked that everyone should work within the law, to which the prosecutor general maintained that he works within the law, reported Dunya News.""We have to determine the misuse of law,"" Kayani said to the petitioner's attorney's argument that the court should also consider cases involving the misuse of laws and procedures.The court adjourned the hearing of the case until June 7, rejecting the request to dispose of the petition for the recovery of poet Ahmed Farhad.","Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan- Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country.

"Improving energy resilience in Pakistan could avert 175,000 deaths by 2030, UNICEF says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/improving-energy-resilience-in-pakistan-could-avert-175000-deaths-by-2030-unicef-says/articleshow/110597885.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A new study by the United Nations children’s agency says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.UNICEF said improved energy resilience would also contribute $296 million to the country’s fragile economy over the next 20 years by reducing maternal, adult and infant mortality.The study, conducted by UNICEF’s Economist Impact Unit and released Friday, comes as Pakistan is experiencing an intense heatwave that has sickened thousands of people, further burdening the country's health care system.Temperatures in various parts of Pakistan soared as high as 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday. Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said. ""We need the private sector to play a bigger role as public sector resources will not be enough. This is everybody’s business.”","UNICEF says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.
