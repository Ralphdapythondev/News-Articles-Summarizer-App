Republican presidential nominee and former US President Trump brought his campaign to New York City on Sunday, holding a rally at Madison Square Garden where he took repeated jabs at Kamala Harris The former president opened the speech by asking if Americans were better off than four years ago, emphasising his intent to restore what he claimed Harris had broken. As part of his closing argument just 9 days before Election Day, Trump told the crowd, ""On issue after issue, Kamala broke it, but I’ll fix it,"" with supporters waving signs that read, “Trump Will Fix It.”During his speech, Trump touched on familiar themes, such as criticising Harris’s intelligence, describing the US as 'occupied' due to immigration, and pledging tariffs on foreign imports and outsourced jobs.He also repeated anecdotes from previous rallies, mentioning a SpaceX launch and defending New York City Mayor Eric Adams over facing federal charges and said that these all were done as he spoke on the city's migrant surge.Trump’s rally featured high-profile speakers, including Tucker Carlson, Elon Musk , Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr., Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Hulk Hogan, and House Speaker Mike Johnson.Former First Lady Melania Trump also made a rare campaign appearance, briefly introducing her husband.Musk, a favourite among Trump’s base, urged attendees to vote early, describing the election as a “real battle” and calling on them to get friends and family to the polls.Guest speakers at the rally sparked controversy, especially comedian Tony Hinchcliffe , who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage,” receiving mixed reactions from the audience. Harris’s team noted that, as at the same time she was in Philadelphia discussing her plans to support Puerto Rico with local voters. Tucker Carlson also stirred tension by mocking Harris’s racial identity, adding to the rally’s divisive tone.","Former US President Donald Trump held a rally at Madison Square Garden.

The Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina 's Awami League (AL), held influence in Bangladesh for over 15 years. However, following a student-led movement in August that led to Hasina's ousting and subsequent exile, BCL members now find themselves in hiding, facing actions taken by the interim government .A report by Al Jazeera states that over 50,000 BCL affiliates are struggling to continue their tertiary education. On October 23, the Bangladeshi interim government led by Muhammad Yunus banned BCL, labelling it a "" terrorist organisation .""The home ministry cited BCL’s history of violence, harassment, and exploitation of public resources over the past 15 years.An undergraduate student of applied chemistry told Al Jazeera, ""Not long ago, I was a voice of authority here. Now, I am running around like a fugitive with no probable future."" This sentiment reflects the struggles many BCL affiliates are experiencing.The unrest began in July when students protested against a controversial reservation system in government jobs, which they claimed favored supporters of the ruling party. Although the top court abolished the quota, the protests escalated, calling for the removal of Hasina’s government due to alleged human rights violations.Protesters stormed government buildings, including Hasina’s residence on August 5, forcing her to flee the country. Violence continued even after her departure, with Awami League members and students becoming targets. Many went into hiding or were detained.Shahreen Ariana and Saikat Raihan, BCL leaders from Rajshahi University, were arrested on October 18 on alleged “forged charges,” as reported by their families. Violence against Awami League-affiliated students spread, with incidents like the beating death of Shamim Ahmed and the mob killing of Masud.The interim government declared BCL banned under the Anti-Terrorism Act 2009, effective October 23. The law was originally enacted by Hasina's administration.For over a decade, BCL dominated campuses, while opposition student wings such as the Chhatra Dal and Islami Chhatra Shibir faced significant challenges.The Yunus government has since lifted the ban on Shibir, allowing opposition student groups to regain control of campuses.","Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) is the student wing of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League (AL) BCL members now find themselves in hiding, facing actions taken by the interim government.

That was down from the 279 seats they held previously and marked the coalition's worst election result since it briefly lost power in 2009. ""This election has been very tough for us,"" a sombre-looking Ishiba said. Komeito's Keiichi Ishii, who took over as that party's new chief last month, lost in his district.The biggest winner of the night, the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), had 143 seats so far, up from 98 previously, as voters punished Ishiba's party over a funding scandal and inflation. The outcome may force parties into fractious power-sharing deals to rule, potentially ushering in instability. A party needs 233 seats for majority.""This is not the end, but the beginning,"" CDPJ leader Yoshihiko Noda said, adding that his party would work with other opposition parties to aim for a change of govt. Ishiba said he would wait until the final results, likely due in the early hours of Monday, before considering potential coalitions or other power-sharing deals.The PM had called the snap poll immediately after being elected to head the party last month, hoping to win a public mandate for his premiership. His predecessor, Fumio Kishida, quit after his support fell due to anger over a cost of living crunch and the scandal involving unrecorded donations to lawmakers. The election also took place nine days before voters in the US - Japan's closest ally - head to the polls in another unpredictable ballot.The LDP has governed Japan for all but four years since 1955. It has held an outright majority since it returned to power in 2012 after a brief spell of opposition rule. It also lost office briefly in 1993, when a coalition of seven opposition parties formed a govt that lasted less than a year. Smaller parties, such as the Democratic Party for the People or the Japan Innovation Party, could now prove key to forming a govt.

MAGA megaphone Donald Trump is claiming that Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to convey accolades on his visit to McDonald's , amid reports that big-tech CEOs and billionaires are ""seeing the writing on the wall"" in the Presidential elections and therefore folding before Trump to avoid retribution.""I actually got a call from Sundar...the head of Google and he said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald's was one of the single biggest events we've ever had at Google,"" Trump claimed at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, repeating an assertion he made hours before on the Joe Rogan podcast.Trump has previously claimed such supplicatory calls from Apple's Tim Cook and Facebook/META's Mark Zuckerberg. As with Pichai, they too have refrained from confirming or denying the calls, likely so as to not offend the tetchy former President.Claiming calls from and conversations with prominent figures, including foreign leaders, has long been a Trump tactic. Some critics see them as fictional or hyperbolic or an inaccurate or self-aggrandizing rendering of the exchanges since they remain unconfirmed and uncontested.Trump frequently relates how he warned France's President Emmanuel Macron that would impose retaliatory tariffs on French wines and champagne if France did the same to American automobile industry, forcing him to back down. He also claims to have warned a Taliban leader, whom he refers to only by the first name ""Abdul,"" that he would bomb his house if US troops in Afghanistan are attacked.He once claimed, at a White House meeting with then Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked him to mediate on the Kashmir issue, forcing New Delhi to refute the claim. Such an invitation would be a departure from New Delhi's long-standing position that it is a bilateral matter, a stand successive US administrations have embraced.Typically, foreign leaders and business honchos who Trump claims made conciliatory calls, do not confirm the conversation -- likely so as to not offend him. But Trump's MAGA acolytes see these uncontested claims as proof of Trump's impending victory.""They’re either all trying to keep up with Elon Musk or they’re trying to get ahead of something they see coming,"" Charlie Kirk, a prominent Trump supporter and MAGA talking head, said on X. Another Trump supporter noted that ""when Fortune 500 CEOs start aligning towards the end of the election cycle, that should give everyone some indication of what's coming..these people have more skin in the game and know better to align early.""Trump has been unhappy with Google for some time now and has openly complained that it illegally uses a system to show only bad stories about him while featuring only good stories about Kamala Harris. He has also called for Justice Department prosecution of Google, failing which, he has warned he will do so ""when I win the elections.""Trump's claim of Pichai's outreach comes on the heels of two of America's largest dailies, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, owned by billionaires Jeff Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong respectively, spiking endorsements for Kamala Harris drafted by its editorial teams.",Donald Trump claims Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to convey accolades on his visit to McDonald's.

They come inside, just like they did to our country. Republicans are the party with a good sense of humour.”Hinchcliffe also compared Travis Kelce with OJ Simpson.

What power does US President get from Alien Enemy Act?



Detention and deportation: The President can detain or deport any male over 14 years old from an enemy nation if they are considered a potential threat.

Restrictions on movement and property: The President may also impose limitations on where these individuals can travel or require them to report regularly to government authorities.

Protection measures: The Act enables measures that, theoretically, protect the US by controlling or mitigating potential risks posed by foreign nationals from hostile nations.

Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday doubled down on his anti-immigration rhetoric, calling for the reintroduction of antiquated laws and the death penalty for migrants who commit violent crimes against American citizens or law enforcement officers.Speaking at a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York, Trump said that he plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.“I will invoke the Alien Enemy Act of 1798... think of that. That’s how far back... they had law and order… They had some tough ones. Get ready,” he told supporters.The law, dating back over two centuries, allows for the deportation of foreign nationals from enemy countries during wartime, underscoring Trump’s proposed approach to combat illegal immigration .The Alien Enemies Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Acts passed in 1798 by a Federalist-controlled Congress, aimed to regulate immigrants amidst rising tensions with France. Anticipating conflict, the act empowered the President to detain or deport foreign nationals from enemy countries during wartime, targeting recent immigrants who might align with US adversaries.Primarily directed at immigrants from France and Ireland, who were largely pro-French, the Alien laws raised the naturalization period from 5 to 14 years, authorized the detention of foreign nationals from enemy countries, and allowed the President to expel any alien deemed a security threat. Unlike other laws in the series, which restricted speech and extended citizenship requirements, the Alien Enemies Act remained in effect long-term, granting future presidents similar powers in subsequent conflicts.This act was one of the first to leverage immigration control as a national security measure.Earlier in Aurora, Colorado, Trump had announced "" Operation Aurora ,"" a proposed national initiative targeting undocumented migrants if he were to be re-elected. Addressing supporters in Aurora, Trump accused Vice President Kamala Harris of enabling illegal immigration, saying, “Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the Third World.” He described Aurora as ""overrun"" by Venezuelan gang members, despite local officials, including Republicans, refuting such claims.""I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer,"" Trump declared to the enthusiastic crowd in Aurora. Referring to a supposed “invasion” at the southern border, he called the United States “occupied America” and pledged mass deportations if re-elected.“November 5, 2024, will be liberation day in America,” he vowed, tying his promise to the election date.The former president’s portrayal of immigration as a national crisis comes despite statistics from the Aurora Police Department showing a decline in major crime rates since last year. Trump continued to characterize migrants as a threat, using language that suggested they posed a public health risk. “They’re very sick, very sick. They’re coming into our country… very, very sick with highly contagious disease,” he claimed.This rhetoric follows unproven claims Trump made at a previous rally, where he alleged that Haitian migrants in Springfield were “killing and eating pets”—a statement state authorities have dismissed as baseless.",The Alien Enemy Act of 1798 allows the President to detain or deport foreign nationals from enemy countries during wartime. It was passed in 1798 by a Federalist-controlled Congress to regulate immigrants amidst rising tensions with France. The act was one of the first to leverage immigration control as a national security measure.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114672106,imgsize-985473,width-400,resizemode-4/114672106.jpg"

McDonald’s on Sunday announced that Quarter Pounders will again be on its menu after testing ruled out beef patties as the source of the E. coli outbreak that killed one person and sickened at least 75 others across 13 states.The fast-food chain's Chief Supply Chain Officer, Cesar Pina , stated, ""We remain very confident that any contaminated product related to this outbreak has been removed from our supply chain and is out of all McDonald's restaurants,"" after the outbreak linked to quarter pounder hamburgers sickened nearly 75 people and caused one fatality, New York Times reported.The company confirmed that Quarter Pounders would not include raw slivered onions, which federal regulators suspect to be the likely cause of the outbreak.McDonald's referred to tests conducted in Colorado, the state with the highest number of reported cases.

What are the different types of advance voting?

When did advance voting begin?

Does one political party use advance voting more than the other?

What led to the partisan split in advance voting?

What will advance voting look like in 2024?

WASHINGTON: Voters had plenty to argue about in the 1972 election, but they overwhelmingly agreed that when it came time to vote, they would do so in person on Election Day .The act of voting was largely a communal experience that year, when roughly 95% of voters went to their local polling places and completed and submitted their ballots in person on a single day, according to a census survey at the time.That number would fall gradually over the next 50 years as states provided Americans with more options on how and when to vote.By 2022, only about half of the electorate voted at the polls on Election Day. The share of people voting before Election Day spiked to more than 70% in 2020, and votes cast by mail surpassed those cast on Election Day for the first time ever. That year, many states enacted emergency measures to temporarily expand vote-by-mail options to protect voters from the spread of Covid-19.""We've been on an upward trend of early voting over time as more states have adopted early voting options and voters have embraced them,"" said University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald , who tracks voter turnout and early voting. ""That's resulted in a greater share of early votes being cast each election cycle.""For most of that time, advance voting was a nonpartisan feature of elections, but a deep chasm formed between the parties on advance voting during and since the 2020 presidential election.Voting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.Advance voting refers to the range of options that people have to vote before Election Day, whether by mail or in person at an election facility.The term ""early voting"" can refer collectively to all voting that takes place before Election Day. Sometimes it refers explicitly to votes cast in person at local election offices or voting centers before Election Day.To avoid confusion, The Associated Press generally uses terms like ""advance voting"" or ""pre-Election Day voting"" to refer to that broader category and ""early in-person voting"" for the narrower one. ""Absentee voting"" usually refers to ballots cast by mail.Voting before Election Day includes both voting by mail and in-person voting conducted before Election Day.Early in-person voting tends to mimic the experience of voting in person on Election Day, down to the type of voting equipment used and the locations serving as voting centers. The main difference is that the voting is conducted before Election Day. The length of early in-person voting periods varies by state.Mail voting can be further divided into at least two smaller categories: ""no-excuse absentee voting,"" where any voter may request a mail ballot for any reason, and ""excuse-required absentee voting,"" where only voters with a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person on Election Day may vote by mail.Requiring an excuse to vote absentee, such as travel or illness, used to be the norm in most states. Today, a shrinking handful of states still require voters to provide an authorized excuse.A third category of mail voting is a hybrid of mail voting and early in-person voting: in-person absentee voting, where a voter submits (and sometimes fills out) a mail ballot in person at an elections office.A small but growing number of states conduct their elections predominantly by mail. Those states, plus a few others and the District of Columbia, automatically send every registered voter a ballot.Variations of absentee voting and voting over multiple days have been part of American elections since the nation's founding. Today's system of mail voting and early in-person voting took root more than a century ago. In 1921, Louisiana paved the way for a formalized early in-person voting system when its constitution specified that ""the Legislature may provide a method by which absentee voting will be permitted other than by mail.""Voting by mail is even older, but relatively few voters were allowed to take advantage of it as of 1972. Just two years later, Washington became the first state in the nation to allow any voter to request a mail ballot for any reason.By 2005, more than half the states adopted no-excuse absentee voting. Today, only Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire provide neither early in-person voting nor no-excuse absentee voting.Yes, but it wasn't always that way.Voting before Election Day steadily grew more popular in both Democratic and Republican-controlled states after 1972. Although there was a partisan split in some states that sometimes varied from election to election, polling from Gallup shows that nationwide there was little partisan divide on advance voting between 2004 and 2016. But the survey showed that voters' plans to use early voting sharply diverged along party lines in the 2020 presidential election.AP's VoteCast survey of the 2020 electorate found a similar result, with additional details on how the choice of voting method divided the electorate. About two-thirds of the votes cast by mail in that election were for Democrat Joe Biden , compared with about one-third for Republican President Donald Trump . In contrast, Trump won about two-thirds of the in-person Election Day vote, compared with about one-third for Biden.When it came to early in-person voting, there was a near-even split, with Trump having only the slightest advantage.Biden overperformed among those casting votes before Election Day, especially among mail-in voters, even in many states that Trump won by a wide margin, VoteCast showed.""This is just an across-the-board, national phenomenon,"" McDonald said.These patterns continued in the 2022 midterm elections, with Democrats accounting for the bulk of the mail vote, Republicans casting most of the Election Day vote and Republicans holding a small advantage in early in-person voting.McDonald noted that party behavior on pre-Election Day voting was, if anything, the opposite before 2020.""People who voted by mail tended to be more Republican than the people who voted in-person early,"" he said, but those patterns ""were suddenly turned upside down"" during the pandemic.During the 2020 election, Trump repeatedly disparaged, politicized and undermined mail voting, going as far as to block funding to the US Postal Service to thwart its ability to process mail ballots he claimed without evidence were susceptible to widespread tampering.Trump's messaging on mail balloting has been somewhat inconsistent. At times he has said ""absentee voting"" is "" good. "" But he also has claimed that mail voting is ripe for fraud, something not borne out by decades of mail voting conducted in every state. Trump himself has cast mail ballots on multiple occasions, including in the 2020 primaries.Trump's rhetoric seems to have taken a toll on Republican confidence in mail voting. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in 2023 found that 58% of Republicans were not very or not at all confident that mail votes would be counted accurately, compared with 32% in 2018. Among Democrats, confidence in the counting of mail ballots increased, from 28% saying they were very or extremely confident in 2018 to 52% in 2023.""We need to wait and see how 2024 plays out before we make definitive statements about what the early voting is telling us"" about the election, McDonald said.Absentee voting in some states began as early as mid-September, and more than half the states had begun some type of voting by October 1.","Voting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway. For most of that time, advance voting was a nonpartisan feature of elections.

What is Project 2025?

Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday launched a scathing attack on her opponent former President Donald Trump linked him to the far right play-book.During an interview with CBS Evening News, the Democratic hopeful said that Trumps name appears at least 300 times in Project 2025 and his running mate JD Vance has written the foreword to the book of the author of Project 2025""As you know, I am a former prosecutor.

Despite this, Trump has publicly distanced himself from the initiative, labeling some of its ideas as “seriously extreme.”The proposals in Project 2025, which include right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch, have been frequently criticized by Democrats . A Harris campaign official stated that the campaign has deliberately associated all of Trump’s policies with “Project 2025,” believing this branding resonates with voters, reported CNN.Though the Project 2025 report was released in April 2023, opposition to the document has intensified as Trump’s polling lead has grown. In response to the increased scrutiny, Trump has distanced himself from the proposal, stating on his social media platform, Truth Social, “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it.” He further characterized some of the project’s ideas as “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.”","Project 2025 is a 920-page document developed by the Heritage Foundation outlining potential policies and changes for a hypothetical second term of Donald Trump’s presidency.

Milley, according to Bob Woodward's recent book ""War,"" described Trump as a ""fascist to the core.""Vance launched a scathing attack on Kelly and accused him of having a ""world view that's so oppositional to peace."" When Tapper questioned whether all the former officials, including former Vice President Mike Pence, were going after Trump because they wanted to send people to war, Vance firmly agreed, stating that they had entered office believing they could control Trump when he expressed a desire for world peace.Trump himself has expressed regrets over some of his staffing choices, telling Joe Rogan that his biggest mistake was picking ""some people that I shouldn't have picked,"" describing them as ""neocons, or bad people, or disloyal people."" He also praised several hawkish Republicans in his orbit, such as former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Following Vance's interview, CNN aired a rebuttal from Liz Cheney, who accused Vance of going through ""unbelievable contortions"" to defend Trump, whom Vance had previously called ""America's Hitler"" during the 2016 campaign.

The New York City Police Department has beefed up the security outside Madison Square Garden as former US President Donald Trump and JD Vance are set to hold a campaign rally on Sunday.The NYPD officials are encouraging people to use the subways instead of driving as several road closures will be in place around Madison Square Garden and Penn Station to ensure safe environment for rally attendees, protesters, and city residents.Interim Police Commissioner Thomas Donlon confirmed the NYPD’s preparedness late Saturday, joining Mayor Eric Adams to discuss protocols for the event. “We are doing everything possible to minimize impact on New Yorkers,” Donlon said, while advising residents to avoid the area if they do not need to be there.“Tomorrow’s rally will be safe, it will be secure,” he added.33rd Street between Sixth and Eighth Avenues 32nd Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues 31st Street between Sixth and Eighth Avenues 30th Street between Sixth and Eighth Avenues Additionally, Seventh Avenue from 34th to 29th Street will be restricted to pedestrians. Though subway service remains unaffected, officials have advised residents and attendees to use public transit where possible, with special procedures in place for riders exiting stations around the Garden.NYPD has also deployed heavy weapons teams and counterterrorism units in preparation for the event. Commissioner Donlon emphasized the security measures in place, and said, “We are doing everything possible to minimize impact on New Yorkers,”He also added that officials are vigilant and ready to respond to any disruptions. Though there are currently no credible threats directed at the event, Adams acknowledged that protests are anticipated. “While we always respect and protect the right to peaceful protests, there will be zero tolerance for crime, blocking traffic, graffiti, or disorderly behavior,” Adams said.Trump's rally is part of his campaign's effort to draw media attention and rally supporters in the lead-up to the election, even in traditionally Democratic areas like New York.The Trump rally at Madison Square Garden is set to feature a diverse line-up of speakers from politics, business, media, and entertainment, each anticipated to energise the crowd and reinforce Trump's campaign message.","NYPD has deployed heavy weapons teams and counterterrorism units in preparation for the event.

The iconic venue and personal prestige

Strategic media magnet

A defiant message in blue territory

Possible boost for local races

Trump’s enduring ties to New York

Former President Donald Trump's decision to hold a rally at Madison Square Garden—well outside the typical battleground states—is leaving political observers curious. With New York heavily leaning Democratic, why would Trump stage an event here with just days left in his campaign? Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons behind this unusual choice.For Trump, the venue’s prestige is as much a draw as the potential for voter reach. Madison Square Garden , billed as “the World’s Most Famous Arena,” has hosted countless celebrities and iconic events. Trump, long drawn to the fame and legacy of such venues, likely views this rally as a significant personal milestone, underscoring his background in entertainment. From his RNC appearances to his frequent mentions of crowd size and venue stature, the rally lets Trump position himself among the notable stars who’ve graced the Garden’s stage.With New York City a media hub, Trump’s rally is designed to maximize press coverage. Even if New York isn’t in play electorally, the event will attract widespread media attention and amplify his message across states where votes are more competitive. His team anticipates heavy coverage of this high-profile location to boost visibility in the final days, capturing attention that reaches far beyond Manhattan.Holding a rally in Democratic stronghold New York isn’t just strategy; it’s a statement. For a city where Trump faced multiple legal challenges, including civil and criminal cases, a high-profile event like this serves as a defiant gesture. It’s a calculated move to reinforce his “outsider” persona and resonate with supporters nationwide by appearing bold, even on less favorable turf.Though New York is a safe state for Democrats in the presidential race, several House races in Long Island and the Hudson Valley are hotly contested. Trump’s presence could rally Republican voters, influencing turnout for down-ballot candidates in critical areas where Republicans hope to retain control of the House. The rally might not sway New York's overall vote, but it could help GOP candidates in these competitive districts.Despite relocating his residency to Florida in 2019, New York remains a city Trump frequents, partly due to his legal cases and personal ties to Trump Tower. The rally reflects his lingering connection to his hometown, even if the state’s political climate makes winning unlikely.In short, Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden is both symbolic and strategic — a unique move in a city where his support is limited but visibility is high. With the race nearing its conclusion, the rally showcases Trump’s characteristic showmanship and his team’s effort to keep him in the spotlight, especially where media coverage and turnout may benefit the broader Republican campaign.","Former President Donald Trump's decision to hold a rally at Madison Square Garden is leaving political observers curious.

He stated, ""Some KP ministers are more focused on benefits than promoting the goals of the PTI.""The MNA mentioned that he had received threats of expulsion from the party but asserted that such threats would not dissuade him. He indicated his plan to meet with the PTI founder to discuss the current situation in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government.

He noted that the officer has now been elevated to the position of senior superintendent of police (SSP) in Peshawar.The report further stated that the PTI leader stated that he would update Imran on grievances to confront the current situation within PTI's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leadership.

Karachi residents hold protest against water and electricity outage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-residents-hold-protest-against-water-and-electricity-outage/articleshow/114631810.cms,"Residents of Karachi on Saturday blocked Jahangir Road as a protest to ongoing water and electricity outages, as per The Express Tribune.During the past week, residents have been experiencing severe and unusual load-shedding, leading to power outages during the daytime.As a result of the protest, traffic police closed both lanes of Jahangir Road. To assist commuters traveling from Teen Hatti, the police offered an alternative route through PIB Colony.The factions of the Battagram Trade Union have announced a complete shutter-down strike and sit-in beginning Tuesday in response to the widespread power outage in Karachi district, Pakistan. Until then, the union will withhold electricity bill payments.The outrage affected small businesses like tailors and welders, creating a virtual halt in commercial activities. This has frustrated both residents and business firms in the same manner as they rely on electricity for their daily purposes.As per the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) department, ""The power cuts took place after an order taken by the High Court related to an alleged incident involving the assault of a female prisoner at the Battagram sub-jail.""Conversely, the trade union has rejected the explanation for the power outage, labeling it as ""ridiculous."" They argue that the daytime power outages are solely to ensure a continuous electricity supply at night for the ongoing operation of CCTV cameras in the sub-jail.The union further contended that the decision to cut power constitutes an ""economic murder"" of local traders, who have been unable to conduct business for over a week. Consequently, the union is urging immediate action to restore power supply in the area, aiming to safeguard the economic interests of both residents and business operators.","Residents of Karachi have been experiencing severe and unusual load-shedding, leading to power outages during the daytime.

Eight people were killed, and five others sustained injuries on Saturday when a suicide bomber triggered an explosion at a checkpoint near Mir Ali, a town situated in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, close to the Afghan border .The attacker detonated the bomb while riding on the back of a motorbike rickshaw, according to an unnamed local police officer who spoke to AFP.The casualties included four police officers, two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians. The police officer further stated that among the five wounded, three are in critical condition and have been moved to a nearby military hospital for treatment.An unnamed local government official corroborated to AFP the reported number of fatalities and injuries resulting from the attack.This comes a day after ten police officers were killed in an attack on a check post near the Afghan border.

The Pakistan Taliban , also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed the attack in a statement to AFP.Since the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan in 2021, Pakistan has faced a surge in terrorism, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which border Afghanistan. Recent anti-terror operations in North Waziristan led to the elimination of about a dozen militants this month. In the most recent operation Pakistani security forces killed nine insurgents, including a high-level target, in a shootout overnight in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban in the volatile northwestern region that borders Afghanistan, the military said Thursday.According to a Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, violence increased sharply in 2024, with a 90% surge in fatalities in the third quarter alone.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan authorities Thursday released Bushra Bibi , wife of jailed former PM Imran Khan , from prison in Rawalpindi, a day after Islamabad high court granted her bail in an alleged graft case involving purchase and sale of state gifts.Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31. She and her husband were convicted of corruption and illegal marriage just ahead of the Feb 8 polls in Pakistan. The Islamabad-based accountability court had sentenced the couple to 14 years in jail in what is known as the “toshakhana” (state repository) case.The case over allegations of illegal marriage had collapsed on appeal and Bibi’s graft sentence was suspended in July, allowing her to walk free from Adiala Jail where Imran remains imprisoned.She was, however, arrested again in a fresh graft case. In the new case, dubbed as “Toshakhana 2,” the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bvlgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader at a low price, causing a significant loss to the national exchequer. The gift set included a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings.A day earlier, HC judge Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb approved Bushra’s bail in the case, following which a special court issued her release orders, ending nearly nine months of her detention. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) hailed her release, with slogans of “welcome back Bushra Bibi.”“You have faced extremely difficult times, disgusting campaigns and character assassination attempts against you during your illegal time in jail. The Pakistani nation salutes your bravery,” PTI said in a post on X, confirming that Bibi had reached her Bani Gala residence in the federal capital.Meanwhile, the Islamabad HC on Thursday also ordered the jail administration to produce Imran by 3pm in court to facilitate his meeting with his lawyers. “I know you won’t implement my orders, but let me issue directions,” Justice Ijaz Ishaq Khan remarked during the hearing. The judge later softened his stance after jail authorities assured him that they would arrange Imran’s meeting with his counsels in prison.Imran and his party have been at crosshairs of an ongoing tussle between the executive and the judiciary, with the latter accusing the country’s powerful military and intelligence agencies of exerting pressure to secure favourable verdicts in political cases, particularly those involving the PTI chief.Imran has not physically appeared in a court since Aug last year, with all hearings being held in the high-security Rawalpindi prison.","Bushra Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31.

While the police dismiss the reports as "" fake news "" designed to incite unrest, protesting students see them as a rare opportunity to publicly address the issue of sexual assault.Despite the conflicting narratives, both sides acknowledge that the case has exposed legitimate concerns. Khadija Shabbir, a 21-year-old protester in Lahore , asserts that girls on campuses feel threatened. Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi, the senior officer investigating the case, admits that harassment is an extremely sensitive subject that most women in Pakistan have experienced to some degree.The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore. When authorities were unable to identify a victim, they dismissed the claims as a hoax. However, student protests erupted, leading to arrests and the closure of educational institutes across Punjab province.Students, who have been banned from officially organizing in unions for the past four decades, continue to protest, driven by a deep-rooted frustration with the lack of trust in authorities to take the matter of harassment seriously. Many protesters cite personal experiences of harassment as their primary motivation for participating in the movement.The Lahore High Court has announced a new committee of judges to investigate campus sexual harassment , indicating that authorities are acknowledging the validity of the protests. However, the confrontation between students and police is taking place amidst a broader crackdown on dissent in Pakistan, with student social media pages and online chat groups disappearing and officials pledging to prosecute those spreading misinformation.As the protests continue, women who have shared their experiences with harassment find themselves sidelined as the demonstrations sometimes turn violent, often led by men. Despite this, young female students remain determined to stand up for their rights and fight against sexual harassment on college campuses.","The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore.

ISLAMABAD: A court in Pakistan granted bail to the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in a case pertaining to the illegal sale of state gifts, his party said on Wednesday - a relief for the embattled politician who could see his spouse released from prison for the first time in months.Both Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , are currently in jail on multiple charges including illegally selling gifts worth more than 140 million rupees ($501,000) received during his 2018-2022 premiership from a state treasury known locally known as the "" Toshakhana "".The Islamabad High Court said Bibi was granted post-arrest bail for ""reasons to be recorded later,"" according to an order shared by the media office of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party.The Khans deny the charges and say they are trumped up by the government to victimise the 72-year-old former cricket star, who remains widely popular and whose candidates won the most seats in February's general election.PTI said a surety bond had been submitted for Bibi's release and hoped she would be freed from prison on Wednesday after ""264 days of unlawful incarceration"".Bibi, Khan's third wife, was first arrested in January. She was acquitted on charges of her marriage with Khan violating Islamic injunctions, but quickly arrested again in the state gifts case before she would be released.Khan has faced dozens of cases since he was removed as premier in 2022 and launched a protest movement against a coalition of his rivals led by current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .The Sharif-led government says it does not interfere in the judicial process.Khan's standoff with powerful military generals, who he says back Sharif, has spawned the worst political turmoil in decades in the nation of 241 million people.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, are currently in jail on multiple charges.
