According to Israel’s Channel 12, the terror leader is insisting that discussions revert to the original agreement put forward by President Biden in May.However, Sinwar, who has successfully evaded the IDF since the terror attack over 11 months ago, has a history of remaining silent, a tactic that has led to previous false reports of his death.During the Israeli military's operations in southern Gaza last December, multiple reports surfaced suggesting that Sinwar had been wounded or killed in an airstrike.","Yahya Sinwar is considered the mastermind behind the October 7 attacks.

Regional victory brings Germany's Scholz brief respite from growing pressure within party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/regional-victory-brings-germanys-scholz-brief-respite-from-growing-pressure-within-party/articleshow/113583143.cms,"More tensions in Berlin

BERLIN: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz 's Social Democrats (SPD) staved off the far-right in a regional election on Sunday, likely providing him only a brief reprieve from growing criticism of his leadership within his own party.The centre-left SPD staged a last minute comeback in the eastern state of Brandenburg, where they have ruled since reunification in 1990 and Scholz has his own constituency, to win the election on 30.9% of the vote.The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which had topped polls for the past two years in the state, won 29.2%, according to provisional official results by the State Electoral Commissioner.Still the AfD was up 5.7 percentage points since the last Brandenburg election five years ago, after it earlier this month became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War Two.The AfD party continues to gain momentum as it capitalizes on worries about a cost-of-living crisis in Europe's largest economy, irregular immigration and a possible escalation of the war in Ukraine due to German weapons deliveries to Kyiv.Moreover, three-quarters of those who voted for the SPD did not do so out of conviction but rather to fend off the AfD, according to the exit poll published by broadcaster ARD, in the election with a record turnout of 72.9%.Brandenburg's SPD premier Dietmar Woidke avoided campaigning with Scholz, Germany's least popular chancellor on record, and even criticized the federal coalition's policies and constant bickering.As such, the regional election results are unlikely to end the growing debate within the SPD over whether Scholz is the right person to lead the party into next year's federal election given what critics call his hesitant leadership and poor communication skills.Asked on Sunday if the SPD federal leadership was the right one, Woidke said this was not the right time to answer that question.""But we must also learn the lessons from this election,"" he said, noting the SPD needed to get closer to the people. ""Especially as the federal level is concerned, there is a lot of catching up to do in the coming months and years.""The SPD is polling just 15% at national level, down from 25.7% in the 2021 federal election. That is behind the AfD on around 20% and opposition conservatives on 32%.Last week, the mayor of Munich, Germany's third largest city, was the latest SPD party politician to suggest it should consider fielding the popular Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, 64, as its candidate for the 2025 elections.Party insiders say Scholz, 66, who already announced his intention to run for a second term, is unlikely to step aside and more senior officials remain loyal to him.The junior partners in Scholz's ideologically heterogeneous coalition suffered dismal performances in Sunday's election which could further stoke tensions in Berlin.The Greens fell below the 5% threshold to make it into the state parliament for the first time in two decades on 4.1%, while the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) scraped less than 1% of the vote.""Either the traffic light coalition shows that it can draw the necessary conclusions from these elections, or it will cease to exist,"" warned FDP Vice Wolfgang Kubicki. ""This is a matter of a few weeks. We won't wait until Christmas. We can't put the country through that.""Last week, FDP leader and finance minister Christian Lindner had called for an ""autumn of decisions"", giving a cryptic answer when asked if his party would break up the coalition.Still, analysts say the government is unlikely to fall apart given none of the three coalition parties would currently stand to gain from snap elections. Together they are currently polling at around 30% combined, less than the conservatives alone.",The centre-left SPD staged a last minute comeback in the eastern state of Brandenburg.

The mayor added, ""Now, let the Caravan begin its journey.

Trump’s favorability rating, meanwhile, saw a slight uptick, with 40% of respondents viewing him positively.A separate poll by CBS News shows a narrower lead for Harris, who was ahead by 4 percentage points, 52% to 48%, among likely voters.

Harris, 59, would make history as the first woman president if elected.Political analysts note that the race has shifted in recent weeks. ""She's been able to change this from a race that was a referendum on Joe Biden to a race that is a referendum on Donald Trump,"" said Amy Walter, editor in chief of the Cook Political Report, during an appearance on NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""As national polls show a close race, state-level results from key battlegrounds will likely determine the outcome, making endorsements like Ghalib’s significant as candidates vie for every vote.(With inputs from agencies)","Amer Ghalib, the mayor of Hamtramck, a Detroit-area suburb with a Muslim majority, has announced his endorsement of Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential election.

Election outcome:

Opposition results

Concession status:

Inauguration details:

Here are the key updates from Sri Lanka elections.

Economic focus

Campaign context: Economic hardships, stemming from a severe financial crisis, dominated the election campaign. Public anger was prevalent due to the ongoing austerity measures.

IMF agreement: Dissanayaka intends to modify the IMF deal rather than cancel it, with plans to reduce income taxes and sales taxes on essentials like food and medicine.

Historical context

Party background: Dissanayaka's party previously had marginal influence, winning less than 4% in the last parliamentary elections (2020). It led two failed uprisings in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in significant casualties.

Political shift: The current crisis has enabled a shift in public support toward Dissanayaka, who advocates for a new political culture to combat corruption.

Voter turnout

Participation: Approximately 76% of Sri Lanka's 17.1 million eligible voters participated in the election.

Geopolitical considerations

India-Sri Lanka relations: Dissanayaka's party assured India that Sri Lanka's territory would not be used against any nation, amid concerns about China's growing influence in the region.

Austerity measures and public sentiment

Wickremesinghe's tenure: The outgoing president's strict austerity measures stabilized the economy but led to increased poverty, with rates doubling to 25% between 2021 and 2022.

Public discontent: Widespread dissatisfaction with the previous government's policies was a key factor in Dissanayaka's rise.

Security and voting conditions

Election security: Thousands of police were deployed to ensure safety during the election, with a temporary curfew imposed post-voting despite no reported violence.

Celebration restrictions: No victory celebrations are allowed until a week after the final results are officially announced.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyy on Sunday arrived in the United States for a crucial visit to present Kyiv's plan to end two and a half years of war with Russia .Zelenskyy will present his proposals -- which he calls a ""victory plan"" -- to President Joe Biden , as well as presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.The visit comes after a summer of intense fighting: with Moscow advancing fast in eastern Ukraine and Kyiv holding on to swathes of Russia's Kursk region.It also comes as Kyiv has for weeks pressed the West to allow it to use long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia -- so far to no avail.When they meet at the White House on Thursday, Zelenskyy is expected to try to convince Biden to change his mind.On the first leg of his US visit, Ukraine's president visited a factory in Pennsylvania on Sunday that produces badly needed 155mm artillery shells.""I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant,"" Zelenskyy said Sunday in a post on X, formerly Twitter.The post included photos of him shaking hands with workers at the plant, where he said production had been ramped up.""It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,"" he wrote.He will next travel to New York and Washington.Zelenskyy said the coming weeks would decide how more than 30 months of fighting that has killed thousands would end.""It is now being determined what the legacy of the current generation of states leaders will be. Those in the highest offices,"" he said.In comments before his trip, Zelenskyy said the United States and UK have not given Ukraine permission to use the long-range weapons as they fear escalation, but hinted he had not given up hope.""We have had some decisions in the history of our relationship with Biden -- very interesting and difficult dialogues,"" Zelenskyy said earlier this week, adding: ""He later changed his point of view.""Moscow has said it considers such a go-ahead as NATO countries being ""at war"" with Russia.- 'Fair and stable peace' -A close adviser to Biden said this month that the US leader would use his remaining time in office to ""put Ukraine in the best possible position to prevail.""No details on Ukraine's plan have been made public.Zelenskyy said Biden would be the first foreign leader to see the plan ""in full"" -- saying it will then also be presented to ""all leaders of our partner countries.""Zelenskyy plans to present the proposals to the US Congress , Harris and Trump. The White House has said he will meet with Democratic Vice President Harris separately from Biden, and Zelenskyy has said he expects to meet with Republican Trump on Thursday or Friday.Harris has indicated she would continue Biden's policies on Ukraine, while Trump has been hugely critical of Washington's massive aid packages for Kyiv.Zelenskyy said earlier this week that the plan envisages that ""war will not return to us again in an even bigger wave"" in years to come.He has said Kyiv plans to hold meetings throughout autumn and that the ""entire plan"" will be ready by ""early November.""The proposals, he told the media Friday, envisage ""quick and concrete steps by our strategic partners.""One of those steps, he said, is ""related to strengthening Ukraine's weapons capabilities"" while another demands a ""clear place for Ukraine in the world's security architecture"".Zelenskyy has also said he plans to invite Russia to a possible second international peace summit in November.But Moscow this weekend said it would not attend and referred to President Vladimir Putin's conditions to enter talks: that Ukraine surrender four of its regions.""I think both are still betting on the possibility of a military victory,"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told CNN Sunday.Russian attacks on Ukraine killed six people -- including two children -- this weekend, while a strike on the city of Kharkiv wounded 21 people in a residential neighbourhood.Ukraine said it struck two arms depots in Russia, with Kyiv's army saying it hit a key ammunition storage base important to the Russian army's logistics for its invasion.",Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyy arrives in the United States for a crucial visit.

This could happen due to an online ancestry test, old photos, and newspaper clippings, AP reported.Luis Armando Albino , now a father, grandfather, and retired firefighter, was located by his niece, Alida Alequin , with help from the FBI , Justice Department, and Oakland police .The Bay Area News Group reported Friday that Albino had been living on the East Coast.Although Albino has chosen not to speak to the media, Alequin shared her relief and hope for other families in similar situations. “I was always determined to find him,” she said. “Who knows, with my story out there, it could help other families going through the same thing. I would say, don’t give up.”Albino’s disappearance began on February 21, 1951, when a woman lured him away from a West Oakland park by promising candy. She abducted him and flew him to the East Coast, where he was raised by a couple as their own son.His family, however, never stopped searching for him, with his photo hanging in their homes. Albino’s mother, who passed away in 2005, always believed he was alive.Alequin’s determination to find her uncle began with an online DNA test she took in 2020. The test revealed a 22 per cent match with a man who turned out to be her uncle.Though initial efforts didn’t yield any contact, her persistence paid off in 2024 when she searched through old Oakland Tribune articles and discovered a picture of Luis and his brother, Roger, which convinced her she was on the right track. She immediately approached Oakland police with the lead.Soon after, a missing persons case was reopened, and through DNA testing, Albino was confirmed to be alive. In June 2024, investigators informed Alequin and her mother that Albino had been found. “We didn’t start crying until after the investigators left,” Alequin recalled. “I grabbed my mom’s hands and said, ‘We found him.’ I was ecstatic.”Albino travelled to Oakland on June 24, where he reunited with his family. He also visited his brother Roger in Stanislaus County, California . ""They grabbed each other and had a really tight, long hug,"" said Alequin. The reunion was heartfelt, as they reminisced about their childhood, the day of the abduction, and their military service.","Luis Armando Albino, 6, was abducted from a park in Oakland, California, in 1951.

Sean Diddy was arrested on charges of sex crime and could face at least 15 years in prison. The pop mogul has not pleaded guilty and is awaiting trial. According to the indictment, he used his power to organize Freak off sessions which continued for days where he used to force female victims to engage with male sex workers.With Diddy going down, several pop stars are now at stake with their previous involvement with Diddy. Reports claimed Justin Bieber was also a victim of Diddy's sexual assault.

Although the bench rejected the request to completely halt the legal proceedings, it granted relief by restraining the accountability court from issuing a final verdict.Khan and Bibi's lawyers argued that recent amendments in anti-corruption laws make the charges against the former prime minister and his wife invalid.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.

We are requesting the authorities once again through social media. It is their responsibility to provide these facilities,"" he said.""It's been 49 years, and we still do not have a medical unit. It is very disheartening for us. The nearest. As the next health unit is around 8-10 kilometres away from here and the next one to that is even further,"" he added.In the report, local residents, including the councillor, lamented the inadequate development and facilities in PoJK, which is grappling with significant socio-economic challenges .They said that this persistent lack of development and the perceived indifference of successive governments have fostered a sense of alienation and frustration among its residents.Other than the medical facility, the area also lacks other basic amenities, such as safe drinking water.Now PoJK struggles with a mix of historical issues, administrative difficulties, and socio-economic challenges that impact its current conditions. The region's complex political status and governance problems continue to hinder its development and affect the quality of life for its residents.","Residents of Pakistan-occupied Jammu-Kashmir ( PoJK) have been suffering due to infrastructural underdevelopment and a lack of basic medical facilities. Despite numerous complaints to the authorities, have not seen any substantial changes on the ground, local media reported.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113365987,imgsize-691749,width-400,resizemode-4/113365987.jpg"

The investigation will focus on allegations that these accounts have been used to incite chaos and anarchy in the country, as well as to undermine national security.“He (the PTI founder) should be ashamed of undermining the national security, inciting people for anarchy and committing the sedition,” the minister said, as reported by APP.He added that there had been a failed attempt to conspire against the sitting chief justice and leaders of other institutions. The posts were aimed at inciting people against two major state institutions, an action he described as highly condemnable.Imran's social media team had posted a video on his X account comparing past and present military leaderships, along with a statement urging people to review a judicial commission report on Pakistan's breakup.“Every Pakistani should study the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and get to know who was the true traitor, General Yahya Khan or Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” said a quote attributed to Imran.The posts also featured images of the current civilian and military leaders, alleging that they had stolen the mandate of Imran’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the February general elections.","Imran Khan has been booked for inciting government officer to mutiny, and committing'sedition,' through his social media posts.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.
