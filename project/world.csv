Infant killed after Chimpanzee snatches her from mother's arms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/infant-killed-after-chimpanzee-snatches-her-from-mothers-arms/articleshow/113720254.cms,"AI-generated image

A chimpanzee recently grabbed an infant from her mother and killed her, sparking outrage in Guinea .The mutilated infant's body was found 3 kilometers from the Nimba Mountains Nature Reserve , a Unesco World Heritage Site . The child's mother, Seny Zogba, told Reuters, ""I was working in a cassava field when a chimpanzee came up from behind, bit me, and pulled my baby into the forest.""Following the incident, residents near a chimpanzee research center in Guinea attacked the facility on Friday.According to the center's managers, the angry crowd destroyed the building and set fire to equipment like drones and computers. They also ransacked over 200 documents.Ecologist Alidjiou Sylla said that food shortages in the reserve are causing chimpanzees to leave the protected area more often, increasing the likelihood of attacks. The research center has documented six chimpanzee attacks on humans in the reserve this year.The forests in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone harbor the critically endangered western chimpanzee. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature , their population decreased by 80% from 1990 to 2014. Only seven western chimpanzees remain in Guinea's Bossou forest, part of the Nimba Mountains Nature Reserve, near local farming communities.In Guinea, chimpanzees are traditionally respected and often given food, which sometimes leads them to human settlements where they may attack, according to Reuters. The Nimba Mountains also contain significant iron ore reserves, raising environmental concerns about the impact of mining on chimpanzees.","The infant's body was found 3 kilometers from the Nimba Mountains Nature Reserve.

'Gaza no longer fit for life': Palestinian President paints grim picture at UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/we-will-not-leave-palestinian-president-mahmoud-abbas-demands-un-action-to-end-israel-hamas-war/articleshow/113720420.cms,"Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (PTI file photo)

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas delivered a forceful plea to the UN General Assembly on Thursday, beginning his speech by declaring three times, ""We will not leave,"" as he called for immediate action to halt the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.""Palestine is our homeland. It is the land of our fathers, our grandfathers. It will remain ours, and if anyone were to leave, it would be the occupying usurpers,"" Mahmoud Abbas said.Abbas warned that Gaza has been almost entirely destroyed and is no longer fit for human life, urging the international community to intervene and end the devastation.""This madness cannot continue. The entire world is responsible for what is happening to our people,"" he said, addressing the 193-member body.Abbas also emphasised that his government would not tolerate any territorial loss, saying, ""We will not allow a single centimeter of Gaza to be taken.""Moreover, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for Israel's removal from the United Nations, accusing the country of repeatedly defying UN resolutions regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""Israel, which refuses to implement United Nations resolutions, does not deserve to be a member of this international organisation,"" Abbas said during his address to the UN General Assembly. His remarks follow the UN's earlier recognition of Palestine's eligibility for full membership.The conflict erupted on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants launched a deadly assault on Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli reports.In response, Israel’s military has carried out extensive strikes across Gaza, which Palestinian health authorities claim have killed more than 41,000 people. The assault has displaced almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million residents, leading to severe food shortages, disease outbreaks, and mounting casualties.While countries like the US, Qatar, and Egypt have attempted to mediate a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, no resolution has been achieved.Abbas called for a complete ceasefire, an end to Israeli settler violence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory.He also insisted that the Palestinian Authority , under his leadership, should take full control of Gaza, including the management of its borders, particularly the Rafah crossing. He reiterated that elections would be held once peace is restored.In response, Israel's UN Ambassador Danny Danon criticised Abbas for focusing on diplomacy without condemning the Hamas attack that triggered the current war.","Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas delivered a forceful plea to the UN General Assembly on Thursday.

NEW YORK: Pulitzer Prize-winning fiction writer Jhumpa Lahiri has declined to accept an award from the Noguchi Museum in Queens next month in disapproval of its new ban on political dress for its staff, which led to the firings of three employees who had worn kaffiyehs to signal solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip .""Jhumpa Lahiri has chosen to withdraw her acceptance of the 2024 Isamu Noguchi Award in response to our updated dress code policy,"" according to a statement emailed by the museum Wednesday.""We respect her perspective and understand that this policy may or may not align with everyone's views,"" the statement said of Lahiri. ""We remain committed to our core mission of advancing the understanding and appreciation of Isamu Noguchi's art and legacy while upholding our values of inclusivity and openness.""The museum, founded nearly 40 years ago by Noguchi, a Japanese American designer and sculptor, announced last month that during their working hours employees could not wear clothing or accessories that expressed ""political messages, slogans or symbols.""The policy, which does not apply to visitors, was instituted after several staff members had, over a period of months, often worn kaffiyehs -- scarves associated with Palestinians -- for what one fired employee termed ""cultural reasons."" The museum defended the prohibition earlier this month, saying in a statement that ""such expressions can unintentionally alienate segments of our diverse visitorship."" A significant majority of staffers signed a petition opposing the rule.Lahiri and Lee Ufan, a Korean-born minimalist painter, sculptor and poet, were to have received the Isamu Noguchi Award at the museum's fall benefit gala next month. Ufan could not be reached for comment Wednesday but is still scheduled to receive the award, the museum said.Lahiri, who was born in London, won the 2000 Pulitzer for fiction for her debut, the story collection ""Interpreter of Maladies,"" and has since published several books of fiction and nonfiction in English and Italian. She is also the director of the creative writing program at Barnard College. Through her literary agent, Lahiri declined to comment.Questions of how to express solidarity with Israelis or Palestinians have divided cultural institutions since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages. Israel's subsequent invasion of the Gaza Strip has killed more than 41,000 people, according to local health authorities.Lahiri was one of thousands of scholars who signed a letter to university presidents in May expressing solidarity with campus protests against Israel's military campaign in Gaza, calling it ""unspeakable destruction.""The museum's budget is supported by royalties from furniture and lighting designs by Noguchi, who died in 1988. The staff petition alludes to his voluntary internment in an Arizona detention camp for Japanese Americans during World War II in an effort to improve conditions there.","Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Jhumpa Lahiri declines to accept award from Noguchi Museum.

DHAKA: The Bangladesh interim govt’s chief adviser, Prof Muhammad Yunus , has ruled out any chance of him running for election. “No way, that’s not me,” Yunus said, adding that he had no plans to run for office. “Do I look like someone who would run,” he asked while responding to a question during a conversation at the “New York Times Climate Forward Event” on Wednesday.On ousted PM Sheikh Hasina , Yunus said that should be extradited.“Why shouldn’t she be? If she committed crimes, she should be extradited and brought to justice. You are pleading for justice. She too should have to face justice.”Referring to Hasina, law af fairs adviser Asif Nazrul had recently said Bangladesh would definitely seek extradition of any convicted person under its extradition treaty with India. Hasina, who fled Bangladesh on Aug 5, faces several cases.Responding to a question on street justice, Yunus said people abroad are getting exaggerated news and invited journalists to come and write whatever they see with their own eyes. He also said elections should not be too far away as reform initiatives have been taken.","The interim govt’s chief adviser, Prof Muhammad Yunus, has ruled out any chance of him running for election. “Do I look like someone who would run,” he asked while responding to a question during a conversation at the “New York Times Climate Forward Event” on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113720198,imgsize-1312807,width-400,resizemode-4/113720198.jpg"

Trump blasts Zelenskyy

WASHINGTON: The Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives demanded that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ""immediately fire"" his ambassador to the United States on Wednesday, a day before Ukraine's leader was due to visit the U.S. Congress.Some Republicans, particularly those closest to former President Donald Trump, have been fuming over Zelenskyy's visit on Sunday to an ammunition plant in President Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania is one of the swing states seen as crucial to victory in the Nov. 5 presidential election.During the trip, Zelenskyy appeared with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - who has campaigned for Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris - Senator Bob Casey and U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright. All are Democrats.""The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because - on purpose - no Republicans were invited,"" wrote Johnson, who is not expected to meet with Zelenskyy when the Ukrainian leader comes to Congress.""The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,"" he said.The Ukrainian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.Trump has repeatedly criticized the Ukrainian president on the campaign trail this week.""Those cities are gone, they're gone, and we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refused to make a deal, Zelenskyy. There was no deal that he could have made that wouldn't have been better than the situation you have right now,"" Trump said on Wednesday. ""You have a country that has been obliterated, not possible to be rebuilt.""The former president also blamed Biden and Harris for Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.The Republican-led House Oversight Committee had already announced that it would investigate whether Zelenskyy's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris' campaign.It is common practice for governors to meet with foreign leaders who travel to their states. In July, Zelenskyy visited a factory in Utah and was hosted by that state's Republican governor, Spencer Cox.Additionally, a series of foreign leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have traveled to Florida, in recent months to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home. Trump won Florida by only 3 percentage points in the 2020 election, and recent polls have shown a close race there between Harris and Trump.On Thursday, Zelenskyy is expected to thank congressional leaders for approving billions of dollars in funding for his country as it grapples with a 2-1/2-year-long Russian invasion, and to make the case for more.After becoming speaker last year, Johnson, who had voted repeatedly against aid for Kyiv, waited until April before allowing the House to vote on Biden's October request for financial assistance for Ukraine.However, he said on Wednesday his letter to Zelenskyy was not a threat to stop funding.""I'm not making any threats,"" he told reporters.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to visit the U.S. Congress on Thursday.

Justin Trudeau: Canadian PM Justin Trudeau survives no-confidence vote amid conservative pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-survives-no-confidence-vote-amid-conservative-pressure/articleshow/113678502.cms,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: Reuters)

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau narrowly survived a vote of no confidence, with 211 lawmakers opposing and 120 in favour, on Wednesday, according to AFP news agency. This vote comes in the wake of heightened scrutiny from the opposition, particularly from Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre , who is eager to capitalise on the political system following the recent collapse of the coalition agreement between the Liberals and the New Democratic Party (NDP).The no-confidence motion was introduced by Poilievre on Tuesday, which followed a debate in Parliament where he criticised Trudeau for failing to address pressing issues such as high living costs, housing crisis, and rising crime rates. “After nine years of Liberal government, the promise of Canada is broken,” said Poilievre noting the doubling of national debt under Trudeau’s leadership. He pledged to implement ""a common sense plan to reduce the tax (on carbon emissions), build homes, fix the budget and stop the crime"" if elected.“People are hurting. People are having trouble paying for groceries, paying for rent, filling up the tank,” said Trudeau on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert acknowledging that many Canadians are “looking at change.” Also, highlighting the challenges Canadians are facing, Trudeau asserted that he remains committed to ""keep fighting"" to improve their situation.Poilievre has vowed to continue pushing for an election, with another attempt to bring down the government expected as early as next week.Despite Poilievre's attempts to unseat Trudeau, other opposition parties have pushed back against his right-wing agenda. Liberal House leader Karina Gould condemned the Conservatives for “playing games,” labelling the no-confidence motion as “pretty lame.”Trudeau, who first came to power in 2015, has previously fended off two of Poilievre’s predecessors in elections in 2019 and 2021. The NDP’s withdrawal from the coalition, intended to maintain government stability until late 2025, has left the Liberals vulnerable. A recent Angus Reid poll shows the Conservatives leading the Liberals by a significant margin, with 43% of voting intentions compared to 21% for the ruling party. Political analysts suggest that an election is unlikely until spring 2025.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau narrowly survived a vote of no confidence, with 211 lawmakers opposing and 120 in favour.

Hezbollah targets Tel Aviv for first time



Israel has asked its troops to prepare for a ""possible entry"" into Lebanon to ""continue degrading Hezbollah ,” after the Iran-backed organisation targeted Tel Aviv for the first time.However, a Pentagon spokesperson said that an Israeli ground incursion did not appear ""imminent"".Meanwhile, Lebanon's prime minister Najib Mikati told the UN Security Council that Israel was violating its sovereignty and called for an immediate ceasefire.Further, France introduced a proposal for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon during UN diplomatic efforts with the United States. The announcement followed discussions at the United Nations between Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, and was presented during an emergency Security Council session.US President Joe Biden warned that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah risks escalating into an ""all-out war"".Meanwhile, France and the US are working on a 21-day ceasefire plan to push for a temporary ceasefire to ease the rising tensions, which have resulted in over 600 fatalities in Lebanon in recent days.""We are counting on both parties to accept it without delay,"" French foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot told the UN Security Council.An Israeli official revealed that PM Netanyahu has approved the pursuit of a potential deal, contingent upon the return of Israeli civilians to their homes.A Lebanese official described the ongoing efforts as ""very serious"" and, when asked about the potential for a ceasefire, he indicated it was ""not wishful thinking"". He suggested that, if an agreement is reached, it would likely initiate with a four-week ceasefire.After Hezbollah launched missile attacks at Tel Aviv, Israel alerted its troops for a ""possible"" entry into Lebanon to continue its offensive against Hezbollah.""We are attacking all day, both to prepare the ground for the possibility of your entry, but also to continue striking Hezbollah,"" Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi said.It remained unclear whether Halevi was alluding to a ground operation, airstrikes, or another form of retaliation against Hezbollah.Recently, the Israeli military had said that it had no immediate plans for a ground invasion, but Halevi's remarks were the strongest indication yet that troops could be deployed.The Israeli military had shot down a Hezbollah missile targeting Tel Aviv, marking the first instance of the Iranian-backed militia directly aiming at the city.The counter strikes from Israel resulted in at least 51 fatalities and 223 injuries, according to Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad.Since Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones at Israel on October 8 in support of Hamas' earlier attack, approximately 60,000 Israelis have evacuated their homes. Meanwhile, Lebanon's foreign ministry reported that around 500,000 Lebanese have been displaced due to heavy airstrikes by Israeli jets over the past week.","US President Joe Biden warned that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah risks escalating into an ""all-out war"" France and the US are working on a 21-day ceasefire plan to push for a temporary ceasefire to ease the rising tensions.

Dubai, renowned for its opulent skyscrapers like the Burj Khalifa and Princess Tower, epitomises luxury and a high quality of life. Each year, countless individuals flock to this vibrant desert metropolis in search of better opportunities and brighter futures. Yet, the story behind Dubai’s impressive skyline often overlooks the lives of the many labourers who work tirelessly to construct it.A significant portion of these workers come from India, earning daily wages as construction labourers in this bustling city.Recently, a viral video has shed light on the harsh living conditions faced by Dubai’s labourers, igniting widespread outrage. This heartbreaking reality was brought to the forefront by Instagram user Md Rafique, whose video revealed a seldom-seen aspect of Dubai: the overcrowded and inadequate living spaces many workers endure. The viral video reveals the living conditions of many migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, providing internet users with a stark glimpse into their struggles. The footage, which is circulating widely online, has ignited significant debate about the inhumane conditions these workers face.The footage shows a large hall with a tin roof, packed with shabby dormitories stacked closely together. Rows of bunk beds stretch on, illustrating the cramped quarters that thousands of workers call home after long, gruelling days on construction sites.The makeshift accommodations house workers from various countries, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, China, and India. After labouring under the relentless sun, these men return each night to rest in conditions that offer little comfort.The video has struck a chord with viewers, amassing over two million views and sparking discussions about the plight of these labourers. Comments reflect a mix of sympathy and outrage. One viewer lamented, “This is heartbreaking! They deserve so much better for all their hard work.” Another emphasised the need for advocacy for change, while some shared personal experiences, with one recalling, “I worked in Dubai years ago and witnessed this firsthand. It’s time the world knows.”Many have likened the situation to an animal farm. Pranav Roy remarked, “It’s no different than a chicken farm .” Tushar Jalavadiya advised, “You might as well stay in India with your family; no one should have to earn money under such conditions.” Radhika commented, “They claim to earn well in Dubai, but the reality is revealed online.” Ashwani Atwal stated, “It’s nothing more than a jail.”However, not all feedback was negative. Adil Chaudhary pointed out that workers receive a three-hour break during the summer, and that there are air-conditioned rooms and toilets available. He also noted that buses transport workers to and from their living quarters, with a rule that no room can house more than six people in Dubai.Many are calling for greater accountability from the companies employing these workers, with one comment stating, “These companies need to be held responsible for the living conditions of their workers!”","A viral video has shed light on the harsh living conditions faced by Dubai’s labourers.

Forced confession and fabricated evidence

Fight for justice

Iwao Hakamada, world's longest-serving death row prisoner, was acquitted on Thursday, five decades after being wrongfully convicted of murdering four of a family in 1968, reported CNN.The 88-year-old spent 46 years behind bars before DNA evidence led to his release in 2014, sparking widespread debates over Japan 's criminal justice system , which has been criticised for its heavy reliance on confessions.Hakamada, once a professional boxer, used to work at a soybean processing plant in Shizuoka when his boss and the boss's family were found murdered in 1966.After police interrogation and alleged beatings, Hakamada confessed to the crime but later retracted his statement, claiming his confession had been coerced. Despite this, he was convicted, largely based on bloodstained trousers found in a miso tank, which prosecutors claimed were his.However, years later, new evidence, including DNA tests, revealed that the blood on the trousers did not belong to Hakamada or the victims.The court ruled on Thursday that the clothing, which was key to his conviction, had been planted long after the murders. This admission has raised serious questions about the integrity of Japan’s legal process and its handling of evidence.Hakamada's long fight for exoneration was led by his sister, Hideko , now 91, who has campaigned tirelessly for his release. She highlighted the psychological toll of his time on death row, stating that her brother now lives in his own world, barely recognising reality. His case has become emblematic of the issues within Japan's judicial system, where prosecutors are known to prioritise confessions over concrete evidence.Hakamada awaited execution in solitary confinement for nearly half a century, in a system where death row prisoners are often held in secrecy and executed without prior warning to their families. His case has also intensified calls for the abolition of the death penalty in Japan, the only G7 country, aside from the United States, to retain capital punishment .Hakamada's ordeal has not only exposed the deep flaws in Japan’s legal system but also fuelled ongoing debates about the country's reliance on confessions and its use of the death penalty.Amnesty International and other human rights groups have used Hakamada’s case as a rallying cry for reform, urging Japan to reconsider its judicial practices.","Iwao Hakamada, 88, was convicted of murdering four family members in 1968. He spent 46 years on death row before DNA evidence led to his release. His case has sparked widespread debates over Japan's criminal justice system. It has been criticised for heavy reliance on confessions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113694523,imgsize-1176554,width-400,resizemode-4/113694523.jpg"

Calling China a “major threat”, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has emphasised that stronger Indo-US ties could be mutually beneficial in addressing China’s influence. He also expressed confidence that Republicans “will win this election handily”, though he admitted “we’ve a competitive race all the way through November”.In an exclusive interview to Times Now, he highlighted India’s border issues with China and raised New Delhi’s stance on Taiwan.“I think China presents a major threat to both India’s security in the future, as well as the long-term security interests of the US,” he said, adding that “there could be opportunities when we think about production and trade relationships between the US and India, where that could be mutually beneficial to both the US and India and provide greater stability.”On Taiwan, he remarked, “God forbid, if something happens in a China-Taiwan scenario in the future. Knowing where India stands in that situation, I believe, could actually help prevent the conflict if it’s made clear from the outset.”When asked about his Indian-origin and Hindu identity and if it was a hurdle to his aspirations for the top job, he said: “I think people actually reward that authenticity. I think the USA is religiously, racially the most tolerant, and I would say one of the most ambitiously inclusive countries in human history.”Reflecting on his failed presidential bid, Ramaswamy said he was “disappointed” but kept his focus on the learnings. When asked if he would run for president in 2028, he said, “We will see what the future holds in store.”","Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has emphasised that stronger Indo-US ties could be mutually beneficial.

California governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law on Thursday, formally apologizing for slavery and its effects on Black Americans in the state.As per the news agency AP, this law is part of a series of reparations bills aimed at addressing racial disparities that have persisted for decades.""The State of California accepts responsibility for the role we played in promoting, facilitating, and permitting the institution of slavery, as well as its enduring legacy of persistent racial disparities,"" Governor Newsom said in a statement.Earlier, Newsom vetoed a bill that would have helped Black families reclaim or receive compensation for property taken through eminent domain . This bill could not take full effect because another bill to create a reparations agency was blocked.Though California has made significant progress, there was no legislation this year for direct payments to African Americans, disappointing some advocates.

""We need to know what books are banned, and we need a mechanism for removing books off of that list.""California, although entering the union as a free state in 1850, implemented policies that hindered Black people from owning homes and starting businesses. According to a state reparations task force report, Black families faced terrorism, aggressive policing, and pollution in their neighbourhoods.While efforts to study reparations at the federal level have stalled, states like Illinois and New York and cities like Boston and New York City have taken steps to study reparations.

US vice president Kamala Harris ’ presidential campaign has come under debate for its extensive use of private jets , spending millions on air travel despite her strong advocacy for urgent climate action , as per Fox News . Harris secured the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek re-election. The campaign has spent at least $3.8 million on private flights in just six weeks, according to a review of Federal Election Commission (FEC) records.The Harris campaign made payments to various private jet companies, including Advanced Aviation Team, Private Jet Services Group, Principal Aviation, and FlexJet between July 24 and August 30.The largest share of the payments went to Advanced Aviation, a company offering luxurious aircraft ranging from smaller jets for short trips to ultra-long-range planes with amenities and flight attendants for journeys up to 16 hours.Harris’ campaign’s use of private jets has sparked criticism due to the significant environmental impact of such travel. According to the National Library of Medicine, private aviation is the most energy-intensive form of air travel, using 10 to 20 times more fuel per passenger than commercial flights.Harris has long positioned herself as a champion of climate action, referring to climate change as an “existential threat” to humanity. During a 2019 interview with CNN, she said, ""There’s no question we have to be practical. But being practical also recognises that climate change is an existential threat to us as human beings... it is well within our capacity to change our behaviours in a way that reduces its effects.""At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2023, Harris said, “The clock is no longer just ticking, it is banging... We need transformative change and exponential impact.” She has also expressed concern about the effect of climate change on younger generations, noting that “climate anxiety” has left some hesitant to have children.The Biden-Harris administration has set ambitious climate goals for the aviation industry, aiming for a 20% reduction in aviation emissions by 2030, with a target of net-zero emissions by 2050.","US vice president Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has come under debate for its extensive use of private jets.

US Presidential Election Top 10: Why Donald Trump and Iran hate each other,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-donald-trump-and-iran-hate-each-other/articleshow/113712857.cms,"The American spooks still tell stories about their comically calamitous attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro, a man so unkillable that he virtually outlived all his obituary writers. Some of the more preposterous CIA attempts include exploding cigars, incompetent members of the Mafia, femme non-fatales, and LSD. Alas, Castro kept on giving seven-hour-long speeches and lived to the ripe age of 90.The recent revelations about an Iranian attempt to assassinate Donald Trump read like that laundry list, spearheaded by a Pakistani national named Asif Merchant , who was ostensibly paid a million bucks to off Trump. Merchant, who was no Jackal, was apprehended on his way to the airport. Merchant’s code words involved sartorial code words which included t-shirt (the protest to distract), the flannel shirt (stealing), and fleece jacket (assassination). Despite the clumsiness of the plot, U.S. officials treated it as a serious threat.Iran’s complicated relationship with the US goes back to the time when the US and the UK overthrew Mosaddeq in a coup. There was the Shah of Iran’s ousting, the hostage rescue act that inspired Argo, George Bush’s Axis of Evil speech, Obama’s attempt to normalise relations, and more recently, Trump ordering a drone strike to kill Qasem Soleimani , the commander of the Quds Force who was described as a combination of James Bond and Christina Aguilera. But where does Donald Trump tie into all this? It seems the hate story with Iran started in 1980, the first time the socialite from New York made a public comment about foreign policy when he expressed his horror at the Iran hostage crisis and couldn’t comprehend how a powerful country like the US could allow it. Perhaps the key to understanding Trump’s view of Iran is the Freudian view of how the human brain works.Sigmund Freud’s famous model of brain function involves three entities: the id, ego, and superego. It’s most explained using the chariot analogy: the id is the horse that can run, responsible for our basic urges and desires. The ego is the charioteer, the rational part of our brain, which can guide the horse but can never fully control it. The superego is the charioteer’s father, pointing out his mistakes and guiding him, the part of the brain responsible for criticising and moralising.Trump, on the other hand, appears to be an amalgamation of all three, a fusion of id, ego, and superego, the horse, the charioteer, and the charioteer’s father, where he cannot fathom a world that would question his worldview, and once he became President, America’s worldview. Any disagreement was seen not as a deep criticism of himself and the country he loved and that was now entwined with his psyche. As POTUS, Trump withdrew from theIran Nuclear Deal , citing its inadequacy in addressing Iran’s regional activities and ballistic missile programme. The Trump administration also implemented a “maximum pressure campaign”, targeting vital sectors of Iran’s economy, especially oil and finance, which, to his fury, didn’t secure a new, stricter nuclear deal or change Iran’s behaviour but caused significant hardship in Iran.In January 2020, Trump authorised a drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force. This marked a dramatic escalation in US-Iran tensions . Trump justified the strike by claiming that Soleimani was planning attacks on US interests. Trump’s Iran policy appeared to be based on muscle flexing, and in the case of the Soleimani strike, demonstrating how things would go if it wasn’t his way. Iran, understandably used to no dissent on its own turf, viewed Trump as both unpredictable and uncontrollable and seems to have left no stone unturned – barring the ones they keep for stoning women without hijabs – to try and neutralise Trump.While Iran has carried out missile strikes on US bases in Iraq, they also ran a comprehensive disinformation campaign on Trump, including running several ‘liberal’ sound news websites that mocked Trump (opioid-pilled elephant in MAGA China shop) and leaked internal documents about Trump and those close to him, including JD Vance. According to numerous reports, the hackathon is still on.Iran knows that Trump’s return would be rather bad news, who, unlike the Biden administration, hardly pretends he wants to normalise relations. While he might be inclined to do so if a Nobel Peace Prize was on the line, the current id-ego-superego amalgamation prevents him from doing so. Trump’s return portends renewed economic isolation and increased risks of military confrontation, especially over Iran's nuclear advancements.There’s a school of thought that views the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel as part of Iran’s attempts to destabilise any thawing of relationships between US allies Israel and Saudi Arabia that would have put Tehran on a back foot. Trump’s return would mean that there would be even stauncher backing for Israel in the Middle East. Iran has always viewed all American regimes with staunch distrust, but with Trump, there’s the added complication of not knowing what he will do. Irrespective of who wins the elections, it’s unlikely that the Trump-Iran relationship will meet the same fate as Inspector Captain Louis Renault’s and Rick Blaine’s: It certainly won’t be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.It's fair to say that the Iran regime, even more than Democrats, are worried about a Trump return.","Iran’s complicated relationship with the US goes back to the time when the US and the UK overthrew Mosaddeq in a coup.

""He behaves like a child and posts things that are deeply inaccurate and extremely damaging,"" Yelland told the BBC.While the government declined to comment on Musk’s absence from the summit, former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt expressed disappointment, calling it a ""big loss"" and noting that Musk had previously considered UK as a site for a new Tesla plant.","Elon Musk has responded after being excluded from the UK government's upcoming International Investment Summit.

The International Monetary Fund ( IMF )'s executive board has given the green light for a fresh $7 billion loan to Pakistan , a country grappling with financial challenges.The announcement was made on Wednesday, over two months after the two parties had initially reached a consensus. Authorities stated that the loan, which will be disbursed to Islamabad over a period of 37 months, is intended to provide a much-needed boost to Pakistan's wilting economy.In a statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the agreement, which his team had been working on with the IMF since June.He expressed gratitude to Kristalina Georgieva , the head of the IMF and her team, for the approval.(This is a top story on Google Trends)According to the IMF, the first tranche of the loan, amounting to approximately $1 billion, will be released immediately.Financially relegated to the margin given the dwindling economic figures, revenue-starved Pakistan will get monetary respite to bring back its economy on track.Earlier this month, Shehbaz Sharif said that ""friendly"" nations have helped Islamabad to meet the requirements necessary to secure the IMF bailout package -- necessary for the nuclear-armed nation to end its chronic economic distress.(This is a top story on Google Trends)Last July, Sharif's administration had secured a $7-billion loan from IMF on the condition that it would introduce stringent reforms to strengthen tax collection and increase revenue.On the global lender's demand, Islamabad had unveiled a tax-heavy budget last June to raise 13 trillion rupees by next year - a 40% increase from the current financial year.There has also been a 20-30% tariff increase on electricity and other energy products, hitting the common man hard. Pakistan's external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.Since joining the multilateral lender in 1950, Pakistan has secured 24 IMF bailouts, the latest being approved by the lender's executive board and confirmed by necessary financing assurances from the country's development and bilateral partners.","The International Monetary Fund ( IMF )'s executive board has given the green light for a fresh $7 billion loan to Pakistan.
