"Central Papua Province: Gunmen kill New Zealand helicopter pilot in Indonesia's Papua, indigenous passengers freed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/gunmen-kill-new-zealand-helicopter-pilot-in-indonesias-papua-indigenous-passengers-freed/articleshow/112302604.cms,"A violent confrontation erupted in Indonesia's restive Papua region on Monday, as gunmen stormed a helicopter, killing its New Zealand pilot shortly after landing. The attackers, suspected to be from the West Papua Liberation Army , released the Indigenous Papuan passengers — a stark contrast to the fate of the pilot, Glen Malcolm Conning , whose life was brutally cut short in the remote village of Alama.Conning, employed by the Indonesian aviation company PT Intan Angkasa Air Service, had just touched down in the mountainous district of Mimika, Central Papua province , when the ambush occurred, accoring to AP. The assailants, who reportedly belong to the armed wing of the Free Papua Movement, wasted no time in setting fire to the helicopter after executing the pilot. The passengers, two health workers and two children, were spared, likely due to their local ties, police said.Faizal Ramadhani, a member of Indonesia’s National Police and the head of the joint security peace force in Papua, confirmed the pilot’s death and the attackers' swift retreat into the dense jungle. “All passengers were safe because they were local residents of Alama village,” Ramadhani said as quoted by AP. He also said that the village's isolated nature, accessible only by air.The West Papua Liberation Army, through spokesperson Sebby Sambom, neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the attack. Sambom issued a chilling warning to foreign pilots, saying, “if that happens, it was his own fault for entering our forbidden territory...if anyone disobeys, they must bear the risk themselves.”The incident has cast a shadow over the already tense relations between Indigenous Papuans and Indonesian authorities. The region, rich in minerals but fraught with conflict, has long been a flashpoint for violence. This attack is the latest in a series of deadly encounters, including the ongoing abduction of New Zealand pilot Philip Mark Mehrtens by the same rebel group since February 2023.New Zealand's foreign ministry expressed concern over the incident, with the embassy in Jakarta seeking further details. The situation remains volatile, as security forces scramble to locate the attackers while the international community watches closely.The violence in Papua has deep roots, tracing back to its controversial incorporation into Indonesia in 1969 after a UN-sponsored ballot, widely criticized as a sham. Since then, the region has simmered with insurgency, fueled by the stark cultural and ethnic differences between the Indigenous Papuans and the rest of Indonesia.","Gunmen stormed a helicopter, killing its New Zealand pilot shortly after landing.

Uncertainty ahead:

As Tropical Storm Debby continues to wreak havoc across the southeastern United States, the storm has brought unprecedented rainfall, deadly winds, and widespread flooding . The storm, which made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane, has already resulted in multiple deaths, mass evacuations, and significant damage across Florida, Georgia , and the Carolinas.Authorities are racing against time to rescue residents from flooded homes, particularly in Sarasota, Florida, and Manatee County, where hundreds have been rescued. The storm's path has brought it into Georgia and is expected to stall, bringing even more rainfall and potential catastrophic flooding to the region.The storm has since weakened to a tropical storm but continues to pose a significant threat, particularly to low-lying areas along the Eastern seaboard. As emergency services scramble to respond, the full impact of Debby’s wrath is still unfolding.The storm has led to at least 5 confirmed deaths, including a 19-year-old man who was killed in Moultrie, Georgia, when a tree fell on a porch. In Florida, a 13-year-old boy died when a tree fell on a mobile home. Additionally, a truck driver was killed in Tampa after losing control of his vehicle in the storm.Approximately 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, while 186 were saved in nearby Manatee County. Local officials described the event as unprecedented.Record rainfall, with up to 30 inches expected in some areas, has triggered flash flood emergencies, particularly in central and northern Florida.Over 300,000 people are without power in Florida and Georgia, with extensive efforts underway to restore electricity amid dangerous conditions.North Carolina and Georgia have also declared states of emergency, bracing for the storm's impact.Over 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide, with Florida airports being the most affected.Charleston, South Carolina, has imposed a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday due to expected heavy rainfall, with officials preparing for possible severe flooding.US President Joe Biden has authorized emergency declarations for South Carolina and Florida, and Vice President Kamala Harris postponed a planned trip to Georgia due to the storm.Debby is expected to continue moving northeast, with forecasted rainfalls of up to 30 inches in some areas. The storm surge and flash flooding remain major concerns as the storm lingers over the region.Debby’s landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, came less than a year after Hurricane Idalia struck the same area as a Category 3 storm, adding to the region’s ongoing struggles with severe weather.As Debby continues its path, local and federal authorities are urging residents to stay safe and heed warnings, with the full impact of the storm still unfolding.","Tropical Storm Debby continues to wreak havoc across the southeastern United States.

Hammers on Mujibur statue

Crowd enters parliament

66 killed on Monday, toll 366

Thousands of protesters in Bangladesh on Monday looted and vandalised Sheikh Hasina ’s official residence in the capital Dhaka , smashed a statue of her father Mujibur Rahman with hammers and set her party’s offices on fire as they celebrated her departure.Hasina, 76, resigned as PM and left Bangladesh amid mass protests against her govt over a controversial quota system that reserved 30% of govt jobs for the families of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence against Pakistan in 1971.She had been governing the strategically located South Asian nation since 2009.Thousands of protesters defied a military curfew and stormed her official residence ‘Ganabhaban’ in Dhaka. Video footage showed jubilant crowds vandalising and ransacking the premises, taking away even fish, chicken and vegetables. Bangladesh’s Channel 24 broadcast images of crowds running into Hasina’s compound, grinning and waving to the camera, looting furniture and books, or relaxing on beds. One protester proudly proclaimed to the media that he had taken a red lipstick. “I will keep it as a memento of our struggle… to remember we broke free from a dictator. She used to wear this lipstick,” he said. Another man carrying a planter said, “This is freedom.” Demonstrators also posed for pictures with the PM’s menagerie, including chickens, ducks and rabbits.Footage on social media showed protesters climbing a statue of Hasina’s father in Ganabhaban and smashing it with hammers. The Bangabandhu memorial museum — dedicated to Mujibur Rahman who was assassinated along with his wife and their three sons while serving as prez in 1975 — was also vandalised. Hasina and her sister had survived the purge as they were abroad. Hasina then spent six years in exile in India. The home of Wajed Miah, Hasina’s husband, was not spared.The Awami League office in the capital was also set on fire. Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan’s house was ransacked. A Prothom Alo reporter said screams could be heard when several people entered the chief justice’s residence. The crowd also entered the parliament building. People were seen taking things from inside the parliament building. A large number of protesters broke through the main gate of the police headquarters and ransacked the building.An unruly mob vandalised the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre in the city’s Dhanmondi area. Four Hindu temples suffered “minor” damages across the country, eyewitnesses said.At least 66 people were killed Monday, police said, saying gangs had launched revenge attacks on Hasina’s allies. Many were shot. The latest violence took the total number of people killed since protests began to at least 366, according to an AFP tally based on police, govt officials and doctors at hospitals.The violence was not restricted to Dhaka. In the eastern city of Sylhet, offices of the deputy commissioner and superintendent of police were set on fire, while the homes of several councillors were attacked, BBC reported. At least eight people were burned to death and 84 others suffered injuries after arsonists torched a hotel owned by Awami League general secretary of Jashore district.","Thousands of protesters defied a military curfew and stormed her official residence ‘Ganabhaban’ in Dhaka.

From gold Rolex to customized Tesla: Did influencer Adin Ross just put Donald Trump in hot water with these expensive gifts?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-gold-rolex-to-customized-tesla-did-influencer-adin-ross-just-put-donald-trump-in-hot-water-with-these-expensive-gifts/articleshow/112302360.cms,"Potential campaign finance violation

Reaching a new audience

Former President Donald Trump added a gold Rolex watch and a customized Tesla Cybertruck to his collection of luxury items , courtesy of internet celebrity Adin Ross . The gifts were presented during a live-streamed interview at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday afternoon.The Cybertruck, emblazoned with Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” and adorned in red, white, and blue, was parked outside Mar-a-Lago, creating a striking visual for Ross’ audience, which peaked at over 500,000 viewers.The truck featured an image of Trump with his fist raised, taken moments after an assassination attempt at a recent rally.Trump expressed admiration for both the vehicle and the watch, saying, “I think it’s incredible,” and “Wow, that’s so nice,” as he inspected the gifts, reported NYT. The interview also featured a custom playlist, with Trump enjoying classics like the Beach Boys while seated inside the Cybertruck.As per Tesla’s website, a base model Cybertruck has a sticker price of $60,990, with high-end trims topping $100,000. A customized wrap — the printed vinyl sticker covering every exterior surface of the vehicle — starts around $4,000. Rolex watches typically start at $5,000.The extravagant gifts, which far exceed the federal campaign contribution limit of $3,300 per election cycle, could pose legal challenges for Trump. Brendan Fischer, deputy executive director at the watchdog group Documented, indicated that these items likely constitute illegal and excessive campaign contributions.In response, Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, stated that the campaign would seek guidance from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on how to handle the gifts.Beyond the potential legal implications, the interview with Ross is part of Trump’s broader strategy to connect with younger, predominantly male, right-leaning voters who form a significant portion of Ross’ fanbase. Ross, who gained fame through video game streaming, has been a controversial figure due to his association with far-right personalities and his content, which led to multiple sanctions and an eventual ban from Twitch.Trump has increasingly sought to engage this demographic, appearing in interviews with other influencers such as Logan Paul and the Nelk Boys, as well as featuring on platforms like TikTok to reach millions of potential voters.During the nearly 90-minute interview, Ross avoided confrontation, allowing Trump to freely criticize political opponents like Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden. Ross’ enthusiastic endorsement of Trump during the livestream even caught the former president by surprise, with Trump praising Ross for his open support.","The gifts were presented during a live-streamed interview at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday afternoon.

His father-in-law was army chief during the first of Hasina's five terms, from 1996 to 2001.The army has been at the centre of political upheavals earlier too. In 1981, Gen Ziaur Rahman, who took the president's office following coups, was assassinated, allegedly by a faction of army officers.

The group of nine staffers fired on Monday includes individuals from both groups, although the total number of staffers fired from the agency remains unclear. Haq affirmed that the UN had sufficient information to take action against the nine individuals.When questioned whether the UN's decision suggests that the nine individuals were ""likely or highly likely"" to have been involved in the attacks, the spokesperson responded affirmatively, saying, ""That's a good way of describing it.""The UN's internal watchdog, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, has been investigating UNRWA since January, when Israel accused 12 staffers of being involved in the October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the death of 1,200 people and the abduction of approximately 250 others. The allegations initially led top donor countries to suspend their funding for UNRWA, causing a cash crunch of around $450 million. Since then, all donor countries, except for the US, have decided to resume funding.Oren Marmorstein, the spokesperson for Israel's ministry of foreign affairs, called for donor countries to once again suspend funding, stating that ""the funds may go to terrorist elements."" He further added, ""UNRWA is part of the problem and not part of the solution, and anyone who seeks the best interests of Israel, the Gaza Strip and the region should act to replace UNWRA's activities with other agencies.""The UN watchdog responsible for investigating UNRWA relied on evidence provided by Israel in discussions with Israeli authorities but could not independently corroborate the evidence due to a lack of direct access. The investigators also reviewed internal UNRWA information, ultimately finding sufficient evidence pointing to the potential involvement of nine employees in the October 7 attack.Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, said in a statement, ""I have decided that in the case of these remaining nine staff members, they cannot work for UNRWA."" He emphasized the agency's priority to continue providing lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region, particularly in the face of the ongoing war, instability, and risk of regional escalation. Lazzarini also condemned the October 7 attack.""Your 'relief' agency has officially stooped to a new level of low, and it is time that the world sees your true face,"" Lieutenant-Colonel Nadav Shoshani, the international spokesperson for the Israeli army, said in a statement posted on X.UNRWA has been the main agency providing aid to Palestinians in Gaza during the 10-month-old conflict, which Gaza Health officials report has caused over 39,600 deaths and a massive humanitarian crisis. Throughout the conflict, Israel has called for the agency's closure, accusing it of collaborating with Hamas and ignoring militant activities. UNRWA denied collaborating with Hamas, stating that over 200 UNRWA staffers have been killed and 190 of its installations damaged during the conflict, including UN-run schools converted into shelters for displaced Palestinians.","UN terminates nine more staff members from its agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.

JD said his wife was sitting there and three children were sleeping upstairs when the lawyer said he had to ask an intrusive question.""I was like, 'Are you serious?' Do I have a secret family? Like, what do you mean? He said sometimes you know people have another spouse, other kids in a place like Alaska,"" Vance said.""Oh by the way, if I did I am not gonna admit it in front of my wife.

Because of the ongoing vetting process, he knew he was one of the candidates Trump was shortlisting but the moment it was decided, he was on a plane to Milwaukee without Wi-Fi and on landing, he saw 350 messages.In the hotel room, when JD finally had a chance to talk to Trump, Trump mentioned, ""JD, you missed a crucial phone call, and now I’ll need to choose someone else."" JD explained that his son was incessantly talking about Pikachu at that moment. ""I told him, 'Son, be quiet for 30 seconds... I have the most important call of my life...'"" JD added that Trump overheard the conversation and asked him to put the phone on speaker so his son could hear the news. Trump read the statement and asked JD’s son for his opinion.

Commitment to swift action

In a bold declaration during a recent Fox News interview, former President Donald Trump referred to America's untapped energy resources as "" liquid gold ,"" asserting that the United States has more energy potential than any other nation, including Saudi Arabia and Russia . He promised to harness these resources to make the US energy-dominant on the world stage.""We have more energy — we have more liquid gold, as I call it, under our feet than Saudi Arabia, than Russia, than anybody,"" Trump was quoted as saying.""We're going to be energy-dominant, we're going to make a fortune, we're going to supply it all over Europe, all over the world,"" Trump said.

""We're going to get energy way down. Drill, baby, drill,"" he said, emphasizing that reducing energy costs would help address broader economic challenges.Beyond energy, Trump laid out an aggressive plan to revive the American auto industry, which he claims has been significantly eroded by foreign competition. He pledged to bring back auto jobs through a tariff system designed to encourage domestic production and penalize countries like China and Mexico, which he says have ""stolen"" US manufacturing jobs.""Those people in Michigan that love me and that I love, they're going to give us a victory because their auto industry won't exist in two years if she [Harris] gets elected,"" Trump warned, predicting a dire future for the industry under current policies. He vowed that if elected, his administration would take immediate action to reverse this trend.Trump promised to prioritize the revival of the auto industry within the first two weeks of his term, assuring voters that his policies would lead to a surge in domestic auto production and job creation.

His initial reaction was confusion, as there was no apparent panic among the passengers.In a subsequent interview with the People, Judelson described the scene, noting that the woman’s rush seemed overly dramatic for the situation. He and another passenger wondered why she was so frantic, since everyone would be deplaning together.Judelson recounted, “I look around, no one’s on the ground, no one’s freaking out. I’m like, ‘it can’t be that dire.'” Upon landing, the situation became more peculiar. “As soon as we land, this woman across the aisle from me shoots up and rushes to the front of the plane,” he ewas quoted as explaing, noting that it seemed like an exaggerated urgency to be the first off the aircraft.The situation grew even stranger when passengers were told they would face a 12-hour delay and were given hotel vouchers. Judelson’s confusion deepened as he questioned whether they were stuck in Phoenix indefinitely.American Airlines confirmed that the flight was diverted because of a medical emergency. However, the details were initially unclear until Judelson heard through word of mouth that the actual reason was a lice outbreak. Passengers were discussing how bugs had been seen in a woman's hair, which led to the emergency landing.Despite the unexpected disruption, the passengers were able to continue their trip to New York, though with an unplanned detour.","TikTok creator Ethan Judelson was on an American Airlines flight that was forced to make an emergency landing in Phoenix.

Legal: $950 million fine for funeral home fraud: Is this enough for families whose loved ones were left to rot?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/950-million-fine-for-funeral-home-fraud-is-this-enough-for-families-whose-loved-ones-were-left-to-rot/articleshow/112304675.cms,"Emotional fallout and

struggles

Legal and legislative repercussions

In a stunning judicial decision, Jon and Carie Hallford , the owners of the Colorado funeral home “Return to Nature,” have been ordered to pay $950 million in damages to the families of victims deceived by their fraudulent practices. This ruling, reported by AP, comes amid the Hallfords' ongoing financial troubles and numerous criminal charges across several states and federal courts.The Hallfords face hundreds of charges, including corpse abuse and theft of $130,000 from families who paid for cremations and burials that were never performed.The $950 million judgment is largely symbolic, reflecting the profound emotional trauma suffered by the families who discovered that the ashes they received were fake, while the actual remains of their loved ones were found decaying in a facility infested with pests.Andrew Swan, the class action attorney representing the victims, expressed frustration over the likely futility of collecting the damages but emphasized the importance of holding the Hallfords accountable. “I’m never going to get a dime from them, so, I don't know, it’s a little frustrating,” said Crystina Page, one of the plaintiffs. Page had entrusted the Hallfords with her son’s remains in 2019 and carried the urn she believed held his ashes until discovering in 2023 that his body was among those found at the funeral home.For Page and many others, the ruling is a small consolation as they grapple with the horror of their loved ones' decaying bodies being mishandled. “If nothing else, this judgment will bring more understanding to the case,” Page said, hoping the case would shed light on the broader impact of the Hallfords' actions.The Hallfords did not attend the civil hearings, with Jon Hallford in custody and Carie Hallford out on bail. Neither has acknowledged the civil case. The lawsuit, which includes over 100 family members, remains open for additional victims, reflecting the scale of the tragedy.The case has spurred Colorado lawmakers to introduce comprehensive regulations for the funeral home industry, addressing previously lax oversight in the state.Jon Hallford is being represented by a public defender’s office, which does not comment on cases, while Carie Hallford’s attorney, Michael Stuzynski, was unavailable for comment.As the legal and emotional fallout continues, the Hallfords’ case stands as a grim reminder of the need for rigorous oversight in the funeral home industry and the devastating impact of their fraudulent actions on grieving families.","Jon and Carie Hallford have been ordered to pay $950 million in damages to families of victims deceived by their fraudulent practices.

Carillo’s reaction:

A Virginia man has been charged with making a series of violent death threats against Vice President Kamala Harris , just days after she was declared the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.Frank Lucio Carillo, 45, from Winchester, Virginia, was arrested on Friday and appeared in US District Court in Roanoke on Monday to face a federal felony charge that could land him up to five years in prison.The FBI's investigation revealed a disturbing pattern of threats emanating from Carillo’s account on the social media platform GETTR . Authorities discovered nearly 20 violent threats directed at Harris, including explicit threats to kill her and her family, along with horrific plans to inflict severe physical harm. One of the posts from July 27 read, “Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive. I will do it personally if no one else does it. I want her to suffer a slow agonizing death.”Carillo, using the GETTR account ""joemadarats1,"" made a total of 4,359 posts and replies targeting various public figures, including President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and other officials. The FBI linked this account to Carillo through their investigation.Besides Harris, Carillo’s threats extended to other officials and groups. He had posted about firearms and shooting people, and expressed violent intentions toward various targets, including Muslims and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.During the search of Carillo’s home, federal agents seized a pistol, an AR-15 assault rifle, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Carillo had boasted about his AR-15 being “LOCKED AND LOADED” in a February post.GETTR, the platform where Carillo made these threats, is a conservative social media site created as an alternative to mainstream platforms. It has been associated with right-wing users and was launched by Trump ally Jason Miller. The site has faced its share of controversies and legal issues.This case highlights a troubling trend of increasing threats against public officials. The U.S. Capitol Police reported over 8,000 threats against members of Congress last year, a significant rise from previous years.After his arrest, Carillo reportedly questioned the severity of the situation, asking, “This is all over a comment, huh?” His lawyer’s details have not been made public yet.","Frank Lucio Carillo, 45, from Winchester, Virginia, was arrested on Friday and appeared in US District Court in Roanoke on Monday to face a federal felony charge that could land him up to five years in prison.

Escalation is not in anyone's interests. It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity.""Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran last week, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and fueled further concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.Iran has blamed Israel and said it will ""punish"" it; Israeli officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also the Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose senior military commander Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut last week.U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by their national security team on the situation in the Middle East, including threats posed by Iran and its proxies to Israel and U.S. servicemembers, the White House said. They were also briefed about an attack on Iraq's al Asad airbase on Monday and discussed the U.S. response.During that briefing, Biden and Harris were told by their national security team that it is still unclear when Iran and Hezbollah are likely to launch an attack against Israel ""and the specifics of such an attack,"" according to a U.S. official.At least five U.S. personnel were wounded in the rocket strike, U.S. officials told Reuters. It was unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over Haniyeh's killing, in which the U.S. said it had no involvement.Biden and Harris were also updated on U.S. efforts to support Israel militarily if it is attacked and diplomatic efforts to ""de-escalate regional tension"" and reach a ceasefire and hostage-release deal in Gaza.Blinken earlier on Monday spoke with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty.""One of the points of the engagements that we have had is to urge countries to pass messages to Iran and urge countries to make clear to Iran that it is very much not in their interests to escalate this conflict, that it is very much not in their interest to launch another attack on Israel,"" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.Miller, speaking at a press briefing, did not say definitively whether or not Washington's messages have been disseminated to Iran or through which channel.""I would expect that some of them would pass that message along and impress that point upon the government of Iran,"" he added.Blinken in his remarks also called for parties to ""break this cycle"" of violence and agree a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict, despite the killing of Haniyeh, who was a key figure in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas.""What it comes down to really is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no,"" Blinken said.

US troops injured in rocket attack on Ain al-Asad Air Base in Iraq,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-troops-injured-in-rocket-attack-on-ain-al-asad-air-base-in-iraq/articleshow/112302361.cms,"Regional tensions escalate

US response and ongoing negotiations

Several American troops were injured late Monday when a rocket attack targeted the Ain al-Asad Air Base in Iraq ’s western desert, according to US defense officials. The base, which has frequently been the target of attacks by Iran-backed Iraqi armed groups, was hit by at least two rockets that landed within its perimeter.The attack comes amid heightened tensions in the region following Israel's conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the recent killing of key leaders tied to Hamas and Hezbollah.This latest assault adds to a series of attacks on US military positions in Iraq and Syria over the past month, including a recent incident at a small US base in eastern Syria.Preliminary reports indicate that at least five individuals were wounded in the attack, including both US troops and contractors. While no group has yet claimed responsibility, the strike bears the hallmarks of previous operations by Iran-backed militias in Iraq, whose goal is to force the withdrawal of US forces from the region.The attack on Ain al-Asad Air Base occurred against a backdrop of escalating regional tensions. Last week, a Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran, and Hezbollah leader Fouad Shukur was killed in Beirut. Israel has acknowledged responsibility for the assassination of Shukur but has remained silent on Haniyeh’s death. In response, Iran has vowed retaliation through its proxy forces, including Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and various militant groups in Iraq.While it remains unclear whether this latest rocket attack was part of a broader Iranian response or a continuation of ongoing militia efforts, it underscores the volatile situation in the region. The US military has been on high alert, anticipating potential reprisals similar to the April attack by Iran on Israel following the killing of senior Iranian military figures by Israeli forces.The White House confirmed that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been briefed on the incident and are considering potential responses. A statement from the administration emphasized that any retaliatory action would be carried out ""in a manner and place of our choosing.""The attack has also highlighted ongoing negotiations between US and Iraqi officials over the future of American military presence in the country. While some factions within the Iraqi government, particularly those aligned with Iran, are pushing for a swift US withdrawal, others, including many Iraqi defense officials, favor a continued albeit reduced US involvement to maintain stability.Currently, approximately 2,500 US troops are stationed in Iraq, with an additional 900 in Syria, where the resurgence of the Islamic State group remains a concern.",A rocket attack targeted the Ain al-Asad Air Base in Iraq’s western desert.

"Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, US judge rules in landmark antitrust case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/google-illegally-maintains-monopoly-over-internet-search-judge-rules/articleshow/112302371.cms,"'Google is a

Monopolist

'

A victory for antitrust regulators

The path forward

Implications for the tech industry

US district judge Amit Mehta said that Google's dominant search engine has been unlawfully leveraged to stifle competition and innovation. The decision, which could significantly disrupt the internet landscape, marks one of the most consequential antitrust rulings in recent history.The ruling follows nearly a year of litigation in a trial that pitted the US Justice Department against Google, marking the largest antitrust case in the US in over 25 years.After reviewing extensive evidence and testimony from high-profile executives at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, Judge Mehta issued his 277-page decision three months after final arguments were presented.Judge Mehta's ruling was unequivocal: “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.” The judge underscored Google's overwhelming control of the search market, citing its 89.2% share of general search services, which soars to 94.9% on mobile devices.This decision delivers a significant blow to Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc., which has long maintained that its market dominance is a result of consumer preference. Google's search engine processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries daily, nearly doubling its volume over the past decade.Despite the setback, Google plans to appeal the ruling. Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, defended the company's practices, saying, “This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn’t be allowed to make it easily available.”For the US Justice Department, the ruling represents a substantial victory in its efforts to curb Big Tech 's power. Attorney General Merrick Garland hailed the decision as “an historic win for the American people,” emphasizing that no company, regardless of size or influence, is above the law.The trial cast Google as a technological bully, using its dominance to extract artificially high prices from advertisers while curbing competition. Prosecutors argued that Google’s monopoly not only hurt competitors but also diminished the quality of its own service by reducing incentives to innovate.Judge Mehta's ruling pointed to Google's billions of dollars spent annually to secure its search engine as the default option on devices as a key factor in maintaining its monopoly. In 2021 alone, Google spent over $26 billion to lock in these agreements.Mehta's conclusion sets the stage for a new legal phase focused on determining the remedies required to restore competition. A hearing is scheduled for September 6 to begin discussing potential measures, which could range from dismantling parts of Google’s operations to banning default search agreements.However, any significant changes are likely to be delayed by a lengthy appeals process, which experts predict could last up to five years. During this time, Google may fend off immediate restrictions, though it could still face class-action lawsuits from advertisers.The ruling also poses potential risks for Apple, which benefits from Google’s payments to make its search engine the default on iPhones. Google reportedly paid Apple around $20 billion in 2022 alone, a figure that has doubled since 2020.This decision could have broader implications for the tech industry, particularly for Microsoft, which has been positioning itself as a counterweight to Google in the search market. If Mehta enforces limits on Google’s default search agreements, it could open up opportunities for Microsoft's Bing, which currently dominates searches on the Microsoft Edge browser.The ruling also reflects the Biden administration's aggressive stance against Big Tech, with the Justice Department pursuing cases against other giants like Apple, Ticketmaster, and even exploring the role of companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and OpenAI in the burgeoning AI sector.","US district judge Amit Mehta said that Google's dominant search engine has been unlawfully leveraged to stifle competition and innovation.

Well, let me say things that I didn’t do. I didn’t call one person. I did not call one person. I could always say to him, ‘I never called anybody.’ What I’m saying is, I had confidence that the president would make the proper choice for our country, whatever that would be, and I said that. Whatever that is, we’ll go with,” She said.Pelosi said: “My whole point was, whatever he decides, but we have to have a more aggressive campaign.”In response to claims that Biden is “furious” with her, Pelosi expressed her affection for him, stating, “Well, he knows that I love him very much.”The House Speaker said that her primary goal was to safeguard Biden's achievements. During the CBS interview, Pelosi highlighted the President's successes and commended his performance at the Nato summit, adding, “So he was in a good place to make whatever decision — the top of his game.”“Such a consequential president of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of president of the United States,” she said, later adding, “Well, you got Teddy Roosevelt up there, and he’s wonderful. I don’t say take him down. But you can add Biden,” she added.During an interview with ABC News, George Stephanopoulos requested that Pelosi provide more details about her involvement in Biden's choice to withdraw from the race. Pelosi said: “Well, I have the greatest respect for the president. I think he will be … viewed as one of the most consequential presidents in our country.”“It was always about him. And why I said I didn’t make calls — because people said I was burning up the airways. No, I wasn’t. The only person that I spoke to about this was the president. Other people called me about what their views were about it and, but, I rarely even returned a call, much less initiated one,” she added.According to the New York Times, Pelosi said in a recent interview before the release this week of a book on her years in Congress that: ""My goal is to defeat Donald Trump ."" And when you make a decision to defeat somebody, you make every decision in favor of that. You don't mess around with it, OK? What is in furtherance of reaching that goal? I thought we had to have a better campaign.""Nancy Pelosi, in her book ""The Art of Power,"" recounts pivotal instances where she had to make crucial decisions during significant events including the Iraq War, a devastating financial crisis, the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, and various confrontations with Donald Trump during his presidency.According to the former speaker, the urgency to terminate Trump's political career outweighed any need to show deference to Biden, especially considering the high risk Democrats faced of losing control of both the House and Senate if the president remained on the ticket. She appeared to be willing to accept the repercussions of angering Biden and his closest advisors, given the gravity of the situation.Pelosi downplays her influence in Biden's decision to step aside from the 2024 presidential race, maintaining that the choice was entirely his own. She stressed that her primary motivation, evident in her attention to polls, fundraising efforts, and private discussions with the president and concerned Democratic colleagues, was the singular goal of defeating Trump.Pelosi asserts that she did not call fellow Democrats, seeking to counter allegations that she had engineered Biden's departure, despite their long-standing alliance.However, if the Democrats emerge victorious this autumn after confronting the possibility of a devastating loss, Pelosi's strategic moves, coupled with the personal entreaties made to Biden by Democratic congressional leaders ""Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York,"" may prove to be among her most consequential actions, the New York Times reported.Pelosi's name has been synonymous with authority and influence in the nation's capital for over two decades. In her book, she aims to chronicle the journey that led her to become one of the most powerful figures in American politics.Pelosi ascended to prominence during an era when the halls of Congress were presumed to be the domain of men, and women were relegated to positions below the ""marble ceiling."" This term, which she employs in her writing, alludes to the ubiquitous building material found throughout Capitol Hill - a substance far more challenging to shatter than glass.""The men explained to me that the House had a pecking order, that other male representatives had been dutifully waiting in line for an upper-level leadership post to open, that I was cutting in and overturning the established order of things,"" Pelosi wrote.","Pelosi downplays her influence in Biden's decision to step aside from the 2024 presidential race, maintaining that the choice was entirely his own.

Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday after holding interviews with top contenders at her Washington residence over the weekend, according to two sources familiar with the situation.The announcement could come at any moment, ahead of her first public appearance with the vice-presidential nominee on Tuesday in Philadelphia, where they will kick off a cross-country tour across several key battleground states that are likely to determine the outcome of the election, the sources indicated.Harris wrapped up her search on Sunday by interviewing three leading candidates—Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro—at her official residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, according to the sources.Harris' search for a running mate began in earnest just two weeks ago, following President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the race and endorse her as his successor.Choosing a running mate is one of the most significant decisions of Harris' political career as she quickly assembles a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election.Her shortlist comprises all white male candidates with proven success in winning over rural, white, or independent voters.Over the weekend, Harris consulted with her vetting team, which included former attorney general Eric Holder. Holder's law firm, Covington & Burling LLP, conducted thorough reviews of the finances and backgrounds of the potential running mates. He and his team provided detailed presentations on each finalist, according to multiple sources familiar with the process.Harris is carefully weighing her decision with input from her husband, Doug Emhoff, brother-in-law Tony West, and a small group of close aides and advisers, the sources said. The candidates are expected to be notified of the decision on Monday night or Tuesday morning, the sources added. The current frontrunners are Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro .Here are their pros and cons:Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is widely considered a leading candidate for Kamala Harris's vice-presidential pick. Speculation around Shapiro intensified after Harris's campaign announced plans to reveal her VP choice at a rally in Philadelphia next week—Shapiro’s home state—which will kick off a series of events in key battleground states. On the positive side, he enjoys significant popularity in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state for Democrats. With Trump currently leading in the polls in Pennsylvania, securing the state’s 19 electoral votes is seen as vital for a Democratic victory in November. Shapiro, considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, is known for his charisma and strong public speaking skills. His moderate stance could appeal to traditional Democrats and independent voters.Some Republicans have privately expressed that Shapiro is the most formidable candidate they could face, according to anonymous sources cited by NBC. Shapiro won the governorship in a landslide in 2022 against Trump-backed state Senator Doug Mastriano and gained national attention for his leadership during a major bridge collapse the following year. His response to an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania was praised by both Republicans and Democrats.However, Shapiro’s candidacy may face challenges, particularly regarding his stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict. Recently, Shapiro's old article claiming Palestianians couldn't ""co-exist peacefully"" surfaced. Following the October 7 Hamas attacks, Shapiro affirmed his support for Israel’s right to defend itself and resisted calls for a cease-fire. While this aligns him with many Democrats, his vocal criticism of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, which he described as antisemitic and compared to the KKK, could be a vulnerability with the party's left wing and younger voters, whom Harris is keen to attract.Tim Walz brings several strengths to the table as a potential vice presidential candidate. As a proven vote-getter and popular governor in Minnesota, a state that could be pivotal in the upcoming presidential election, Walz’s presence on the ticket might sway the race in favour of the Democrats. His modest background and relatable persona could help him appeal to voters across other crucial swing states, similar to how JD Vance is campaigning for the GOP in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Ohio. Walz's loyalty to the Democratic Party and alignment with Kamala Harris's agenda means he would likely be a reliable and effective voice for the ticket, avoiding internal conflicts and helping to amplify its message. Additionally, as Minnesota’s governor, he has access to experienced local operatives and a record of electoral success that could be leveraged to boost the campaign’s appeal in other swing states.However, Walz faces significant challenges that could hinder his candidacy. His low national profile is a drawback in a high-stakes, fast-paced presidential campaign, where name recognition is crucial. This lack of visibility could also make him an easier target for negative campaigning, particularly by the Trump campaign. Moreover, the key swing states in this election are Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where other potential vice presidential picks like Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly might offer stronger electoral advantages. Walz's handling of the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis could also be used against him, as the GOP might exploit these events to introduce him negatively to a national audience. Lastly, while Walz is a competent and well-liked governor, he lacks the charisma that might add energy to the ticket, potentially leaving the Democratic campaign without the additional “sizzle” that some might argue is needed. Despite these hurdles, this moment offers Walz a chance to step onto the national stage, and his consistent success in Minnesota suggests he should not be counted out in this competition.Mark Kelly brings a unique and impressive background to the table as a potential Vice Presidential candidate. His experience as a US Navy pilot, astronaut, and successful politician in Arizona, a crucial swing state, sets him apart from typical candidates. He also has a twin, which one social media user joked, would allow for twice the number of campaign appearences. Kelly’s centrist approach and strong fundraising abilities have helped him maintain high favourability ratings, making him a valuable asset to Kamala Harris in key battleground states. His personal story, including his partnership with his wife Gabrielle Giffords and their joint advocacy for gun control, resonates with voters on a deep emotional level. Additionally, Kelly’s proximity to the US-Mexico border and his stance on immigration could strengthen the ticket’s appeal, particularly in areas where Harris may face criticism.However, selecting Mark Kelly as Vice President comes with significant risks. The most pressing concern is the potential loss of his Senate seat in Arizona, which could tip the balance of power in the Senate if a Republican were to win the subsequent special election. Additionally, Kelly’s limited experience with political controversy and his less aggressive campaign style might be disadvantages in the high-pressure role of Vice President. His business ties, including his involvement with a space balloon company connected to China and selling vitamins in China, could also be points of attack from opponents. Moreover, while his advocacy for gun control is a strength, it could polarize voters, especially in swing states with strong pro-gun constituencies.","Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday.

Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy. For a nation largely comprising very young people, this would be an unmitigated disaster as it could have repercussions that may spill over generations. Already struggling to compete, the Pakistpeople will end up being deprived of even more chances to realise their potential and contribute positively on a global scale,"" the editorial said.According to the website DataReportal, there were 71.70 million active social media user identities in Pakistan in January 2024.

Data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 54.38 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Pakistan at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 38.9 per cent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.Meanwhile, according to Samaa TV, the Pakistan government has made previous attempts to regulate VPN usage by requiring registration, but these efforts have not resulted in significant action. In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions. The PTA also passed VPN regulations in 2010, but enforcement has been inconsistent.","Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others.

He said the bloated electricity bills were ""unacceptable"" for the inflation-hit masses.The PTI leader also said that they support Jamaat-e-Islami's (JI) sit-in - underway on Rawalpindi's Murree Road since July 26 - against the massive hike in power bills.However, JI Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman has said that his party would not become part of the PTI proposed grand alliance as history suggests that the opposition parties use such platforms for self-interest.""We will have the same stance as the opposition parties on some issues and hold meetings with them, but we will not become part of any alliance,"" Naeem said on Thursday.Ayub, while addressing the same press conference, appealed to the masses to attend the public gathering in Swabi on August 5 in large numbers from across the country to show solidarity with the former premier.Responding to criticism against the PTI founder for demanding negotiations with the Pakistan Army, Ayub said that they did not hold any discussion regarding the dialogue, however, he added that Khan made it clear that the military belongs to the nation and vice versa.He further said that the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were trying to drive a wedge between the military and the nation.Commenting on the cases against the jailed ex-prime minister, the opposition leader said that they were fighting a legal battle for Khan's release. Ayub blamed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for stopping the release of former first lady Bushra Bibi despite having no connections with the Toshakhana corruption case.The PTI secretary general demanded Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq to recuse themselves from hearing the PTI founder's cases, Geo News reported.The PTI believes he is being arrested in more cases at the behest of the powerful military establishment to make sure that he does not come out of jail.Khan was first arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a 190-million-pound corruption case. He faces over 200 cases and has been in jail since August last year.","Imran Khan has approved the formation of a ""grand opposition alliance"" by expanding the existing platform. Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser announced that the former ruling party would gather all opposition parties to run a powerful anti-government movement. He also rebuked the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government over skyrocketing power bills.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112222285,imgsize-556631,width-400,resizemode-4/112222285.jpg"
