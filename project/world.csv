Former US President and Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has raised over $160 million in the month of September, according to Trump’s campaign . This amount is 23 per cent more than what Republicans managed to raise in the previous month, which was around $130 million.As a result of this successful fundraising , Trump's campaign now has a cash reserve of around $283 million.Meanwhile, Trump’s counterpart in this election, Kamala Harris managed to get past the amount collected by the former President for the month of August. The Democratic Presidential nominee and her party raised $361 million, which gave an edge to the US vice president’s party.Official figures for the amount collected in the month of September have not been disclosed by the Harris’ campaign. However, the US Vice President’s party managed to raise $55 million this past weekend from two events, informed a campaign official on Sunday.The entry of Kamala Harris in the Presidential race against Trump revoked a new sense of energy in the Democratic party , which seemed quite nervous and clueless when Biden was in the race.Earlier, the polls were showing a clear lead to Republican candidate Trump, even in the battleground states attributed to a sympathy wave after surviving an assassination attempt and Biden’s deteriorating cognitive health, Trump’s re-election seemed like a cakewalk until Biden stepped out on July 21 and endorsed Kamala for the post.Her entry has now tilted the scenarios building up during the time of Biden’s nomination, as now polls are showing a tight race between the Republican candidate and the Democratic candidate.Both sides are now focusing on the swing states to manoeuvre in their favour with aggressive ad campaigns.","Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has raised over $160 million in the month of September.

A medical student and his girlfriend were quarantined and transported for further testing after they developed flu-like symptoms on a high-speed train at Hamburg Central Station in northern Germany .According to Bloomerg, the couple had recently arrived in Frankfurt from Rwanda, where the student had been working at a hospital treating Marburg patients.Rwanda had recently declared a Marburg outbreak after reporting 9 deaths due to the deadly virus.Platform four at the station was temporarily closed as a team of police and firefighters responded to the situation. The man and his girlfriend were then taken to a specialist clinic for further evaluation and treatment.Marburg virus disease is a highly dangerous illness that can lead to severe hemorrhagic fever , with a mortality rate that can reach up to 88%. It belongs to the same viral family as Ebola virus disease and produces symptoms such as fever, headaches, vomiting, and diarrhoea. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ""on average, the Marburg virus kills half of the people it infects.""The virus originates from prolonged exposure to mines or caves housing Rousettus bat colonies. Human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, secretions, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials.Marburg virus was first identified in 1967 when lab workers in Marburg, Frankfurt, and Serbia were infected with a previously unknown infectious agent.","A medical student and his girlfriend were quarantined and transported for further testing after they developed flu-like symptoms on a high-speed train.

'Steady stream of disinformation': Filing details evidence against 'increasingly desperate' Trump after 2020 election results,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/steady-stream-of-disinformation-insights-from-us-prosecutors-filing-on-an-increasingly-desperate-trump-after-2020-election-results/articleshow/113890417.cms,"A federal judge in Washington DC has unsealed a staggering 165-page document from Special Counsel Jack Smith offering insights into the high-stakes case against former President Donald Trump for alleged attempts to subvert the 2020 election results. This filing was made public just 34 days before Americans cast their ballots.With many Americans gearing up to decide whether to reinstate Trump in the White House, the contents of the filing provides a comprehensive outline of the prosecution’s case against Trump, detailing his actions and strategies aimed at overturning the election results—actions that prosecutors argue fall outside the protections of presidential immunity .The document alleges that Trump’s efforts to pressure Vice President Mike Pence not to certify the election were carried out in an unofficial manner, exempting them from the cloak of immunity typically given to a sitting president.The Associated Press reported that the filing contends that Trump had laid the groundwork for rejecting the election results even before the ballots were cast, telling advisers that in the event he held an early lead he would “declare victory before the ballots were counted and any winner was projected.""Throughout the filing, prosecutors depict Trump as a leader in a state of ""increasing desperation"", suggesting he resorted to deceit and manipulation to influence every stage of the electoral process.The document details a conversation that highlights Trump’s dismissive attitude towards the severity of the events unfolding on January 6, 2021. When informed that Pence had been evacuated from the Capitol due to the violent insurrection incited by Trump supporters, he reportedly replied, “So what?” Furthermore, when an aide warned him that a lawyer was unable to substantiate the false claims being made, Trump said, “The details don’t matter.”The filing also showcases Trump's calculated use of social media to disseminate misinformation about the election. Of the more than 1,200 tweets he sent during the weeks leading up to the insurrection, the majority revolved around unfounded claims of election fraud .Trump also promoted false assertions that Pence could reject electoral votes, despite being informed that the vice president lacked such authority. This “steady stream of disinformation,” prosecutors argue, culminated in Trump’s incendiary speech at the Ellipse on January 6, where he urged his supporters to march to the Capitol, setting the stage for the violent breach that followed.The filing references “forensic evidence” from Trump’s phone, aiming to provide further insights into his actions post-Capitol attack.In response, Trump and his campaign continue to vehemently deny any wrongdoing. A Trump campaign spokesperson labeled the brief as “falsehood-ridden” and unconstitutional, framing Smith’s investigation as a politically motivated attack. Trump himself took to his Truth Social platform, asserting that the case against him would ultimately end in his “complete victory.”","A federal judge in Washington DC has unsealed a 165-page document from Special Counsel Jack Smith offering insights into the high-stakes case against former President Donald Trump.

The United States is reportedly urging Israel to exercise caution while responding to Iran 's recent escalation of launching approximately 200 ballistic missiles on Tuesday night.During consultations following Iran's missile launch, US President Joe Biden and G7 leaders have stressed the importance of a ""proportionate"" response. Biden said, ""All seven of us agree that they have a right to respond, but they should respond in proportion.""The US has cautioned Israel against targeting Tehran's nuclear facilities , warning that such actions could escalate regional instability.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has discussed this position with his counterparts from France, Britain, Germany, and Italy with Washington being deeply concerned about the potential for further escalation in the Middle East While former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has advocated for a decisive strike on Iran's nuclear sites to ""fatally cripple this terrorist regime,"" the US favors avoiding an all-out regional war. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller reiterated, ""Israel has a right to respond... but we don't want to see any action that would lead to a full-blown regional war.""Israel recently conducted a deadly airstrike on aHezbollah rescue facility in central Beirut on Thursday, resulting in at least six fatalities, as reported by AFP citing Lebanese sources.

At one point, Acosta, visibly frustrated, interjected, ""What is this Kamala? It’s Kam-a-la Harris. Corey, you’ve been in this business a long time, I think you’re a mature grown-up. It’s Kam-a-la Harris. Can you just say Kamala? What’s going on there?""But Lewandowski’s refusal to comply led Acosta to abruptly end the interview.Earlier in the interview, Lewandowski and Acosta had engaged in a back-and-forth about the 2020 election , with Acosta pressing Lewandowski on why the Trump campaign continues to avoid acknowledging Trump’s defeat. “Why is it so difficult for the Trump campaign to answer a simple question—did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?” Acosta asked, echoing a sentiment raised during a vice presidential debate between Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Ohio Senator JD Vance the previous night.Lewandowski, deflecting, responded, ""Jim, I think it’s very simple. The American people have moved past the 2020 election. They’re focused on an election just under five weeks away. What we have now is an opportunity to talk about two different visions for America, and what JD Vance laid out last night is a very different vision than what Tim Walz and Kamala Harris want to say.""Acosta, not letting the moment pass, jumped in. ""It’s not about relitigating the past. It’s a simple question: Did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?"" Lewandowski, avoiding a direct answer, turned the conversation to economic issues, saying, ""Jim, why are we talking about 2020 anymore? Do the American people care about the 2020 election, or do they care about being able to put food on their table?""The interview also touched on other controversial topics, including immigration. Acosta also referenced a debunked claim by Trump and Vance that migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people’s pets. Lewandowski, in response, listed off statistics about immigrants, asserting, “13,099 murderers were let into this country,” in an apparent attempt to steer the conversation away.","CNN anchor Jim Acosta abruptly cut short an interview with Corey Lewandowski after the latter mispronounced Vice President Kamala Harris' name.

Tim Walz and JD Vance exchanged barbs on the campaign trail, despite maintaining a surprisingly calm and policy-focused discussion at the vice presidential debate on Wednesday.Known for his assertive support of Republican nominee Donald Trump , JD Vance caught many off guard with his cordial tone during the debate. However, he quickly reverted to a more combative style afterwards, commenting on his opponent's verbal missteps.In response, Walz criticized Vance for not directly addressing the outcome of the 2020 election .During the debate, Walz asked Vance to state the winner, but Vance did not provide a clear answer. Walz said, ""The moment that really stuck out is, I just asked the simplest of all questions that every single American should be able to answer. I asked him if Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. He refused to answer.""The Minnesota governor described the debate as ""spirited"" but labelled Vance a ""slick talker"" who made false claims about Trump. Walz also targeted Vance's stance on the 2020 election, calling it ""disqualifying."" He said, ""Understand in that 88th minute last night, with that damning non-answer, Senator Vance made it clear: he will always make a different choice than Mike Pence made.""Despite being credited with a strong debate performance, Vance seemed to avoid discussing the 2020 election post-debate. Instead, he focused on criticising Harris for inflation during a speech in Michigan, only addressing the 2020 issue in a Q&A. He accused the media of being ""obsessed"" with the past election, saying, ""I'm focused on the election of 33 days from now because I want to throw Kamala Harris out of office and get back to commonsense economic policies.""Vance also mocked Walz for a reported comment about school shooters , suggesting that Walz misspoke about being ""friends with school shooters"". He quipped, ""probably only the third or fourth dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night.""The debate on Tuesday reached an estimated 43 million viewers, which was less than the 58 million who tuned in to watch Kamala Harris debate Mike Pence in 2020.

Malcolm Gladwell , the best-selling author ofone of the most important non-fiction books of the 21st century, is back with its dark sequelWhile discussing the new book with the Guardian, Gladwell calls out what he calls Harvard’s admission officers’ “bias towards affluent white students”.Pointing out the disparity between Harvard and an institution with a merit-based admissions process like Caltech compared to Harvard, he writes: “My suspicion is that for many people it’s unconscious, but there must be a point at which [Harvard admissions tutors] are confronting the fact that they have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their campus hasn’t become dominated by Asians and Indians.”In the book, Gladwell notes that Caltech, a highly competitive university with a merit-based admissions system, saw the proportion of Asian American students rise from 25% to 43% between 1992 and 2013.In contrast, at Harvard, where the admissions process is influenced by factors such as legacy, donor contributions, and athletic scholarships, the percentage of Asian American students has remained consistently between 15-20% during the same period. Indian applicants are even more likely to be excluded by Harvard’s application process.Gladwell goes on to argue: ""Meritocracy is one of the most beautiful inventions of the 20th century – it is a foundation of a free society.""Here are 10 other key points aboutand Malcolm Gladwell:Malcolm Gladwell was initially reluctant to revisit his debut work but ultimately chose to create an entirely new version, one that reflects today's more anxious world rather than simply updating the original.The foundational idea that social trends behave like epidemics, initially growing slowly before suddenly taking off, still holds true. However, some of Gladwell's original examples have not aged well.Gladwell now finds his earlier chapter on crime ""embarrassing,"" as he once credited New York City's crime reduction to 'broken windows' policing. He has since acknowledged that this approach led to over-policing in minority neighbourhoods and wasn't actually responsible for the drop in crime rates.Gladwell values the process of learning from errors, a trait he respects in his father. He proposes that authors should periodically reassess their original works every 25 years to stay aligned with new insights.The new book is darker and more nuanced than the original. It delves into how a small number of individuals can disproportionately influence significant events, such as the opioid crisis, where a minority of doctors were responsible for nearly half of all prescriptions.While The Tipping Point became a cultural phenomenon, Gladwell’s latest book explores how individuals with substantial influence can shape societal changes, both positively and negatively.Gladwell reflects on how male leadership failures over the past eight years make a strong case for female leaders, particularly in the current political climate.Gladwell has expressed his support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, noting a personal connection through his mother, who shares Jamaican heritage with Harris's father.He argues that recent examples of male leadership failures have made it increasingly difficult to justify misogynistic attitudes and believes that America is ready for a female president.Now living with his partner and two young daughters, Gladwell views parenting as a journey of intellectual humility. He continuously adapts his understanding of his children as they grow and sees this phase of his life as a ""productivity mechanism"" that shapes his evolving perspective.","Malcolm Gladwell's new book, ""Revenge of the Tipping Point,"" is darker and more nuanced than the original.

Israel's military recently conducted a significant airstrike targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah using U.S.-supplied BLU-109 bombs with JDAM guidance kits. These 2,000-pound bombs, also known as ""bunker busters,"" are designed to penetrate fortified underground structures. The airstrike was captured in a video showing Israeli F-15i jets carrying out the mission, where the bombs were deployed to strike Hezbollah's underground command centre.This operation was part of Israel’s ongoing efforts to neutralise threats posed by Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran.As per reports, the U.S. has provided Israel with bunker buster bombs since 2005, with over 1,000 bombs included in a $6.5 billion military aid package in 2023. These bombs are equipped with delayed fuses, ensuring detonation only after penetrating the targeted bunkers.The strike resulted in the death of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrullah along with both military and civilian casualties, drawing international attention to the precision of Israel's military operations and the destructive capabilities of these advanced weapons.Bunker buster bombs, also known as ground-penetration munitions, are specialised weapons designed to destroy heavily fortified structures or underground bunkers. These bombs, weighing between 2,000 and 4,000 pounds, are loaded with explosives and equipped with delayed fuses to ensure they only detonate after reaching their target. They can penetrate up to 30 metres of earth or six metres of reinforced concrete, maximising structural damage through their impact and internal explosion.The concept of bunker busters originated during World War II, developed by German engineer August Coenders and tested between 1942 and 1943. However, these bombs gained prominence in modern warfare, particularly during the Gulf War, when precision-guided munitions became essential for targeting deeply buried enemy assets.: Developed during the Gulf War, this 5,000-pound bomb uses laser-guided technology for precision targeting.A GPS-guided bomb effective in adverse weather, capable of hitting deeply buried targets.: The largest bunker buster weighing 30,000 pounds, designed to penetrate up to 200 feet of reinforced concrete.Bunker busters bombs are equipped with advanced GPS or laser guidance systems for precise targeting, reducing collateral damage. Their strong casings allow the bombs to drill deep into hardened structures before detonating, making them ideal for targeting command centres, weapons depots, and other strategic locations.While bunker busters bombs are not banned by international law, their use in densely populated areas raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding potential civilian casualties. The Geneva Conventions emphasise avoiding unnecessary harm to civilians, making the deployment of such bombs controversial when used in urban environments.","Israel's military recently conducted a significant airstrike targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah using U.S.-supplied BLU-109 bombs.

What exactly is Iron Dome

When was Iron Dome first put in use

How does Iron Dome work

Cost of Iron Dome

Who has made Iron Dome

How is Iron Dome different from an air defence system

Iran on Tuesday attacked Israel to avenge killings of top chiefs Hezbollah and Hamas -- proxy militant groups which Tehran backs in the Middle East to counter the United State and Israel.After the Khamenei regime launched over 100 rockets, including ballistic missiles near Tel Aviv, Israel, as usual, deployed the Iron Dome to safeguard its civilians against foreign hostility.According to a Congressional Research Service report, the Iron Dome is a mobile anti-rocket, anti-mortar and anti-artillery system that can intercept launches from 2.5 to 43 miles away, or 4 to 70 kilometres. It then sends information about the rocket’s path to the command-and-control centre.The Iron Dome is a series of batteries that use radars to detect incoming short-range rockets and intercept them. According to Raytheon , the US defence giant that co-produces the system with Israel's Rafael Defense Systems, each battery has three or four launchers, 20 missiles, and a radar.As of 2021, Israel is said to have at least ten Iron Dome batteries deployed throughout the country, each designed to defend a 60-square-mile populated area.Development on the Iron Dome first began in the year 2007. After tests in 2008 and 2009, the first Iron Dome batteries were deployed in 2011. Israel activated the Iron Dome in 2011. The system has been “tested consistently” since first being put to use in April 2011.The Iron Dome radar identifies an incoming rocket within its range, from the battery and sends information about the rocket’s path to the command-and-control centre. The control centre calculates the location of impact and predicts whether the rocket is going to strike inhabited areas.If so, it launches a missile to intercept and destroy the rocket. However, if the system determines that the rocket is headed to an open area or into the sea, it is allowed to land, thus conserving missiles. According to the military, all interceptions occur in Israeli airspace.Each missile is reported to cost an estimated $40,000 to $50,000, according to the Institute for National Security Studies , a Tel Aviv think tank. The US too has invested heavily in the system, helping with development costs and replenishing it during major conflicts.US President Joe Biden recently said that he will ask Congress for $14.3 billion in military aid for Israel. “We’re surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome,” Biden said.Iron Dome has been developed by Israel-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with US backing.Unlike air defence systems designed to stop ballistic missiles, the Iron Dome warhead targets unguided rockets that remain at low altitudes. These are reported to be the type often fired by militant groups in Gaza.","The Iron Dome is a series of batteries that use radars to detect incoming short- range rockets and intercept them.

JD Vance 's story is one of resilience, shaped by his childhood in Middletown, Ohio, and summers spent in Jackson, Kentucky. At 40, he stands on the brink of becoming the youngest vice president since Nixon. His military service in the Marine Corps, where he served as a public affairs officer in Iraq, deepened his sense of duty and informed his political views.Gaining national attention with his 2016 memoir, "" Hillbilly Elegy ,"" Vance candidly explored the challenges of his upbringing, offering insight into the socio-economic struggles of Appalachia, which paved the way for his political career and shifting stance on former President Trump.JD Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, and spent summers with extended family in Jackson, Kentucky. His upbringing in these areas significantly influenced his perspectives. Vance turned 40 on August 2. If elected, he would become the youngest vice president since Richard Nixon. After high school, Vance joined the Marine Corps and served as a public affairs officer in Iraq, adding a layer of depth to his political identity.Vance married Usha Chilukuri Vance in 2014 after meeting at Yale Law School. Usha is a former litigator who left her job following Vance’s nomination for vice president. The couple has three young children: Ewan (7), Vivek (4), and Mirabel (2).

Will Biden support a decision to strike Iran's nuclear facilities? What the US President said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-biden-support-a-decision-to-strike-irans-nuclear-facilities-what-the-us-president-said/articleshow/113890725.cms,"US President Joe Biden (File photo)

'Won't Support Israel If...' Biden Opposes Israel Destroying Iran’s Nuclear Sites

US President Joe Biden on Wednesday rejected the possibility of supporting an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities in retaliation for the missile attack launched by Iran on Israel. “The answer is no,” Biden told reporters when asked about backing such a move, following Iran’s launch of approximately 200 missiles at Israel on Tuesday.“All seven of us agree that they have a right to respond, but they should respond in proportion,” Biden reiterated as he boarded Air Force One to tour the damage caused by Hurricane Helene in the Carolinas.""We will be discussing with the Israelis what they are going to do,"" Biden said when a reporter asked whether he would support a decision to strike Iran's nuclear facilities, Biden said he would consider that a step too far. Meanwhile Joe Biden said that, he planned to speak with Netanyahu ""relatively soon.""Biden’s remarks followed a teleconference with leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) nations, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, during which they coordinated new sanctions against Iran. The G7 leaders condemned Iran’s attack and expressed their solidarity with Israel's right to defend itself.The Biden administration has consistently urged caution, concerned that any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear program could trigger a wider regional conflict. “They should respond in proportion,” Biden stressed, highlighting the need for restraint in the escalating Middle East tensions.Tuesday's missile attack marked Iran’s second direct assault on Israel in six months, following a similar barrage in April. US military forces assisted Israel in defending against both attacks. Despite the heightened tensions, some analysts suggest that Israel may be less inclined to escalate the conflict into a broader confrontation with Iran.However Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to decide on a course of action, with options ranging from symbolic retaliatory strikes to more aggressive measures, including targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities. However, Biden’s opposition underscores the administration's concern about the risks of large-scale military action.Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other US officials continue to engage with their Israeli counterparts, stressing the need to avoid actions that could further inflame the situation.While some US officials believe Israel is less eager for a major confrontation compared to April, when the Biden administration successfully persuaded Israel to limit its military response, there are concerns that Israel may still take more forceful action against Iran.Simultaneously, Israel is engaged in military operations against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon.In recent weeks, Biden administration officials warned Netanyahu that the conflict with Hezbollah could spiral into a broader regional war, potentially involving Iran, the US, and other countries. However, Netanyahu has continued an aggressive military campaign in Lebanon, despite international calls for a ceasefire.Netanyahu's decision to approve the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah further heightened tensions, even as the US and other nations called for de-escalation between Israel and Lebanon.According to The New York Times, a senior US official said the Biden administration understands that Israel’s clash with Hezbollah is “local and targeted” and does not aim to escalate into a larger conflict or territorial invasion.","'Won't Support Israel If...'

Multiple women from anti-vax group allege romantic ties with Robert F Kennedy Jr after Nuzzi scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/multiple-women-from-anti-vax-group-allege-romantic-ties-with-robert-f-kennedy-jr-after-nuzzi-scandal/articleshow/113889286.cms,"At least three women have recently come forward, alleging that they had romantic relationships with Robert F Kennedy Jr in the past year, according to a report by Mediaite.The women reportedly connected with Kennedy through the Children’s Health Defense , an organization he chairs that is known for its anti-vaccine stance. These allegations come on the heels of a highly publicized “emotional and digital affair” between Kennedy and New York Magazine reporter Olivia Nuzzi , who is nearly 40 years younger than the former presidential candidate.The revelation of these new allegations adds another layer to an already turbulent narrative surrounding Kennedy’s personal life. His camp has vehemently denied the claims, issuing a statement to Mediaite that characterized the reports as “untrue.”The details of relationship with Kennedy were disclosed through a series of text messages from the women, sparked by news of his relationship with Nuzzi.The Daily Mail reported that the friends of Kennedy’s wife, actress Cheryl Hines , suggest that she may soon file for divorce, potentially prompted by the public scrutiny surrounding her husband’s romantic entanglements. However, Page Six reported that if Hines decides to end her marriage to Kennedy, it may stem more from his connections with figures like Donald Trump than his relationship with Nuzzi.In a bid to quell the controversy, Kennedy’s spokesperson asserted, “Mr. Kennedy has had no romantic relationships with any woman other than his wife since their marriage.”Interestingly, Kennedy has been on leave from his role as chairman and chief legal counsel of Children’s Health Defense since April 2023, as noted on the organization’s website.The implications of these allegations extend far beyond Kennedy's personal life. They could create significant challenges for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which Kennedy endorsed after withdrawing from his own bid for the White House. While Trump has attempted to distance himself from the controversy, the growing scandal surrounding Kennedy may become an unwanted distraction from Trump.","The women reportedly connected with Kennedy through the Children’s Health Defense, an organization he chairs that is known for its anti-vaccine stance.

Doctor pleads guilty in 'Friends' star Matthew Perry's death due to drug overdose,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doctor-pleads-guilty-in-friends-star-matthew-perrys-death-due-to-drug-overdose-ketamine-queen-depression/articleshow/113889172.cms,"San Diego doctor Mark Chavez became the third person to plead guilty in the investigation surrounding Matthew Perry ’s tragic death. Dr Chavez, 54, on Wednesday took the first step in cooperation with federal prosecutors , agreeing to a plea deal that could prove pivotal in targeting larger figures believed to be responsible for Perry’s demise.The “Friends” star, who played Chandler Bing, was found dead in October 2023 from a drug overdose that has now sparked a wide-reaching investigation into the illegal distribution of ketamine .The case exposed the chilling reality of how an off-label treatment for depression spiraled into a lethal cocktail. Perry, who had battled addiction for years, sought refuge in ketamine therapy—a controversial, yet increasingly common treatment for depression. However, as his dependency grew, so did his desperation. When his legal sources dried up, Perry turned to the dark underbelly of the medical world, allegedly aided by Dr Salvador Plasencia and notorious Los Angeles dealer Jasveen Sangha, known as the “ketamine queen.”Dr Chavez, standing before US District Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett, admitted his role in this dangerous network. His admission came as prosecutors recounted how he conspired with Plasencia to distribute ketamine to Perry through fraudulent prescriptions.Chavez, who once took an oath to do no harm, found himself supplying over 22 vials and nine lozenges of the powerful anesthetic. It was this very drug that Perry's assistant would find beside the actor’s lifeless body that fateful October day.“Are you pleading guilty because you did the things the prosecutors described?” Judge Garnett asked Chavez.“Yes, your honor,” he replied.The plea agreement Chavez signed in July binds him to cooperate fully as federal prosecutors continue to build their case against Plasencia, the doctor who allegedly delivered the fatal doses, and Sangha, the woman whose reputation as a drug supplier looms large in Los Angeles. Their roles, prosecutors argue, were far more sinister, as they preyed on Perry's vulnerability in his final months. US Attorney Martin Estrada, during a press conference in August, pointed to their exploitation of Perry’s history of addiction, providing him with “amounts they knew were dangerous.”Plasencia and Sangha are the ultimate targets. Text messages between Plasencia and Chavez, revealed in court filings, shed light on the extent of their illicit operations. In one exchange, Plasencia mused about how much Perry might pay for the drugs, calling the actor a “moron” and suggesting that they make themselves his go-to suppliers. Chavez, while hesitant at first, seemed to approve—so long as they stayed away from “shady stuff"".Chavez remains free on bond until his April 2 sentencing, having surrendered his passport and medical license as part of the agreement.Outside the courtroom, Chavez’s lawyer, Matthew Binninger, spoke briefly, signaling that his client had come to terms with his role in the tragic chain of events. “Mark entered his plea of guilty and that’s now public record,” Binninger said. “You accept responsibility and then you set sentencing,” he said.","San Diego doctor Mark Chavez is the third person to plead guilty in the investigation surrounding Matthew Perry's tragic death.

According to CBS News , the incident occurred on September 24, and authorities have condemned the act of violence against the 13-month-old dog.According to the Genesee County sheriff’s office, Josie was greeting individuals throughout the jail when Romello Maxwell struck her.Sheriff Chris Swanson reported that Josie suffered a concussion and scrapes to the inside of her pupil but is expected to recover.During a news conference on Tuesday, the sheriff shared surveillance footage of the incident, which showed Josie approaching Maxwell, who was lying on the ground before he punched her. The video ended with another inmate appearing to confront Maxwell in response to the attack.""We're going to hold people accountable. If they're going to do that to these animals, they're going to do it to people,"" Sheriff Swason said, holding Josie close during the press briefing.""Josie has returned to work, having resumed her duties the following Monday.""Prosecutor David Leyton moved forward with charges after reviewing the surveillance video. He indicated that Maxwell is being charged “as harshly as possible under Michigan law .” Given Maxwell’s history of assault against individuals, he is classified as a habitual offender, which increases the maximum penalty for the charge from four years to eight years.""I don't think the laws in Michigan are strong enough to protect our furry friends, and I think that if the legislature is listening and watching, maybe you'll want to take a bill in that increases the penalties for people who would harm our friends, our dogs and our cats,"" Leyton remarked.","Josie, a 13-month-old therapy dog, suffered a concussion and scrapes to the inside of her pupil but is expected to recover.

Donald Trump: 'Details don't...': Judge unseals filing detailing Trump’s attempts to overturn 2020 election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/details-dont-judge-unseals-filing-detailing-trumps-attempts-to-overturn-2020-election/articleshow/113886435.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump

Judge Tanya Chutkan has unsealed portions of a filing from prosecutors that argue for the continuation of the case against former US President Donald J Trump, despite the Supreme Court ’s recent ruling on presidential immunity . The special counsel, Jack Smith , contends that Trump is not shielded from prosecution on federal charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election , according to the New York Times .The disclosed brief adds crucial details to the extensive record regarding Trump’s attempts to retain power after losing the election. Among the revelations is a social media post Trump made on January 6, 2021, the day of the Capitol attack. In the post, he said that vice president Mike Pence had “let them all down.” Smith argues that this post should be seen as an act of a desperate candidate rather than an official act of a sitting president, which would typically warrant immunity under a landmark Supreme Court ruling from this summer.As the Capitol riot unfolded, an aide entered the Oval Office to inform Trump of the situation, hoping he would act to ensure Pence’s safety. Instead, Trump reportedly responded, “So what?” This exchange was also revealed through grand jury testimony included in the brief.The document also noted that Trump had previously received “an honest assessment” from one of his lawyers, who informed him that his claims of widespread fraud in the election would likely not hold up in court. Trump said, “The details don’t matter.”Additionally, the brief recounts a private lunch in mid-November 2020, during which Pence urged Trump to accept his election loss and consider running again in 2024. Trump’s response, “I don’t know, 2024 is so far off,” indicates his unwillingness to confront the reality of his defeat.Smith's 165-page brief was filed under seal last week to assist Judge Chutkan in determining which parts of the indictment could withstand the Supreme Court’s ruling granting Trump immunity for many official acts during his presidency. Prosecutors asserted that Trump's conduct was not official but rather a private scheme to overturn the election, saying, “Although the defendant was the incumbent president during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one.”The brief serves not only a legal purpose but also functions as a trial brief, presenting Smith’s comprehensive findings from nearly two years of investigation into Trump’s actions surrounding the election. The filing was accompanied by a sealed appendix containing FBI interviews, search warrant affidavits, and grand jury testimony.","Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed portions of a filing from prosecutors that argue for the continuation of the case against former US President Donald J Trump.

Former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin accused senator JD Vance of “straight up lying” about Donald Trump ’s stance on Obamacare , a healthcare reform law, during a discussion on The View following Tuesday’s vice presidential debate , according to the Daily Beast.Griffin, who served as a communications official during Trump’s administration, refuted Vance’s claims that Trump attempted to salvage the Affordable Care Act .“When [Vance] said Trump tried to save Obamacare, I was on Capitol Hill and we were trying to repeal Obamacare,” she said, remarking on her firsthand experience of the Republican agenda . “I’m willing to admit what we were trying to do as Republicans.”Vance had asserted that Trump could have “destroyed the programme” but instead “worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care.” Griffin strongly disagreed, calling his comments a blatant falsehood. Co-host Joy Behar weighed in, calling on Vance’s “slickness” and comparing him to a seller of counterfeit luxury bags. She noted she had never witnessed such “straight-faced” lying, suggesting that Trump might feel “jealous” of Vance’s ability to maintain composure while delivering similar talking points.Despite her criticism of Vance’s honesty, Griffin acknowledged that he outperformed governor Tim Walz during the debate. “From a performance and delivery perspective, Tim Walz had the rockier night,” she commented. “JD Vance strategically went in to do midwestern nice to disarm Tim Walz, and Tim Walz kind of took the bait. He wasn’t in fighting mode.”Griffin pointed out that Walz missed opportunities to capitalise on key moments during the debate. However, she maintained that Vance’s performance did not alter her opinion of him. “Performance-wise, [Vance] is eloquent; he can feign empathy,” she said.","Former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin accused JD Vance of ""straight up lying"" about Donald Trump's stance on Obamacare.

Notable matchups

Voting begins Wednesday for the annual Fat Bear Week contest at Alaska ’s Katmai National Park and Preserve, where fans can select their favourite among a dozen brown bears that have fattened up in preparation for winter, according to the Associated Press . This marks the 10th anniversary of the popular competition, celebrating the resilience of the park's 2,200 brown bears, which feast on the abundant sockeye salmon returning to the Brooks River.The announcement of this year's contestants was delayed by a day due to the tragic death of Bear 402, a female bear, who was killed by a male bear during a fight on Monday.The park's livestreaming cameras captured the incident. Park spokesperson Matt Johnson said, “National parks like Katmai protect not only the wonders of nature but also the harsh realities. Each bear seen on the webcams is competing with others to survive.”Katmai National Park ranger Sarah Bruce noted that the reasons behind the bears’ aggressive behaviour remain unclear. Mike Fitz, the resident naturalist for explore.org, acknowledged the duality of celebrating the bears’ success while recognising the “ferocity” and challenges they face. “The risks that they face are real. Their lives can be hard, and their deaths can be painful,” he said.This year's competition features a bracket of 12 bears, with eight facing off in the first round while four receive byes to the second. These bears have been packing on the pounds throughout the summer, preparing for their winter hibernation. Adult male brown bears typically weigh between 600 to 900 pounds (about 270 to 410 kilograms) in mid-summer, but can tip the scales at over 1,000 pounds (454 kilograms).Fans are encouraged to vote not just for the largest bears but for those that ""best exemplify fatness and success in brown bears."" Among the contestants is Bear 909 Jr, who recently claimed victory in the Fat Bear Junior competition. He will face Bear 519, a young female, in the first round. The winner will go up against the defending champion, Grazer , one of the most formidable bears in the river.Other notable first-round matchups include Bear 903, known as Gully for his taste for seagulls, facing off against Bear 909, the mother of Bear 909 Jr. The winner will challenge Bear 747, a two-time champion named after the massive aircraft. In another match, Bear 856, an older and well-recognised bear, will compete against newcomer Bear 504, who is raising her second known litter. The victor will face 32 Chunk, a colossal 20-year-old bear reputed for consuming 42 salmon in just 10 hours.The final matchup features Bear 151, a once-playful bear nicknamed Walker, against Bear 901, a solo female returning to the river after losing her first litter. The winner will go up against Bear 164, affectionately named Bucky Dent due to an indentation in his forehead.Voting for this year’s tournament-style bracket is open until October 8, with more than 1.3 million votes cast last year.","Voting begins Wednesday for the annual Fat Bear Week contest at Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve.

Islamabad, In an effort to minimise administrative expenditures, cash-strapped Pakistan on Sunday announced to abolish about 150,000 government posts , close six ministries, and merge two others, as part of reforms agreed upon with the IMF under USD 7 billion loan deal . The International Monetary Fund on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to cut expenditures, increase tax-to GDP ratio, tax non-traditional sectors like agriculture and real estate, limit subsidies and transfer some fiscal responsibilities to provinces.Addressing the media on his return from the US, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that a programme had been finalised with the IMF, which would be the last programme for Pakistan.""We need to implement our policies to prove that it will be the last programme,"" he said, and emphasised that in order to join the G20, the economy must be formalised.The minister said right-sizing within ministries was going on and the decision to close six ministries is set to be implemented, while two ministries will be merged. ""Additionally, 150,000 posts across various ministries will be eliminated,"" Aurangzeb said.He dwelt at length on increasing tax revenues, noting that there were approximately 300,000 new taxpayers last year, and so far this year, 732,000 new taxpayers have registered, increasing the total number of taxpayers in the country from 1.6 million to 3.2 million.Aurangzeb also said that the non-filers category will be abolished and those not paying taxes will no longer be able to purchase property or vehicles.The minister claimed that the economy was moving in the right direction and the country's foreign exchange reserves had increased, reaching their highest level. He highlighted significant growth in both national exports and IT exports, and stated that investor confidence regarding the strength of the economy is a major success.Aurangzeb stated that the policy rate has been reduced by 4.5 per cent by the government after coming to power, and expressed optimism that the exchange rate and policy rate will remain as expected.""Our claim that the economy is improving is not a hollow claim because inflation has decreased due to government policies. Inflation has dropped to single digits,"" he said.Pakistan has been struggling to fix its economy for the last many years and it was close to default in 2023 but a timely loan of USD 3 billion by the IMF saved the situation.Pakistan has negotiated a long-term loan with the global lender with the hope and commitment that it would be the last loan. However, many doubt this claim as the country has already secured about two dozen loans from the Fund but failed to address the economy on a permanent basis.","Pakistan to abolish about 150,000 government posts, close six ministries, and merge two others.

ISLAMABAD: At least 64 people have been killed this week in a fresh outbreak of violence involving the Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan 's militancy-prone Kurram district along the Afghanistan border in the northwest, where a ceasefire had been signed just over a month ago.Governor Faisal Karim Kundi of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said dozens on either side were wounded in the fighting, which continued Friday amid reports of higher casualties than the official figure.Police said the clashes started after the Boshehra Shias of upper Kurram started setting up bunkers on land belonging to the Sunni Ahmadzai community last week. The dispute quickly engulfed other areas and became a full-blown sectarian conflict , they said.In Aug, the warring sides signed a truce after clashes resulted in 50 deaths and injuries to over 200 people.Security officials said the renewed fighting led to closure of roads, triggering a shortage of food, medicines and fuel. Educational institutions have also remained shut for a week.Kurram, a mountainous area that shares a long border with Afghanistan, is home to about 700,000 people, of which more than 42% belong to the Shia community. The district's Parachinar town is one of the few Shia-dominated areas in largely Sunni Pakistan. The region has seen frequent tribal and sectarian clashes in recent years.","At least 64 people killed in fresh outbreak of violence involving Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan's militancy-prone Kurram district.

TOI had reported on Tuesday that Jaishankar will visit Sri Lanka on October 4.Jaishankar’s visit for a meeting with the new president, barely a couple of weeks into Dissanayake’s presidency, is meant to build on the Indian outreach to the relatively unfamiliar leader ahead of the presidential poll that saw him visiting India earlier this year. The Indian government is also banking on the goodwill generated by its $ 4 billion-worth assistance to the strategically crucial Indian Ocean nation - in the middle of an acute financial crisis - to ride out any negative fallout from the winds of political change blowing in the country.Jha also met the new Lankan PM, Harini Amarasuriya, on Wednesday. According to Dissanayake, the high commissioner reflected on the long-standing friendship and closeness between the two nations, highlighting the importance of maintaining a continuous and stable partnership as neighbouring states.Furthermore, the president added, Jha pointed out the significance of digitizing government systems to effectively combat corruption. ``He appreciated the anti-corruption program outlined in our policy statement, and he expressed India’s willingness to assist Sri Lanka in implementing these digitization initiatives,’’ said Dissanayake.Dissanayake’s anti-corruption focus in the election campaign found a lot of traction among young voters, who were upset with the mishandling of Sri Lanka’s financial crisis and also with discredited political dynasties who for long held the reins of power. India believes Dissanayake’s emphasis on rooting out corruption in the handling of infrastructure projects will work in its favour as it believes in transparent infrastructure development backed by responsible debt financing practices.","Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake met Indian high commissioner Santosh Jha.

"Video: World War II-era 'anti-Kamikaze' bomb explodes at Japan airport, 87 flights cancelled",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/ww2-era-kamikaze-bomb-explodes-at-japan-airport-87-flights-cancelled/articleshow/113873959.cms,"【速報】空港で爆発音、誘導路陥没 宮崎、不発弾の可能性も

What is 'Kamikaze bomber'

A regional airport in southwest Japan was closed on Wednesday after the explosion of what is believed to be a World War Two-era bomb near its runway, leading to the cancellation of nearly 90 flights.Miyazaki Airport suspended operations when the blast created a crater seven meters wide and one meter deep on the taxiway adjacent to the runway, according to an official from the Japanese transport ministry.A bomb disposal team from the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force later confirmed that the explosion was caused by an American bomb, likely dropped during an air raid to prevent ""kamikaze"" attacks during the war. The bomb had been buried beneath the surface for decades, the official added.Although no injuries were reported, local broadcaster MRT shared live footage showing that an airplane had been taxiing just two minutes before the explosion occurred.As a result of the incident, 87 flights were grounded, but Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi assured that there is no risk of further explosions. Repairs to the damaged area are expected to be completed by Thursday morning.The affected flights included those operated by Japan Airlines (JAL), All Nippon Airways (ANA), and other carriers connecting Miyazaki to major cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka.Miyazaki Airport, located on the southeastern coast of Kyushu island, was previously a Japanese navy base during World War Two, from where many kamikaze pilots embarked on their final missions, according to the Miyazaki city website.This is not the first time unexploded bombs have been found at the airport. The transport ministry noted that remnants of wartime airstrikes are still discovered across Japan, despite the war ending over 79 years ago. In fiscal year 2023 alone, 2,348 bombs weighing a total of 37.5 tonnes were safely disposed of by the Self-Defense Forces.A kamikaze bomber refers to a Japanese military pilot who deliberately carried out suicide missions during World War II, particularly in the latter stages of the war. The term ""kamikaze"" comes from the Japanese words ""kami"" (meaning divine or god) and ""kaze"" (meaning wind), translating to ""divine wind."" Kamikaze pilots intentionally crashed their planes, often laden with explosives, into enemy ships or targets, sacrificing their lives in an effort to inflict maximum damage.The kamikaze tactic was primarily used by the Japanese Imperial Navy and Air Force against Allied naval vessels, especially during the Battle of Okinawa and other Pacific Theater battles. These missions were seen as a last resort as Japan's military resources dwindled, and they aimed to slow down the advancing Allied forces.The kamikaze strategy became a symbol of extreme sacrifice, as pilots were typically young men who were willing to die for the cause, viewing their missions as an honourable duty to defend their country.Kamikaze strikes against Allied warships continued throughout World War II. Kamikaze pilots deliberately crashed specially made planes directly into enemy warships, which resulted in suicide. It was a desperate policy.","Miyazaki Airport in southwest Japan was closed on Wednesday after the explosion of what is believed to be a World War Two-era bomb.
