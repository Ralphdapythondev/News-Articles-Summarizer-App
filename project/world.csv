'It was a hard hit’: Trump describes shooting as ‘surreal’ in Musk interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/it-was-a-hard-hit-trump-describes-shooting-as-surreal-in-musk-interview/articleshow/112482119.cms,"Musk’s endorsement and technical difficulties

In a live conversation on X with billionaire CEO Elon Musk , former US President Donald Trump recounted his experience of the recent shooting incident at a campaign rally , describing it as a ""hard hit"" and ""surreal."" The discussion, which aired Monday night, was delayed due to a technical glitch and a cyberattack.When asked by Musk about the shooting, Trump described the experience as ""not pleasant,"" recounting the moment he felt the bullet hit his ear.""It was a hard hit. It was very, I guess you would say, surreal, but it wasn't surreal,"" Trump said. He continued, ""I knew immediately that it was a bullet. The only question in my mind when I went down was, 'How many were killed?'""Trump was on stage at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13 when gunshots rang out, prompting Secret Service agents to intervene. Hours after the incident, Trump reported that the bullet had pierced the upper part of his right ear. The FBI has identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.Musk revealed that he endorsed Trump's presidential campaign in part due to Trump's reaction during the rally. ""Trump pumping his fists was just incredibly inspiring,"" Musk said.The live stream of the conversation faced significant disruptions. Initially scheduled for 8 pm ET, the event was delayed to 8:42 pm ET due to a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that overwhelmed X’s servers. Musk explained that the attack ""saturated hundreds of gigabits of data,"" making the platform nearly inaccessible for users.During the technical difficulties, users on X encountered issues accessing the livestream. Trending hashtags like ""crashed"" and ""#TwitterBlackout"" reflected widespread frustration as users faced error messages and screen outages.Despite the disruptions, the interview provided a stark reflection on the impact of the shooting and the ongoing challenges of digital security in high-profile broadcasts.","Former US President Donald Trump recounted his experience of the recent shooting incident at a campaign rally.

""I heard people shouting, ‘Bullets, bullets.’""He further described the situation, saying, ""we had bullets flying right over my head after I went down. So I'm glad I went down. The bigger miracle was that I was looking in the exact direction of [Crooks].""Trump also spoke about Corey Comperatore , the man who lost his life in the attack, calling him a “great Trumper” and a terrific person. He added that supporters had raised significant funds for Comperatore’s family.The former US President commended the secret service for the swift actions and the crowd's ability to remain calm.“You didn’t have anybody flee, you didn’t have anyone stampede,” Trump remarked, noting his immediate concern about the lack of security on the rooftop.“That would have been the spot [for a gunman],” he added.Musk, once a critic of Trump, praised the Republican presidential nominee's toughness pointing to his response to last month's shooting as crucial for national security.“There are some real tough characters out there,"" X CEO said. ""And if they don’t think the American president is tough, they will do what they want to do.”The conversation between Trump and Musk, which lasted for over two hours and was largely friendly, offered few new details about Trump's plans for a potential second term.The former president mainly discussed his recent assassination attempt, illegal immigration, and his intentions to reduce government regulations.","Former US President Donald Trump recounted his assassination attempt in a conversation with tech giant and world's richest person, Elon Musk.

"Suspected attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels targets ship in southern Red Sea, officials say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/suspected-attack-by-yemens-houthi-rebels-targets-ship-in-southern-red-sea-officials-say/articleshow/112481193.cms,"DUBAI: A suspected attack by Yemen 's Houthi rebels targeted a ship in the southern reaches of the Red Sea early Tuesday, officials said, the latest in their campaign of assaults over the Israel-Hamas war.The attack comes as Yemen's main sponsor, Iran , weighs a possible retaliatory attack against Israel over the assassination of Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh in late July, which has renewed fears of a wider regional war breaking out across the Mideast.Already, the Houthi assaults have have disrupted the $1 trillion of goods that flow annually through the maritime route crucial to trade between Asia, Europe and the Middle East, while also sparking the most intense combat the US Navy has seen since World War II.The attack happened around 115 kilometers (70 miles) south of the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said. The attack saw an explosive detonate near the ship, though ""the vessel and crew are reported safe,"" the UKMTO said.The private security firm Ambrey similarly reported the attack, saying the ship saw ""two 'close-proximity' explosions.""Though the Houthis didn't immediately claim the attack, it sometimes can take hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults. They've also claimed others that apparently haven't happened.The Houthis have targeted more than 70 vessels with missiles and drones in a campaign that has killed four sailors since the start of the war in Gaza in October. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the time since. Other missiles and drones have been either intercepted by a US-led coalition in the Red Sea or splashed down before reaching their targets.The rebels maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the UK as part of a campaign they say seeks to force an end to the war. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel, including an attack on July 19 that killed one person and wounded 10 others in Tel Aviv. Israel responded the next day with airstrikes on the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida that hit fuel depots and electrical stations, killing and wounding a number of people, the rebels say.After the strikes, the Houthis paused their attacks until Aug. 3, when they hit a Liberian-flagged container ship traveling through the Gulf of Aden. A Liberian-flagged oil tanker came under a particularly intense series of attacks beginning Aug. 8 likely carried out by the rebels.As Iran threatens to retaliate over Haniyeh, the US military has told the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to sail more quickly to the area. America also has ordered the the USS Georgia guided missile submarine into the Mideast, while the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier strike group had been in the Gulf of Oman. Additional F-22 fighter jets have flown into the region, while the USS Wasp, a large amphibious assault ship carrying F-35 fighter jets, is in the Mediterranean Sea.","The attack happened around 115 kilometers (70 miles) south of the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida.

Donald Trump: US elections: FBI investigates allegations of stolen Trump campaign documents in cyber attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-fbi-investigates-allegations-of-stolen-trump-campaign-documents-in-cyber-attack/articleshow/112480631.cms,"The FBI has initiated an investigation into allegations that sensitive documents from the Trump Campaign were stolen in a cyber attack. “We can confirm the FBI is investigating this matter,” said the FBI in a brief statement.This development follows the Trump Campaign's assertion that it was hacked by Iran, AP reported.While the campaign has not provided specific evidence to support its hacking claims, it cites a report from Microsoft about foreign agents' attempts to interfere in the 2024 US election.As per reports, a spear-phishing email was sent in June by an Iranian military unit to a high-ranking official of the presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.Microsoft’s report indicated that ""foreign malign influence concerning the 2024 US election started off slowly but has steadily increased over the last six months, initially due to Russian operations, and more recently from Iranian activity.""Further analysis in the report stated, ""Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three US election cycles. Iran's operations have been notable and distinguishable from Russian campaigns for appearing later in the election season and employing cyberattacks more geared toward election conduct than swaying voters.""Concluding the report, Microsoft noted, ""Recent activity suggests the Iranian regime—along with the Kremlin—may be equally engaged in Election 2024.""Politico reported receiving emails starting July 22 from an unidentified AOL account under the name ""Robert."" The emails contained what appeared to be a research dossier prepared by the campaign on Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Senator JD Vance. The dossier was dated February 23, nearly five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate.Reacting to the report, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung stated, ""These documents were obtained illegally"" and are ""intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process.""Iran's delegation to the United Nations has denied involvement when questioned about the Trump campaign's claims.Despite this, there have been longstanding suspicions regarding Iran's engagement in hacking operations aimed at its adversaries in the Middle East and other regions. Additionally, Tehran has consistently expressed its intention to seek revenge against Trump for the 2020 drone strike he authorized that resulted in the death of prominent Revolutionary Guard General Qassem Soleimani.","The FBI is investigating allegations that sensitive documents from the Trump Campaign were stolen in a cyber attack.

US Elections 2024: US elections 2024: Trump and Kamala’s differing ideologies offer contrasting outlooks for voters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-2024-trump-and-kamalas-differing-ideologies-offer-contrasting-outlooks-for-voters/articleshow/112481148.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are presenting voters with sharply contrasting visions as they campaign nationwide. Harris, alongside her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , is championing a message of optimism, branding their campaign as a team of ""joyful warriors.""In contrast, Trump has adopted a more sombre tone, cautioning about potential national challenges, reported AP.Harris and Walz are actively engaging with voters through a campaign tour of key battleground states , which recently included a high-energy rally in Philadelphia and stops in Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, and Nevada. However, planned events in Georgia and North Carolina were cancelled due to Tropical Storm Debby. Harris emphasized the theme of joy, saying, ""Thank you for bringing back the joy,"" and branding the Democratic ticket as ""joyful warriors.""Trump, campaigning with his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, has taken a different approach. At a recent news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trump warned of ""a lot of bad things coming up,"" predicting potential economic decline and other serious challenges. This marks a stark contrast to the optimistic tone of the Harris-Walz campaign.Polling data from The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reveals widespread pessimism, with two-thirds of Americans feeling uneasy about the political climate and about 70% believing the country is heading in the wrong direction. Despite this, Trump’s senior adviser, Jason Miller, argues that voters are focused on practical issues, noting, ""That's not making gas or food or housing less expensive.""Vance has echoed Trump’s economic concerns while criticizing the Democratic ticket and defending past remarks. He has underscored Trump’s accomplishments and proposed policies for a second term, while also addressing criticisms of Walz’s military record.Walz is preparing for his first solo events as Harris' running mate, beginning with a speech at the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees convention in Los Angeles. He will also attend fundraisers in Newport Beach, California, and visit additional cities including Denver, Boston, Rhode Island, and Southampton, New York.Trump is scheduled for a live interview on X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter, which he was banned from following the January 6, 2021, Capitol incident. Hosted by Elon Musk, the interview has faced technical issues and has been postponed. Musk, who had previously identified as a Democrat, endorsed Trump’s candidacy after an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. The FBI is currently investigating allegations of stolen sensitive documents from the Trump campaign in a recent cyber intrusion.As the campaign progresses, voters will continue to hear from both candidates and their running mates. Harris and Walz will persist in promoting their optimistic vision, while Trump and Vance will highlight potential future challenges. The initial phases of the Harris-Walz campaign have attracted large, enthusiastic crowds with a focus on joy, aiming to contrast with Trump’s more cautionary predictions and appeal to an electorate concerned about the nation’s direction.Tim Walz will continue his campaign this week with various fundraisers and speaking engagements, further reinforcing the optimistic message central to the Harris-Walz campaign.In summary, the contrasting messages from Harris and Trump offer voters distinct visions for the future, reflecting the broader debate on the nation’s path forward.","Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are championing a message of optimism, branding their campaign as a team of ""joyful warriors"" Trump has adopted a more sombre tone, cautioning about potential national challenges.

Recently, the Iraqi government introduced a draft measure in the parliament that would lower the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to just 9. This implies that child marriage would become acceptable once more. This is perceived by activists and demonstrators in Iraq as a serious danger to women's rights since it leaves the young girls, who are only nine years old, open to forced marriage and ""child rape.""The legal age of marriage varies from nation to nation throughout the world.While some, like the United Kingdom, have set the age at 18 for both men and women, underage marriage is still permitted with parental approval. In India, the legal age of marriage is fixed at 18 for men and 21 for women. This year, the bill to raise the age at which women may marry expired. A number of nations allow child marriages. Any age of child can get married with the approval of their parents or father figure. Let's examine a few nations in the world for the highest and lowest marriage age.With few exclusions that vary by nation, most governments permit marriages between people under the age of 18. In 2010, 158 nations declared that the legal minimum age for women to marry without parental approval or consent was 18. Males are legally allowed to marry in 180 countries at the age of 18, while males can marry with parental approval in 105 countries. Many EU nations have strengthened their marriage rules in recent years, outlawing unions between people under the age of 18 or demanding judicial consent. Very similar legislation has also been passed by other emerging nations.","The legal age of marriage varies from nation to nation throughout the world.

They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together,” Prof Yunus said during a session with students at Begum Rokeya University. He urged students to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.Thousands of protesters demonstrated in major cities like Dhaka, Chattogram, Barisal, Tangail and Kurigram saying that Hindus have a right to live in Bangladesh.They blocked the Shahbagh intersection in Dhaka for the second consecutive day on Saturday to protest against attacks on homes, shops, and temples in various parts of the country following the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt.“August 2024: Save Bangladeshi Hindus.

We want answers”, “Hindu persecution in independent Bangladesh, it will not continue”, “Religion is for individuals, the state is for everyone”, and “Ensure the safety of Hindus”.The Hindu minorities demonstrating in Shahbag demanded security for the Hindus and their homes, temples and businesses, the arrest of those who perpetrated violence against them, and compensation for vandalism, loot and torture.Members of minority communities in Bangladesh faced at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts since the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt on Aug 5, according to two Hindu organisations — Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad — in the country.

The couple's joint appearance, their first since the explosive Oprah Winfrey interview, has been branded a ""car crash"" amid allegations of behind-the-scenes tension and anger, as reported by The Mirror.During a recent appearance on GB News, Royal author Angela Levin shared her take on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's latest interview, claiming that the Duchess of Sussex was ""screaming"" and ""very annoyed"" after the cameras stopped rolling, the Mirror reported.During the CBS Sunday Morning interview, the couple intended to discuss online harm and their philanthropic endeavors. However, the conversation took an unexpected turn when Meghan was questioned about her previously disclosed suicidal thoughts, which she reportedly did not expect. Royal author Angela Levin claims that Markle was visibly upset by the line of questioning, revealing a tense atmosphere that persisted off-camera.""After the interview was over, she was apparently screaming at the producers, very, very annoyed at what they had asked her,"" Levin said on Dan Wootton's show. ""You mustn't do that with Meghan because she's in control. But you could see she couldn't contain her anger, her fury,” she added.Observers and body language experts noted a palpable sense of discomfort between the couple during the interview, according to body language expert Judi James. Harry appeared either bored or distracted, and Meghan’s icy stares seemed to convey dissatisfaction whenever he spoke. Broadcaster Dan Wootton remarked, “It certainly wasn’t a good 43rd birthday for the Duchess of Sussex, was it?”Levin further emphasized the strain in their dynamic, saying, ""Just the same as in and out of the interview, she couldn't stand Harry speaking. She would look at him with such harsh eyes and such a terrible expression on her face because she didn't want him to talk, I imagine. He is really lost at the moment... I think that he's in a very, very bad way.""The interview, which was meant to mark a fresh start in their public engagement, has instead raised questions about the couple’s relationship dynamics and their handling of media scrutiny. Branding it a “car crash,” Wootton commented on the failed attempt at damage control, noting the couple's awkward chemistry despite their united front.","Royal author Angela Levin claims that Meghan Markle was ""screaming"" and ""very annoyed"" after the CBS Sunday Morning interview.

US elections: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to face off in prime-time debate on September 10,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-to-face-off-in-prime-time-debate-on-september-10/articleshow/112389058.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to meet in a highly anticipated prime-time debate on September 10, as announced by ABC News on Thursday. This 90-minute showdown, expected to be held in Philadelphia, marks a pivotal moment in an unpredictable presidential campaign that has already seen significant twists and turns.The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Although the exact format and ground rules are still being finalized, it is likely that the event will proceed without a live audience, according to sources familiar with the plans.Notably, Trump had proposed three debates with major networks - September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with NBC, and September 25 with ABC. However, Harris has agreed to participate only in the September 10 debate with NBC. Harris has not yet provided reasons for declining the other proposed dates.This announcement follows Trump's initial agreement to debate President Joe Biden on the same date, an arrangement made months ago. However, after Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Trump questioned the validity of that commitment with Harris, leading to uncertainty over whether the debate would take place.Recent events, including Biden's exit and an assassination attempt on Trump, have drawn renewed attention to the presidential race, which had initially been shaping up as a repeat of the 2020 election. The upcoming ABC debate is expected to serve as a critical moment in the campaign's final stretch leading up to the election.Trump has also indicated his willingness to engage in additional debates with Harris, proposing events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. However, the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these additional debates. NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate on September 25, but Harris has not committed to participating. Similarly, no agreement has been reached for a debate hosted by Fox News.","The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Although the exact format and ground rules are still being finalized, it is likely that the event will proceed without a live audience. Trump had proposed three debates with major networks - September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with NBC, and September 25 with ABC. However, Harris has agreed to participate only in the September 10 debate with NBC.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112389088,imgsize-120096,width-400,resizemode-4/112389088.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former US president Donald Trump on Monday during his interview with tech giant Elon Musk praised Israel 's defence military system Iron Dome which can destroy short-range weapons.""Why shouldn't we have an Iron Dome? Israel has one,"" said Trump.The system which is nothing less than a shield that protects and counters rockets or mortars that are fired at Israel.It is no secret that Israel admits that the Iron Dome missile defence system has helped protect the country against rockets fired by the Hamas group from Gaza.The Israeli military states that without the Iron Dome the casualties would have been far higher during the ongoing war.Designed to protect against incoming short-range weapons Iron Dome operates in all weather conditions. The system uses radar to track rockets while differentiating between the places that are densely populated or not. The radar-guided system then launches the interceptor missiles to destroy the threats mid-air accordingly. The system is placed across Israel, and every launcher is capable of firing 20 interceptor missiles in one go.Developed after a 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, who then launched thousands of rockets into Israel causing huge damage to the country and killing dozens of citizens.In response to this later Israel developed the most successful missile system with the support of the US. The system was developed by Israeli firms Rafael Advances Defense System and Israel Aerospace Industries.The system was first put into use in 2011 combat, the system counter-attacked a missile fired from the Gaza strip by Hamas. After a successful run in 2011 US announced to buy and test some Iron Dome batteries.Israel's military says the Iron Dome defence system has a success rate of up to 90 per cent. Hamas claimed it launched 5,000 rockets on the first day of its attack, but Israel estimates the number was closer to 2,500. The rockets were fired quickly to try to overwhelm Iron Dome, and some were also launched from Lebanon by Hezbollah.Since October 7, more than 8,000 rockets have been fired at Israel, according to the Israeli Defense Forces.

Technical glitches and delays

In a much-anticipated return to social media , former President Donald Trump shared harrowing details of an assassination attempt and pledged the largest deportation in US history during a live interview with Elon Musk on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The conversation was marred by technical issues, frustrating many of Trump's supporters as the start was delayed by over 40 minutes.Trump recounted the near-fatal experience at a Pennsylvania rally, revealing how a bullet narrowly missed him.""If I had not turned my head, I would not be talking to you right now — as much as I like you,"" Trump told Musk. He attributed his survival to quick reflexes and divine intervention, emphasizing the severity of the situation by stating, ""For those people that don't believe in God, I think we all have to start thinking about that.""Musk responded by praising Trump’s bravery, saying, ""You can't fake bravery under such circumstances — the courage is instinctual or it is not.""

Trump suggested that his strong relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin could have prevented the conflict, saying, ""I got along with Putin very well, and he respected me.""Reiterating his hardline stance on immigration, Trump promised the largest deportation in U.S. history if re-elected.

The tremor, centered near Highland Park, shook buildings, rattled dishes, and set off car alarms, but no major injuries or damage have been reported.The quake hit at approximately 7.5 miles (12.1 kilometers) beneath the surface, with its epicenter about 6.5 miles (10.5 kilometers) northeast of LA's City Hall, according to the US Geological Survey ( USGS ).The temblor caused a pipe to burst at Pasadena's historic 1927 City Hall, resulting in water spilling from an upper floor. TV news helicopters captured the scene, showing the extent of the leak.In other areas, the quake interrupted an ESPN interview, and Disneyland in Anaheim felt the ground sway. Social media was abuzz with photos of shampoo bottles and other items strewn across the floor of a Target store in Los Angeles.Pasadena public information officer Lisa Derderian confirmed the water leak at City Hall was earthquake-related. About 200 employees safely evacuated, and one person was rescued from an elevator. There was no immediate assessment of the city's 1927 Central Library, which was closed for a seismic retrofit.Los Angeles firefighters, from all 106 stations, surveyed the city and reported no significant damage.

Donald Trump's interview with Elon Musk on X hit by DDoS attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-technical-glitches-disrupt-trump-musk-livestream-on-x/articleshow/112479944.cms,"The highly anticipated online conversation between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk encountered technical difficulties just as it was about to begin on X (formerly Twitter).The platform is reportedly facing a massive Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, causing significant disruptions during a highly anticipated live conversation between Republican Presidential contender and the tech tycoon.Elon Musk, who owns X, acknowledged the attack and provided an update on the situation. ""There appears to be a massive DDoS attack on X. Working on shutting it down,"" Musk posted. He also noted that if the situation could not be resolved quickly, the event would proceed with a smaller audience, with the full conversation being posted online later.Scheduled to take place on the social media platform X, the event had generated significant buzz due to the high-profile nature of both figures involved. However, as the livestream was set to start, users began reporting widespread issues with accessing the event, with many unable to connect or experiencing severe lag.Neither Trump nor Musk immediately commented on the issues, leaving their supporters and critics alike in suspense.The event had been promoted as an unscripted discussion with no limitations on topics, heightening the anticipation and the subsequent disappointment over the technical problems.Ahead of his anticipated conversation with Donald Trump, Elon Musk posted on X that the platform was conducting “some system scaling tests” to accommodate the expected high volume of participants. However, the tests failed to prevent issues, leaving many Trump supporters frustrated.“Not available????? I planned my whole day around this,” conservative commentator Glenn Beck wrote on X. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman also voiced his displeasure, saying, “Please let Elon know we can’t join.”The interview's potential to stir controversy drew a cautionary response from Europe. Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, warned Musk of the risk of “amplification of harmful content” from broadcasting the Trump interview. In a letter posted on X, Breton urged Musk to ensure that X complies with the EU’s Digital Services Act, which addresses misinformation and other issues.In response, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung criticized the EU’s involvement, declaring, “The EU is an enemy of free speech and has no authority of any kind to dictate how we campaign.”Musk, who endorsed Trump two days after the former president was injured in an attempted assassination at a Pennsylvania rally last month, has shifted politically in recent years. Previously identifying as a Democrat, Musk has become increasingly aligned with right-leaning viewpoints on X, using the platform to influence political discourse globally.Musk’s controversial actions include reinstating banned accounts such as those of Alex Jones and Trump. Trump’s account was reinstated in November 2022 after Musk purchased the platform, though Trump had not actively used it until Monday. The former president preferred his Truth Social site, which he launched during his Twitter ban.Hours before the interview, Trump posted a video on his X account featuring highlights from his presidency and a campaign message asserting, “They’re not coming after me, they’re coming after you, and I just happen to be standing in their way, and I will never be moving.”Trump’s X account boasts 88 million followers, significantly more than his Truth Social following of 7.5 million. Musk’s account, which will host the interview, has over 193 million followers.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to inquiries about cross-posting the interview on other platforms. Trump's recent X activity was limited to a photo of his mug shot from an Atlanta jail, related to charges involving attempts to overturn his election loss in Georgia.","The highly anticipated online conversation between Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk encountered technical difficulties just as it was about to begin on X (formerly Twitter) The platform is reportedly facing a massive Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, causing significant disruptions during the event.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112480355,imgsize-2029813,width-400,resizemode-4/112480355.jpg"

And I think that’s what a normal person does,” Vance told CNN in an interview that aired Sunday.“Tim Walz gave his wife a name, firm midwestern handshake and then tried to sort of awkwardly correct for it,” he added.Donald Trump Jr. shared a clip of the interaction and said: “Totally normal to greet your wife with a firm handshake and a bro hug/back slap. Tim Walz isn't weird at all, guys.”The Ohio Senator said Harris and Walz, her running mate, ""aren't comfortable in their own skin"" and are attempting to persuade the American public that it is the Republicans who are peculiar.Vance believes that the handshake demonstrates Walz's attempt to divert attention from his own awkwardness by persistently labeling him as strange. “I think what it is, is two people, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, who aren't comfortable in their own skin, because they're uncomfortable with their policy positions for the American people,” Vance told CNN host Dana Bash on “State of the Union”.“And so they're name-calling instead of actually telling the American people how they're going to make their lives better,' he said. 'I think that's weird, Dana. But look, they can call me whatever they want to,” he added.Vance said: They're trying to distract from their own policy failures.

The Ohio Senator dismissed the attacks, seemingly unfazed by the criticism leveled against him and the Republican ticket on Sunday.Despite their Midwestern origins, both Vance and Walz have emphasized their backgrounds and upbringings as evidence of their understanding of the concerns and values of middle America.When asked by Bash about Trump's response to the 'weird' attacks, the former president said: “Not me, they're talking about JD.”The GOP VP pick chuckled and said: “Certainly they've levied that charge at me more than anyone else. But I think that drives home how they're trying to distract from their own policy failures.”“This is fundamentally schoolyard stuff,” Vance added.","JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee fired back at Kamala Harris’s running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz over calling GOP ticket ‘weird’ The Ohio Senator said Harris and Walz, her running mate, ""aren't comfortable in their own skin"" and are attempting to persuade the American public that it is the Republicans who are peculiar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112476584,imgsize-45956,width-400,resizemode-4/112476584.jpg"
'Trying to kill him': GOP rep. Michael Waltz accuses Biden administration of ‘burying’ Iran’s threats against Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trying-to-kill-him-gop-rep-michael-waltz-accuses-biden-administration-of-burying-irans-threats-against-trump/articleshow/112475240.cms,"What documents have been leaked

‘Iran's motives for wanting Trump dead’

What US intelligence said

Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.) accused the Biden administration of “burying” Iran ’s threats against GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump in the wake of the recent hacking attack on the Trump campaign and argued that the administration is sending the wrong message to Tehran.“These plots from Iran are ongoing. And when Biden says nothing, Harris says nothing, the DOJ tries to bury it, what message does Iran get? They get that we can keep trying to take Trump out and have no consequences,” Waltz told Fox News’.“They tried to hack his campaign or did hack his campaign this week.They’re trying to kill him. And we know from the intelligence community Iran doesn’t want Trump back,” he added.On Saturday, Trump's campaign confirmed that some of its internal communications had been hacked. This acknowledgment came after Politico began receiving emails from an anonymous source containing documents purportedly from inside Trump’s campaign operation. The Trump campaign attributed the breach to “foreign sources hostile to the United States,” referencing a recent Microsoft report.Earlier, on Friday, Microsoft disclosed that Iranian hackers had “sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign.” While Microsoft did not identify the specific campaign targeted and declined to comment further, the Trump campaign drew a connection between this incident and their own breach.Several news organisations, such as Politico and the Washington Post, claimed to have obtained Trump campaign materials that seemingly originated from the hack, The New York post reported.As per Politico, they received certain documents from “Robert” using an AOL email account. The documents consist of what appeared to be internal communications from a senior Trump campaign official. The report cited two people familiar with documents as saying that they are authentic. Additionally, Politico received a set of materials pertaining to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who was rumored to be a top contender in the vice presidential selection process.Among the information provided to these outlets was a comprehensive 271-page document about JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee. The document appeared to be a compilation of publicly available information, intended to vet Vance and assess his potential vulnerabilities. The dossier was prepared by Brand Woodward, a law firm that provides services to several Trump advisers.Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign said: “These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process.”Cheung further linked the timing of the breach with a Microsoft report that noted Iranian hackers had compromised an account of a “high-ranking official” on a US presidential campaign in June 2024, coinciding with the close timing of Trump’s selection of a vice-presidential nominee. However, Cheung did not disclose whether the campaign had been in contact with Microsoft or law enforcement about the breach, stating the campaign would not discuss such conversations.According to Waltz, who holds positions on the House Intelligence, Armed Services, and Foreign Affairs Committees and is rumored to be a potential candidate for a significant foreign policy role should Trump secure victory in the 2024 election, “You have multiple assassination plots from the Iranians. This Pakistani national was recruiting females as spotters. He had recruited hit men and had made a down payment. He was even recruiting protesters as a distraction.”“Yet, the Department of Justice, when they unveiled the indictment, didn’t even name Trump as the target. They tried to soft-pedal it and just say, oh, it was a politician. So this wasn’t an isolated incident in Butler, Pa,” he added.It is a widely held belief that Iran seeks retribution against Trump for his role in ordering the killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in 2020. The Trump administration claimed that Soleimani was “developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,” The New York post reported.US officials have long maintained that Soleimani played a role in distributing improvised explosive devices responsible for the deaths and severe injuries of thousands of US soldiers during the Second Iraq War.Moreover, the strike occurred amidst a series of provocative actions taken by Iran in the region, some of which Trump did not retaliate against.Waltz argued that Iran's motives for wanting Trump dead are clear. “He held them accountable. And you overlay that with, how has Biden and Harris treated Iran? Well, Iran knows that they’re sympathizers,” he said.According to US intelligence officials , Iran has directed its propaganda efforts towards Trump. In 2021, a declassified assessment by the director of National Intelligence revealed that Iran targeted Trump during the 2020 election cycle, The New York post reported.The document stated: “We assess that Iran carried out a multi-pronged covert influence campaign intended to undercut former President Trump’s reelection prospects—though without directly promoting his rival,” adding that “We assess that Supreme Leader Khamenei authorized the campaign.”Tehran has officially denied the accusations of interfering in US elections.","On Saturday, Trump's campaign confirmed that some of its internal communications had been hacked. This acknowledgment came after Politico began receiving emails from an anonymous source containing documents purportedly from inside Trump’s campaign operation. The Trump campaign attributed the breach to “foreign sources hostile to the United States,” referencing a recent Microsoft report. It is a widely held belief that Iran seeks retribution against Trump for his role in ordering the killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112475922,imgsize-43074,width-400,resizemode-4/112475922.jpg"

Hameed has also been accused of multiple violations of the Pakistan Army Act after retirement.“Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City (housing society) case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” the military said in a statement.The management of Top City had accused the former ISI chief of orchestrating a raid on its offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan. As per the petition, filed in May 2017, Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials had taken away valuables, including gold and diamond ornaments and money, in connection with a purported terrorism case.Consequently, according to ISPR, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Hameed under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act.“In addition, multiple instances of violation of Pakistan Army Act post-retirement have also been established,” the statement said.Hameed came into the global spotlight when he was filmed drinking tea in the lobby of a Kabul hotel shortly after the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, forcing the former ruler, Ashraf Ghani, to flee.His transfer out of his ISI post had become a bone of contention between the former PM and the then army chief, Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, which ultimately ended in Imran’s ouster from office in April 2022. Hameed had sought early retirement from the army in Nov 2022.Hameed was among the six senior-most army generals who were nominated by General HQ as a potential candidate for the two top military offices, chief of army staff (COAS) and chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC).

How case unfolded

Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal and the process for his court martial was initiated, the army said on Monday.It is for the first time in the country's history that court martial has been initiated against a former intelligence chief, according to Dawn .“Complying with the orders of Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry, was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” a press statement by Pakistan army said further adding that ""the process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody.”“Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), under provisions of Pakistan Army Act,” the release further said.Hameed was regarded as close aide to Imran Khan, who appointed him to lead the ISI during his tenure as prime minister. Khan was removed from office in 2022 through a vote of no-confidence, which he claims was orchestrated by the military, though the military denies this allegation.In 2022, Hameed was one of the six senior-most generals whose names were forwarded by general headquarters to Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif for consideration for the two top military positions. He, however, chose to seek early retirement and submitted his resignation to the high command, as per sources.The Supreme Court, in its order dated November 14 last year, had said that the allegations against Hameed were of ""extremely serious nature"" and ""would undermine the reputation of the federal government, the armed forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.”This came after the management of Top City, a private housing scheme, made allegations against the former spy-master, accusing him of orchestrating a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.The petition was filed on May 12, 2017, and it said that Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials conducted a raid on Top City's office and Moeez’s residence, seizing valuables such as gold and diamond jewelry and money in connection with an alleged terrorism case, Dawn reported.It also alleged the involvement of former ISI officials Irtaza Haroon, Sardar Najaf, Wasim Tabish, Zahid Mehmood Malik, and Mohammad Munir ""in the illegal takeover of the housing society”.In March, a court placed retired naib tehsildar Najaf Hameed, Hameed's brother, under a 14-day judicial remand.Najaf and other co-accused had sought pre-arrest bail in an FIR filed with the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) in Rawalpindi.The FIR alleged that former minister for mineral resources Hafiz Ammar Yasir had acquired properties worth billions of rupees through intermediaries.In April, the military had reportedly established an inquiry committee to investigate allegations of authority misuse involving the former ISI head.","Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal.

Polio is transmitted through contaminated water or food, or contact with an infected person. Treatment includes bed rest, pain relievers, rehabilitation and portable ventilators.Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO 's regional director of polio eradication was cited by Al-Jazeera as saying that the challenge exists in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. ""This is where there's a lot of militancy, insecurity and community hostility and frustration towards the government because of conflict and a lack of services,"" Jafari said.Over 50 districts across Pakistan are detecting the virus, he said.Compounding to the challenges is the fact, says the WHO official that not only is the polio programme being targeted but also security personnel that are guarding the teams ""because they become soft targets when they are in the community.""At least 102 polio field workers, officials and security personnel have been killed, including at least six in campaigns carried out this year, the Al Jazeera report cited.Meanwhile, the latest victim is an 11-month-old infant from Qila, in Balochistan who has succumbed to paralysis caused by the wild poliovirus.The child from Qila who displayed symptoms of paralysis on July 17, is among the five cases detected in the district. Other cases in Balochistan have been reported in Chaman, Quetta, Zhob, Dera Bugti, and Jhal Magsi as per a report in the Balochistan Post.In Balochistan, the situation is compounded by a recent history of inadequate vaccination coverage and persistent misconceptions about the vaccine.

Asif Raza Merchant was charged in a complaint unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn with murder-for-hire as part of a scheme to assassinate a politician or US government officials on its soil. Law enforcement said they foiled the charged plot before any attack could be carried out. Merchant, who has stated that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan, is in federal custody in New York. US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said that working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of US government officials on American soil. According to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. FBI director Christopher Wray said the ""dangerous murder-for-hire"" plot allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook. In April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source. In early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a ""finger gun"" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant stated that the intended victims would be ""targeted here"", meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official. Merchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.

The plot by Asif Merchant

A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant , has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil. Prosecutors in Brooklyn announced criminal charges against Asif Merchant, accusing him of travelling to New York for the purposes of trying to hire a hitman for the assassinations. The plot was disrupted before it could be carried out.The document did not name any potential target but CNN reported that former president Donald Trump and other current and former US government officials might be the targets of the plot.Trump was shot at by Thomas Crooks at a Pennsylvania rally last month in which the shooter was killed. This attempt was unrelated to the life threat that Trump had from Iran. US officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump.Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement: ""The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.""Merchant said, as revealed by the document, that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified ""party"" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to ""finalize"" the plan and leave the United States.In mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a ""political person"".Merchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.On June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance. Merchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12 when law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country.(With agency inputs)","A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil.

It is evident that the state is unwilling to ease the tensions between the Baloch masses and those in power,"" the BYC said in a post on X.It further highlighted that it has been a week since the roads have been blocked and people are suffering from food shortages and a complete communication blockade.""This is a form of collective punishment against an entire nation for the crime of practising the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. This repressive behaviour by the state indicates that they will never tolerate protests for merely human rights,"" it added.This development comes as the protest by the Baloch community against the Pakistani authorities entered its eighth day in Gwadar , with thousands of peaceful protestors persisting until justice is achieved.""For the past ten days, the state of Pakistan has imposed a curfew in Gwadar and throughout Makuran by shutting down the internet and mobile networks. All roads, highways, shops, and markets have been forcibly closed, resulting in a severe shortage of food and medicine,"" the BYC said in a subsequent post.They further stressed that the water supply in Gwadar has been cut off. ""This brutality and oppression by the state of Pakistan will lead to a severe humanitarian crisis in Balochistan"".""We deeply regret that thousands of lives are at risk in Balochistan due to this situation, yet the world remains silent, witnessing this destruction. Your silence could lead to the loss of millions of lives.

"Pakistan plans to regulate VPN, Opposition-civil society cry foul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-plans-to-regulate-vpn-opposition-civil-society-cry-foul/articleshow/112257788.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others, according to PTA Chairman Maj General (retd) Hafeezur Rehman, Samaa TV reported.During the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat meeting, Rehman said that once the policy is in place, only whitelisted VPNs will be operational in Pakistan, while all others will be blocked.In 2024, the use of VPNs among local internet users surged significantly, primarily to access X, which has been banned in the country since February 19, according to the Samaa TV report. Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy. For a nation largely comprising very young people, this would be an unmitigated disaster as it could have repercussions that may spill over generations. Already struggling to compete, the Pakistpeople will end up being deprived of even more chances to realise their potential and contribute positively on a global scale,"" the editorial said.According to the website DataReportal, there were 71.70 million active social media user identities in Pakistan in January 2024. YouTube is Pakistan's most-used social media platform in 2024 with a potential ad audience of 71.70 million. Data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 54.38 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Pakistan at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 38.9 per cent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.Meanwhile, according to Samaa TV, the Pakistan government has made previous attempts to regulate VPN usage by requiring registration, but these efforts have not resulted in significant action. In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions. The PTA also passed VPN regulations in 2010, but enforcement has been inconsistent.","Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others.
