Hannah Gutierrez-Reed , the armorer involved in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western film ""Rust,"" pleaded guilty on Monday to a charge of carrying a firearm into a licensed liquor establishment. This plea comes as part of an agreement that will see her serve 18 months of supervised probation.Judge T. Glenn Ellington approved the plea deal, allowing Gutierrez-Reed to start her probation while serving an 18-month prison term for involuntary manslaughter related to Hutchins' death.During the tragic incident, actor Alec Baldwin discharged a revolver while rehearsing a scene, resulting in Hutchins' death and injury to director Joel Souza.Prosecutors have pointed to Gutierrez-Reed's negligence in bringing live ammunition onto the film set and failing to adhere to essential gun safety protocols. She appeared in court on Monday wearing a beige jumpsuit and was handcuffed as she changed her plea to guilty, expressing her gratitude to the court: ""I’d just like to apologise to the court and thank you for your judgement today.""The charge stems from an incident weeks before filming began in October 2021, when Gutierrez-Reed brought a handgun into a bar in Santa Fe, where firearms are prohibited. A video obtained during the investigation showed her explaining how she managed to sneak the weapon into the venue.Gutierrez-Reed was convicted in March of involuntary manslaughter and has since appealed that decision. Baldwin faced similar charges but had them dismissed during a trial due to issues regarding evidence disclosure.As part of her plea agreement, Gutierrez-Reed must avoid firearms, alcohol, and drugs during her probation, pay £180 in fees, and submit DNA to a criminal database. Her attorney indicated that she could be released by June 2025 to complete probation in Arizona, avoiding a further felony conviction.Before leaving the courtroom, Gutierrez-Reed blew kisses to her mother, Stacy Reed, who expressed her support, stating, “She’s not gotten a fair shake from the beginning.”","Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was involved in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western film ""Rust"" She pleaded guilty on Monday to a charge of carrying a firearm into a licensed liquor establishment.

Hurricane Milton , a massive Category 5 storm , is rapidly approaching Florida’s Gulf Coast, threatening to hit the Tampa Bay region, which has not faced a major direct hurricane impact in over a century. The storm comes just two weeks after Hurricane Helene ravaged the same area, leaving significant destruction and debris behind. As Milton's landfall nears, authorities are racing to clear the remaining debris from Helene to prevent it from becoming airborne missiles, while evacuation orders have been issued in several regions.The storm has already intensified with winds reaching 180 mph and poses a serious risk of storm surges, flooding, and wind damage across Florida's west coast.Many residents, still recovering from Helene, are preparing for what could be one of the most severe storms to hit the area in decades. Meanwhile, the federal and state governments are mobilizing resources to manage the storm's impact, with tensions rising as political leaders clash over storm preparedness and response efforts.Hurricane Milton is a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph. The storm is moving toward Florida and is expected to make landfall in the Tampa Bay region on Wednesday. As it approaches, it could weaken slightly but will likely retain hurricane strength as it moves across central Florida and exits into the Atlantic Ocean.Milton is considered potentially catastrophic, especially since it comes on the heels of Hurricane Helene, which struck Florida just two weeks ago. Milton intensified quickly, gaining 92 mph in 24 hours, which is one of the fastest rates recorded. The National Hurricane Center reports that Milton's pressure is near record low, signaling its strength. Meteorologists have compared its rapid intensification to storms like Hurricane Wilma (2005) and Hurricane Felix (2007).The Tampa Bay area is at high risk, with forecasts predicting storm surges between 8 to 12 feet, the highest ever predicted for the region. In addition, widespread flooding is expected, with rainfall estimates between 5 to 10 inches across Florida and up to 15 inches in some areas. Other affected regions include Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and Florida’s mainland and Keys.Florida’s government has mobilized efforts to remove debris left by Hurricane Helene to prevent it from becoming dangerous projectiles during Milton. Hillsborough County has issued evacuation orders for areas near Tampa Bay, mobile homes, and vulnerable regions. Federal assistance, including 7,000 workers, has been dispatched, and President Biden has declared a state of emergency for Florida.Residents in affected areas are rushing to evacuate or prepare for the storm. Many have expressed concerns about debris from Hurricane Helene turning into dangerous projectiles. Sarah Steslicki from Belleair Beach criticized the slow removal of debris, stating, “They’ve screwed around and haven’t picked the debris up, and now they’re scrambling to get it picked up.” Others, like Candice Briggs from Seminole, are emotionally drained from evacuating just two weeks after Helene, saying, “Most of the tears I’ve cried have been out of exhaustion or gratitude.”Hurricane Helene, which killed at least 230 people, has highlighted the growing intensity of storms, particularly due to climate change. FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell warned that “these storms are bringing more water than they ever have” and emphasized that while wind remains a risk, flooding is the primary cause of fatalities. Researchers believe warmer oceans are fueling the rapid intensification of these storms.Hurricane Milton has sparked political tensions, with Vice President Kamala Harris criticizing Governor Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump for what she called “political gamesmanship” in the wake of Hurricane Helene. She accused DeSantis of ignoring federal support offers and Trump of spreading misinformation about disaster funds. DeSantis, meanwhile, has been coordinating directly with President Biden to manage the storm response.Several Florida counties are converting schools into shelters, and airports in Tampa, St Petersburg, and Orlando have announced closures. Fuel shortages have been reported, with gas stations in Fort Myers and Tampa running out of fuel as people evacuate.(With inputs from agencies)","Hurricane Milton is a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph.

He emphasized that the potential for disclosure is causing anxiety among prominent individuals in Harris's camp.When asked about Reid Hoffman, who served as the VP of PayPal alongside Musk, the Tesla CEO claimed that Hoffman is terrified of a Trump victory and the potential disclosures that would follow.""He's terrified of a Trump victory because Of the disclosure that Would follow, I think. Yeah. I mean, I think he's certainly ideologically not aligned with Trump anyway, but I think he is concerned about the Epstein situation,"" said Elon.The Epstein list refers to speculation regarding individuals connected to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of sex trafficking. While numerous names have surfaced in court documents, there has been no official compilation identifying Epstein's clients.Trump has also addressed the Epstein situation during a September podcast with Lex Fridman. When asked about the rumored client list associated with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump said he would be inclined to examine it and expressed no objections to its release if the opportunity arose.Musk has recently ramped up his support for Trump, appearing at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. This marks Musk's first public endorsement since Trump's attempted assassination in July. A source indicated that Musk's appearances are linked to his America PAC, aimed at boosting Trump's campaign ahead of the November 5 election, where Pennsylvania is seen as a pivotal state.","Elon Musk suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris's support by billionaires is linked to concerns over the potential release of a so-called "" Epstein client list.""

Former US President Donald Trump stirred debate on Monday by suggesting that undocumented immigrants who commit murder possess “bad genes,” during an interview on “The Hugh Hewitt Show .”In the interview, Trump distorted immigration and crime statistics to criticise Vice President Kamala Harris , falsely claiming that “13,000 of which were murderers” were crossing through an “open border.” He said, “You know, now, a murderer, I believe this – it’s in their genes.And we got bad, a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for further comment. This rhetoric aligns with Trump's ongoing campaign strategy, which has made reducing illegal immigration a central focus. His language regarding undocumented immigrants has drawn criticism from civil rights groups , particularly after he claimed last autumn that they were “poisoning the blood of our country.”Additionally, Trump has previously invoked genetics at campaign rallies, stating in 2020, “You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe? The racehorse theory .” This comment references the notion that selective breeding in horses produces superior bloodlines, a concept that has drawn parallels to discussions on race and genetics.","Former US President Donald Trump suggested that undocumented immigrants who commit murder possess ""bad genes"" Trump distorted immigration and crime statistics to criticise Vice President Kamala Harris.

However, Jaishankar's upcoming visit is looked at as a significant move by New Delhi, given the strained bilateral relations between the two countries.Tensions escalated after India carried out airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Balakot in February 2019, following the Pulwama terror attack. Relations worsened further after India revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and reorganised the state into two union territories in August 2019, leading Pakistan to downgrade diplomatic ties.India has consistently stated its desire for normal relations with Pakistan, which New Delhi has said will depend on Islamabad creating an environment free of terrorism and hostility.In May 2023, Pakistan's then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India for an SCO foreign ministers' meeting in Goa, marking the first such visit by a Pakistani foreign minister in nearly 12 years.Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, however, confirmed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will chair the upcoming Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting of the SCO.""We expect high-level participation from SCO members; the observer state of Mongolia; Turkmenistan as a special guest; and representatives of the international organisations, including Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and European Economic Community (EEC),"" she said.The spokesperson stated that the CHG meeting will focus on discussions regarding cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, environment, and socio-cultural connections, while also reviewing the SCO's overall performance.","Pakistan has ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit.

Over a 100 PTI members were arrested from Islamabad and more than 600 workers were detained in Lahore, where also Imran’s supporters were staging a protest on his call.

Supporters of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan reached Islamabad's iconic D-Chowk late on Saturday, despite the government's efforts to deter them by deploying a heavy police force and cutting off internet services in the capital. The police's use of tear gas to stop protesters was largely ineffective as heavy rain in the capital weakened its impact, Dawn reported.Meanwhile, the Islamabad high court ordered the Pakistan government to prevent any illegal protests in the capital during the SCO summit.However, the court instructed government to assign a specific location for supporters of jailed former PM to hold demonstrations.Islamabad was placed under a strict lockdown on Saturday as authorities sought to prevent the demonstration, which comes in support of the imprisoned cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan. His supporters have been consistently staging protests over the past month, demanding his release.The rallies also target the ruling coalition government, which Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ), claims is illegitimate, alleging that it came to power following a fraudulent election.Pakistan army troops were deployed in Islamabad to ensure security as Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters moved forward with plans for a protest.Meanwhile, Pakistan's interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said that more than 80 police personnel have been injured so far in clashes with supporters of Imran Khan taking part in a march near Islamabad.Khan, who was barred from participating in the February elections due to numerous legal cases against him, has been sidelined from the political arena. However, Imran Khan's PTI has continued to challenge the government by organising regular demonstrations and protests despite facing a crackdown.Earlier in the day, the PTI claimed that Pakistani Rangers “forcefully entered” KP House in Islamabad to arrest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur after he arrived in the capital to take part in the protest.PTI workers set out from Khan's stronghold in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Friday, intending to reach the capital Islamabad. However, they were met with roadblocks made of shipping containers and rounds of tear gas fired by security forces.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi warned Khan's party on Friday to cancel the planned protest, saying that there would be ""no leniency"" if the ban on protests is defied. He accused armed supporters of Khan of marching on Islamabad with the intention of launching an assault on the capital. “They should think about what they are going to do with Pakistan by marching on Islamabad with weapons,” he said.“I am very clear that they are going to launch an assault on Islamabad,” Naqvi said. He urged Imran Khan's party to postpone their rally to avoid disrupting the capital city's preparations for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting on October 15 and 16.On Saturday, small groups of protesters persisted in their efforts to enter the capital, defying the government's decision to deploy troops on the streets. The government justified the deployment as a necessary measure to ensure security ahead of the upcoming SCO.""I am so proud of all our people,"" Khan said in a message posted on the social media platform X on Saturday afternoon. ""You showed unfaltering resilience and courage as you came out yesterday and overcame unbelievable obstacles to keep marching forward towards D Chowk.""Lahore's D-Chowk or Democracy Chowk is known in Pakistan as the place where various protests routinely take place. In the past, Imran Khan had a 126-day sit-in protest here in 2014.Imran Khan urged citizens to continue their journey to D Chowk and join the convoy led by Ali Amin. ""I am calling on everyone to keep heading to D Chowk and join Ali Amin's convoy. I especially want to commend our people from KP, North Punjab, and Islamabad. You have defeated insurmountable obstacles, including shelling, chemicals fired from helicopters, trenches & nails on the motorway, with your determination and commitment,"" Imran Khan said.The former Prime Minister also called upon the people of Punjab to gather at Minar-i-Pakistan in Lahore. ""I am also asking our people from Punjab to move towards Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore. If they cannot make it there, they must join the protests in their cities,"" he said.Protests were also planned in Lahore on Saturday, but access to the city was restricted as the main road connecting it to the capital was blocked.

Six soldiers and as many terrorists were killed in a gunfight in Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to a statement from the Pakistan military on Saturday.Inter-Services Public Relations ( ISPR ), the military's media wing, said that the exchange of fire occurred during the night between October 4-5 in the Spinwam area of North Waziristan district, which shares a border with Afghanistan.Lieutenant colonel Muhammad Ali Shoukat, aged 43, who was leading the operation against the terrorists, lost his life along with five other soldiers during the ""intense fire exchange"", the Pakistan military said.The banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed responsibility for the attack. The TTP, established in 2007 as an umbrella organization for several militant groups, has been officially declared as 'Fitna al-Khawarij' by the Pakistani government. The interior ministry's notification emphasizes the use of the term 'khariji' (outlawed) when referring to such terrorists.Pakistan has repeatedly accused the TTP of operating from sanctuaries in Afghanistan, a claim that the Afghan Taliban denies. Since the Taliban's takeover of the government in Kabul in 2021, there has been a rise in terrorist incidents in Pakistan, shattering hopes in Islamabad that a friendly government in Afghanistan would help combat militancy.The relationship between the two countries has recently become strained, primarily due to the TTP and frequent border skirmishes.",Six soldiers and as many terrorists were killed in a gunfight in Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Reality via research

Same old story

all

Remember that movie,? It opens with a manager of a ritzy London hotel acting snooty to a Singaporean mom and her kids. Why don’t you try Chinatown, the manager tells them, in a fine example of British racist prejudice. Mighty cheesed off, mom calls her husband, who solves the problem – by buying the hotel his family was trying to check into.That scene tells you everything about Singapore’s wealth.It reinforced a certain image of the city-state. Singapore – everything’s shiny, everyone’s happy. This is a country where a popular slogan was built around the idea of material possessions. Called “5Cs”, it defined Singaporeans’ aspirations – cash, country club membership, car, credit card and condo. Plenty of people in other countries want/have these things, too. Only Singapore coined a slogan around this.Plus…This is by no means an exhaustive list of what makes Singapore tick.But…Singapore is not all shiny, happy.A well-heeled visitor driving down a beautiful road from Changi airport to a world class hotel, thence to dine at a world class restaurant (Singapore hosts five of the world’s top 100 restaurants) won’t probably see this, or even know about it – there’s poverty , some of it deep, in Singapore. And it’s a problem likely to sharpen because the city-state, like many rich countries, is ageing.Most countries define a poverty line, a level of income/expenditure that differentiates the poor from the non-poor. There's a good reason for this. A poverty line allows policymakers to better target those who need the most help. India has a poverty line, so does America, and so do most countries. Singapore doesn’t.Why? Singapore govt’s approach, as Arabella Woo wrote in a London School of Economics research paper (“Inequality in Singapore: The Hidden Poor”) is “to reward citizens in alignment with the work that is done”. As for economically vulnerable citizens, govt wants “citizens…to protect themselves…to do it themselves”.If that’s your take on poverty, obviously there’ll be no official poverty line. Naturally, there’s no official count of poor people either.With govt not defining poverty, researchers have had to work with other data. A superbly researched paper (“A handbook on inequality, poverty and unmet social needs in Singapore”), by Catherine J Smith, John A Donaldson, Sanushka Mudaliar, Mumtaz Md Kadir & Lam Keong Yeoh, quotes a separate study by one of the authors, who had used expenditure survey data. Per that study, “there are 110,000 to 140,000 households in Singapore who fit the definition of absolute poverty…these include the working poor, unemployed poor and poor retiree households”.Absolute poverty is defined as an economic situation where a person or a household doesn’t earn enough to cover basic needs.In a small country (population just over 6 million), 140,000 households, that is, around 560,000 people (reasonably assuming 4 people per household), is not a vanishingly small number. You wouldn’t think, visiting Singapore, there are more than 5.5 lakh people living in absolute poverty.Economists also use a concept called relative poverty – a measure that captures living standard relative to that enjoyed by those earning median wage (a median is defined as the middle value of a sequence of numbers, arranged in ascending or descending order).By this measure, per the handbook quoted above, 25% to 30% of Singaporeans live in relative poverty. The same research points out that many Singaporean middle-class families have faced “stagnating wages and an increased cost of living”. This double whammy hits middle-classes, and the poor, who are hit harder, in many countries, including India. But it’s also true for that island of gleaming high-rises.In a report on poverty and inequality in Singapore, BBC said this: “The city-state, which has some of the highest-paid ministers in the world, is a place of sometimes extreme contrasts, with glittering condominiums and towering facades just a stone's throw from one-room rental apartments inhabited by elderly and blue-collar families.”The same BBC report also quoted two local studies that concluded that in multiracial Singapore, it’s not race but class that’s become the deepest social faultline.Poverty, absolute or relative, and sharp income inequality in Singapore can be traced to pretty much the same set of reasons that’s produced similar outcomes in other countries. Policy attention on maintaining high GDP growth, low corporate taxes to attract investment, an emphasis on meritocracy, and the transition from old economy to knowledge economy. Implemented well, as Singapore govt has, this set of policies can produce shining economic performance – but it can also produce an underclass that gets caught in a deprivation trap. And the problem gets worse, as is the case in Singapore, when a society starts ageing. Elderly poor face the worst kind of poverty.None of this invalidates Singapore’s success story. But all of it tells us about a Singapore that most people don’t know exists.To saySingaporeans are crazy, rich is crazy, and full of rich irony.","At $141,500, its per capita income in PPP terms (a fairer measure than nominal dollar figures) ranks second after Luxembourg globally.

Tourism Crunch

The president of the Maldives swept into power a year ago on a campaign to push India out of the island nation’s affairs and draw closer to China. Now, as a debt crisis looms and earlier Chinese loans come due, he is in New Delhi looking to mend some fences.Mohamed Muizzu arrived in New Delhi on Sunday on his first state visit, with the country’s financial crisis likely to be a key feature of discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.Prior to his visit, Muizzu has softened his rhetoric notably, saying he’s never opposed India and New Delhi knows the financial strain his nation is under and was willing to help.That’s a contrast to a year ago when he took office, pushing for the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Maldives and promising new big-ticket projects backed by China. His campaign thrust the Maldives to the center of the rivalry between the two powers, which have been vying for influence over the Indian Ocean nation known for pristine beaches and its strategic location straddling global shipping routes.Both countries — and others — have poured hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans into the Maldives in recent years, saddling the tourism-dependent nation amid a protracted economic slowdown, a drought of foreign reserves and a slow return of visitors.The country’s debt is estimated at 110% of gross domestic product, and risks are growing it may fail to make payments on its sukuk. If that were to happen, it would be the world’s first default of an Islamic bond.India gave the Maldives a $50 million lifeline last month to help it avoid that outcome, but that was likely only a short-term fix given additional looming payments, according to investors and analysts.Fitch Ratings estimates the country’s total external debt obligations will grow to $557 million in 2025, and exceed $1 billion by 2026. The island nation’s foreign reserves stood at just $437 million as of the end of August, sufficient to cover only around one-and-a-half months of imports.A default event was looking more likely, according to Fitch, while the International Monetary Fund has also warned of a potential debt crisis.“This is a growing concern and the debts are piling up,” said Aditya Gowdara Shivamurthy, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. “They’ve been able to repay until now. What will happen next is something we will have to see.”Muizzu met with India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday and is due to meet with Modi on Monday.China and India are the No. 1 and 2 external lenders for Maldivian central government debt, respectively. The Maldives owed about $400 million to the Export-Import Bank of India and about $530 million to the Export-Import Bank of China at the end of last year, according to official figures.The Maldives Monetary Authority has said officials are working on a $400 million foreign-currency swap with India’s central bank, which could provide a key source of funds for future debt payments. China meanwhile has said it’s held discussions with Male over debt relief.“President Muizzu has tried to steer the Maldives away from its traditional reliance on India to a more independent foreign policy, including friendlier relations with China,” said Søren Mørch, head of emerging markets debt at Danske Bank AS. “This recent bailout from India has shown the limits of this approach.”The debt crunch comes as the Maldivian economy has failed to maintain momentum in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. While GDP growth reached 13.9% in 2022, it slowed to 4% last year, with tourists spending at rates below pre-pandemic levels, according to the World Bank.Relations between the Maldives and India took a dive in January after a social-media spat in which a Maldivian deputy minister mocked Modi, prompting a backlash from Indian citizens and several celebrities calling for a tourism boycott of the island.In an interview with the BBC, Muizzu said the Maldives is not facing a sovereign debt default, nor would it join an IMF funding program. Still, India’s backing in any potential debt restructuring is likely to prove invaluable, making a fence-mending with New Delhi all the more important, said Gulbin Sultana, associate fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, a government-backed think tank in New Delhi.“Muizzu is re-balancing ties with India, as is New Delhi trying to reset its ties with the island nation,” she said.",Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu is in New Delhi on his first state visit.

Improving ties



NEW DELHI: Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.As per media reports in the Maldives , Muizzu, his wife Sajidha Mohamed, and a high-level delegation of Maldivian government officials traveled on a special flight arranged by the Indian government, a gesture reserved for such visits by Maldivian presidents.Muizzu will receive an official welcome on Monday.During his visit from October 6-10, Muizzu will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi , external affairs minister S Jaishankar and other top ministers to discuss various bilateral, regional, and international issues.The president's upcoming discussions are expected to lead to several agreements that could enhance bilateral cooperation.Muizzu has been criticised for pivoting his island nation sharply towards China, and eyebrows were raised in New Delhi after he decided to break tradition by not making India his first foreign visit after taking office in November last year. Instead, he initially visited Turkey and China - a significant diplomatic shift, particularly given that his administration has been perceived as pro-China and has previously campaigned on an ""India Out"" platform.This change in approach had raised concerns about the future of India-Maldives relations, which had become strained following Muizzu's election.However, ties between the two countries have been warming up with Muizzu publicly acknowledging India's importance, referring to it as ""one of the closest allies and invaluable partners"" of the Maldives. The Maldivian president's acknowledgment of India's role in providing aid during times of need also indicates a willingness to move past contentious rhetoric towards constructive engagement.This shift could pave the way for a more balanced approach that respects Maldivian sovereignty while recognising India's strategic interests in the region.Geopolitically, the Maldives is crucial for India's 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) initiative and its 'Neighbourhood First Policy'. The Maldives serves as a key maritime neighbor in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), making it strategically significant for India's national security interests.The president met EAM Jaishankar on Sunday evening shortly after landing in New Delhi.""Pleased to call on President Muizzu today at the start of his State Visit to India. Appreciate his commitment to enhance 🇮🇳 🇲🇻 relationship. Confident that his talks with PM Modi on Monday will give a new impetus to our friendly ties,"" the external affairs minister posted on X.Official talks and signing of agreements with Indian leadership are scheduled for Monday.President Muizzu will also meet with the Maldivian community living in India, on Sunday.He will also engage in business events in Mumbai and Bengaluru, highlighting the importance of economic ties between the two nations.The delegation accompanying president Muizzu includes foreign minister Dr Abdullah Khaleel, defense minister Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon, minister of homeland security and technology Ali Ihusaan, finance minister Moosa Zameer, health minister Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim, and economic development minister Mohamed Saeed.Other key officials joining the visit are attorney general Ahmed Usham, tourism minister Ibrahim Faisal, transport & civil aviation minister Mohamed Ameen, construction & infrastructure minister Dr Abdulla Muththalib, and chief of staff at the President's Office Abdulla Fayaz, alongside several senior officials.Muizzu last visited India in June to attend the swearing in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During the visit, the two leaders met and discussed strengthening bilateral relations between Maldives and India.The two leaders also met on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai in December last year.Relations between the two countries had deteriorated after two Maldivian deputy ministers made defamatory comments about PM Modi and India on social media, amid ongoing discussions about the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the Maldives.The two officials, Malsha Shareef and Mariyam Shiuna were suspended from their roles in the Ministry of Youth and later resigned on September 10 this year.Withdrawal of Indian military personnel was a key pledge of President Muizzu, and the transition was carried out peacefully, with civilians replacing Indian troops as per the agreement between the two governments.Muizzu's administration has since appeared committed to mending relations with India.","Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.
