Ecuador stops waiving visas for Chinese nationals over rise in irregular migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ecuador-stops-waiving-visas-for-chinese-nationals-over-rise-in-irregular-migration/articleshow/111094634.cms,"Ecuador 's foreign ministry on Tuesday said that it was effectively reinstating a visa requirement for travellers from China, citing an increase in irregular migratory flows from the Asian nation.

The ministry, in a statement posted on social media, said that it was suspending an agreement with China which had waived the requirement for travelers to obtain a visa. It added that many Chinese travellers had overstayed the permitted 90-day period, with some potentially using Ecuador as a stepping stone to reach other destinations in the region. The ministry also said that in recent months, nearly half of visitors from the country did not exit through regular routes on time.

Asked about Ecuador's visa waiver suspension, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Tuesday that China firmly opposes all forms of human smuggling . ""The agreement on mutual visa exemption between China and Ecuador... has played an important and positive role in promoting cross-border travel and practical cooperation in various fields between the two nations.""

Since 2022, Ecuador has seen an increase in the number of Chinese citizens entering its territory without registering their departure. Between 2023 and 2024, 66,189 Chinese travellers entered the country, while just 34,209 were recorded as leaving, meaning some 32,000 have not been registered as leaving Ecuador, the foreign ministry said. Many of the Chinese citizens arriving in Ecuador head toward the US, mainly through the so-called Darien Gap , the ministry added.

Prez Biden has delayed delivering certain heavy bombs to Israel since May over concerns about the killing of civilians in Gaza. However, the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening Rafah invasion, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.Netanyahu, in a short video, spoke directly to the camera in English as he lobbed sharp criticisms at Biden over ""bottlenecks"" in arms transfers. ""It's inconceivable that in the past few months, the administration has been withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel,"" Netanyahu said, adding, ""Give us the tools and we'll finish the job a lot faster.""Netanyahu didn't elaborate on what weapons were being held back, and the Israeli military declined to respond to a request for comment. Ophir Falk, a foreign policy adviser to Netanyahu, deferred questions on details to the US govt.Netanyahu also claimed that US secretary of state Antony Blinken , in a recent visit to Israel, said he was working around the clock to end the delays. However, Blinken said the only pause in sending weapons to Israel was related to those heavy bombs from May, speaking during a presser Tuesday. ""We, as you know, are continuing to review one shipment that Prez Biden has talked about with regard to 2,000-pound bombs because of our concerns about their use in a densely populated area like Rafah,"" he said.

Putin vows to support North Korea against the United States,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-vows-to-support-north-korea-against-the-united-states/articleshow/111094571.cms,"SEOUL/MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed on Tuesday to deepen trade and security ties with North Korea and to support it against the United States, as he headed to the reclusive nuclear-armed country for the first time in 24 years.The US and its Asian allies are trying to work out just how far Russia will go in support of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose country is the only one to have conducted nuclear weapon tests in the 21st century.In a signal that Russia, a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council, is reassessing its entire approach to North Korea, Putin praised Pyongyang for resisting what he said was US economic pressure, blackmail and threats.In an article published by North Korean state media, Putin praised ""Comrade"" Kim, and promised to ""jointly resist illegitimate unilateral restrictions"", to develop trade and strengthen security across Eurasia.""Washington, refusing to implement previously reached agreements, continuously puts forward new, increasingly stringent and obviously unacceptable demands,"" Putin said in the article, printed on the front page of North Korea's Rodong Sinmun, the ruling Workers' Party mouthpiece.""Russia has always supported and will continue to support the DPRK and the heroic Korean people in their opposition to the insidious, dangerous and aggressive enemy.""Putin noted the Soviet Union was the first to recognise the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) founded by Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, less than two years before the 1950 Korean War.North Korean state media also published articles praising Russia and supporting its military operations in Ukraine , calling them a ""sacred war of all Russian citizens"".Putin's state visit comes amid US accusations that North Korea has supplied ""dozens of ballistic missiles and over 11,000 containers of munitions to Russia"" for use in Ukraine. South Korea, a staunch US ally, has raised similar concerns.The White House said on Monday it was troubled by the deepening relationship between Russia and North Korea. The US State Department said it was ""quite certain"" Putin would be seeking arms to support his war in Ukraine.Moscow and Pyongyang have denied arms transfers but have vowed to boost military ties, possibly including joint drills.Russia is due to outproduce the whole NATO military alliance on ammunition production this year, so Putin's trip is likely aimed at underscoring to Washington just how disruptive Moscow can be on a host of global crises.Russia in March vetoed the annual renewal of a panel of experts monitoring enforcement of longstanding United Nations sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTPutin's foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Russia and North Korea may sign a partnership agreement during the visit that would include security issues.He said the deal would not be directed against any other country, but would ""outline prospects for further cooperation"".The visit will include one-on-one discussions between the two leaders, as well as a gala concert, state reception, honour guards, document signings, and a statement to the media, Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Ushakov as saying.Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the ministers for natural resources, health, and transport, the heads of the Russian space agency and its railways, and Putin's point man for energy, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, will be part of the delegation.Ahead of the visit, North Korea appears to have been making preparations for a possible military parade in downtown Pyongyang, commercial satellite imagery showed.The summit presents the greatest threat to US national security since the Korean War, said Victor Cha, a former US national security official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""This relationship, deep in history and reinvigorated by the war in Ukraine, undermines the security of Europe, Asia, and the US homeland,"" he wrote in a report on Monday.He urged Washington to work with Europe and other partners to increase economic and diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang, engage with China, and launch a major human rights and information campaign to flood the North with outside media.North Korea has been under UN sanctions for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs since 2006, and those measures have been strengthened over the years.The Security Council has been divided over how to deal with Pyongyang.Russia and China say more sanctions will not help and that joint military drills by the United States and South Korea merely provoke Pyongyang. Two years ago, they vetoed a US-led push to impose more UN sanctions on North Korea over its renewed ballistic missile launches.Washington and its Asian allies accuse Beijing and Moscow of emboldening North Korea by shielding it from more sanctions.After North Korea, Putin will visit Vietnam on June 19-20.(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin and Josh Smith and Guy Faulconbridge in Moscow; Additional reporting by Lidia Kelly in Melbourne and Michelle Nichols in New York; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Gareth Jones)","Russian President Vladimir Putin vows to deepen trade and security ties with North Korea.

Only Romania, whose Prez Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still opposed to Rutte's candidacy.

Dutch news outlet NOS quoted sources as saying Rutte will succeed Stoltenberg, who steps down in Oct after nearly a decade at the helm. Stoltenberg said the decision-making process was very close to a conclusion. ""I think Mark Rutte is a very strong candidate. He has a lot of experience as PM.""

Nato's next chief will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine, while guarding against any escalation that could draw it directly into a war with Moscow.

Thailand passes same-sex marriage bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/thailand-passes-same-sex-marriage-bill/articleshow/111094523.cms,"Lawmakers in Thailand voted on Tuesday to approve a marriage equality bill , a move that puts the country on a clear path to becoming the first in Southeast Asia to legalise same-sex marriage . Thailand's Senate passed the bill by 130 votes to 4, with some abstentions, on Tuesday afternoon. It was approved by the House of Representatives in March. The legislation would become law after it is reviewed by a Senate committee and the Constitutional Court and receives royal assent from the king, a formality that is widely expected to be granted.""After 20 years of trying to legalise this matter,"" activist Plaifa Kyoka Shodladd said in the Senate chamber after the vote, ""finally, love wins."" The bill's passage underscores Thailand's status as a relative haven for gay couples in Asia. Only Taiwan and Nepal have legalised same-sex marriage.In some Asian countries, gay sex is a criminal offense. Indonesia, where gay marriage is illegal, made extramarital sex illegal in 2022. In 2019, Brunei made gay sex punishable with death by stoning. It later said it would not carry out executions, after widespread international protest.After the bill's passage, hundreds of supporters gathered in downtown Bangkok to celebrate the milestone despite the punishing heat, waving flags and throwing colorful balloons at a Pride rally. A parade began with the bang of a firecracker and confetti flying in the air. Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"" played at the rally, as well as a '90s-style Thai pop song called ""History"", with the lyrics: ""History won't repeat anymore, history's about to change its course, change toward equality."" PM Srettha Thavisin said he would host a celebration for activists on Tuesday, though he said he could not attend the event because of a Covid infection.Thailand's bill, which amends the country's civil and commercial code, calls marriage a partnership between two people age 18 and above, without specifying gender. It also gives LGBTQ couples equal rights to adopt children, claim tax allowances, inherit property and give consent for medical treatment when their partners are incapacitated.The bill has been contentious since its first version was introduced over 20 years ago. While Thailand is one of the most open places in the world for gay couples, it is socially conservative in other ways. In Feb, lawmakers dismissed a proposal to let people change genders on official documents. But a majority of the Thai public supports the marriage equality bill. Last year, 60% of adults in Thailand said they backed legalising same-sex marriage in a survey.","Thailand's Senate passed the bill by 130 votes to 4, with some abstentions.

"Biden's new policy to offer deportation protection, work permits for spouses of US citizens",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bidens-new-policy-to-offer-deportation-protection-work-permits-for-spouses-of-us-citizens/articleshow/111072930.cms,"US President Joe Biden is set to announce a comprehensive new policy on Tuesday that aims to protect hundreds of thousands of individuals married to US citizens from deportation. This move, highly anticipated by many Democrats, emerges as a significant election-year decision on immigration.On the agenda for a White House event , US President plans to introduce this initiative while also celebrating the Obama-era program known as the ""dreamers"" directive. This directive has historically provided deportation protections for young undocumented immigrants.According to sources familiar with the matter, the new policy will offer approximately 490,000 spouses of US citizens the chance to apply for a ""parole in place"" program. If they have resided in the country for at least 10 years, this program would not only shield them from deportation but also grant them work permits. These sources requested anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the announcement publicly.The White House opted not to comment on the announcement when reached on Monday.This announcement represents a pivotal moment for Biden's administration. At the beginning of his presidency, Biden pledged to advocate for broader relief for the millions of immigrants in the US without permanent legal status. However, as migrant numbers hit record highs and Biden gears up for a potential re-election contest against Donald Trump , recent policy changes have reflected a stricter stance. Earlier this month, Biden's administration implemented a border crackdown that many critics feel mirrors those of Trump's era.The recent restrictive measures at the US-Mexico border, effectively halting asylum processing, have drawn criticism from Biden’s political allies.Representative Nanette Barragan, D-Calif., who heads the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, expressed her support for upcoming announcements, predicting they would bring ""tears of joy paired with some sighs of relief"" for many families.Some families affected by Biden's new policy are expected to attend the White House event on Tuesday afternoon.For a while, administration officials have explored various ways to protect immigrants without legal status but with deep-rooted ties in the US The authority Biden is leveraging will not only offer deportation protections and work permits but will also remove legal barriers, allowing eligible immigrants to apply for permanent residency and, eventually, US citizenship. This authority has previously been applied to other groups, including US military members and their families without legal status.""Today, I have spoken about what we need to do to secure the border,” Biden said at a June 4 White House event when introducing his order to suspend asylum processing for many migrants. “In the weeks ahead - and I mean the weeks ahead - I will speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just.""Biden is also expected to extend eligibility for visas to recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, moving beyond the temporary work authorizations currently granted to them.Immigration advocates welcomed the expected policy for spouses of US citizens, noting the challenges these individuals face in obtaining legal status despite having substantial ties in the country.""This is a defining moment in history, and we need to meet this moment,"" said Ashley DeAzevedo, president of American Families United, an advocacy group for US citizens married to foreign nationals.Despite the positive reception from advocates, Biden’s use of this authority could face legal challenges, similar to the challenges faced by the DACA program. The White House plans to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the DACA program, initiated by then-President Barack Obama to protect young immigrants, often referred to as ""dreamers.""In recent weeks, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has urged Biden to shield the spouses of US citizens from deportation and to create work visas for graduates of US colleges who came to the country without authorization as children.Several House Democrats plan to return to Washington for the announcement, which is expected to be warmly received within their ranks.Senator Alex Padilla, D-Calif., described Biden's action as ""justice"" that ""was long overdue for the people who have been waiting but are key to so many thriving families and communities.""Advocates believe the policy could be politically advantageous for Biden.""We anticipate that immigrant and Latino voters will express their gratitude at the ballot box in November,"" said Gustavo Torres, president of CASA in Action.Donald Trump, on the other hand, has pledged to deport millions of migrants if he is re-elected. His campaign’s rhetoric continues to be strongly anti-immigration.While Biden's policy targets longtime US residents, it has drawn criticism from Republicans. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, characterized it as a ""huge magnet"" for potential immigrants, suggesting it would ""attract even more people"" to the border.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Joe Biden is set to announce a comprehensive new policy on Tuesday.

The ecodesign regulations are to kick in 24 months after its publication in the official journal.The European Commission can introduce similar bans for other products in the future, an official statement said.

Thakur, who heads the secretariat at the industry body, suggested that govt should take it up as part of the bilateral talks with EU.Another industry player described it as a non-tariff barrier and said govt should flag the concern even during the free trade negotiations as these norms would negate the impact of any tariff cut that is being sought. The adoption of the regulations by the European Council has temporary exclusions for SMEs, but they are not seen to be sufficient.""This new regulation replaces the existing ecodesign directive and broadens its scope to encompass all goods placed in the EU market, beyond just energy products.

Explained: Why Russian President Vladimir Putin is visiting North Korea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/vladimir-putin-to-visit-kim-jong-un-russia-north-korea-relations-ukraine-war-putin-kim-bromance/articleshow/111073224.cms,"Putin and Kim bromance has blossomed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Why it matters

The Economist has termed the growing Russia-North Korea ties as ""Vladimir Putin’s dangerous bromance with Kim Jong Un"". As per the Economist, the Putin-Kim bromance has blossomed thanks to geopolitical shifts.

has blossomed thanks to geopolitical shifts. Kim turned away from talks with America following the failed summit in Hanoi and began making fresh overtures to Russia. The response was lukewarm—until Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine floundered and Russia came to need munitions, one of the few things Kim’s regime has in abundance.

However, this realignment extends beyond mere arms deals, as North Korea helps Russia complicate American strategy in Asia and undermine multilateral institutions.

What they are saying

Jenny Town of the Stimson Centre, an American think-tank, told the Economist: “It’s a mistake to think about it simply as an arms deal.”

“It is the biggest strategic opportunity for North Korea since the end of the Cold War,” said Ankit Panda of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“The new Russian love with North Korea is shallow and artificial,” argued Andrei Lankov, a Russian expert on North Korea based at Kookmin University in Seoul.

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba characterized the trip as a ""lonely bromance"" between Putin and Kim.

How has this partnership affected international dynamics?

North Korea’s alliance with Russia complicates American strategy in Asia and undermines multilateral institutions. Russia’s veto of a United Nations resolution extending the mandate of the Panel of Experts on North Korean sanctions in March highlighted this cooperation. This relationship also deters South Korea from providing direct lethal aid to Ukraine. Fyodor Tertitskiy of Kookmin University noted, “It’s not a bilateral relationship—big brother is always watching from Beijing.”

What has North Korea gained from this partnership?

North Korea has benefitted from trade with Russia, which has helped stabilize its economy amidst years of sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic. Summits with Putin have bolstered Kim’s image domestically. Ankit Panda of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace highlighted, “It is the biggest strategic opportunity for North Korea since the end of the Cold War.”

What might Russia offer North Korea in return?

Speculation surrounds what Russia might provide in return for North Korean arms. South Korea’s government believes North Korea’s wish list includes nuclear weapons designs, re-entry vehicles for intercontinental ballistic missiles, and technology related to satellites, submarines, and hypersonic weapons. Putin has already given Kim a Russian-made luxury limousine, but sensitive military technology transfers have yet to occur.

What are the long-term prospects of this relationship?

The partnership is likely to last as long as the war in Ukraine continues, but it may not endure beyond it. Lee Sang-hyun of the Sejong Institute remarked, “The calculated convergence of national interests can shift if the circumstances change.” Russia’s need for North Korean munitions may diminish as its own arms production ramps up.

What are the concerns of the United States and its allies?

Washington is troubled by the deepening relationship between Russia and North Korea. US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, “North Korea has supplied dozens of ballistic missiles and over 11,000 containers of munitions to Russia.”

There are concerns about what Russia might provide North Korea in return, whether it be hard currency, energy, or military technology. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell emphasized the need for vigilance, saying, “We don’t know. But we’re concerned by that and watching carefully.”

How does China fit into this relationship?

China’s role in the Russia-North Korea relationship is significant. Beijing’s influence can shape the depth of cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Fyodor Tertitskiy pointed out, “Big brother is always watching from Beijing.” While China supports North Korea as a stable buffer state, closer military ties between Russia and North Korea could threaten these aims.

Vladimir Putin , the President of Russia, is visiting North Korea this week for the first time in 24 years, marking a significant deepening of relations between Moscow and Pyongyang. This visit underscores the burgeoning partnership between the two nuclear-armed states, particularly in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , who has referred to their relationship as an “unbreakable relationship of comrades-in-arms,” extended the invitation during his visit to Russia’s Far East last September.Here is all you need to know about growing Russia-North Korea ties:(With inputs from agencies)",Putin and Kim bromance has blossomed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Legal age for marriage in Pakistan

The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72-year-old man named Habib Khan was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town. While the police managed to arrest the groom and the 'Nikah Khwan' (a person who solemnizes the marriage), the girl's father managed to escape.A case has been registered against the girl's father, the 72-year-old man, and the 'Nikkah Khwan' under the Child Marriage Act , according to ARY News. Despite the existence of laws prohibiting child marriage, such incidents continue to occur in various parts of Pakistan. The minor girl was sent to a hospital for a medical examination.The girl's father, Alam Syed, had reportedly agreed to sell his daughter to the elderly man for PKR 500,000.In recent times, law enforcement agencies have thwarted similar attempts in Rajanpur and Thatta, where young girls were being coerced into marrying older men. In Rajanpur, Punjab, an 11-year-old girl was set to marry a 40-year-old man, while in Thatta, a young girl was forcibly married to a 50-year-old landlord before the police took action and rescued the girl.In another incident on May 6, a 70-year-old man was arrested by the police for marrying a 13-year-old girl in Swat. The girl's father had arranged the marriage, but the police swiftly took the groom and the father into custody. The 'Nikkah Khwan' and the marriage witnesses were also arrested, and the minor girl was sent to a hospital for a medical examination.In Pakistan, the legal age for marriage differs based on gender. While the internationally recognized minimum age for both males and females is 18, the country's laws allow males to marry at 18 but permit females to wed at the younger age of 16.Although Sindh province took a step towards gender equality in 2013 by passing legislation to raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 for both genders, this progressive change has not been adopted and implemented throughout the nation. The disparity in legal marriage age between men and women persists in other parts of the nation.","The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72- year-old man was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town.

A collision between a Philippine ship and a Chinese vessel occurred on Monday near the Spratly Islands in the disputed South China Sea , according to Beijing's Coast Guard .Beijing claims nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, a vital waterway facilitating over $3 trillion in annual maritime trade which is subject to overlapping claims by several nations, including China, the Philippines , Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.China deploys various boats to patrol the waters and has transformed several reefs into militarised artificial islands. A series of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have occurred in disputed areas.New Chinese coast guard rules took effect on Saturday, June 15, which reinforce a 2021 law granting its coastguard the authority to use deadly force against foreign vessels in contested waters.Under these new rules, China's coastguard is empowered to apprehend suspected trespassers and detain them for up to 60 days without the need for a trial.In a statement, the Beijing's Coast Guard said, ""Philippine replenishment ship ignored many solemn warnings from the Chinese side"".It ""approached the... Chinese vessel in an unprofessional way, resulting in a collision"", the statement said.""The Chinese Coast Guard took control measures against the Philippine ship in accordance with the law,"" it added.Beijing accused the ship of having ""illegally broken into the sea near Ren'ai Reef in China's Nansha Islands"", using the Chinese name for the Spratly Islands.Manila has accused the Chinese coast guard of ""barbaric and inhumane behaviour"" against Philippine vessels, and President Ferdinand Marcos has called the new rules a ""very worrisome"" escalation.China has defended its new coast guard rules, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying last month that they were intended to ""better uphold order at sea"".The Group of Seven bloc criticised what it called ""dangerous"" incursions by China in the South China Sea on Friday.

Here are the highlights from the speech of Elon Musk at the AGM:

The advancement of unsupervised autonomous driving technology is accelerating rapidly. Elon Musk has predicted that soon, Tesla owners will be able to connect their vehicles to a fleet and generate passive income. The market value of the autonomous car industry could potentially reach $10 trillion.

One significant revelation was the confirmation of the long-awaited Cybertruck's production timeline. Musk stated, ""We'll be in production with Cybertruck next year."" This news has been eagerly anticipated by Tesla enthusiasts and potential buyers alike.

next year."" This news has been eagerly anticipated by Tesla enthusiasts and potential buyers alike. Additionally, Tesla announced plans to expand its manufacturing capabilities with a new factory in Mexico. This facility will focus on producing the next-generation vehicle platform. Musk emphasized the importance of this platform, saying, ""Most important product development we're working on is the next-generation vehicle that will be roughly half the cost of the 3 and Y platform.""

with a new factory in Mexico. This facility will focus on producing the next-generation vehicle platform. Musk emphasized the importance of this platform, saying, ""Most important product development we're working on is the next-generation vehicle that will be roughly half the cost of the 3 and Y platform."" Musk also said that Tesla is not just a car company. He said, ""Tesla also writes a lot of software that helps what like we call the Tesla operating system internally. That is Head and Shoulder above what any other company has I think. The Tesla internal software is just way better. So...yeah it's just far more than what people normally think of as a car company.""

Musk also provided updates on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. While acknowledging the challenges and regulatory hurdles, Musk expressed confidence in Tesla's progress and potential in this area.

During the shareholder meeting, Elon Musk unveiled Tesla's ambitious plan to create humanoid robots, focusing on the Optimus project. Musk envisioned a future where these robots become essential in everyday life, extending beyond their industrial applications. Musk predicted that the ratio of humanoid robots to humans could be at least 2:1. At scale, cost of producing 1 robot could be $10k. Valuation of Optimus business could be $25 trillion. He humorously remarked, ""Who doesn't want a C3PO?"" which elicited laughter and applause from the audience. Musk emphasized, ""I think everyone in the world is going to want one, like literally everyone.""

The Optimus robot is designed to perform a wide range of tasks and has the potential to transform various industries and households. Musk highlighted Tesla's unique position to succeed in this challenging field, leveraging their expertise in electric motors, batteries, and AI. He elaborated on the company's approach, stating, ""We've had to design everything from scratch—the motors, the gearboxes, the sensors, the power electronics.""

Musk further noted the lack of an existing supply chain for the specific components required for humanoid robots, emphasizing Tesla's innovative efforts in this domain.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk bragged about his company's internal advancements in AI, including hardware and chip design, saying he'd choose the company's in-house work over any alternative. Musk said, ""Tesla is also the leader in the real world AI so this really is a big deal. Tesla is ahead of Google... No one can, no one is even close and it's getting better I say with each passing month if not each passing week."" He said its chips are also made in-house as Nvidia and other chip players can’t make a competing chip for Tesla’s use-cases (humanoid robots, intelligent cars and cameras).

NEW DELHI: Tesla 's annual meeting was held earlier this week in which the shareholders approved the ratification of Elon Musk's $56 billion performance-based stock option award , rescinded by a Delaware court for lack of board independence and transparency, and a proposal on relocating Tesla’s incorporation from Delaware to Texas. Tesla's 2024 shareholder meeting also provided several important updates and insights into the company's plans and progress. CEO Elon Musk and other executives discussed various topics, including vehicle production, new models, and technological advancements.","Tesla announced plans to expand its manufacturing capabilities with a new factory in Mexico.

"Nikhil Gupta will now face justice in American courtroom, says US attorney general",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nikhil-gupta-will-now-face-justice-in-american-courtroom-says-us-attorney-general/articleshow/111093913.cms,"WASHINGTON: Nikhil Gupta , an Indian national accused of being involved in a murder-for-hire plot against a Sikh extremist in New York, will now face justice in an American courtroom, Attorney General Merrick Garland has said, asserting that the US will not tolerate attempts to ""silence"" or ""harm"" its citizens. Gupta, 53, also known as Nick, was arrested and detained in the Czech Republic on June 30, 2023, at the request of the US government on charges of being involved in a plot to assassinate Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York. He was extradited to the US on June 14.Gupta was produced before a federal court in New York on Monday, where he pleaded not guilty, according to his attorney, Jeffrey Chabrowe.He was arraigned on the charges in the Superseding Indictment before U.S. Magistrate Judge James L. Cott on Monday. The case is assigned to US District Judge Victor Marrero.""This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens ,"" Garland said on Monday.""Nikhil Gupta will now face justice in an American courtroom for his involvement in an alleged plot, directed by an employee of the Indian government , to target and assassinate a US citizen for his support of the Sikh separatist movement in India,"" he said.Gupta has been charged with murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, the US Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York said in a press release.Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said this murder-for-hire plot, allegedly orchestrated by an Indian government employee to kill a US citizen in New York City, was a brazen attempt to silence a political activist for exercising a quintessential American right -- his freedom of speech.""The extradition of the defendant is a vital step towards justice,"" she said.FBI Director Christopher Wray said the agency will not tolerate attempts by foreign nationals or anyone else to repress constitutionally-protected freedoms in the United States.""We will continue to work with our partners at home and abroad to protect our citizens and these sacred rights,"" he said.India has publicly said a high-level inquiry is looking into the evidence shared by the US in the alleged plot to kill Pannun on American soil.DEA Administrator Anne Milgram described Gupta as an international narcotics trafficker. ""Gupta is alleged to have orchestrated a dangerous plot to murder a U.S. citizen on US soil,"" she added.According to court documents, last year, an Indian government employee (CC-1) allegedly worked together with Gupta and others in India and elsewhere to direct an assassination plot against an attorney and political activist, who is a US citizen of Indian origin, on US soil.Gupta is an Indian national who resides in India, is an associate of CC-1, and has described his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking in his communications with CC-1 and others, a media release said.CC-1 is an Indian government agency employee who has variously described himself as a ""senior field officer"" with responsibilities in ""security management"" and ""intelligence"" and has referenced previously serving in India's Central Reserve Police Force and receiving ""officer training"" in ""battle craft"" and ""weapons"". CC-1 directed the assassination plot from India, it added.Federal prosecutors alleged that CC-1 recruited Gupta in May 2023 to orchestrate the assassination in the US.Pannun is a vocal critic of the Indian government and leads a US-based organisation that advocates for the secession of Punjab, the federal prosecutors said.They alleged that on CC-1's direction, Gupta contacted an individual whom he believed to be a criminal associate but he was in fact a confidential source working with the DEA (the CS) for assistance in contracting a hitman to murder the victim in New York City.""The CS introduced Gupta to a purported hitman, who was in fact a DEA undercover officer (the UC). CC-1 subsequently agreed, in dealings brokered by Gupta, to pay the UC USD 1,00,000 to murder the victim. On or about June 9, 2023, CC-1 and Gupta arranged for an associate to deliver USD 15,000 in cash to the UC as an advance payment for the murder. CC-1's associate then delivered the USD 15,000 to the UC in Manhattan,"" they said.In June 2023, in furtherance of the assassination plot, CC-1 provided Gupta with personal information about the victim, including the victim's home address, phone numbers associated with the victim and details about the victim's day-to-day conduct, which Gupta then passed on to the UC, they added.CC-1 directed Gupta to provide regular updates on the progress of the assassination plot, which Gupta accomplished by allegedly forwarding to CC-1, among other things, surveillance photographs of the victim.""Gupta directed the UC to carry out the murder as soon as possible, but Gupta also specifically instructed the UC not to commit the murder around the time of anticipated engagements scheduled to occur in the ensuing weeks between high-level US and Indian government officials,"" the prosecutors said.According to the prosecutors, after Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was killed outside a gurdwara in Canada on June 18, 2023, Gupta allegedly told the UC that he ""was also the target"" and ""we have so many targets"".Around June 20, 2023, CC-1 sent Gupta a news article about the victim and messaged him ""(i)t's (a) priority now"", the prosecutors alleged.","Nikhil Gupta is accused of being involved in a murder-for-hire plot against a Sikh extremist in New York.

What's a heat dome? Here's why so much of the US is broiling this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whats-a-heat-dome-heres-why-so-much-of-the-us-is-broiling-this-week/articleshow/111093905.cms,"A heat dome and a heat wave are two related but distinct weather phenomena that are causing extreme summer temperatures across much of the Midwest and Northeast of USA this week. While both terms indicate very hot conditions, they differ in their specific characteristics and impacts.A heat dome refers to the atmospheric conditions that lead to high temperatures . It occurs when a high-pressure system develops in the upper atmosphere, causing the air below to sink and compress. This compression raises temperatures in the lower atmosphere, creating a dome-like structure of hot air. The boundaries of the current heat dome are not precisely defined, but the National Weather Service expects the most extreme heat in the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.On the other hand, a heat wave is defined by the intensity, duration, and location of the heat experienced by people on the ground. The severity of a heat wave depends on the region; for example, several days of temperatures above 90°F (32°C) might be considered a heat wave in the Midwest and Northeast, while such temperatures are more common in Texas. This week, the Midwest and Northeast are expected to experience mid- to high-90s temperatures, with heat indices reaching or exceeding 100°F (38°C). These conditions can be particularly challenging for populations not accustomed to such extreme heat.The combination of clear skies and the higher summertime angle of the sun can result in high heat index readings, which measure the combined effect of temperature and humidity. Humidity makes the weather feel hotter because it hinders the body's ability to cool itself through sweating. Several cities, including Detroit, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Albany, are expected to break temperature records and experience heat indices near or above 100°F (38°C) this week.The United States experienced the most heat waves since 1936 last year, contributing to more than 2,300 deaths, the highest number in 45 years of records. The current heat dome is expected to affect a broad area from the Great Plains states up through Maine, with some locations potentially seeing their hottest temperatures on record for any month. As of Tuesday, nearly 77 million people in the United States were under extreme heat alerts.","A heat dome occurs when a high-pressure system develops in the upper atmosphere, causing the air below to sink and compress.

""Let him go, let him go,"" his friends were telling the police.The cop who pulled Timberlake over was so young that he didn't even recognize the 10-time Grammy winner.The 43-year-old pop singer was taken into custody and was charged with one count of driving while intoxicated and two other traffic violations: not stopping at the stop sign and failure to stay in a proper lane of travel, the report said.Timberlake claimed to have one martini before he was stopped by the cops. The criminal complaint report, however, said his eyes were bloodshot and glassy. “His eyes were bloodshot and glassy, a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot, and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests,’’ the report said.In recent years, Timberlake's behavior toward women in the early 2000s has also come under sharper scrutiny.The public and media have reexamined his treatment of singer and actor Britney Spears, whom he dated in the early 2000s, and whom he referenced in songs like ""Cry Me a River.""

Why do the spouses of American citizens need protection?

When will the program take effect?

President Joe Biden has announced a new immigration policy in which spouses of American citizens will obtain legal status if they are illegal immigrants. The policy will be applicable to those who have been residing in the country for not less than 10 years and are married to a US citizen before June 17, 2024. According to the White House, the move will benefit at least 500,000 people in addition to some 50,000 stepchildren of US citizens.Indian-Americans are a major group who will be safeguarded from deportation fears in the new policy. Undocumented Indians are to benefit from the policy as their numbers have been steadily growing since 2011. Those who will qualify under this policy will get work authorization followed by their right to stay in the United States for up to three years. By the time, they can apply for the green card -- if married to a US citizen.Marrying an American citizen generally provides a pathway to US citizenship. But people who crossed the southern border illegally must return to their home countries to complete the process for a green card, something that can take years. The new program allows families to remain in the country while they pursue legal status.Biden administration officials said they expected the program to start by the end of the summer. Those eligible will then be able to apply for the benefits.New York Times noted that Biden is trying to strike a tricky balance on immigration, which is a serious political vulnerability for him. Polls show Americans want tougher policies. Just two weeks ago, Biden announced a crackdown on asylum at the southern border. His new policy, giving hundreds of thousands of immigrants new legal protections, is a way for him to answer the calls from the progressive base of the Democratic Party, which has accused the White House of betraying campaign promises to enact a more humane approach to immigrants.","President Joe Biden announced a new immigration policy in which spouses of American citizens will obtain legal status if they are illegal immigrants. The policy will be applicable to those who have been residing in the country for not less than 10 years and are married to a US citizen before June 17, 2024. The move will benefit at least 500,000 people in addition to some 50,000 stepchildren of US citizens.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111092840,imgsize-943469,width-400,resizemode-4/111092840.jpg"
Legal blow for Donald Trump as court rejects appeal of gag order in hush money case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/legal-blow-for-donald-trump-as-court-rejects-appeal-of-gag-order-in-hush-money-case/articleshow/111092453.cms,"New York's top court on Tuesday refused to hear former US President Donald Trump 's appeal regarding the gag order in his hush money case , maintaining the restrictions following his felony conviction in May. The Court of Appeals found that the order does not present ""substantial"" constitutional issues warranting immediate intervention.This decision marks another legal setback for the former Republican president, who has repeatedly criticized the gag order, which prohibits him from commenting on witnesses, jurors, and others involved in the case. However, the trial judge , Juan M Merchan, is expected to make a ruling soon on a defense request to lift the gag order.Trump's attorneys filed a notice of appeal with the state's high court on May 15, during his historic criminal trial. They contended that the gag order limited Trump's ""core political speech on matters of central importance at the height of his Presidential campaign.""The Court of Appeals, however, did not agree. In a decision list released on Tuesday, the court stated that it would not automatically hear the case, noting that ""no substantial constitutional question is directly involved.""Trump's lawyers were essentially attempting to expedite their appeal through a shortcut, which was denied by the state's mid-level appeals court last month. They now have 30 days to file a motion for leave to appeal, according to court spokesperson Gary Spencer.Merchan imposed the gag order on March 26, a few weeks before the trial began, after prosecutors expressed concerns about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's propensity to attack individuals involved in his cases.During the trial, Merchan held Trump in contempt of court and fined him $10,000 for violating the gag order. The judge warned that Trump could face jail time if he repeated the violation.The order remains in effect weeks after the trial concluded, which resulted in Trump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors alleged that this was an attempt to conceal a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election. Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11.","New York's Court of Appeals refused to hear Donald Trump's appeal regarding the gag order in his hush money case.

Akhter, a resident, expresses the struggles faced by daily wage workers and labourers, highlighting the impact of soaring prices not only on milk but also on related products such as Ghee (clarified butter).""We can't sustain our households in such inflationary times,"" he laments, urging the government to consider the plight of its citizens amidst these challenging circumstances.Faizan echoes similar sentiments, explaining that milk prices have escalated due to the rising costs faced by dairy farm owners for essentials like fodder, high rents, and water.""They have no choice but to pass on these expenses to consumers,"" he observes, urging the government to prioritise the welfare of the common people regardless of how they came into power.In Karachi, and across Pakistan, the struggle against inflation is not just about economic numbers but about the daily realities faced by the citizens.According to local media reports, the cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers, in collaboration with commissioner Karachi , settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.The decision came after an extensive consultation session that lasted several hours, where the commissioner met with stakeholders from the dairy farming, wholesaling, and retail sectors to discuss and finalise the price adjustment.Following thorough deliberations, all parties reached a consensus to implement the PKR 20 per litre hike, setting the new price of milk at PKR 220 per litre, which represents a significant increase compared to previous rates.","The cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.

The incident unfolded on May 25 in Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, where Nazir and other Christians were accused of blasphemy , sparking violent outrage among locals.After fighting for his life for eight days, Masih succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.The incident showed a troubling pattern in Pakistan where blasphemy accusations lead to violence against Christian communities.HRFP has expressed deep concern over the swift post-arrest bail granted to 52 attackers involved in the Sargodha incident.Despite the First Information Report (FIR) being filed against 44 identified and 400 unidentified suspects under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), progress in police investigations and court proceedings has been slow and inadequate.Compounding the community's apprehensions are threatening videos released by Islamic groups following the incident, exacerbating fears among the Christian community.Drawing parallels with the August 16, 2023, attack in Jaranwala, the HRFP report highlighted similar incidents of mob violence and property destruction against minorities. It underscores a recurring pattern involving provocation, and subsequent violence, often followed by the expedient release of perpetrators.HRFP has called for decisive action, citing intelligence reports linking extremist groups to multiple blasphemy allegations. The organization has also urged stringent measures to address these threats.The report also documented individual cases of violence and harassment against Christians across Pakistan.Farooq Masih's family in Jaranwala continues to face threats. Despite the FIR filed in February, the perpetrators are still at large.Similarly, the case of Saima Bibi, who suffered an assault in April, was downplayed as an 'accident' despite clear evidence of the attack.The plight of Rawal Masih, Romeo Masih, Waqas Masih, Rakhsana Bibi, Asifa Bibi, Shazia Zaulfiqar, and Ahsan Masih, who all were abducted and murdered, also underscores the ongoing oppression faced by PakistChristians.Naveed Walter, president of HRFP, emphasized the ""dire circumstances"" for minorities in Pakistan and urged increased protection and support for the Christian community. He called for an end to the misuse of blasphemy accusations and fabricated justifications for violence, stressing the need for systemic reforms to ensure minority safety.The HRFP report underscores the urgent situation faced by Christians in Pakistan and advocates for international and local intervention to uphold human rights and justice.","Human Rights Focus Pakistan (HRFP) has published a detailed fact-finding report uncovering disturbing incidents of religious persecution against Christians.

Massive protests threatening to send the government packing used to be held across the country.""Oh, how the times have changed. Days after dropping tax bombs that will further eviscerate the struggling masses, the authorities have announced that not only will they be taking more money out of the pay cheques of salaried individuals, they will also be squeezing whatever is left through significantly jacked-up electricity bills ,"" the editorial read.Citing news reports, it said that Nepra (National Electric Power Regulatory Authority) has hiked the uniform national tariff for the base price of electricity by almost 20 per cent to hand over electricity distribution companies almost half a trillion rupees more over the next fiscal year.The average base tariff for a single unit of electricity, which was PakistRupees (PKR) 27.78 in the outgoing year, will be PKR 35.50 from July 1.On top of this, various duties, taxes, and surcharges, as well as fuel and tariff adjustments, will be levied, forcing ordinary citizens to pay through their noses, not just for the fuel and operation and maintenance costs involved in generating electricity, but also for capacity charges that past governments have promised power generation companies, as well as the theft and transmission losses that distribution companies have shown a complete unwillingness to mitigate for many years.The average middle-class bill-paying customer will be forking out between PKR 65-72 for each unit of electricity they use in a month. Meanwhile, the federal government will present this as an 'achievement' in front of the IMF to ask for even more loans to keep a clearly failing system running for a few years longer, the editorial added.However, at the same time, the government has announced a PKR 10.69 per unit 'relief' for the industrial sector to 'make it competitive'. There can probably be no better example of crony capitalism.While the average salaried individual is finding it difficult to meet their ends on a shrinking real wage amidst month after month of unceasing, unchecked inflation, it is the big industries who get a break in the form of cheaper electricity so that they can pad up their profits while paying little back to the country in the form of taxes.""That the government is failing the people seems like an understatement. It is clearly least bothered by their plight. Its financial planning shows that it has no interest in going after those who dodge their dues; it just wants to take the easy route and enjoy the ride for however long it is in power,"" the Dawn editorial stated.","The average base tariff for a single unit of electricity, which was PakistRupees (PKR) 27.78 in the outgoing year, will be PKR 35.50 from July 1.

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching display of their persistent sorrow and discontent, families affected by enforced disappearances in the Balochistan region of Pakistan decided to abandon customary Eid festivities. Instead, they planned to stage a protest to voice their outrage against state agencies alleged to have perpetrated atrocities against the Baloch people.

Mama Qadir Baloch , a key member of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), declared the protest in a video statement, asserting, ""For the past 15 years, the atrocities committed by the Army and intelligence agencies of Pakistan have led the Baloch to boycott Eid celebrations. While Muslims across the world celebrate this occasion, the Baloch mourn.""

Coinciding with this, families of the missing persons organized a sit-in protest at Shaheed Fida Chowk on Eid day, following a similar demonstration in front of the DC office just days prior. The earlier protest concluded after the district administration provided assurances to the families.

The decision to protest on Eid emphasizes the profound impact of enforced disappearances on the Baloch community, who have been tirelessly seeking justice and answers regarding the fate of their loved ones, allegedly taken by state forces.

Pakistan: Tomato prices soar to PKR 200 per kg ahead of Eid festivities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tomato-prices-soar-to-pkr-200-per-kg-ahead-of-eid-festivities/articleshow/111049153.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha, despite the district government setting the price cap at PKR 100 per kilogram, as per reports.This annual occurrence during Ramadan and Eid al-Adha typically goes unnoticed by authorities, despite their assurances to the contrary.In response to the situation, the Peshawar Deputy Commissioner has taken action by imposing a ban, under Section 144, on transporting tomatoes out of the district.With Eid al-Adha merely two days away, local retail markets have seen tomato prices double, aligning with earlier predictions that tomatoes, along with onions, would once again be sold at inflated prices during this festive period.Residents of the area have expressed frustration, noting that prices have escalated by Rs100 per kilogram in just one day. Many believe that the district administration's efforts will likely be limited to verbal instructions, as has been the case in previous instances, as per reports.During the budget presentation, one of the standout assertions was the government's commitment to maintaining inflation at 12 per cent in the upcoming fiscal year. On the surface, this goal appears supported by various planned initiatives aimed at curbing inflation rates.However, the implementation of aggressive tax measures, highlighted as key revenue strategies, seems paradoxical as they could potentially escalate prices instead of stabilising them.Regardless of the method used to gauge inflation, the stark reality is that any figure exceeding the previous fiscal year's average monthly inflation rate of 24.9 per cent will inevitably lead to increased consumer prices.Abid Suleri, Executive Director of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), argues that the government ought to have adjusted the minimum taxable income thresholds to factor in inflation when outlining personal income tax brackets. He criticises the current monthly exemption of PKR 50,000 as insufficient and warns that doubling taxes on those falling within the initial tax slab could reduce their disposable income, thereby exacerbating economic hardships.Moreover, heightened fuel expenses stemming from amplified levies and augmented GST rates in specific sectors are anticipated to drive inflation even higher, intensifying the overall cost of living. Suleri emphasises the absence of any mention regarding the taxation of agricultural income, which he believes could substantially broaden the tax base, Dawn reported.","The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha.

Imran should stay in jail for 5 years: Pakistan minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-should-stay-in-jail-for-5-years-pakistan-minister/articleshow/111043178.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan will have to be kept behind bars for five years to maintain the country’s “economic stability”, minister Ahsan Iqbal said Sunday. The five years coincide with the full term of the current govt led by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) that took office earlier this year.“People come to us and tell us that if Pakistan has to progress, then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,” Iqbal, the minister for planning and development as well as PML-N secretary-general, said.His comments came hours after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif pledged to rid the country of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying the next deal for a bailout package with the global lender would be the last in Pakistan’s history. IMF ties such loans to tough reform measures.According to Iqbal, if Imran came out of jail, “there would be sit-ins and fights again, which the country cannot afford”. “There is a voice of the people that Imran should remain in jail for five years,” Iqbal said. The minister added that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder was an “angry man” and it wasn’t known with whom he had a quarrel.The minister also made a subtle jab at the legal system by claiming Imran always relied on the “shoulder of the judiciary” for support during trying times. The allusion appeared to be to some court orders that went in favour of Imran in recent times.Asked about confrontation between the judiciary and the military establishment, Iqbal replied: “Both should think whether this is better for the country.”Iqbal recalled the past when politicians used to fight the military and vice versa. “Now we must cooperate for the benefit of the nation because fighting between institutions has put the country’s sovereignty at stake,” the minister said.","Ahsan Iqbal says Imran Khan will have to be kept behind bars for five years.
