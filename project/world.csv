"'They eat head, whole body ...': Fishermen face growing threat from bearded fireworms devouring their catches",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/they-eat-head-whole-body-fishermen-face-growing-threat-from-bearded-fireworms-devouring-their-catches/articleshow/112073505.cms,"Fishermen from Sicily, are facing a growing problem caused by bearded fireworms . These predators, which thrive in the warming Mediterranean Sea , are devouring fish caught in nets, leaving them half-eaten and unsellable.The centipede-like creatures, measuring 15 to 30 centimetres long, are equipped with venomous white bristles that can sting fishermen upon contact.The increasing presence of fireworms is attributed to rising sea temperatures caused by climate change , creating an ideal habitat for them to flourish year-round. Fishermen like Alfonso Barone are forced to reduce the time their nets are in the water to minimise the damage, resulting in smaller catches.""They eat the head, the whole body, they gut it,"" Barone said.""With global warming the waters are heating up and becoming an ideal habitat for them, and they are growing in number, year on year... the whole year round,"" he added.The worms, once confined to the waters off Sicily during summer, are now migrating northward, with cases reported in Calabria, southern Italy.Beachgoers in Marzamemi are also affected, with many donning masks or water shoes to protect themselves from potential stings.The warming Mediterranean is causing other changes, such as the loss of habitat and mass mortality events for certain species. Additionally, non-native tropical species like the blue crab are invading the ecosystem, causing further disruption.Zoologist Francesco Tiralongo, who heads a study on the fireworm at the University of Catania, has made a concerning discovery: ""You can't kill a fireworm by cutting it in half, it has excellent regeneration capabilities,"" he said. ""If you slice it in two, not only does the part with the head regenerate a back half, but the back half manages in about 22 days to regenerate a head.""","Fireworms are devouring fish caught in nets, leaving them half-eaten and unsellable.

"'World first': Juice spacecraft to flyby by Earth and Moon, then slingshot to Jupiter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/world-first-juice-spacecraft-to-flyby-by-earth-and-moon-then-slingshot-to-jupiter/articleshow/112073067.cms,"The European Space Agency 's Juice probe , launched in April 2023, is set to perform a groundbreaking manoeuvre next month as it journeys through the Solar System to Jupiter. The spacecraft, currently 10 million kilometres from Earth, will utilise the gravity of both the Moon and Earth to conserve fuel on its eight-year voyage to investigate the potential for extra-terrestrial life on Jupiter 's icy moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa.Preparations for this complex manoeuvre have begun at the ESA's space operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Juice is expected to reach Jupiter's system in July 2031, taking a longer route than Nasa's Europa Clipper spacecraft, which is scheduled to launch this October and arrive a year earlier.The decision to take the scenic route is partly due to the limitations of the Ariane 5 rocket used to launch Juice, which was not powerful enough for a direct shot to Jupiter, approximately 800 million kilometres away.""The only solution is to use gravitational assists,"" explained Arnaud Boutonnet, the ESA's head of analysis for the mission. By flying close to planets, spacecrafts can leverage their gravitational pull to change course, speed up, or slow down. While many other space missions have used planets for gravity boosts, the upcoming Earth-Moon flyby will be a ""world first"", according to the ESA, as it will be the first ""double gravity assist manoeuvre"" using boosts from two worlds in succession.Juice will pass 750 kilometres above the Moon on August 19 before zooming past Earth the next day, leaving at a speed of ""3.3 kilometres a second -- instead of three kilometres if we had not added the Moon"", Boutonnet noted.During its flyby, Juice will capture photos and test its numerous instruments, while some amateur skygazers on Earth may be able to spot the probe as it passes over Southeast Asia using telescopes or powerful binoculars.The manoeuvre has been meticulously planned for years, but it will not be without challenges. ""We are aiming for a mouse hole,"" Boutonnet emphasised, noting that even the slightest error during the Moon slingshot could be amplified by Earth's gravity, potentially risking the spacecraft entering and burning up in Earth's atmosphere. The ground team will closely monitor the spacecraft and have a 12-18 hour window to calculate and adjust its trajectory if necessary.If the manoeuvre is successful, Juice will continue its journey through interplanetary space , heading to Venus for another boost in 2025 and flying past Earth twice more in 2026 and 2029 before finally setting course for Jupiter. Once at Jupiter, Juice will perform an impressive 35 gravitational assists as it bounces around the planet's ocean moons, with its trajectory resembling ""a real plate of spaghetti"", according to Boutonnet, who added, ""What we're doing with the Earth-Moon system is a joke in comparison.""","Juice probe will use gravity of both the Moon and Earth to conserve fuel on its eight-year voyage to Jupiter.

Devastating wildfires in Northern California: Why West is burning and what we can do,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/park-fire-wildfires-in-northern-california-why-west-is-burning-and-what-we-can-do/articleshow/112072720.cms,"Fire status

Fires are becoming ever bigger

The Park Fire: California's largest blaze this year

Fires across the West

Increasingly severe wildfires

Nonstop fires

Controlled burns

as a solution

The future of wildfire management

Thousands of firefighters are battling a rapidly growing wildfire in northern California after the blaze more than doubled in size within 24 hours. The Park Fire , which has now consumed over 350,000 acres (141,640 hectares), is located approximately 90 miles (144 km) north of Sacramento, the state capital, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).As of Saturday afternoon, the fire remained 0% contained. However, cooler temperatures and more humid air are expected in the region, potentially aiding efforts to slow the fire's spread. Despite these hopeful conditions, the fire has already destroyed 134 structures.Experts say that decades of extinguishing fires at the first sign of smoke, combined with the effects of climate change , have set the stage for a massive wildfire in northern California and numerous smaller blazes across the western US and Canada.These fires are moving faster and proving harder to fight than those in the past. The only way to prevent future wildfires from becoming so fierce is to use smaller controlled fires, a method indigenous people employed for centuries, experts suggest. However, they acknowledge that implementing this change won't be easy.The Park Fire, the largest blaze in California this year, spanned 544 square miles (1,409 square kilometers) as of Saturday. It ignited on Wednesday when a man reportedly pushed a burning car into a gully in Chico and then blended in with others fleeing the scene.The intensity and rapid spread of the fire led officials to draw unfavorable comparisons to the Camp Fire of 2018, which devastated nearby Paradise, killing 85 people and destroying 11,000 homes.Communities across the U.S. West and Canada were also under siege from fast-moving flames on Saturday. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, more than 110 active fires covering 2,800 square miles (7,250 square kilometers) were burning in the U.S. on Friday.""Amped up"" is how Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist at Yale’s School of the Environment, described the recent fires. While there may not necessarily be more wildfires, they are larger and more severe due to the warming atmosphere.""The big message is that seeing extreme wildfires is just part of a series of unnatural disasters that we are going to continue seeing because of climate change,"" Marlon said.Benjamin Hatchett, a fire meteorologist with the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University, noted that ten of California’s 20 largest fires occurred in the last five years. The Park Fire ranked eighth as of Saturday morning and continued to spread. Hatchett attributed the increase in fire severity to climate change, which creates more variability in weather conditions.""We have a lot of very, very wet years and very, very dry years,"" Hatchett said. ""And so we get a lot of this variability that helps to accumulate and then dry out fuels.""This year, record-setting temperatures in California dried up the plant growth from recent wetter-than-average years, creating ideal conditions for widespread large wildfires.""We’re starting to push the limits of firefighting resource availability,"" Hatchett said.Today's fires don't allow firefighters a chance to rest, burning with extreme intensity straight through the night and into the next day, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.""We’re also seeing fires burning over a longer fire season than we used to,"" Swain said.The severity and heat of these fires can transform forests into different ecosystems. In some areas, trees are replaced with flammable invasive grasses due to climate change, affecting the ability of ecosystems to recover.In some parts of the country, like the Midwest, farmers use fire to control trees, woody shrubs, and invasive species. However, in the western U.S., fires have been extinguished in their infancy for decades.Tim Brown, a research professor at the Desert Research Institute and director of the Western Regional Climate Center in Reno, Nevada, pointed out that accumulated fuel in these areas causes fires to burn hotter and more intensely than natural fires would.Fires were once common in the West due to lightning strikes and indigenous burning, but this practice stopped during colonial settlement. Hatchett emphasized the need to return to controlled burns.""That’s the only way we’re really going to get out of this, is to really accept and embrace the use of fire on our terms,"" Hatchett said. ""Otherwise, we’re going to get fire on the fire’s terms, which is like what we’re seeing right now.""However, Swain acknowledged that conducting controlled burns is challenging in today's landscape, where millions of acres cannot burn unchecked.""This is something we need to be doing more of. But the practical reality of doing so is not at all simple,"" Swain said.Despite the challenges, Swain said there is no option to address the wildfire risk that doesn't involve fire.""We’re going to see more and more fire on the ground,"" he said. ""The question is whether we want to see it in the form of more manageable, primarily beneficial prescribed burns, or in these primarily harmful, huge, intense conflagrations that we’re increasingly seeing.""","The Park Fire, the largest blaze in California this year, spanned 544 square miles (1,409 square kilometers) as of Saturday.

Did Kamala Harris make ‘Simpsons’ video at Comic-Con? The real story behind the clip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-kamala-harris-make-simpsons-video-at-comic-con-the-real-story-behind-the-clip/articleshow/112073106.cms,"Treehouse of horror

Reports swirled on Sunday that Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise video appearance at Comic-Con during a "" Simpsons "" panel. According to these reports, 'Simpsons' creator Matt Groening introduced a clip featuring Harris, describing it as coming from a super fan.The video reportedly showed Harris quoting a popular "" Treehouse of Horror "" episode — the beloved ""Simpsons"" Halloween special — which centered around the 1996 presidential election between then-President Bill Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole.This sparked excitement and speculation among fans, with many believing that the video was a new creation, made specifically for Comic-Con.The clip generated buzz, as people began to say that 'The Simpsons' had once again predicted the future, referencing Harris' current political prominence and presidential ambitions.However, sources close to the show have clarified the truth behind the video. The clip, while authentic, is not a new production, as per the report by TMZ. It was recorded years ago and has resurfaced in light of the current political climate and Harris' ongoing campaign efforts. The video was not created specifically for this year's Comic-Con event.This revelation comes as Harris embarks on an extensive campaign blitz, particularly targeting Gen Z voters. Following her emergence as the presumptive Democratic nominee after Joe Biden, she has been utilizing various platforms to reach potential voters and solidify her position against Donald Trump.With just over 100 days left before the election, Harris is determined to connect with the electorate and showcase why she believes she is the right choice for the presidency. The resurfaced 'Simpsons' clip, while intriguing, is part of a broader narrative that intertwines pop culture with the unpredictable world of politics.So, while the clip shown at Comic-Con is indeed real, it is not a recent production meant for this year’s event. Instead, it’s a nostalgic piece that has found renewed relevance amid Harris' current political journey.","Reports swirled on Sunday that Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise video appearance at Comic-Con during a "" Simpsons "" panel.

Shift in campaign focus following Biden’s withdrawal

Dig at Harris’ name

'Kamala is Biden’s border czar'

Former President Donald Trump escalated his criticism of Kamala Harris on Saturday calling her a “bum” and accused her of failing in her role as Vice President. “She was a bum three weeks ago. She was a bum, a failed vice president ,” Trump said.In his first public appearance without an ear bandage since surviving an assassination attempt, Trump addressed a gathering at the Believers Summit in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he also portrayed Harris as a proponent of extreme left-wing policies and accused her of wanting to impose ""crazy San Francisco liberal values"" on the nation, citing her potential judicial appointments as a means to enforce these views nationwide.""Kamala Harris will appoint hundreds of extreme far-left judges to forcibly impose crazy San Francisco liberal values on Americans,"" Trump said.This speech marked Trump's second major campaign appearance since President Joe Biden's unexpected decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race earlier this week. The shift in the race dynamics led Trump to refocus his criticisms from Biden to Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee.The former president also declared Harris “worse than Joe Biden and, in a true sense, much more liberal.”Trump continued to take digs at President Biden, saying, ""Biden didn't want to do what he did. He said, 'I will never go out, I will never ever go out.' Two days later, 'I'm proud to go out.' Because the fascists threatened him with the 25th Amendment. They said we can do it the nice way or we can do it the hard way, Joe. That's what happened, I know. I know as many people on that side as I know on our side. But that's what happened. And now they are trying to make him a brave hero. 'He is so brave.'Trump also took aim at Biden’s recent speech regarding his decision to withdraw. ""The other night he made a speech. Look, I am not going to look into it, I am going to give people credit or no credit. It was horrible,"" Trump remarked, questioning the sincerity and quality of Biden’s address.The Republican presidential nominee also took jabs at Harris’ name, which he has been repeatedly accused of fumbling on purpose.“And by the way, there are numerous ways of saying her name. They were explaining to me, ‘You can say Comma-la, you can say Kah-mala,'” Trump said. He consistently uses the latter, which is incorrect.“I said, ‘Don’t worry about it. It doesn’t matter what I say,'” he continued. “I couldn’t care less if I mispronounce it.”Trump’s speech continued his campaign’s pattern of attacking Harris on immigration issues, despite her role not encompassing overall border policy. He described her as President Biden’s “border czar,” a designation not officially assigned but used by Republicans to criticize her handling of migration issues, reported the Washington Post.Trump's speech, aimed at a predominantly Christian audience, was notable for its direct assault on Harris's policies and beliefs. He claimed that Harris would expand the Supreme Court with “hard-core Marxists” to undermine the Constitution and religious freedoms. Trump's rhetoric also included controversial statements about abortion rights, accusing Harris of supporting extreme late-term abortions—a claim that is not supported by current laws or Harris’s actual policy positions.In addition to his abortion comments, Trump criticized Harris for her handling of immigration, broadly characterizing immigrants in a negative light and alleging without evidence that Harris and Democrats were encouraging illegal border crossings to increase voter rolls.Trump also took aim at Harris’s response to the Israel-Palestine conflict, accusing her of being “hostile to Americans of faith” and failing to support Israel adequately. He used his recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate to bolster his pro-Israel stance and further criticize Harris.James Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, condemned Trump's remarks as offensive and misleading. “Trump went on and on and on, and generally sounded like someone you wouldn’t want to sit near at a restaurant—let alone be president of the United States,” Singer said in a statement.",'Kamala is Biden’s border czar' 'She was a bum three weeks ago' 'I couldn’t care less if I mispronounce it’ 'She will appoint hundreds of extreme far-left judges to forcibly impose crazy San Francisco liberal values',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112058338,imgsize-3825983,width-400,resizemode-4/112058338.jpg"

A UAE court has jailed 57 Bangladeshi citizens to lengthy prison terms for protesting against the Sheikh Hasina government over the controversial quota decision .The Bangladeshi citizens were jailed as unauthorised protests are banned in the Gulf country.Commenting on the case, Amnesty International 's UAE researcher Devin Kenney said it was ""the second mass trial in the UAE this month, with dozens of people sentenced to huge prison terms literally overnight, on charges involving no element of violence"".In a statement to news agency AFP, Kenney said the UAE's ""extreme reaction to the mere existence of a public protest on Emirati soil shows that the state places great priority on suppressing any manifestation of dissent in the country.""Meanwhile, a Bangladeshi student leader on Monday called for a 48-hour halt to the protest against the quota decision, which embroiled the nation in deadly clashes resulting in the death of over 100 people.""We are suspending the shutdown protests for 48 hours,"" Nahid Islam, the top leader of the main protest organiser Students Against Discrimination, told news agency AFP. Nahid Islam demanded the government to ""withdraw the curfew, restore the internet and stop targeting thestudent protesters "" in the halt period.In what could be deciphered as a sign of ease, the halt comes a day after the Bangladesh Supreme Court scaled down the controversial quota decision of the Sheikh Hasina government that facilitated 30 per cent reservation in government jobs to descendants of 1971 war heroes, who fought for the Independent against Pakistani regime.As the situation appears to head towards normalcy, the Bangladesh police have arrested more than 500 people, including some opposition leaders, over days of clashes in the capital Dhaka.""At least 532 people have been arrested over the violence,"" Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Faruk Hossain.""They include some BNP leaders,"" he added, referring to the opposition Bangladesh National Party.After days of deadly violence, normalcy returned to Bangladesh on Wednesday as factories, offices, and banks reopened following the easing of a nationwide curfew enforced by the army.

However, social media platforms remained suspended in the wake of student-led protests that turned violent last week.Despite the easing of restrictions, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, a junior technology minister, informed reporters that ""For now, all social media will remain shut,"" indicating that the government is still cautious about the potential for further unrest.","UAE court jails 57 Bangladeshi citizens to lengthy prison terms for protesting against the Sheikh Hasina government over the controversial quota decision.

Kamala Harris Launches Her Campaign for President

Violation of platform policies

X's policy on misleading media

World’s richest man Elon Musk has stepped into one of the most contentious issues in US politics: deepfake videos. On Friday night, Musk, the owner of the social media platform X, reposted an edited campaign video of Vice President Kamala Harris that appears to have been digitally manipulated in a deceptive manner.The video mimics Harris’s voice, but instead of her original words from the campaign ad, it features her falsely stating that President Joe Biden is senile, that she does not “know the first thing about running the country,” and that she is the “ultimate diversity hire,” reported NYT.The clip was also edited to remove images of former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, replacing them with images of Biden. The original, unaltered ad, titled “We Choose Freedom,” was released by the Harris campaign on Thursday.The version posted on X lacks a disclaimer, although the account that initially uploaded it, @MrReaganUSA, labeled it as a “parody.” When Musk reposted the video eight hours later, he did not include any such disclosure, simply commenting, “This is amazing,” followed by a laughing emoji. The post has since been viewed 98 million times.The original, unaltered ad, which the Harris campaign released on Thursday, is titled “We Choose Freedom.”Musk’s repost appears to violate X’s policies, which prohibit sharing “synthetic, manipulated or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm.” Some observers were quick to call out the post. “This is a violation of @X’s policies on synthetic media & misleading identities,” Alex Howard, director of the Digital Democracy Project at the Demand Progress Education Fund, posted on the platform. “Are you going to retroactively change them to allow violations in an election year?”The Harris campaign issued a statement saying, “The American people want the real freedom, opportunity and security Vice President Harris is offering; not the fake, manipulated lies of Elon Musk and Donald Trump.”X’s policy on misleading media, instituted in April 2023 after Musk’s acquisition of the platform, defines such content as “significantly and deceptively altered, manipulated or fabricated” and “likely to result in widespread confusion on public issues.” The policy mandates that such content must be labeled or removed.","Elon Musk reposted an edited campaign video of Kamala Harris that appears to have been digitally manipulated in a deceptive manner.

'Gen Z feels the Kamalove': How Kamala Harris campaign gains youth traction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gen-z-feels-the-kamalove-how-kamala-harris-campaign-gains-youth-traction/articleshow/112073237.cms,"“ Brats for Harris .” “ We need a Kamalanomenon. ” “ Gen Z feels the Kamalove .”In the days since President Joe Biden exited the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, Gen Z voters have taken to social media to share coconut tree and ""brat summer"" memes, marking a significant shift in tone for a generation that has often felt overlooked by the Democratic Party.Youth-led progressive organizations have warned for months that Biden had a problem with young voters , urging the president to work more closely with them on key issues. With Biden out of the race, many young leaders are now hopeful that Harris can revive support among Gen Z and harness a new wave of enthusiasm.Since last Sunday, statements have poured out from youth-led organizations across the country, including in Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, California, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Leaders thanked Biden for stepping aside and celebrated the chance to rally around a new candidate. On Friday, a coalition of 17 youth-led groups endorsed Harris.“This changes everything,” said Zo Tobi, director of communication for the Movement Voter Project, a national progressive funding group focusing on youth-led organizations. “The world as it is suddenly shifted into the world as it could be,” Tobi was quoted as saying by AP.As the campaign enters a new phase, both Harris and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, are focusing on younger voters who could be crucial in some of the most contested states.Harris recorded a brief video message shown Saturday at a conference of Gen Z activists and elected officials in Atlanta.“We know young voters will be key, and we know your vote cannot be taken for granted,” Harris told the gathering, emphasizing her support for gun safety, abortion rights, LGBTQ rights, and climate action.Eve Levenson, the national youth engagement director for Harris’ campaign, attended the conference in Atlanta and praised young voters for their enthusiastic response to Harris’ elevation as the likely nominee.“As amazing as it is to see the tremendous youth enthusiasm online, what has been even more incredible is how that online energy has already translated into a tangible desire to take action and get involved with our campaign,” she said, noting new voter registrations, small donations from young voters, and student requests to help start campus-based campaign organizations.Trump, in his own address Friday in Florida to a conference on faith hosted by Turning Point USA, criticized Harris as “incompetent” and “far left.” He vowed to champion religious Americans' causes in a second White House term.“With your vote, I will defend religious liberty in all of its forms,” Trump told the conservative group that focuses on high school, college, and university campuses. ""I will protect Christians in our schools and our military and our government and our workplaces and our hospitals, in our public square, and I will also protect other religions.""John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, who has worked with Biden, said the “white-hot energy” among young people is something he hasn't seen since former President Barack Obama’s campaign. While there's little reliable polling so far, he described the dynamic as “a combination of the hopefulness we saw with Obama and the urgency and fight we saw after the Parkland shooting.”For many young people, it was the first time they felt heard and believed their actions could impact politics, he and several young leaders said.“It’s reset this election in profound ways,"" he said. ""People, especially young people, for so long, for so many important reasons, have been despondent about politics, despondent about the direction of the country. It’s weighed on them. And then they wake up the next morning, and it seems like everything’s changed.”About 6 in 10 adults under 30 voted for Biden in 2020, according to AP VoteCast, but his ratings with the group have dipped substantially since then, with only about a quarter saying they had a favorable opinion of him in the most recent AP-NORC poll conducted before Biden withdrew from the race.That poll, along with polls from The New York Times/Siena and CNN conducted after Biden dropped out, suggests Harris starts off with somewhat better favorable ratings than Biden among young adults.Sunjay Muralitharan, vice president of College Democrats of America, said it felt like a weight was lifted off his chest when Harris entered the race.Despite monthly coalition calls between youth-led groups and the Biden campaign, Muralitharan spent months worrying about how Biden would fare among young voters as he watched young people leave organizations like the College Democrats and Young Democrats to join more leftist groups.College Democrats issued statements and social media posts encouraging the party to prioritize young people and change course on the war in Gaza. They worked tirelessly to get College Dems programming at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago later this summer, but received limited outreach in return, Muralitharan said.A Harris campaign represents an opportunity to move in a new direction, he said. The vice president has shown her vocal support for issues important to young voters such as climate change and reproductive rights, and she may be able to change course from Biden's approach to the war in Gaza.“The perpetual roadblock we’ve run into is that Biden is the lesser of two evils and his impact on the crisis in Gaza,"" he said. ""For months, we’ve been given this broken script that’s made it difficult for us to organize young voters. But that changes now.”Santiago Mayer, executive director of the Gen Z voter engagement organization Voters of Tomorrow, said the Biden campaign “created an entirely new framework for operating with youth organizations” that can now be transitioned into supporting Harris' campaign.“Gen Z loves VP Harris, and VP Harris loves Gen Z,"" he said. ""So we’re ready to get to work for her.”","Youth-led progressive organizations have warned for months that Biden had a problem with young voters. With Biden out of the race, many young leaders are now hopeful that Kamala Harris can revive support among Gen Z. Since last Sunday, statements have poured out from youth-led organizations across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112073284,imgsize-36108,width-400,resizemode-4/112073284.jpg"

But this is a people-powered campaign, and we have momentum,” she told the crowd at the event, which her campaign announced would net $1.4 million.""Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record. And some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it's just plain weird,"" she added.As Trump addressed a Bitcoin conference in Tennessee, Harris was at a fundraising event in Massachusetts with celebrity guests including singer-songwriter James Taylor and cellist Yo-Yo Ma.The Harris campaign has adopted ""weird"" as a new catch-all for describing Trump's aggressive rhetoric. His attacks include false allegations that Harris wants to legalize killing newborn babies, stemming from her fervent support of abortion rights. Harris has made her advocacy on this issue central to her campaign against Trump, whose conservative nominees to the Supreme Court helped overturn the national right to the procedure in 2022.The former California prosecutor also challenged Trump to a debate after his campaign announced this week he would not agree to keep a September 10 televised face-off previously scheduled with Biden.""I hope he reconsiders because we have a lot to talk about,"" she said.Trump, 78, is now the oldest major-party nominee in history and is scrambling to reorient an election against someone two decades his junior, having expected to face an 81-year-old incumbent Joe Biden beset by concerns over infirmity.On Saturday, he made his pitch to the cryptocurrency industry, one he previously called a ""scam."" Saying China or others could seize the reins on the fast-growing field, Trump's appeal is welcomed by crypto enthusiasts who feel they have been treated harshly by the Biden administration.""This is the steel industry of 100 years ago,"" Trump told the bitcoin conference. ""I think you're just in your infancy.""""If crypto is going to define the future I want (it) to be mined, minted and made in the USA,"" he said to cheers, calling for the United States to be ""the crypto capital of the planet.""Trump also vowed a return to outdoor rallies two weeks after being wounded in an attempted assassination at a campaign event in Pennsylvania.""I will continue to do outdoor rallies, and the Secret Service has agreed to substantially step up their operation. They are very capable of doing so,"" Trump said on his Truth Social platform.""No one can ever be allowed to stop or impede free speech or gathering,"" he added.Trump has made the shooting a key part of his campaign pitch, telling supporters he ""took a bullet for democracy."" He and running mate JD Vance will hold a rally later Saturday night at an indoor hockey arena in the midwestern US state of Minnesota.Harris, seeking to become the first female president in US history, is tasked with rapidly assembling a campaign against an opponent who has been in near permanent reelection mode since he became president in 2016.Her late-starting White House bid has enjoyed early momentum. Polls that had shown Biden steadily slipping against Trump now show Harris in a race too close to call. She's garnered support from Democratic heavyweights, including Biden himself and most recently Barack and Michelle Obama.Torianna Parrish, 34, was among the crowd greeting Harris upon her arrival Saturday afternoon at the airport in Westfield, Massachusetts.""I wanted to show there's power in numbers. I wanted to show my support,"" she said. ""We're rooting for her, and we want to see her make this country what it needs to be.""Harris was introduced at the Colonial Theater in Pittsfield by Taylor, who said: ""Let us honor the woman and the moment, and may our ardent support be the wind in her sails. Our hopes go with her, and she stands for us all.""","US Vice President Kamala Harris says her campaign is the ""underdogs"" in the November election.

'Trump just a bad man'

JD Vance reacts to leaked mails

JD Vance , Donald Trump's running mate in the upcoming election, was once a Trump hater and Vance's campaign has not tried to put a fig-leaf onto it. They said Vance's opinion about Trump evolved over the ages. Now an old friend of Vance, Sofia Nelson, who identifies himself as a transgender, has leaked his old private mail exchanges with Vance -- to the New York Times hoping that voters would be now well informed about Mr Vance -- who already is at the center of a major controversy for his past remark on 'childless cat ladies'.Sofia and Vance went to Yale Law School together and kept in touch until 2021 when Vance said he supported an Arkansas ban on gender-affirming care for minors.The NYT published several excepts from those mails showing that Vance was a different person at that time.In a 2015, JD Vance wrote he was outraged by Donald Trump's rhetoric. ""...and I worry most of all about how welcome Muslim citizens feel in their own country. But I also think that people have always believed crazy s***. And there may have always been demagogues willing to exploit the people who believe crazy s*** ""In his book Hillbilly Elegy, Vance mistakenly referred to Nelson as lesbian instead of transgender and apologized for it. That did not break their friendship though.In another email, JD Vance wrote Trump is ""just a bad man. A morally reprehensible human being"".The revelations came amid reports that Trump may change his running mate in the wake of several controversies. It was also reported Saturday that Vance's wife Usha used to be ""appalled"" by Trump.The New York Times reached out to JD Vance's campaign for a comment on the leaked mail exchanged. His spokesperson said the senator wishes Sofia, who leaked the mails, very best.""Senator Vance values his friendships with individuals across the political spectrum. He has been open about the fact that some of his views from a decade ago began to change after becoming a dad and starting a family, and he has thoroughly explained why he changed his mind on President Trump. Despite their disagreements, Senator Vance cares for Sofia and wishes Sofia the very best,"" the statement said,","JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate in the upcoming election, was once a Trump hater.

Video game actors go on strike over AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/video-game-actors-go-on-strike-over-ai/articleshow/112071165.cms,"SAN DIEGO: Artificial intelligence was key to last year's Hollywood strikes, and it has now sparked a second walkout by those actors who work in a far larger industry, at the heart of advancing technology - video games.The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) on Friday began its second strike in nine months, this time against gaming giants that dominate an industry which grosses well over $100 billion each year.And while many demands are the same - consent and compensation for actors, whose voices and movements are used by AI to build game characters - the latest talks are posing unique challenges, union negotiators told AFP.Technology companies, by their nature, tend to view actors simply ""as data,"" said Ray Rodriguez, lead negotiator for the video game contract. ""The fact that they see themselves as technology companies"" is directly connected to ""their unwillingness to perceive the performance value,"" he said. The work stoppage began immediately after midnight Friday.It concerns some 2,600 artistes who provide voice dubbing services for video games, or whose physical movements are recorded in order to animate computer-generated characters. The strike followed more than a year and a half of fruitless negotiations between the union and the likes of Activision, Disney, Electronic Arts and Warner Bros Games. Talks have been sporadic, as video game companies have not appointed dedicated full-time negotiators, and are ""absolutely obsessed with secrecy,"" said Rodriguez.There are other complicating factors. Video game characters often fuse multiple human performers - for example, one person may voice a hero whose movements are motion-captured by another actor. It's ""a really joyful, cool"" way to collaborate, said Sarah Elmaleh, chair of the union's negotiating committee. But video game companies have tried to exploit that ambiguity to create ""loopholes"" in their counteroffers, she warned. This is because video game companies can use AI not just to replicate a specific actor, but to create ""new"" voices or body movements from a composite of human performers. Such use of generative AI can make it far harder for actors to trace their work, and therefore to deny consent or get paid.Voice actor Lindsay Rousseau does ancillary characters, non-player characters that give you side quests, characters that you fight and die, and creature voices. And ""that's the first work that's going to go away,"" she says.","The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) on Friday began its second strike in nine months.

Why artificial intelligence often struggles with math,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-artificial-intelligence-often-struggles-with-math/articleshow/112071126.cms,"In the school year that ended recently, one class of learners stood out as a seeming puzzle. They are hardworking, improving and remarkably articulate. But curiously, these learners - artificially intelligent chatbots - often struggle with math .Chatbots such as Open AI's ChatGPT can write poetry, summarize books and answer questions, often with human-level fluency.These systems can do math, based on what they have learned, but the results can vary and be wrong. They are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not doing rules-based calculations. Likelihood is not accuracy, and language is more flexible, and forgiving, than math.""The AI chatbots have difficulty with math because they were never designed to do it,"" said Kristian Hammond, a computer science professor and AI researcher at Northwestern University. The world's smartest computer scientists, it seems, have created AI that is more liberal arts major than numbers whiz.That, on the face of it, is a sharp break with computing's past. Since the early computers appeared in the 1940s, a good summary definition of computing has been ""math on steroids."" They have been tireless, fast, accurate calculating machines. Yet, all past efforts at AI did hit a wall.Then, over a decade ago, a different approach began to deliver striking gains. The underlying technology, called a neural network , loosely modelled on the human brain began generating language, based on all the information it has absorbed, by predicting what word or phrase is most likely to come next - much as humans do. But at times, AI chatbots have stumbled with simple arithmetic and math word problems that require multiple steps to reach a solution, something recently documented by some technology reviewers. The AI's proficiency is getting better, but it remains a shortcoming.Speaking at a recent symposium, Kristen DiCerbo, chief learning officer of Khan Academy, an education nonprofit that is experimenting with an AI chatbot tutor and teaching assistant, introduced the subject of math accuracy . ""It is a problem, as many of you know,"" DiCerbo told the educators. A few months ago, Khan Academy made a significant change to its AI-powered tutor, called Khanmigo. It sends many numerical problems to a calculator program instead of asking the AI to solve the math. While waiting for the calculator program to finish, students see the words ""doing math"" on their screens and a Khanmigo icon bobbing its head. ""We're actually using tools that are meant to do math,"" said DiCerbo, who remains optimistic that conversational chatbots will play an important role in education.For more than a year, ChatGPT has used a similar workaround for some math problems. For tasks such as large-number division and multiplication, the chatbot summons help from a calculator program. Math is an ""important ongoing area of research,"" OpenAI said in a statement, and a field where its scientists have made steady progress. Its new version of GPT achieved nearly 64% accuracy on a public database of thousands of problems requiring visual perception and mathematical reasoning, the company said. That is up from 58% for the previous version.The technology's erratic performance in math adds grist to a spirited debate in the AI community about the best way forward in the field. Broadly, there are two camps. On one side are those who believe that the advanced neural networks, known as large language models , that power AI chatbots are almost a singular path to steady progress and eventually to artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a computer that can do anything the human brain can do. That is the dominant view in much of Silicon Valley.But there are skeptics who question if adding more data and computing power to the large language models is enough. Prominent among them is Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta. The large language models, LeCun has said, have little grasp of logic and lack common-sense reasoning. What's needed, he insists, is a broader approach, which he calls ""world modelling,"" or systems that can learn how the world works much as humans do. And it may take a decade or so to achieve.","Chatbots such as Open AI's ChatGPT can write poetry, summarize books and answer questions.

The party later changed its plan and announced holding a sit-in at three places, including Murree Road and Chungi No 22 in Rawalpindi and H-8 Bridge Islamabad.JI chief Hafiz Naeem addressed the participants camping on the Murree Road, the main artery of the garrison city connecting it with Islamabad, and vowed to continue the sit-in till the demands were accepted.""Our demands are simple and we want the government to give relief to the masses,"" he said, adding that the party was aware of difficulties but was sure that the issue of power tariffs could be addressed.He said the protest would continue until its key demands were met, elaborating that renegotiations be held with the Independent Power Producers (IPPs), a group of power companies considered the main cause of the exorbitant rise in the electricity bills.Naeem also expressed willingness to talk with the government if the latter showed seriousness in addressing the issues highlighted by the JI. He said the government should first set up the committee for talks.He also announced to address a big gathering on Murree Road on Sunday evening and asked people from every walk of life to attend as his party has been fighting for their rights.The JI is one of the oldest parties in the country and is also known for holding big protests.

He criticised the federal government for its perceived failure to maintain law and order , attributing the rising lawlessness to this inadequacy.""The federal government's failure to maintain law and order has led to widespread lawlessness,"" Afridi asserted. He further voiced concerns over the severe inflation rates, exorbitant electricity bills, and the high cost of petroleum and essential goods. According to him, these issues have rendered life increasingly difficult for the populace.Afridi also accused the federal government of lacking effective solutions to these pressing issues, suggesting that it does not possess the people's mandate. He contended that the PTI was the rightful winner of the February general elections, but claimed that the PML-N and its allies had unlawfully seized power through manipulated election results.""[Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif's government has been imposed through Form-47 rather than the people's mandate specified in Form-45,"" Afridi said. He also called for enhanced security for PTI leader Murad Saeed, who has been in hiding since the violent protests on May 9.Afridi emphasised that the nationwide protests organised by the PTI were a clear demonstration of public dissatisfaction with the federal government. He insisted that only Imran Khan's party could effectively address the issues of inflation and law and order in the country.In Peshawar, PTI Peshawar President MNA Sher Ali Arbab led a vehicular procession in the Gulshanabad area. The procession was marked by the display of party flags and pictures of Imran Khan on vehicles, with participants chanting slogans demanding the immediate release of the detained leaders.Similarly, in the Bajaur tribal district, PTI supporters held rallies to press for the release of Imran Khan, his wife, and other leaders.

They claimed that the leaders were wrongfully implicated in false cases. The speakers criticised the federal government for imposing heavy taxes, which they alleged were enforced under the pressure of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in exchange for loans.The government's anti-people policies were also a focal point of criticism, with the speakers accusing it of failing to address the public's plight amid record inflation. They demanded the early release of Imran Khan, his wife, and other leaders and called for adherence to the Constitution and legal frameworks.In Charsadda district, Provincial Labour Minister Fazal Shakoor Khan, along with MPAs Arshed Umerai and Iftikhar Khan, spearheaded a protest at Farooq Azam Chowk, where PTI activists and supporters turned out in large numbers.In Topi, Swabi district, PTI central leader and former National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser addressed a rally, urging the government to immediately free Imran Khan and his wife, alleviate the public from soaring inflation, and improve law and order, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Reacting to the viral news, Imran Khan's aide Sayed Z Bukhari said the decision has not been taken whether Imran Khan would contest but there are consultations going on.""No decision has been made about Imran Khan running for Chancellor of Oxford University , however we have a series of consultations regarding it today and will be decided in the next 24-48hrs,"" Bukhari posted.According to the UK Telegraph, the elections for the chancellor post will be held online for the first time. Generally, the post goes to graduates of the university, mostly politicians.Imran Khan graduated from Oxford in 1972, studied economics and politics at Keble College and also captained the cricket team of the university. In 2005, Imran Khan became the chancellor of Bradford University and hence if he becomes the Oxford chancellor, it will not be his first such role.Reports said Imran Khan's team cited public demand that he should contest but it will be a tough one as Boris Johnson, Tony Blair -- the former UK PMs -- are also in the race.The news came as Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf faces crisis in the country with the present government planning to ban the party.

This camp will continue till the release of the PTI founder,"" he said.Khan has been imprisoned at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi for almost a year upon his conviction in three cases - the Toshakhana corruption case, the cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case -- in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.Though Khan had secured bail or his conviction was set aside, he has not been released.Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been kept in jail in various cases.Gohar also said that the party's reservations regarding ""illegal and unconstitutional actions"" had been conveyed to National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and the party decided to raise voice for the PTI lawmakers and their families who were being picked up.He also strongly condemned the sealing of the party's secretariat in the federal capital.Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that the major demand was to set Khan and his wife free.""Our first demand is to release the PTI founder, his wife Bushra Bibi and other detainees, including Raoof Hasan and party workers,"" he said.He also demanded the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led coalition government to immediately resign over ""bad governance and mismanaging the economy"".The strike came as authorities were gradually increasing pressure on the PTI, which continued to target the establishment and the government. Despite dozens of cases against Khan, he has refused to soften his tone and instead routinely criticise the Army leadership.PTI leaders have also kept up the pressure on the government by calling it illegal which allegedly came to power through fraudulent elections.","Pakistani authorities sealed the central office of Imran Khan's party here over violation of safety standards.

"Imran Khan's house used as 'terrorist training hub', claims Maryam Nawaz",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khans-house-used-as-terrorist-training-hub-claims-maryam-nawaz/articleshow/111965676.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jailed ex-Pakitan PM Imran Khan 's house in Lahore was used as a "" training hub for terrorists "", claimed Punjab province CM Maryam Nawaz on Tuesday.She said terrorists used Khan's house to make petrol bombs and planned attacks on the state.Maryam Nawaz, the daughter of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , has accused Imran Khan, the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), of orchestrating attacks on government buildings and military installations during the May 9, 2023 riots.She alleged that Khan feigned leg injuries for four months while planning these attacks.According to The Express Tribune, Maryam condemned the PTI as a group focused on creating chaos and damaging the state. She claimed that Khan's residence in Lahore, Zaman Park, had become a ""training hub for terrorists "", where petrol bombs were made and attacks on the state were planned.The May 9 riots erupted across Pakistan after Khan was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a corruption case. Hundreds of PTI workers and senior leaders were arrested for their involvement in the violence and attacks on military installations, including the Jinnah House, ISI building in Faisalabad, and General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi.Maryam also accused the PTI of conspiring to default the country, writing letters to the International Monetary Fund, waving cipher messages, and disrespecting memorials as part of a larger plot. She called for strict action against the PTI under the Constitution and law, citing national security and interests.The chief minister further criticized the PTI for alienating friendly countries, making baseless accusations against the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and disrupting Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit in 2014 by staging a sit-in. She recounted PTI's previous attacks on Parliament, PTV, and the Prime Minister's house, and accused them of violence against police officers and desecrating the Supreme Court's walls.In March, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Ataullah Tarar said that a handful of ""miscreants"" associated with the PTI were bent upon sabotaging Pakistan's deal with the IMF, which he said was crucial for economic stability.He said that at the protest, activists belonging to PTI were urging the IMF to give funds to Pakistan only if their jailed leader was released, regretting that activists of an ""anti-national"" party continued to hold sit-ins and protests outside the IMF offices. He said the protesters only wanted to sabotage the IMF deal because their dream was to make Pakistan default.","Maryam Nawaz, the daughter of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, has accused Imran Khan of orchestrating attacks on government buildings and military installations.

"Anti-terrorism efforts being made controversial by illegal, political mafias, says Pak army",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terrorism-efforts-being-made-controversial-by-illegal-political-mafias-says-pak-army/articleshow/111937180.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan armyaccused its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts , including a new military operation, to the detriment of the country’s national interests following the arrest on Monday of Raoof Hasan, information secretary of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), headed by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan. The army said the party information secretary was in charge of PTI ’s digital media cell which, it alleged, was involved in running anti-state propaganda.Last month PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved a military offensive to counter aspikein terrorist attacks across Pakistan, particularly in volatile northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, but the idea was widely criticised by opposition parties, particularly PTI and the rights group Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). They termed it a ploy against Pashtuns to earn dollars from major powers and exploit their resources.Addressing a presser in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, asked, “Why did a mafia, a political mafia , and an illegal mafia say that they would not let this campaign (OperationAzm-e-Istehkam, or Resolve for Stability) happen?” He added that opponents of the offensive had tried to make it “controversial” and paint it as a purely military operation in which thousands of people would be displaced.He did not name any party or group butcalled the army’s critics “politicalandillegal mafias”,an apparent reference to PTI and PTM.Lt Gen Chaudhry said they were using “fake news and propaganda” to spread lies about the army and its intentions.“This is digital terrorism,” he said. “The physical terrorist also attacks law enforcement agencies and the army, and the digital terrorist also attacks the army. They are doing the same thing.”“Digital terrorists”, the spokesman said, would be deterred through laws, regulation and monitoring.He, however, questioned the lack of action against such individuals despite their activities against the leadership of the state and other institutions. “Instead of the courts and regulations moving forward against them, they’re given further space and they’re made heroes in the name of freedom of expression,” he said.Ahead of Sharif’s press conference, security forces had raided PTI’s offices and arrested Raoof Hasan from the party’s central secretariat. The raid came a week after the govt had said it planned to ban the party.“The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,” Islamabad police said, adding that those directly involved in anti-national propaganda were arrested and all evidence from PTI’s digital media cell wasconfiscated.The party issued a statement on X, saying: “It’s absolutely shameful how Islamabad police continues to completely mock and disregard every law in this country. Law of the jungle is reigning over Pakistan!”The crackdown on PTI follows several court rulings in its favour this month that threaten PM Sharif’s govt, which came to power in Feb this year with the military’s backing.","Pakistan army accuses its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts.

The Pakistan army on Monday accused an "" illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation, codenamed "" Azm-i-Istehkam "" (Resolve for Stability), against rising terrorism in the country.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif, in a press conference in Rawalpindi, stated that a ""massive, illegal political mafia"" has risen to undermine the operation due to ""vested interests"".Sharif clarified that Azm-i-Istehkam is not just a military operation but a comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign launched through national consensus to reinvigorate the already in-place National Action Plan (NAP).He stressed that the purpose of the operation is to eliminate terrorism, which will eventually lead to ""societal and national uplift"".However, the DG ISPR accused a ""very strong lobby"" of having a vested interest in sabotaging the operation, as it does not want the NAP to succeed.He alleged that this entity is receiving a lot of money to subvert the operation.""The stakes in [sabotaging] this operation are very high, and it's not based on any ideology but involves a lot of money,"" he said.Lt Gen Sharif stated that the ""illegal political mafia"" made the first move to make the operations controversial through false and fake arguments.He pointed out that the problem lies in the implementation of the NAP's other points, such as the regularisation and registration of religious seminaries, where only a bit over 16,000 out of about 32,000 seminaries have been registered so far. He questioned whether the army should be responsible for these tasks.The DG ISPR also mentioned the issue of the ""illegal spectrum"", which hides a major illegal economy through which the criminal system and terrorism operate. He said the requirement of the illegal spectrum is a ""soft state"" and the solution to it is the National Action Plan.While the DG ISPR's statements highlight the challenges faced by the government in implementing its counter-terrorism strategy, it is essential to note that the army's involvement in political matters can be a sensitive issue.The military has historically played a significant role in the country's politics, and its direct intervention in political affairs has often been a subject of controversy.It remains to be seen whether the army will take a more active role in the country's affairs in response to the alleged sabotage of the counter-terrorism campaign by the ""illegal political mafia"".","Pakistan army accuses an ""illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation.
