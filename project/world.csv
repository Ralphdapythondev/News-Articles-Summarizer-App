US President Joe Biden on Thursday reaffirmed his commitment to Israel's security ""against all threats from Iran,"" during a phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , the White House said, after the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.A statement released by the White House said: ""Together with this commitment to Israel's defence, the president stressed the importance of ongoing efforts to de-escalate broader tensions in the region.Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris also joined the call.""""The president reaffirmed his commitment to Israel's security against all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis,"" the White House said in a readout.""The president discussed efforts to support Israel's defense against threats, including against ballistic missiles and drones, to include new defensive US military deployments,"" it added.The recent call between leaders came after Israel's announcement of eliminating Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.Netanyahu's government has not commented on the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, but the Palestinian militant group has blamed Israel, whereas Hamas, Hezbollah, and Yemen's Huthi rebels all receive backing from Iran.Israel conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip began on October 7, during the Hamas attack, militants also seized 251 people, of which 111 are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.Since then, Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed 39,480 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.","US President Joe Biden on Thursday reaffirmed his commitment to Israel's security ""against all threats from Iran"" Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris also joined the call.

Olympic gender debate: Trump condemns trans inclusion as Harris campaign stays silent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/olympic-gender-debate-trump-condemns-trans-inclusion-as-harris-campaign-stays-silent/articleshow/112210733.cms,"As the 2024 Olympic Games stir debate on various fronts, a new controversy has emerged involving transgender athletes, igniting a fierce political and public debate in the US. The White House and Kamala Harris' campaign have remained silent on whether they support the inclusion of biologically male, intersex, or transgender athletes competing against biological females.The Trump campaign seized on the controversy, launching a robust critique of the current administration's policies. “President Trump has been unequivocally clear that he will NOT stand for men competing in women’s sports – an insane and unfair reality that has been allowed to transpire because of Radical Left politicians like Kamala Harris,” a Trump campaign spokesperson said as quoted by the Fox News. “When he returns to the White House, President Trump will take immediate action to protect women and girls and overturn the Harris-Biden Administration's radical rewrite of Title IX.”The debate intensified following the disqualification of Algerian boxer Imane Khelif from the 2023 World Boxing Championships. The International Boxing Association (IBA) ruled that Khelif, who is listed as female on her passport, failed gender tests, showing elevated testosterone levels. The decision followed a controversial match where Khelif's opponent, Italian boxer Angela Carini, withdrew just 46 seconds in due to the impact of Khelif’s punch.Carini expressed her frustration, saying, “I didn’t give up, but one punch hurt too much, and so I said enough. I’m going out with my head held high.”IBA President Umar Kremlev explained the disqualification, citing DNA tests that revealed XY chromosomes in some athletes, leading to their exclusion from the competition. This move has sparked a broader debate over gender eligibility in sports.The Algerian Olympic Committee (COA) defended Khelif, condemning what it called “unethical targeting and maligning” of the athlete. The COA called for an end to “baseless propaganda” and emphasized its commitment to protecting Khelif’s dignity and career.Italian sports minister Andrea Abodi echoed concerns about fairness in competition, noting the lack of uniform international criteria for gender eligibility. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also weighed in, stating, “I think that athletes who have male genetic characteristics should not be admitted to women’s competitions… to protect the right of female athletes to be able to compete on equal terms.”The controversy is set against a backdrop of additional criticism faced by the Olympics, including backlash from Christian groups over the opening ceremonies, which featured skits deemed offensive by some.If elected, Kamala Harris is expected to advance the Biden administration's efforts to expand Title IX protections to include gender identity and sexual orientation, a move LGBTQ+ activists have supported as necessary to prevent discrimination. This rule took effect on August 1, adding to the ongoing debate over the role of gender in sports and beyond.","The Trump campaign seized on the controversy, launching a robust critique of the current administration's policies.

North Korea will eye nuclear talks with US if Trump becomes president: Ex-diplomat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-will-eye-nuclear-talks-with-us-if-trump-becomes-president-ex-diplomat/articleshow/112210538.cms,"How will North Korea’s ties help?

Who is Ri Il Gyu?

Ri Il Gyu, a high-ranking North Korean diplomat who recently defected to South Korea, revealed in an interview with Reuters that North Korea is interested in reopening nuclear talks with the United States if Donald Trump wins re-election as president. The country is currently developing a new negotiation strategy to achieve this goal.According to Ri, North Korea has prioritized Russia, the US and Japan as its top foreign policy targets for the coming years.While strengthening ties with Russia, Pyongyang aims to resume nuclear negotiations if Trump returns to office, with the objective of lifting sanctions on its weapons programs, removing its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and securing economic aid .The diplomat believes that the foreign ministry will take charge of the negotiations this time, making it more difficult for Trump to restrict North Korea's actions without offering concessions.Ri also discussed the benefits of North Korea's closer ties with Russia, which include assistance with missile technology and the economy, as well as the potential to block additional sanctions and undermine existing ones.He noted that ""the Russians got their own hands dirty by engaging in illicit transactions and, thanks to that, North Korea no longer needs to rely on the US to lift sanctions, which essentially means they stripped the US of one key bargaining chip.""Ri suggested that Kim Jong Un would be open to holding a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, aiming to secure economic assistance in exchange for concessions on the issue of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 80s. Further added that Kim would be willing to change the country's position on the abductee issue, established under his father Kim Jong Il, to obtain economic support from Japan.Ri, who studied at a French school in Algeria and lived in Cuba alongside his late father, a state media reporter, had long dreamed of a life in South Korea. However, it was not until he faced bullying from a colleague and was denied medical treatment in Mexico that he decided to defect.The Covid-19 lockdown further exacerbated hardships at home and for those stationed abroad, with most telephone lines to Pyongyang cut to prevent information from spreading to the outside world.Ri also shared his experience in trying to hinder the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Korea and Cuba, a long-time ally of North Korea.Despite his efforts, he acknowledged that ""establishing relations with Cuba was the best thing South Korea had done since last year,"" and that it served as ""a model example of how the tides of history have turned, and where a normal civilisation of the international community is headed.""","Ri Il Gyu, a high-ranking North Korean diplomat who recently defected to South Korea, revealed in an interview with Reuters that North Korea is interested in reopening nuclear talks with the United States.

"JD Vance’s ‘childless cat ladies’ remark: Are societal pressures, not 'selfishness,' behind America's fertility decline?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vances-childless-cat-ladies-remark-are-societal-pressures-not-selfishness-behind-americas-fertility-decline/articleshow/112210337.cms,"For years, some conservative voices have framed the declining fertility rate in the United States as a moral crisis and a sign of eroding family values . High-profile figures like Sen JD Vance and Fox News commentator Ashley St. Clair have criticized childless Americans, suggesting that they prioritize personal pleasure over family life.In 2021, Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, disparaged what he called ""childless cat ladies"" and criticized their supposed disdain for traditional family values.Last year, St. Clair echoed this sentiment, condemning those without children for seeking self-indulgence instead of pursuing family life.However, experts argue that the reality behind declining fertility rates is far more complex and rooted in societal and economic challenges rather than individual choice. Researchers point out that declining fertility is a global trend, not unique to the US, and reflects broader issues such as the rising costs of child care, housing, and economic uncertainty.""I don’t see it as a lack of commitment to family,"" said Mary Brinton, a sociologist at Harvard University, as quoted by NYT. ""The issues are very much on the societal level and the policy level.""The US fertility rate has been on a downward trend since the end of the baby boom in the mid-1960s, with a more pronounced decline following the Great Recession of 2008. Kenneth Johnson, a demographer at the University of New Hampshire, noted that many anticipated a temporary delay in childbearing due to the economic downturn, but this rebound never materialized.In 2022, the total fertility rate dropped to a historic low of 1,616.5 births per 1,000 women, significantly below the replacement level of 2,100 births needed to maintain population size. The Pew Research Center's recent survey highlights that an increasing number of adults are unlikely to have children, a trend that predates the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, nearly half of US counties reported more deaths than births last year.Experts point to several factors contributing to this decline. The average age of marriage and first childbirth has risen substantially, with the median age for first marriages at 28 and the average age for first births at 27. Financial barriers, such as high housing costs and student debt, along with inadequate support for working families, are significant obstacles.Sarah Hayford, director of the Institute for Population Research at Ohio State University, found that many young adults still desire children but face economic and practical barriers that prevent them from achieving this goal. The rising costs of mortgages and child care, coupled with a lack of supportive policies like paid parental leave, exacerbate these difficulties.Sociologist Karen Benjamin Guzzo of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill believes that a lack of optimism about the future also plays a role. “The decision to have children is the ultimate vote of confidence in the future,” Guzzo said. “When fertility rates are down, it’s because people don’t feel they have a future they’re confident in.”Efforts to reverse the trend have included proposals like former President Donald Trump's ""baby bonus"" and Sen. JD Vance's suggestions for tax breaks and altered voting systems to incentivize parenthood. However, experts note that there is little evidence that such policies are effective on their own. Instead, addressing broader societal issues such as affordable housing, student loan debt, and parental leave may be more effective in encouraging higher birth rates.“In our view, every policy is a family policy,” Guzzo said, emphasizing the need for comprehensive changes to support prospective parents and families.","The US fertility rate has been on a downward trend since the end of the baby boom in the mid-1960s.

"Louisiana Laws: Louisiana's new laws: Surgical castration, 'don't say gay', absentee ballot restrictions, and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/louisianas-new-laws-surgical-castration-dont-say-gay-absentee-ballot-restrictions-and-more/articleshow/112210198.cms,"Surgical castration as punishment

Restrictions on

absentee ballots

Previously Vetoed Anti-LGBTQ Measures

Police 'buffer-zone'

Concealed carry of firearms

A series of new laws in Louisiana , including a groundbreaking measure that allows judges to impose surgical castration on offenders convicted of certain sex crimes against children, took effect on Thursday. These laws reflect a shift towards conservative policies under the new Republican governor Jeff Landry and a GOP supermajority in the state legislature, according to AP.Louisiana has joined a few other states such as California, Florida, and Texas, which have allowed chemical castration for over 15 years.However, it is now the first state to permit judges to sentence offenders to surgical castration for specific aggravated sex crimes against children under 13. This punishment is discretionary and not automatic.Chemical castration uses medications to reduce testosterone production and decrease sex drive, while surgical castration involves the removal of testicles or ovaries, a far more invasive procedure. This method is used in countries known for severe criminal sanctions, like the Czech Republic and Nigeria. Supporters of the law, including Democratic senator Regina Barrow who authored it, hope it will deter crimes against children. However, opponents argue it is a form of cruel and unusual punishment.Louisiana currently has 2,224 inmates serving sentences for such crimes, but the new law applies only to those convicted after August 1.New restrictions on absentee ballots have been introduced in Louisiana, a state where mail-in voting has gained popularity. The new legislation limits how many times a person can assist with filling out, signing as a witness, and delivering absentee ballots. Additionally, it makes it easier for officials to reject absentee ballots missing certain details.Supporters, including the state’s top election official, believe these measures will protect election integrity. Critics argue the laws could create additional hurdles for voters, particularly elderly residents who rely on help from family, neighbours, or caretakers during elections.Under the new administration of governor Jeff Landry, previously vetoed bills targeting transgender youth have become law. One new law prohibits teachers from discussing gender identity and sexual orientation in schools, a policy critics refer to as “don’t say gay.” It also bans covering these topics during any extracurricular activities under school jurisdiction.A new law now imposes penalties on anyone who knowingly approaches within 25 feet (7.6 meters) of a police officer performing their official duties, after being ordered to stop or retreat. Violators can face up to a $500 fine, up to 60 days in jail, or both.Critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, argue that the law could impede the public’s ability to film police and infringe on First Amendment rights . Proponents believe the law will create a buffer zone ensuring officer safety, while still allowing bystanders to film police interactions from a reasonable distance.A Republican-drafted law allowing individuals aged 18 and older to carry a concealed weapon without a permit went into effect across Louisiana on July 4. However, in New Orleans, this legislation became effective on Thursday when a more restrictive city ordinance expired.“The city is no longer allowed to have stricter laws than the state regarding permitless concealed carrying of a firearm ,” said Reese Harper, communications director for the New Orleans police department, as per AP.Supporters argue that expanding gun rights strengthens the constitutional right to carry firearms. Opponents fear that the lack of required training for carrying a concealed weapon could lead to increased gun violence. According to the National Council of State Legislatures, Louisiana is now the 28th state to implement such legislation.","Louisiana is the first state to permit judges to sentence offenders to surgical castration for specific aggravated sex crimes against children under 13.

US & Russia complete biggest prisoner swap since Cold War,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-russia-complete-biggest-prisoner-swap-since-cold-war/articleshow/112210269.cms,"A prisoner swap on Thursday involving seven countries freed the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and two other Americans held in Russia, along with several jailed Russian opposition figures, the White House said, in the most far-reaching exchange between Russia and the West in decades.The scope of the deal has little precedent in the post-Soviet era.For the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, Moscow freed prominent dissidents as part of a swap; 16 people in total were released from Russian custody. In exchange, eight people were freed by the West, after a complex web of negotiations that took place behind the scenes for months among nations that are otherwise bitterly at odds over Russian aggression in Ukraine.The exchange took place at the international airport in Ankara, Turkiye's capital, and involved seven different planes ferrying 24 prisoners from the US, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, Russia and Belarus, a Turkish intelligence official said. The deal seemed sure to prompt jubilation among Western nations that had condemned the charges against the imprisoned Americans and opposition figures as baseless and politically motivated. It also delivered a diplomatic victory for Prez Biden , who has long pledged to bring home imprisoned Americans and to support Russia's embattled pro-democracy movement. Biden said at a news conference that the prisoners had left Russia and were on their way home. ""Their brutal ordeal is over, and they're free,"" he said, surrounded by family members of the released prisoners.It was also a triumph of a different sort for Prez Putin of Russia, who can use the deal to highlight his loyalty to Russian agents who get arrested abroad. But the deal also carried risks at home for him, by releasing imprisoned politicians who could energize Russia's moribund, exiled opposition.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not specifically confirm a swap but was quoted by the state news agency TASS as saying that, in principle, ""all our enemies should stay there (abroad), and all those who are not our enemies should return"".In the last major exchange in 2010, 14 prisoners were exchanged. In Dec 2022, Russia traded US basketball star Brittney Griner, sentenced to nine years for having vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage, for arms dealer Viktor Bout, serving a 25-year sentence in the US.","The scope of the deal has little precedent in the post-Soviet era. 16 people in total were released from Russian custody.

What lies behind Donald Trump’s claims about Kamala Harris 'turning black' for political advantage?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-lies-behind-donald-trumps-claims-about-kamala-harris-turning-black-for-political-advantage/articleshow/112209926.cms,"The Truths We Hold

The Breakfast Club

Former President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris , claiming she ""happened to turn Black"" for political advantage. This incendiary remark is the latest in a series of racially charged statements from Trump, aimed at undermining his 2024 rival. However, Harris's embrace of her racial identity and heritage has been a core aspect of her life long before she entered the political arena.Harris, born in Oakland, California, in 1964, is the daughter of Afro-Jamaican Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan, who emigrated from India. The couple met at the University of California, Berkeley, where they engaged in civil rights activism, often with young Kamala in tow. Donald Harris, now a professor emeritus at Stanford University, and Gopalan, who passed away in 2009 after making significant contributions to breast cancer research, raised their daughters with a strong sense of cultural pride.Following their divorce, Gopalan continued to emphasize both her daughters' South Asian heritage and their Black identity. In her 2019 memoir,, Harris recounts how her mother, aware of societal perceptions, was determined that her daughters would grow up as confident Black women. Gopalan's efforts included trips to India and the use of Tamil in their household, ensuring that both Kamala and her younger sister Maya understood and appreciated their diverse backgrounds.As a child, Harris attended a newly desegregated school in a predominantly white neighborhood and was actively involved in her local Black church. Her statement onin 2019, ""I'm Black, and I'm proud of being Black, and I was born Black, I will die Black,"" reflects her long-standing commitment to her racial identity.Harris's educational choices further underscore her dedication to her Black heritage . She attended Howard University, a historically Black institution, and joined Alpha Kappa Alpha, the sorority founded to support Black women. Her activism included participating in protests against apartheid in South Africa.After Howard, Harris continued to align herself with her Black identity during her legal career. As president of the Black Law Students Association at UC Hastings College of the Law and later as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, Harris was consistently recognized in the media as a Black or African American leader.Trump’s attacks, drawing comparisons to criticisms faced by Barack Obama, are seen by some analysts as a strategy to undermine Harris’s credibility. Christopher Clark, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, suggests that Trump's remarks are a form of "" race-baiting "" intended to rally his base.Teresa Wiltz, writing for Politico, argues that American Black identity encompasses a wide range of experiences and appearances due to the legacy of slavery. She emphasizes that significant Black figures in history, such as Frederick Douglass and Angela Davis, were also of mixed race, and Harris’s self-identification as Black should be respected.Harris’s public life has always included a strong affirmation of her racial identity, from her activism and career choices to her personal declarations. Trump’s recent comments seem to overlook the complexities of racial identity in favor of a divisive and misleading narrative.","Kamala Harris is the daughter of Afro-Jamaican Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan, who emigrated from India.

Trump’s comments have also fueled further misinformation spread by far-right and conservative accounts on social media, questioning Harris' racial identity.The panel interview had a tense beginning when ABC News reporter Rachel Scott asked Trump why Black voters should support him despite his controversial history with racially charged comments. Trump reacted strongly to the question, calling it ""horrible,"" ""hostile,"" and a ""disgrace,"" while also labeling ABC as a ""fake"" network.""I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln,"" Trump asserted.Trump's appearance at the convention, his first-ever at the National Association of Black Journalists' annual event in Chicago, faced backlash from some members. This prompted a co-chair of the convention to resign in protest.Despite this friction, Trump has made some progress with Black men, particularly after President Joe Biden , his former Democratic opponent, struggled to mobilize Black voters, who have traditionally been a loyal Democratic voting bloc. In 2020, Biden secured 92% of Black voters compared to Trump’s 8%, according to Pew Research.The race for the presidency is anticipated to be tight, with key battleground states playing a decisive role. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, Trump leads Harris by a narrow margin of 43%-42%, within the poll's margin of error.

"Who is Khaled Meshaal, tipped to be next Hamas chief ?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-is-khaled-meshaal-tipped-to-be-next-hamas-chief-/articleshow/112182356.cms,"What we know about Khaled Meshaal

Khaled Meshaal, who is expected to become the new leader of Hamas, gained global attention in 1997 when Israeli agents attempted to assassinate him by injecting him with poison outside his office in Amman, Jordan.

Originally from Silwad near Ramallah, Meshaal moved to Kuwait with his family as a child and joined the Muslim Brotherhood at age 15. The Brotherhood played a key role in founding Hamas during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the late 1980s.

Meshaal transitioned from being a schoolteacher to lobbying for Hamas from abroad, while other Hamas leaders were often imprisoned by Israel.

As Hamas' political leader in exile since the year before the assassination attempt, Meshaal has represented the group internationally, benefiting from fewer travel restrictions compared to other Hamas officials.

At 68, Meshaal is tipped to succeed Ismail Haniyeh, who was recently assassinated in Iran, with both Tehran and Hamas pledging retaliation against Israel. Meshaal's relationship with Iran has been complicated due to his previous support for the Sunni revolt against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.

Throughout his tenure, Meshaal has faced the challenge of balancing the group's original goal of Israel's destruction with the possibility of a more pragmatic approach to achieve Palestinian statehood. His efforts to reconcile with President Mahmoud Abbas led to internal tensions within Hamas, resulting in his replacement by Haniyeh in 2017.

When Khaled Meshaal was responsible for international fundraising in Jordan, he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. The incident in 1997, ordered by then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in retaliation for a Hamas bombing in Jerusalem, aimed to kill Meshaal.

After the assassination attempt, Jordan closed Hamas' office in Amman and expelled Meshaal, who then moved to Qatar and later to Syria in 2001. In December 2012, Meshaal visited the Gaza Strip for the first time since leaving the West Bank as a child and delivered a significant speech at Hamas' 25th anniversary celebration.

During his time abroad, Hamas solidified its control over Gaza in 2007, challenging the Western-backed Palestinian Authority that was open to peace negotiations with Israel.

Khaled Meshaal is tipped off as the new leader of Hamas after the ‘ assassination ’ of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The strike, which Hamas has blamed on Israel , has left the group scrambling to find a new leader while raising concerns about the direction the group will take amid ongoing conflict .( with input from agencies)","Khaled Meshaal, 68, is tipped to succeed Ismail Haniyeh as Hamas leader.

He rose through the ranks of Hamas, developing its tunnel network and bomb-making skills, and has been a major target for Israeli forces, responsible for numerous Israeli deaths in suicide bombings.

Despite surviving multiple assassination attempts, he lost an eye and suffered severe leg injuries.

The military commander's wife, 7-month-old son, and 3-year-old daughter were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2014.

Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif , who was among the main masterminds of the October 7 attacks on Israel was ""eliminated"" in July by the Israeli forces. The IDF confirmed that its fighter jets took the Hamas military commander out in the area of Khan Yunis, following an intelligence assessment.""The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) announces that on July 13th, 2024, IDF fighter jets struck in the area of Khan Yunis, and following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike ,"" the military said.( with input from agency)","Mohammed Deif is believed to have been one of the masterminds of Hamas' October 7 attack on southern Israel. The military commander topped Israel's most wanted list for decades, held personally responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.

'See my assessment below on the 13 Keys Tracker on where The Keys stand NOW.'Harris filed her nomination on July 27 officially and declared her candidature for President race.Harris has an upper hand in this election because of the several key factors like she faced no primary challenger, there has been minimal threat from third-party candidates, and the economy remains strong both in the short and long term.With the transition from Biden to Harris, the White House has avoided major policy changes, and Harris is not contending with any scandals or significant social unrest.Lichtman observed that with Biden’s shift to Harris as the presumptive nominee, the Democrats have lost the incumbency advantage. As Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump prepare to face off, Lichtman considers the race essentially open, reported The Daily Mail.However, Lichtman also pointed out that the Democrats have managed to mitigate potential fallout from this transition.

'Loss of $900 million': Donald Trump's net worth falls sharply following Kamala Harris’ US presidential bid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-net-worth-falls-sharply-following-harris-us-presidential-bid/articleshow/112209924.cms,"Former President Donald Trump ’s financial stake in Truth Social has taken a significant hit, with its value dropping by $900 million since Vice President Kamala Harris announced her 2024 presidential bid on July 21. The stock of Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, has fallen by about 23% in that period, including a notable drop on Thursday, as reported by CNN.On July 19, before President Joe Biden 's exit from the race and endorsement of Harris, Trump’s stake was valued at just over $4 billion.By Thursday, the value had fallen to approximately $3.1 billion. This decline reflects a broader trend of volatility for Trump Media's share price, which has been heavily influenced by political developments and market fluctuations.The recent selloff highlights the stock’s role as a barometer for Trump’s potential return to the White House, with Truth Social expected to be a key platform for presidential communications if he wins. Polls showing a tight race between Trump and Harris have further impacted investor sentiment.In June, Trump Media’s stock briefly surged following Biden’s poor debate performance and again last month after Trump survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. However, the company has faced persistent challenges.Truth Social's user engagement has been declining. Data from Comscore, cited by CNN, reveals that unique visitors to the platform fell by 38% year-over-year in June, marking its third consecutive month of declines.Trump Media’s stock, which went public in late March, has experienced extreme volatility, with analysts comparing it to a ""meme stock"" driven by market speculation rather than solid financial performance. Despite the downturn, Trump Media remains valued at $5.1 billion.Trump retains significant control over the company, holding 114.75 million shares and serving as chairman, while Truth Social remains a minor player in the social media landscape. Bloomberg estimates Trump’s net worth at $5.9 billion. Critics argue that Trump Media’s high valuation is not supported by its modest revenue of $4.1 million last year, especially when compared to established companies like JetBlue, which is valued at $2.2 billion but generated 2,300 times more revenue.","On July 19, before President Joe Biden's exit from the race and endorsement of Kamala Harris, Trump’s stake was valued at just over $4 billion.

US-Russia: From journalists to high-profile convicts: US and Russia complete largest post-Soviet prisoner swap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-and-russia-complete-largest-post-soviet-prisoner-swap/articleshow/112209789.cms,"The United States and Russia completed their largest post-Soviet prisoner swap on Thursday, involving 24 individuals. According to AP, this complex exchange followed months of negotiations and necessitated concessions from European countries holding Russian prisoners.The swap saw the release of a diverse group, including journalists, political dissidents, suspected spies, a hacker, a fraudster, and even a convicted murderer.Among those freed by Russia were Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, a corporate security executive from Michigan, both accused of espionage charges that the US government deemed baseless. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was serving a 25-year sentence for treason, were also released.The most infamous of the eight individuals Russia received was Vadim Krasikov, convicted in Germany in 2021 for the murder of a former Chechen rebel in Berlin, allegedly under orders from Moscow’s security services. The exchange also included two alleged “sleeper” agents jailed in Slovenia, three men charged in the US, and two others returned from Norway and Poland.This substantial exchange does not signify a betterment in US-Russia relations. Previous swaps, including the December 2022 exchange of WNBA star Brittney Griner for arms trafficker Viktor Bout, have not led to improved relations. The backdrop of ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine and continuous US military support for Kyiv underscores the persistent hostilities.Despite the scale of the swap, several Americans remain detained in Russia. This group includes Travis Leake, a musician convicted on drug charges; Gordon Black, an American soldier convicted of theft and threats of murder; Marc Fogel, a teacher also convicted on drug charges; and Ksenia Khavana, arrested for treason charges linked to collecting money for Ukraine’s military.Fogel's family expressed frustration over his exclusion from the swap, deeming it “inconceivable” and urging the Biden administration to prioritise his release. A senior administration official acknowledged the ongoing efforts to secure the release of the remaining detainees.The US and its allies have released individuals convicted of serious crimes, including Krasikov, whose actions were tied to the Russian authorities. Krasikov’s 2019 murder of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, a Georgian citizen and former Chechen rebel, was conducted under a false identity provided by Russian officials. Throughout negotiations, Russia prioritised Krasikov’s release, with President Vladimir Putin hinting at the possibility earlier this year.In contrast, the Americans and Europeans released by Russia were predominantly held on charges considered baseless. President Joe Biden acknowledged the tough decisions involved in such deals but emphasised the importance of protecting Americans.A notable absentee from the swap was Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Discussions had included a potential exchange involving Navalny and Krasikov, but Navalny’s sudden and unexplained death in February thwarted these plans. Nevertheless, several of Navalny’s associates were released.Politically, this swap was a significant move for President Biden, who had foreshadowed his commitment to securing the release of unjustly detained Americans. Welcoming the families of the returning Americans to the White House, Biden highlighted the importance of international alliances, subtly contrasting this with former President Donald Trump ’s “America First” approach. Trump criticised the deal, incorrectly suggesting that the US had paid Russia for the exchange and questioning the release of criminals, as per AP.","The United States and Russia completed their largest post-Soviet prisoner swap on Thursday.

The lawsuit also alleges that Lemon was pressured by X executives to publicly announce the partnership at the CES technology conference in January, with the threat of withdrawing the deal if he didn’t comply.The collaboration between Lemon and X was part of Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino’s broader strategy to attract advertisers by creating premium content with well-known personalities.

Tech glitch leaves Trump rally vulnerable: How a $3 billion agency was outplayed by 20-year-old gunman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tech-glitch-leaves-trump-rally-vulnerable-how-a-3-billion-agency-was-outplayed-by-20-year-old-gunman/articleshow/112209455.cms,"A routine campaign stop in Butler , Pennsylvania, spiraled into a nightmare on July 13 when former President Donald Trump was injured in an assassination attempt that also left three rally attendees wounded, one fatally. The incident has cast a harsh light on the Secret Service , revealing a cascade of technological failures that allowed a lone gunman to exploit a critical vulnerability.The shooter, Thomas Crooks, was spotted by a local officer just moments before he fired his weapon. The officer's urgent ""Long gun!"" alert should have triggered a rapid response from the Secret Service, but the message never reached them, reported NYT. The ensuing 30 seconds were enough for Crooks to unleash chaos, as a tangled web of outdated technology and miscommunication left Trump and his supporters exposed.Despite being armed with a budget exceeding $3 billion, the Secret Service failed to deploy several key technologies that might have thwarted the attack. A surveillance drone, offered by local law enforcement, was declined. A system designed to enhance agent communications in areas with poor signal was never set up. Even the equipment on hand, such as counterdrone technology, failed when it was needed most. The agency's acting director, Ronald Rowe Jr., admitted during a Senate hearing that these oversights have haunted him. ""That has cost me a lot of sleep,"" he confessed, grappling with the gravity of the situation, reported NYT.The incident at Butler underscores a longstanding issue within the Secret Service: a sluggish adoption of modern technology. Despite repeated calls for reform, the agency still relies heavily on methods that seem better suited to the mid-20th century than the digital age. This resistance to innovation has had dire consequences, not just in Butler but in several previous incidents.Critics argue that the Secret Service's slow embrace of technology stems from a lack of urgency and funding allocation. Although its budget has grown substantially over the past decade, a mere fraction—less than 1%—is spent on researching and developing new security tools. This underinvestment leaves agents and their protectees vulnerable in an era where threats are increasingly sophisticated and technologically advanced.","Former President Donald Trump was injured in an assassination attempt that also left three rally attendees wounded, one fatally.

Trump turns 2024 presidential race into debate on Harris’ race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-turns-2024-presidential-race-into-debate-on-harris-race-is-this-worrying-some-republicans/articleshow/112209454.cms,"Trump doubles down on his comments

'This could backfire'

As the 2024 presidential race heats up, Donald Trump has once again stirred controversy with remarks questioning Vice President Kamala Harris ' racial identity . His comments, suggesting that Harris ""turned Black"" for political gain, have drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and even sparked discomfort within his own party.Trump’s racially charged rhetoric has been a hallmark of his political strategy, dating back to his role in the “birther” movement against Barack Obama.However, this latest attack on Harris, who is of Jamaican and Indian descent, appears to be testing the limits of his allies' patience. Some Republicans, including Sen. Cynthia Lummis, have publicly distanced themselves from the former president’s remarks, warning that such rhetoric is unhelpful and divisive.Despite the internal pushback, Trump has shown no signs of retreating. He doubled down on his comments, sharing a photo of Harris in traditional Indian attire on social media, further questioning her racial identity. This move seems to contradict advice from within his own campaign, where advisers believe focusing on Harris' policies rather than her identity would be more effective.The controversy comes at a pivotal moment in the election cycle, with President Joe Biden having recently ended his re-election bid and endorsed Harris. Trump, who has had to shift his campaign strategy from attacking an aging Biden to facing a younger and more dynamic Harris, appears to be leaning heavily on his familiar playbook of racial division.While some within the GOP believe that race-based attacks could backfire, particularly among swing voters, others see potential gains in targeting Harris’ identity to appeal to certain segments of the electorate. Diante Johnson, president of the Black Conservative Federation, argues that Trump’s broader focus on economic and social policies might resonate with Black voters, though this strategy is not without risks.Pollster Frank Luntz notes that gender-based criticisms of Harris might hold some sway, but race-based attacks are likely to be less effective. He warns that such tactics could alienate crucial voters, especially in a race where Trump’s handling of race has been under intense scrutiny.As the campaign unfolds, Trump’s approach to Harris will likely continue to evolve, shaped by both his instincts and the feedback from within his party. For now, his strategy of questioning Harris’ racial identity reflects a familiar, if controversial, path — one that has defined much of his political career. Whether it will pay off in November remains to be seen.","Trump's racially charged rhetoric has been a hallmark of his political strategy, dating back to his role in the 'birther' movement against Barack Obama.

And I told them that the president was determined to get this done in light of that tragic news.""Navalny, a prominent political opponent of Russian leader Vladimir Putin , was found dead in a Russian prison in Western Siberia in February at the age of 47. President Biden and many Western officials held Putin responsible for Navalny's death, given the Russian leader's history of seeing his enemies die under suspicious circumstances. Navalny had previously fallen ill due to alleged poisoning in 2020 and was later imprisoned on charges of embezzlement, extremism, and more, which Western leaders denounced as politically motivated.The prisoner swap deal, hailed by Biden as a ""feat of diplomacy,"" involved six countries and two dozen prisoners. In exchange for the three Americans, Russia secured the return of eight nationals, including three from US prisons, two from Slovenia, one from Norway, one from Poland, and Vadim Krasikov from Germany. Krasikov, a convicted murderer facing life in prison for allegedly killing a Georgian asylum seeker who had fought against Kremlin forces in Chechnya, was a key figure in the negotiations, with Putin expressing his desire for Krasikov's release during an interview with Tucker Carlson in February.The complex prisoner exchange, described as one of the largest since the end of the Cold War, involved high-level discussions between the US and Germany, with both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

H1B Scam: What is H-1B lottery scam? Who is Indian-American Kandi Srinivasa Reddy allegedly behind this?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-h-1b-lottery-scam-who-is-indian-american-kandi-srinivasa-reddy-behind-this/articleshow/112205692.cms,"10 things you need to know about Reddy and H-1B scam

The scam is based on a process called 'multiple registrations'. If one individual submits many applications under different company names, chances of getting selected in the lottery that takes place every April increases. Srinivasa Reddy controlled several companies which had shared addresses -- like Cloud Big Data Technologies LLC, Machine Learning Technologies LLC through which he rigged the system and got hundreds of H-1B visas. Those who applied for H-1B visa through Reddy's companies were assured of the visa. The system created disadvantage for companies that follow rules. Reddy created what Bloomberg called ""the Amazon of staffing"". A Telugu NRI, Reddy studied masters in the US and worked as a tech consultant as he settled there. After Reddy got a worker a visa, it used to take 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the worker's pay -- which is around $15,000 or more each year. In the 2020 lottery, Reddy's Cloud Big Data submitted some 288 names. At the same time, other companies under Reddy submitted the same names. His companies in 2020 entered the lottery more than 3,000 times. Reddy told Bloomberg that he is just a registered agent for the companies and has no involvement in them but official documents say otherwise. In his election data, he said he is the owner of all the staffing companies. Reddy has a foundation to help farmers in his hometown in India. He also has his own television and online news operation. Reddy told TOI that there is nothing illegal in what he did. ""When multiple visa entries are filed, the choice is up to the employees to choose which company they would like. From 20924, changes were made, and passport numbers need to be entered. Now, if multiple entries are filled, it will reflect everywhere,"" he said.

A major H-1B lottery scam has surfaced in which multiple companies submitted multiple applications for the same individuals rigging the system of getting American visas. Kandi Srinivasa Reddy, an Indian-American businessman, has been named behind the fraud. Interestingly, Reddy was a candidate of the Congress, now the ruling party in Telangana in the recent local election -- and lost.An investigation by Bloomberg has unearthed the scam going on for some years and now many other firms are doing the same.","Scam is based on a process called'multiple registrations' If one individual submits many applications under different company names, chances of getting selected in the lottery increases.

Joe Biden said the prisoner swap is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world -- as he credited the allies for the multi-country swap deal that set two dozen people free.The countries involved in the swap deal were US, Russia, Belarus and Germany. Norway, Slovenia, Poland became part of the deal as they has custody of additional Russians included in the exchange, Turkey provided critical logistic support in the deal.Evan Gershkovich was arrested on charges of espionage that both the US government and the Wall Street Journal denied but Kremlin insisted that he was caught spying red-handed.The Wall Street Journal published a detailed account of what went behind all these months Geshkovich was inside a jail in Russia culminating on Thursday when Evan's monther Ella arrived for an urgent 10.30am meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House. Today was the 491st day of her son's detention and she was asked to bring her husband and her daughter. The only instruction was: Tell no one.WSJ reported that Evan Gerskovich had to put in an official request for presidential clemency address to Putin. He added a request if after his release he would be allowed to take an interview of Putin. ""The pro forma printout included a long blank space the prisoner could fill out if desired, or simply, as expected, leave blank.

He pressed for details of the prisoner swap and asked whether Russia was also paid in cash.""So when are they going to release the details of the prisoner swap with Russia? How many people do we get versus them? Are we also paying them cash? Are they giving us cash (Please withdraw that question, because I’m sure the answer is NO)? Are we releasing murderers, killers, or thugs? Just curious because we never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps. Our “negotiators” are always an embarrassment to us! I got back many hostages, and gave the opposing Country NOTHING – and never any cash. To do so is bad precedent for the future. That’s the way it should be, or this situation will get worse and worse. They are extorting the United States of America.

In a statement, it said efforts were underway to pump rainwater off of main roads.Drainage systems quickly became overwhelmed after the rains, flooding several residential areas, officials said. The rainwater entered scores of homes in various parts of the city, residents said.Monsoon rains have returned to Pakistan as the country is still struggling to recover from devastating 2022 floods that affected 33 million people and killed 1,739. But weather forecasters say the country will receive less heavy rains compared to 2022, when climate-induced downpours swelled rivers.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Weather forecasters and scientists have blamed climate change for the unusually heavy monsoon rains.In neighboring Afghanistan, authorities on Thursday were dealing with a different kind of weather event, warning people against leaving their homes because of high temperatures.Fawad Ayoubi, a forecast officer at the country's aviation department, said people should go out before 10 a.m. and after 4 p.m. if they needed to leave the house.""The temperature will increase in northern and northwestern provinces as well as southwestern provinces,"" said Ayoubi. ""The reasons are the monsoon or hot weather from India that is affecting Afghanistan.""The World Health Organization also shared advice on how Afghans could protect themselves in the warmer weather. It said people should wear a wide-brimmed hat or hat and sunglasses, to eat small meals and more often, and to avoid leaving children in parked cars.",At least three people are dead after record-high rainfall in Lahore. The death toll from rain-related incidents over the past month surpasses 100. The latest spell of downpours started before dawn and is expected to continue for a week. The rains are likely to cause flash flooding and landslides.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112198365,imgsize-1485526,width-400,resizemode-4/112198365.jpg"

He mentioned that UAE authorities have raised concerns about inappropriate behavior, including making videos of women in Dubai without their consent.He also pointed out a declining trend in overseas employment for Pakistani workers, attributing this to the lack of skills despite technological advancements and modernisation efforts.Mahmood suggested that countries like Bangladesh serve as a model for Pakistan in terms of skilled labour force and recommended that Pakistan should follow their example.""The governments of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait have expressed various concerns regarding overseas Pakistanis,"" Mahmood informed the committee.He also said that the Pakistani diaspora consists of 10.7 million individuals, primarily employed in Saudi Arabia, UAE, the US, UK, and Canada.Another issue brought to light was the presence of organised gangs of Pakistani beggars operating in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, having entered these countries as pilgrims. Mahmood noted that many individuals travel to Saudi Arabia on Umrah visas, with Saudi authorities reporting that 90 percent of beggars arrested in the country are Pakistani.Senator Nasir Abbas raised concerns about Pakistanis living illegally in Iraq and questioned whether the ministry could assist them, as they are often subjected to poor treatment.Senator Zeeshan Khanzada also pointed out that many Pakistanis living illegally in Italy often deny their nationality, while the Pakistani embassy recognises them as citizens. He urged the ministry to take a more proactive role in obtaining a clear understanding of the situation and extending help to stranded Pakistanis.In response to the committee's queries, Mahmood said, ""A lack of resources and skill development among Pakistani workers has led to their replacement by workers from other countries.""","The senate standing committee on overseas Pakistanis was informed that employers in the Gulf region prefer hiring workers from countries like Bangladesh over Pakistan due to the 'deplorable standards' of Pakistani labour.

Pakistan to launch new messaging app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-launch-new-messaging-app/articleshow/112152439.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has said it would “soon” launch a new messaging application , “Beep Pakistan”, which will initially be used for communication by govt employees and later made available to the general public.The announcement came as Pakistani users have been facing problems with WhatsApp , especially when sending and receiving media files. Digital rights advocates suspect that the country’s testing and deployment of an internet firewall , intended to stifle dissent and crack down on free speech, may be the cause of the disruption.“Beep Pakistan”, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication which says it will be launched “soon” among other government departments.“The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and telecommunication.When the plan was announced last year, the then IT minister, Syed Aminul Haque, described it as Pakistan’s alternative to WhatsApp.Now, govt is distancing itself from that comparison. “Any comparison to WhatsApp is misplaced as there is no intention to compete with any third-party platform,” Khwaja said, adding the purpose of this app is to protect privacy and data.Haque, who currently heads the National Assembly’s standing committee on IT, said govt plans to roll out the application to all its employees within the next 45 days. “Then we will see the situation and launch it for the public too,” he said. Unlike WhatsApp, the former IT minister said, “Beep’s data centre will be in Pakistan, ensuring 100% safety and security. Just as China has WeChat and America has WhatsApp, Pakistan now has its own app.”Pakistani authorities have long been concerned about WhatsApp’s security features, particularly after reports in Dec 2019 that at least two dozen senior officials were targeted by Pegasus, a spyware developed by an Israeli cybersecurity firm. At that time the Pakistan govt instructed all officials to avoid sharing sensitive and confidential documents over WhatsApp.When asked if WhatsApp would be banned in the country following Beep Pakistan’s public launch, Khwaja, the IT minister, denied any plans to block WhatsApp in the country. Haque said he was not in favour of a ban. “But since Beep Pakistan is safe and secure we wish it to be used in Pakistan and those who want to use WhatsApp can continue to use it,” he said.","“Beep Pakistan’, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication. “The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and tele communication.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112152447,imgsize-401505,width-400,resizemode-4/112152447.jpg"

Pakistan seeks reprofiling of over $27 billion debt with friendly nations: Finance minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-seeks-reprofiling-of-over-27-billion-debt-with-friendly-nations-finance-minister/articleshow/112099105.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF, according to a media report on Monday. The Washington-based International Monetary Fund last month announced that it signed a staff-level agreement with Pakistan to provide a $7 billion loan which would be disbursed for 37 months.However, it attached stringent conditions with it, requiring Pakistan prior action before the fund's board accords final approval for the loan.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb after returning from Beijing told the media on Sunday that talks have been going on with China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE for a re-profiling of $27 billion.Aurangzeb said Pakistan had already asked the friendly bilateral trio of lenders to roll over its more than $12 billion annual debt portfolio by three to five years to secure the IMF board's approval, which is expected next month.This is on top of Islamabad's request to Beijing to convert imported coal-based projects to local coal and re-profile more than $15 billion in energy sector liabilities to create fiscal space amid difficulties in timely repayments.Pakistan has a peculiar financial arrangement with these three countries in the shape of commercial loans and SAFE deposits that are rolled over every year and form a major part of the IMF programme in terms of external financing needs.Pakistan has now requested the maturity period of these loans - $5 billion from China, $4 billion from Saudi Arabia, and $3 billion from the UAE - to be extended to at least three years, offering greater predictability under the IMF programme.Aurangzeb said the Chinese side acknowledged Pakistan's foreign exchange difficulties and wanted to help in new business ventures and the re-profiling of energy sector payments besides playing its role in supporting Pakistan's case at the IMF board as one of the major stakeholders.He said the process of debt and equity rescheduling had been started and would now go to the working groups with relevant financial institutions and sponsors of Chinese projects for which Pakistan hired local Chinese consultants.""Between now and the IMF board meeting (on the 37-month bailout package), we have to ensure confirmation of external financing"" from friendly bilateral partners, the minister said.However, he explained that the Chinese energy sector debt reprofiling had nothing to do with the IMF programme as other prior actions had been completed and structural benchmarks were under implementation.Aurangzeb said he was in contact with the Chinese, Saudi and UAE finance ministers for an extension in debt rollover for three years and they had assured their support that would place Pakistan in a very comfortable position in terms of external financing gap.""I can assure you we are at a very good place on external financing for the next three years, including year one, year two and year three,"" he said.He said the IMF had worked out a financing needs assessment for three years that also included its own $7 billion Extended Fund Facility. After rollovers from friendly countries, the remaining external financing gap would become very manageable, he said.Responding to a question, the minister said Pakistan was not seeking any incremental financing from friendly countries. ""The only incremental thing is an extension in the maturity period for three years instead of yearly rollovers,"" he said.Aurangzeb said that the issue of energy sector repayments was initially taken up by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Beijing and followed it up with formal letters to Prime Minister Li Keqiang.As part of the process, Aurangzeb, along with Power Minister Awais Leghari, held meetings with Chinese finance and energy ministers and the governor of the Chinese central bank to understand the context of Pakistan's ability to pay, economic stability and relief in energy tariffs.He said the two sides discussed conversions of Chinese power projects to local coal and how to take their technical, logistical and financial parameters forward.Secondly, financial re-profiling would also need to be discussed with banks and project sponsors one by one. ""They have recognised this and the process would now move forward on that basis,"" Aurangzeb said.He said the re-profiling of CPEC debt was also discussed with the governor of the Chinese central bank and ""we would need to go project by project given the CPEC structure"".""Very positive discussions have taken place from my perspective,"" he said, adding the debt of Chinese independent power producers (IPPs) was manageable as their legal payments were being made, but the issue pertained to return on equity to project sponsors mainly because of foreign exchange which required to be rescheduled to create fiscal space.The minister, however, clarified that Pakistan was seeking the re-profiling of payments and not ""haircuts"" - debt waiver or interest rate cuts.",Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF.

Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's party says ready to talk with Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/bilawal-bhutto-zardaris-party-says-ready-to-talk-with-imran-khan/articleshow/112084489.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples Party-led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that it is ready to talk with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan if the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder is willing to engage, amidst heightened political instability in the cash-strapped country. ""It is being said that the PTI founder is ready to talk. If Imran Khan is ready to talk then that's a positive thing,"" Senior PPP leader Khurshid Shah said while speaking to the media in Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan.Shah welcomed the possibility of talks as a positive development.""President Asif Ali Zardari has always tried to solve problems through negotiations, and the PPP would play its role if needed,"" Shah was quoted as saying by the Express Tribune newspaper.The PPP's willingness to engage with Khan's party comes amidst heightened political instability, following the PTI's hard-line stance against the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led government.The PPP, along with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and other allies, supports the PML-N of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The two former rivals recently witnessed a war of words. The ruling PML-N accepted all the demands of PPP over the federal budget and allocation of development funds.Since Khan's ouster through a vote of no confidence in 2022, the PTI has maintained a strong opposition to the PPP-PML-N alliance.Political tensions increased after the February 8 elections, which saw the two parties forming a coalition government in the Centre.Calls for reconciliation have been growing from various societal and political quarters, urging the PTI to negotiate with the government.Khan's party had previously rejected talks with what it termed the ""Form-47 government,"" instead showing a preference for dialogue with the military establishment.In April, PTI's Shehryar Afridi indicated a preference for negotiations with Army chief Gen Asim Munir and the Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI).Subsequently, PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub mentioned that Imran Khan had assigned significant responsibility to former President Dr Arif Alvi.Last month, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar confirmed that Khan had approved discussions with the government.Similarly, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Khan's sister Aleema Khan called for state institutions to remain neutral for the country's progress.Meanwhile, the government too has called on the Khan-founded party to come to the table and hold talks.""If you want to remove us then do it. You don't want to resolve issues but to further complicate them. You should do talks instead of destroying everything,"" Federal Minister for Petroleum Dr Musadik Malik said last week.",The Pakistan Peoples Party-led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that it is ready to talk with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan. The PPP's willingness to engage with Khan's party comes amidst heightened political instability.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112084547,imgsize-68912,width-400,resizemode-4/112084547.jpg"
Bangladesh bans Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir under anti-terrorism law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-bans-jamaat-e-islami-and-its-student-wing-islami-chhatra-shibir-under-anti-terrorism-law/articleshow/112199637.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh on Thursday banned the Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir under anti-terrorism law following nationwide unrest over the quota system for government jobs , accusing the fundamentalist party of instigating protests that left at least 150 people dead. A notification issued by the public security division of the ministry of home affairs on Thursday confirmed the ban on the Islamist party, a key ally of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party.The ban on Jamaat, Chhatra Shibir and other associated groups came through an executive order under Section 18(1) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.""They (Jamaat-Shibir and BNP) just used the students as their shield,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on Thursday when Italian Ambassador Antonio Alessandro called on her at her official residence Ganabhaban here.A Home Ministry spokesman said that the government on August 1 banned all political activities of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and its various wings.The Bangladesh government on Tuesday decided to ban the Jamaat-e-Islami following the deadly nationwide students' protests over quotas in government jobs, accusing it of exploiting the movement that left at least 150 people dead.The development comes after a meeting of the ruling Awami League-led 14-party alliance passed a resolution earlier this week that Jamaat must be banned from politics.The decision to ban Jamaat comes over 50 years after its initial prohibition in 1972 for ""misusing religion for political purposes"".The Jamaat opposed Bangladesh's 1971 independence from Pakistan and sided with the Pakistani troops during the Liberation War.The party, founded in 1941 in undivided India, was first banned in 1972, the year Bangladesh framed its Constitution, which disbanded the functioning of any association or union or political party based on religion.But the subsequent military government led by General Ziaur Rahman revoked the ban by issuing a martial law proclamation, which allowed Jamaat to refloat and years later became a crucial partner of the then prime minister Khaleda Zia's 2001-2006 four-party alliance government. Two senior Jamaat leaders were inducted into her cabinet.Top leaders of the ruling Awami League, who have been in power for the past 15 years, have supported the ban on the Jamaat because of its role in the Liberation War.The Jamaat remained active despite losing its registration and being barred from elections due to court rulings.The party was allegedly involved in the recent violence surrounding the protests of the quota reform movement, which the government has cited as a reason for the ban, the report added.Violence gripped Bangladesh for almost the entire of July when the protests that had started in universities and colleges earlier this month, quickly turned into a widespread agitation against Prime Minister Hasina and her government's policies.The government called in the Army to quell protests against job quotas after the unrest left at least 150 dead and several thousand people, including policemen, wounded and major government installations damaged.Law Minister Anisul Huq said on Tuesday the ban is being imposed because of the recent violence associated with the quota reform movement and will be enacted through an executive order.He said the students who waged a movement demanding reforms in quota system said they had no link to the violence while evidence was there that Jamaat, its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir, BNP and a militant part of its students front Chhatra Dal carried out the mayhem.""From now on, the party cannot carry on its politics using its name,"" he told reporters on Thursday.Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said any violent reaction to the decision by the party would be dealt with severely as security agencies were ordered to enforce a stricter vigil.Bangladesh in 2009 initiated a process to try the key collaborators of Pakistani troops in 1971 on charges of crimes against humanity and six top leaders of Jamaat and one of BNP were hanged after their trial in two special war crimes tribunals while the apex Appellate Division of the Supreme Court upheld the judgments.","Bangladesh bans the Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir under anti-terrorism law.

Bangladesh's battle between democracy and autocracy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshs-battle-between-democracy-and-autocracy/articleshow/112158370.cms,"Originally published under Creative Commons by 360info™.

The brutal crackdown on student protesters revealed the totalitarian aims of the prime minister and the resilience of belief in democratic freedoms.The crisis in Bangladesh can be seen as a battle for the soul of Bangladesh’s political future.On one side there is 76-year-old prime minister Sheikh Hasina , who has not held genuinely free, fair and participatory elections for the past 15 years.She appears to want to drive Bangladesh from an autocracy to a totalitarian state.In Hasina’s totalitarian vision of Bangladesh, she and her government will face no accountability, and if anyone protests , they will be met with a violent crackdown , including death, torture, enforced disappearance and imprisonment.Any violence against protesters will be justified on the grounds they are “anti-state”, “anti-independence” and “conspirators” who want to derail the dream of Hasina’s late father and the country’s founding leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, of a ‘golden Bengal’.On the other side of the battle, there are hundreds and thousands of Bangladeshi students and political opponents who want accountable government and greater participation in the decision-making process. They want to exercise their democratic aspirations by demanding fairer access to government jobs — specifically through reform of thequota system for the Bangladeshi public service.Over the past 15 years, Bangladeshis from all walks of lives have shown their resilience in the face of autocratic governance and have adopted innovative techniques to challenge it.The current student pushback against Hasina’s totalitarian ambitions is an example of this ‘democratic bricolage’ — the creative ways in which the ideals of responsive government and popular participation are upheld and autocracy is contested.In a previous round of protests in 2018, students demanded the abolishment of the 30 percent public service quota reserved for independence fighters and their descendants.They argued that the veterans’ quota in the years immediately after independence in 1971 was justified, but after 50 years of independence it had become redundant and Hasina’s government was using the quota only to recruit party cadres. The 2018 protest led to the abolishment of the quota system.However, it was reinstated this year, angering many students, who began to stage peaceful protests at universities around the country.By protesting government decisions and holding rallies, the students showed they value democratic freedoms and their right to protest.Hasina called the protesting students “razakars” — a derogatory term for those who sided with Pakistanis in carrying out atrocity crimes against Bengalis in the 1971 war for independence. The accusation angered protesters, who chanted slogans calling Hasina a dictator.To quell the protests, Hasina’s government first deployed the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of Hasina’s Awami League party. Their indiscriminate, violent attacks involved sticks, guns and other weapons, and they made no effort to spare female students. In many instances, police were seen to support the Chhatra League and also to use physical force inside university campuses.The students turned from peaceful protest to fighting back with violence. They allegedly set fire to the state television building in Dhaka, seen as the mouthpiece of the government.Hasina deployed all the security forces — police, military, border guard, detective branch, and intelligence agencies — to squash the protests.An internet blackout and a strict curfew were put in place, with a ‘shoot-on-sight’ order for offenders or unruly crowds.The result is horrific. According to conservative estimates, about 200 people were killed, mostly students. Some victims were children. Students and some media sources reportedly put the real figure much higher. Media reports have claimed that helicopters were used to shoot at protesters, and UN officials have conveyed concerns that UN-marked vehicles were used in suppressing protests. The country’s own armed forces and border guards, who are supposed to defend the country’s border, were seen shooting at their own citizens.Meanwhile, the government reduced the quota to 7 percent — 5 percent for descendants of veterans and 2 percent for members of ethnic minorities and people with disability or identifying as transgender.That move can’t undo the brutality of the crackdown, which is unheard of in Bangladeshi history.With the internet back up, in a limited capacity, the videos and photos that have emerged are harrowing. Unarmed civilians are seen being shot and left on the streets. Many lost limbs and even eyes.Some of the student leaders of the protests were forcefully disappeared, tortured and coerced into compromising with the government.However, while Hasina is seemingly re-establishing control over the streets, she will not be winning many hearts and minds.The student leaders who were forcefully disappeared, tortured and later released, are not giving up. With broken voices, teary eyes and in obvious pain, they held a press conference and demanded Hasina accept responsibility for the mass killings of students and that she publicly apologise.This is perhaps the greatest challenge to Hasina, because for so long she has avoided accountability.Like any totalitarian leader, she considers herself the state, answerable to nobody.In asking her to accept blame for the violence directed against her own citizens, the tortured and beaten students are demonstrating their democratic resilience.They are showing that the battle to bring Bangladesh back to democracy is far from over.",Bangladeshis from all walks of lives have shown their resilience in the face of autocratic governance and have adopted innovative techniques to challenge it. The current student pushback against Hasina’s totalitarian ambitions is an example of this ‘democratic bricolage’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112158464,imgsize-639933,width-400,resizemode-4/112158464.jpg"
