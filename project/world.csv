Qutb Minar model in teak to go under the hammer at UK auction house,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/qutb-minar-model-in-teak-to-go-under-the-hammer-at-uk-auction-house/articleshow/109541186.cms,"LONDON: A 19th-century, 2.5-metre-tall teak model of the Qutb Minar as it looked in 1828 with six storeys is going under the hammer on Wednesday at UK auction house Dreweatts, with an estimate of Rs 20 to Rs 30 lakh.The item is from the private collection of the late art collector Count Manfredi della Gherardesca, a wealthy Italian count who died in 2022 at the age of 60.""This model represents the red sandstone tower, the Qutb Minar in Delhi, built in 1193-1230 for Qutb ud-Din-Aibak, the first Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate ...to cast the shadow of God over both east and west,"" states the auction brochure.Its provenance can be traced to a sale at Christie's in 2000 of the collection of antiques dealer Christopher Gibbs. It is not known where Gibbs bought it from, but since it was made of teak, it is thought it could have been made in India.An anonymous buyer bought it from Gibbs, who then put it up for sale at Christie's in 2018, where Manfredi bought it.""Manfredi told me he walked into the gallery, it was displayed in the middle and he just decided he had to have it. It has such a great presence and is so detailed in its construction. Manfredi knew the model Gibbs had was rare. There is only one other model known to be in existence in the UK,"" Joe Robinson, head of the Manfredi sale, said.The model Gibbs purchased showed the minaret as it did prior to the rebuilding of the upper stories by Firoz Shah between 1288 and 1293. The anonymous buyer added the upper stories in poplar wood to reflect how it looked after Colonel Robert Smith added a controversial cupola to it in 1828, creating a sixth storey. This is the version going under the hammer.That cupola was then taken down from the structure in 1848 and reinstalled on the ground, where it is known as ""Smith's Folly"".""Unlike the Middle East mosques at the time, what you see is a fusion of Islamic architecture with the craftsmen who actually made it, who were Hindu. It is an incredibly symbolic and important building.

Germany suspects AfD staffer in EU parliament of spying for China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/germany-suspects-afd-staffer-in-eu-parliament-of-spying-for-china/articleshow/109546183.cms,"BERLIN: An aide to a member of the European parliament for the far-right Alternative for Germany has been arrested in Germany on suspicion of ""especially severe"" espionage for China, the latest in a spate of such arrests across Europe.Prosecutors named him as Jian G in a statement on Tuesday and accused him of passing information about discussions in the EU legislature to Chinese intelligence.The website of Maximilian Krah, the AfD's top candidate in June's election to the assembly, lists Jian Guo as one of his assistants. Krah said he had learned of Guo's arrest from the media and would stop working with him if the charges were proven.Anxiety about alleged Chinese spying has mounted across western Europe in recent months. Three German nationals were arrested on Monday on suspicion of handing over technology with military applications. The same day, two men were charged in Britain with spying for China. And on March 25, the US and Britain accused Beijing of cyberespionage against millions including lawmakers, academics and journalists, as well as companies including defence contractors.China foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a briefing that reports of Chinese espionage in Europe were ""hype"" and ""intended to discredit and suppress China"".The aide also spied on Chinese opposition figures in Germany, prosecutors said.

Gaza war has US universities up in arms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gaza-war-has-us-universities-up-in-arms/articleshow/109546175.cms,"At New York University, police swept in to arrest 133 protesting students Monday night, ending a standoff with the school's administration. At Yale University, police placed protesters' wrists into zip ties Monday morning and escorted them onto campus shuttles to receive summonses for trespassing. Columbia kept its classroom doors closed Monday, moving lectures online and urging students to stay home.Harvard Yard was shut to the public. Nearby, at campuses including Tufts and Emerson, administrators weighed how to handle encampments that looked much like the one that police dismantled at Columbia last week - which protesters quickly resurrected. On the West Coast, a new encampment bubbled at the University of California, Berkeley. Less than a week after the arrests of over 100 protesters at Columbia, administrators at some of the country's most influential universities were struggling to calm campuses torn by the conflict in the Gaza Strip and Israel.During the turmoil Monday, which coincided with the start of Passover, protesters called on their universities to become less financially tied to Israel and its arms suppliers. Many Jewish students agonised anew over some protests and chants that veered into antisemitism, and feared again for their safety. Some faculty members denounced clampdowns on peaceful protests and warned that academia's mission to promote open debate felt imperiled. Alumni and donors raged. And from Congress, there were calls for the resignation of Columbia's prez from some of the same lawmakers Nemat Shafik tried to pacify last week with words that inflamed her own campus.The menu of options for administrators handling protests seems to be quickly dwindling. It is all but certain that the demonstrations, in some form or another, will last on some campuses until the end of the academic year, and even then, graduation ceremonies may be bitterly contested gatherings. The University of Michigan is informing students of the rules for its ceremony: Banners and flags are not allowed. Protests are OK but in designated areas away from the cap-and-gown festivities. The University of Southern California cancelled a planned speech by the school's Muslim valedictorian - and then ""released"" all its outside commencement speakers.For now, the most significant protests were confined to a handful of campuses. Columbia prez Shafik said the West Asia conflict is terrible and she understands many are experiencing deep moral distress ""But we cannot have one group dictate terms,"" she said in a community message early Monday, four days after officers dressed in riot gear helped clear part of Columbia's campus.The events at Columbia rippled to Yale, where students gathered at Beinecke Plaza in New Haven, Connecticut, for days to demand that the university divest from arms manufacturers. Yale Prez Peter Salovey said Monday that university leaders had spent ""many hours"" in talks with protesters, but the talks proved unsuccessful. Authorities arrested 60 people Monday morning, including 47 students, Salovey said. The university said the decision to make arrests was made with ""the safety and security of the entire Yale community in mind"". All were released on promises to appear in court later, he said.At NYU, an encampment set up by students swelled to hundreds of protesters Monday. A New York police department spokesperson said 133 protesters were taken into custody at NYU, and that all of them had been released with summonses to appear in court on disorderly conduct charges. University spokesperson said NYU was carrying on with classes Tuesday.The scene was less contentious in Massachusetts, where Harvard officials had moved to limit the possibility of protests by closing Harvard Yard. Elsewhere in Boston area, protesters had set up encampments at Emerson College, MIT and Tufts. But those protests, for now, appeared modest. At MIT, protesters have called for endof funding from Israeli defence ministry for university projects with military objectives.","At Yale University, police placed protesters' wrists into zip ties Monday morning and escorted them onto campus shuttles to receive summonses for trespassing.

Iran president pledges to strengthen ties with Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/iran-president-pledges-to-strengthen-ties-with-pakistan/articleshow/109510160.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi announced Monday during a joint press conference with Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad that the two countries have resolved to increase their trade volume to $10 billion, stating the current level as “unacceptable”.Raisi is on a three-day visit, the first by any foreign leader since Pakistan’s controversial general elections on February 8.This also comes in the backdrop of Iran’s recent attack on Israel, involving more than 300 drones and missiles. The visit is closely watched amid ongoing tensions with Israel, and US sanctions.“We are committed to strengthening relations at high levels. We have decided to increase economic, commercial, and cultural relations between Pakistan and Iran,” Raisi said.Sharif echoed the sentiment. “We have to keep this relationship strong despite the challenges we face,” he said, commending Iran for its firm stand on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and urging for an immediate cessation of hostilities.Pakistan and Iran share a 900km border, which is susceptible to unlawful crossings, smuggling, and militant infiltration. Both nations accuse each other of failing to prevent terrorist organisations from seeking refuge on their territory and conducting cross-border assaults.Last Jan, Iran launched missile strikes against anti-Iranian militant hideouts in Pakistan’s southwestern Baluchistan province, prompting Islamabad to retaliate with strikes on bases of anti-Pakistan militants operating from Iranian soil. The exchange of strikes raised concerns about larger conflicts and regional instability.The Iranian President is accompanied by his spouse, the foreign minister, cabinet members, and business representatives.Analysts said Raisi’s visit will also address financial and legal issues related to the construction of a gas pipeline between the two countries. Despite signing an agreement in June 2009 for the pipeline to export Iranian natural gas to Pakistan, construction on the Pakistani side has not started, possibly due to US pressure as Iran’s energy sector faces sanctions for its nuclear programme. Iran’s attack on Israel further complicates Pakistan’s efforts to build the pipeline.","Raisi is on a three-day visit, the first by any foreign leader since Pakistan’s controversial general elections on February 8.

"Could Trump go to jail? If he does, Secret Service goes too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/could-trump-go-to-jail-if-he-does-secret-service-goes-too/articleshow/109546048.cms,"The US Secret Service is in the business of protecting the president, whether he's inside the Oval Office or visiting a foreign war zone. But protecting a former president in prison? The prospect is unprecedented. That would be the challenge if Donald Trump - whom the agency is required by law to protect around the clock - is convicted at his criminal trial in Manhattan and sentenced to serve time.Even before the trial's opening statements, the Secret Service was in some measure planning for the extraordinary possibility of a former president behind bars. Prosecutors had asked the judge in the case to remind Trump that attacks on witnesses and jurors could land him in jail even before a verdict is rendered. (The judge, who is holding a hearing Tuesday to discuss whether Trump should be held in contempt for violating a gag order, is far more likely to issue a warning or impose a fine before taking the extreme step of jailing the 77-year-old former president.)Last week, as a result of the prosecution's request, officials with federal, state and city agencies had an impromptu meeting about how to handle the situation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That behind-the-scenes conversation - involving officials from the Secret Service and other relevant law enforcement agencies - focused only on how to move and protect Trump if the judge were to order him briefly jailed for contempt in a courthouse holding cell, the people said.The far more substantial challenge - how to safely incarcerate a former presidentif the jury convicts him and the judge sentences him to prison rather than home confinement or probation - has yet to be addressed directly, according to some of a dozen current and former city, state and federal officials. That's at least in part because if Trump is ultimately convicted, a drawn-out and hard-fought series of appeals, possibly all the way up to the Supreme Court, is almost a certainty. That would most likely delay any sentence for months if not longer, said several of the people, who noted that a prison sentence was unlikely.But the daunting challenge remains. And not just for Secret Service and prison officials, who would face the logistical nightmare of safely incarcerating Trump, who is also the presumptive Republican nominee for president. ""Obviously, it's uncharted territory,"" said Martin Horn, who has worked at the highest levels of New York's and Pennsylvania's state prison agencies. Protecting Trump in a prison environment would involve keeping him separate from other inmates, as well as screening his food and other personal items, officials said. If he were to be imprisoned, a detail of agents would work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, rotating in and out of the facility, officials said.Former corrections officials said there were several New York state prisons and city jails that have been closed or partly closed, leaving wings or large sections of their facilities empty and available. One of those buildings could serve to incarcerate the former presidentand accommodate his Secret Service protective detail. Anthony Guglielmi, the spokesman for the Secret Service in Washington, declined to discuss specific ""protective operations."" But he said that federal law requires Secret Service agents to protect former prezes.The trial in Manhattan, one of four criminal cases pending against Trump and possibly the only one that will go to a jury before the election, centres on accusations he falsified records to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star. The former presidentis charged with 34 counts of felony falsifying business records. If convicted, the judge could sentence him to punishments ranging from probation to four years in state prison, though for a first-time offender of Trump's age, such a term would be extreme.",The Secret Service was in some measure planning for the extraordinary possibility of a former president behind bars.

"In hush money trial, tabloid publisher testifies he helped Trump's candidacy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-hush-money-trial-tabloid-publisher-testifies-he-helped-trumps-candidacy/articleshow/109546062.cms,"The sixth day of

Donald Trump

's criminal trial got off to a dreadful start for the former US president on Tuesday as the judge questioned his lawyer's credibility and a key witness pulled back the curtain on what prosecutors say was a conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential polls.

In a pivotal stretch of testimony, David Pecker, the longtime

publisher

of the National Enquirer, described a 2015 meeting with Trump and his fixer at the time, Michael Cohen, at

Trump

's midtown Manhattan headquarters.

Prosecutors say that meeting was part of the trio's efforts to conceal several sex scandals during the 2016

campaign

, including with a $130,000 hush-money payment Cohen made to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, that is at the heart of the case.

At that meeting, Pecker said on the stand, Cohen and Trump asked him what he and his magazines could do ""to help the campaign,"" a crucial statement that supports the prosecution's argument that the men were not just protecting Trump's personal reputation, but aiding his campaign.

""I would be your eyes and ears,"" Pecker recalled telling them, as he explained the tabloid practice of ""catch and kill,"" in which an outlet bought the rights to a story, only to never publish it.

Pecker described working with Cohen to generate negative coverage of Trump's political rivals, saying that Cohen would feed him information and that the National Enquirer would sometimes ""embellish"" and add onto it.

Trump, who repaid Cohen for the

hush money

, is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. Each charge reflects a cheque, invoice or ledger that prosecutors say disguised the true purpose of his reimbursement of Cohen, who is now a key witness against him.

Pecker's testimony came after a bruising hearing for Trump and his legal team, as prosecutors argued that Trump's attacks on witnesses and jurors pose a ""threat"" to the trial. They urged the judge to hold him in contempt of court over what they said were 11 violations of a gag order that bars the former president from attacking witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and court staff, as well as their relatives.

Witnesses in the case ""rightly fear"" being subjected to the former president's ""vitriol,"" a prosecutor, Christopher Conroy, told the judge.

He rattled off various statements that Manhattan prosecutors believe crossed the line, including calling Cohen and Daniels ""sleaze bags"" and reposting an attack on the jury pool, which came the night before a juror who had already been seated asked to be excused. ""What happened here was exactly what this order was meant to prevent, and the defendant doesn't care,"" Conroy said.

Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, argued that Trump's posts were political in nature and did not violate the order as he was simply responding to ""a barrage of political attacks"" including from Cohen.

Prosecutors have asked the judge, Juan M Merchan, to fine Trump $1,000 for each violation. Justice Merchan, whose daughter has been among Trump's targets, did not immediately rule. But he appeared sceptical of the defence's claims. At one point, after Blanche told the judge that Trump was trying to comply with the order, Justice Merchan replied, ""You're losing all credibility with the court.""","Donald Trump is on trial for allegedly making a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. He is also accused of lying to Congress about the payment. He has also been accused of violating a court order to keep quiet about the payments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109546076,imgsize-33802,width-400,resizemode-4/109546076.jpg"
Tabloid publisher says he pledged to be Trump campaign's 'eyes and ears' during 2016 race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tabloid-publisher-says-he-pledged-to-be-trump-campaigns-eyes-and-ears-during-2016-race/articleshow/109541708.cms,"NEW YORK: A veteran tabloid publisher testified Tuesday that he pledged to be Donald Trump 's ""eyes and ears"" during his 2016 presidential campaign , recounting how he promised the then-candidate that he would help suppress harmful stories and even arranged to purchase a doorman's silence.The testimony from David Pecker was designed to bolster prosecutors' assertions of a decades-long friendship between Trump and the former publisher of the National Enquirer that culminated in an agreement to give the candidate's lawyer a heads-up on negative tips and stories so they could be quashed.Pecker is the first witness in Trump's history-making hush money trial in Manhattan, where he faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments meant to prevent harmful stories from surfacing during the final days of the 2016 campaign.The effort to suppress unflattering information was designed to illegally influence the election, prosecutors have alleged in seeking to elevate the gravity of the first trial of a former American president and the first of four criminal cases against Trump to reach a jury.With Trump sitting just feet away in the courtroom, Pecker detailed his intimate, behind-the-scenes involvement in Trump's rise from political novice to the Republican nomination and then the White House. He explained how he and the National Enquirer parlayed rumor-mongering into splashy tabloid stories that smeared Trump's opponents and, just as crucially, leveraged his connections to suppress seamy stories about Trump, including a porn actor's claim of an extramarital sexual encounter a decade earlier.Pecker traced the origins of their relationship to a 1980s meeting at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and said the friendship bloomed alongside the success of the real estate developer's TV show ""The Apprentice"" and the program's subsequent celebrity version.Their ties were solidified during a pivotal August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower involving Trump, his lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, and another aide, Hope Hicks, in which Pecker was asked what he and the magazines he led could do for the campaign.Pecker said he volunteered to publish positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents. But that wasn't all, he said, telling jurors how he told Trump: ""I will be your eyes and ears.""""I said that anything I hear in the marketplace, if I hear anything negative about yourself, or if I hear about women selling stories, I would notify Michael Cohen,"" so that the rights could be purchased and the stories could be killed.""So they would not get published?"" asked prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.""So they would not get published,"" Pecker replied.To illustrate their point, prosecutors displayed for the court a screenshot of various flattering headlines the National Enquirer published about Trump, including: ""Donald Dominates!' and ""World Exclusive: The Donald Trump Nobody Knows."" The jury was also shown disparaging and outlandish stories about Trump's opponents in the race, including the surgeon Ben Carson and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.Pecker painted Cohen as a shadow editor of the National Enquirer's pro-Trump coverage, directing the tabloid to go after whichever Republican candidates was gaining in momentum.""I would receive a call from Michael Cohen, and he would direct me and direct Dylan Howard which candidate and which direction we should go,"" Pecker said, referring to the tabloid's then-editor.Pecker said he underscored to Howard that the agreement he struck with the Trump operation was ""highly, highly confidential."" He said he wanted the tabloid's bureau chiefs to be on the lookout for any stories involving Trump and said he wanted them to verify the stories before alerting Cohen.""I did not want anyone else to know this agreement I had and what I wanted to do,"" the ex-publisher added.Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal charges related to his role in the hush money payments. He was once a confidant of Trump's, but their relationship has deteriorated in spectacular fashion. Cohen is expected to be a star government witness, and he routinely posts profane broadsides against Trump on social media.Trump's lawyers are expected to make attacks on Cohen's credibility a foundation of their defense, but in opening with Pecker, prosecutors hope to focus attention on a witness with a far less volatile backstory.Pecker's resumption of testimony Tuesday followed a hearing earlier in the day in which prosecutors urged Judge Juan Merchan to hold Trump in contempt and fine him $1,000 for each of 10 social media posts that they say violated an earlier gag order barring attacks on witnesses, jurors and others involved in the case.Merchan did not immediately rule, but he seemed skeptical of a defense lawyer's arguments that Trump was merely responding in his posts to others' attacks and had been trying to comply with the order.Pecker's testimony began Monday after opening statements that offered the 12-person jury - and, just as important, the voting public - radically divergent roadmaps for a case that will unfold against the backdrop of a closely contested White House race in which Trump is not only the presumptive Republican nominee but also a criminal defendant facing the prospect of a felony conviction and prison.Prosecutors allege that Trump sought to illegally influence the 2016 race through a practice known in the tabloid industry as ""catch-and-kill"" - catching a potentially damaging story by buying the rights to it and then killing it through agreements that prevent the paid person from telling the story to anyone else.In this case, that included a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to silence her claims of an extramarital sexual encounter that Trump denies.Defense lawyers have said Trump is innocent and that Cohen cannot be trusted.Prosecutors also described other arrangements, including one that paid a former Playboy model $150,000 to suppress claims of a nearly yearlong affair with the married Trump, which Trump also denies.In another instance, Pecker recounted a $30,000 payment from the National Enquirer to a doorman for the rights to a rumor that Trump had fathered a child with an employee at Trump World Tower. The tabloid concluded the story was not true, and the woman and Trump have denied the allegations.As Pecker described receiving the tip in court, Trump shook his head.Pecker said upon hearing the rumor, he immediately called Cohen, who said it was ""absolutely not true"" but that he would look into whether the people involved had indeed worked for Trump's company.""I made the decision to purchase the story because of the potential embarrassment it had to the campaign and to Mr. Trump,"" Pecker said.In response to the prosecutor's question about who he understood the boss to be, Pecker replied: ""Donald Trump.""Explaining why he decided to have the National Enquirer foot the bill, Pecker testified: ""This was going to be a very big story. I believe it was important that this story be removed from the marketplace.""If he published the story, Pecker said it would be ""probably the biggest sale of the National Enquirer since the death of Elvis Presley.""Trump' s 34 felony counts of falsifying business records arise from reimbursements that prosecutors say Trump's company made to Cohen over the hush money payments.The charges punishable by up to four years in prison - though it's unclear if Merchan would seek to put him behind bars. A conviction would not preclude Trump from becoming president again, but because it is a state case, he would not be able to pardon himself if found guilty. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.",David Pecker is the first witness in Trump's history-making hush money trial. He faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments.

Minnesota and other Democratic-led states lead pushback on censorship. They're banning the book ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/minnesota-and-other-democratic-led-states-lead-pushback-on-censorship-theyre-banning-the-book-ban/articleshow/109539911.cms,"ST PAUL: A movement to ban book bans is gaining steam in Minnesota and several other states, in contrast to the trend playing out in more conservative states where book challenges have soared to their highest levels in decades.As a queer and out youth, Shae Ross is encouraged. The 18-year-old senior in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington already has experience fighting bans on the local level against books dealing with sexuality, gender and race.Now, she is glad to see her governor and leaders of other states are taking the fight statewide.""For a lot of teenagers, LGBT teenagers and teenagers who maybe just don't feel like they have a ton of friends, or a ton of popularity in middle or high school ... literature becomes sort of an escape."" Ross said. ""Especially when I was like sixth, seventh grade, I'd say reading books, especially books with gay characters ... was a way that I could feel seen and represented.""Minnesota is one of several Democratic-leaning states where lawmakers are now pursuing bans on book bans. The Washington and Maryland legislatures have already passed them this year, while Illinois did so last year. It was a major flashpoint of Oregon's short session, where legislation passed the Senate but died without a House vote.According to the American Library Association, over 4,200 works in school and public libraries were targeted in 2023, a jump from the old record of nearly 2,600 books in 2022. Many challenged books - 47% in 2023 - had LGBTQ+ and racial themes.Restrictions in some states have increased so much that librarians and administrators fear crippling lawsuits, hefty fines and even imprisonment if they provide books that others regard as inappropriate. Already this year, lawmakers in more than 15 states have introduced bills to impose harsh penalties on libraries or librarians.Conservative parents and activists argue that the books are too sexually explicit or otherwise controversial, and are inappropriate, especially for younger readers. National groups such as Moms for Liberty say parents are entitled to more control over books available to their children.But pushback is emerging. According to EveryLibrary, a political action committee for libraries, several states are considering varying degrees of prohibitions on book bans. A sampling includes California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont, though some in conservative states appear unlikely to pass. One has also died in New Mexico this year.One such bill is awaiting Democratic Gov. Wes Moore's signature in Maryland. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed a bill last month that sets a high bar for removing challenged materials, especially those dealing with race, sexual orientation and gender identity. A version pending in New Jersey would protect librarians from civil or criminal liability.Some proposals are labeled ""Freedom to Read"" acts.""That's what's so critical here. The voluntary nature of reading,"" said Martha Hickson, a librarian at North Hunterdon High School in New Jersey. ""Students can choose to read, not read, or totally ignore everything in this library. No one is asking them to read a damn thing.""Hickson recalled how parents first suggested her book collections contained pedophilia and pornography during a school board meeting in 2021. She watched the livestream in horror as they objected that the novel ""Lawn Boy"" and illustrated memoir ""Gender Queer"" were available to students and suggested she could be criminally liable.""Tears welled up, shaking"" Hickson said. ""But once my body got done with that, my normal attitude, the fight side kicked in, and I picked up my cellphone while the meeting was still going on and started reaching out.""Book bans have been a sore point for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former high school teacher. The Minnesota Senate passed his proposal this month. It would prohibit book bans in public and school libraries based on content or ideological objections and require that the key decisions about what books will or won't be offered be made by library professionals.The state House is considering an approach with more teeth, including penalties and allowing private citizens to sue to enforce it.""I'm working with stakeholders, with the Department of Education, librarians, school districts and their representatives,"" said Democratic Rep. Cedrick Frazier, of New Hope. ""We're working to tighten up the language, to make sure we can come to a consensus, and just kind of make sure that everybody's on the same page.""Ross, a student at Jefferson High School in Bloomington, was alarmed when she heard last year that conservative groups were organizing in her community to ban books based on their content. So she and her friends got organized themselves, and they helped persuade their school board to make it much harder to remove books and other materials from their libraries and classrooms.Because of her activism, Ross was invited when Walz went to Como Park Senior High School in St. Paul last month to view a display of books banned elsewhere. The governor called book bans ""the antithesis of everything we believe"" and denounced what he depicted as a growing effort to bully school boards.At a House hearing last month, speakers said books by LGBTQ+ and authors of color are among those most frequently banned. Karlton Laster, director of policy and organizing for OutFront Minnesota, who identifies as Black and queer, said reading their works helped him ""communicate my hard feelings and truths to my family and friends,"" and helped him come out to his family.Kendra Redmond, a Bloomington mother with three children in public schools, testified about efforts to push back against a petition drive by conservatives to pull about 28 titles from the city's school libraries.Pushback from Ross, Redmond and others succeeded. The Bloomington School Board last month made it much harder to seek removals. Parents can still restrict access by their own children to material they deem objectionable.Many challenges in the district came from the Bloomington Parents Alliance. One of its leaders, Alan Redding, recalled how his son's 9th grade class was discussing a book a few years ago when graphic passages about date rape were read aloud in class. He said his son and other kids were unprepared for something so explicit.""They were clearly bothered by this and disgusted,"" Redding said. ""My son absolutely shut down for the semester.""Minnesota Republican lawmakers have argued that instead of worrying about book bans, they should be focusing instead on performance in a state where just under half of public school students can read at grade level.""Every book is banned for a child that doesn't know how to read,"" said GOP Rep Patricia Mueller, a teacher from Austin.","Minnesota is one of several Democratic-leaning states where lawmakers are now pursuing bans on book bans.

'Losing all credibility': Judge to Donald Trump's lawyer in hush money trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/losing-all-credibility-judge-to-donald-trumps-lawyer-in-hush-money-trial/articleshow/109538796.cms,"NEW DELHI: The judge presiding over Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial admonished Trump's lawyer on Tuesday, suggesting that he was ""losing all credibility"" as they deliberated whether the former president should face repercussions for violating a gag order preventing him from publicly criticizing witnesses and other individuals involved in the case.Prosecutors urged Justice Juan Merchan to impose a $10,000 fine on Trump for breaching the order. However, defense attorney Todd Blanche contended that Trump's responses were warranted against political attacks. Merchan deferred a decision on the prosecution's request.During the hearing, Merchan appeared to grow frustrated when Blanche failed to provide specific instances of the attacks prompting Trump's responses. The judge criticized Blanche for lacking case law or evidence to support his argument.""You've presented nothing,"" Merchan rebuked. ""I've asked you eight or nine times, show me the exact post he was responding to. You've not even been able to do that once.""""Mr. Blanche, you're losing all credibility. I have to tell you right now, you're losing all credibility with the court,"" Merchan added.The judge's gag order prohibits Trump from publicly denigrating witnesses, court officials, and their relatives. Trump has argued that it infringes upon his constitutional right to free speech.New York prosecutor Christopher Conroy alleged that Trump breached the order through posts on his Truth Social platform.""Defendant has violated this order repeatedly and hasn't stopped,"" Conroy asserted. ""The court should now hold him in contempt.""Conroy cited an April 10 post where Trump referred to porn star Stormy Daniels and his former lawyer Michael Cohen as ""sleazebags,"" both of whom are anticipated to testify in the trial. He also mentioned other posts leading to media coverage prompting a juror to withdraw last week over privacy concerns.""He knows what he's not allowed to do and he does it anyway,"" Conroy asserted regarding Trump's conduct. ""His disobedience of the order is willful. It's intentional.""The $10,000 fine sought by Conroy would represent a relatively minor penalty for Trump, who has posted $266.6 million in bonds while appealing civil judgments in two other cases.Conroy clarified that he was not currently seeking to have Trump jailed for up to 30 days, as permitted by New York law.""The defendant seems to be angling for that,"" Conroy remarked.Blanche contended that Trump's posts were responses to political attacks by Cohen and were unrelated to the expected testimony of his former lawyer.""He's allowed to respond to political attacks,"" Blanche argued.Trump faces charges from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment made just before the 2016 US election to silence Daniels about an alleged sexual encounter in 2006, which Trump denies.The trial, which could influence Trump's candidacy for the Nov. 5 election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden, may be the only one of his four criminal prosecutions to reach trial before the election. A guilty verdict would not disqualify Trump from running, but it could damage his candidacy.","The judge's gag order prohibits Trump from publicly denigrating witnesses, court officials, and their relatives.

This has included private meetings and calls warning that Washington stands ready to implement sanctions against Chinese financial institutions that facilitate this trade.As per the WSJ report, the potential sanctions would target banks that handle significant transactions aiding Russia’s military-industrial base, potentially cutting them off from accessing the US dollar, a move described by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as exposing these banks to the ""risk of US sanctions.""These discussions and warnings come at a time when China and Russia have increased trade in the yuan instead of the dollar, a strategic shift that may protect them from potential escalation in U.S. sanctions. This financial maneuvering aims to fortify their economies against external pressures, especially from the West.The stakes are high, as the West, including figures like Blinken, has expressed concerns that Russia could potentially outlast Ukraine in a protracted conflict if it continues to receive such robust support from China. This situation has led to significant discussions among Western allies on how to effectively counteract this support.The implications of cutting major banks off from the global financial system are profound. Such actions are generally seen as a last resort due to their broad economic impacts, affecting not just the targeted institutions but also their customers and the broader financial stability of the country involved.China's response to the potential sanctions has been one of defiance, with its foreign ministry denouncing the US actions as ""economic coercion, unilateralism, and bullying.""","U.S. preparing sanctions that could sever some Chinese banks from the global financial system, aiming to halt Beijing's commercial backing of Russia's military enhancements.

NEW DELHI: Russia's economy may only maintain its current strength for another 18 months before beginning to falter, according to insights from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The Washington DC-based think tank highlighted Russia's robust economic performance despite increased military expenditures and extensive Western trade sanctions related to its ongoing conflict in Ukraine.Despite these challenges, the International Monetary Fund has projected that Russia's economy will grow faster than all other developed economies this year, including the United States.This growth has been partly attributed to Russia's ability to circumvent sanctions by selling oil to allies and importing Western goods through third-party nations.""A paradoxical situation has emerged: Russia's economy is now stable both in spite of and as a result of Western sanctions ,"" said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. She further explained in her report that while Russia's economic stability appears solid, it is not sustainable indefinitely. ""But this hard-won stability is not eternal. In a best-case scenario, the current arrangement will likely begin to come apart within eighteen months owing to growing imbalances and possible social problems,"" Prokopenko cautioned.Russia is currently grappling with a policy ""trilemma,"" facing the challenge of funding its military operations, maintaining living standards for its citizens, and keeping the economy stable—goals that are becoming increasingly difficult to achieve simultaneously. The Kremlin's record spending on military efforts this year could exacerbate these challenges, as defense expenditure is generally seen as economically unproductive.Furthermore, living conditions in Russia are at risk of deteriorating. Inflation has spiked, forcing the central bank to hike interest rates to 16%. This measure, although aimed at controlling inflation, may reduce workers' real incomes and lead to broader economic contraction. The resulting financial strain could increase Russians' debt distress and heighten the risk of social discontent.Economists have also raised concerns about the long-term impacts of a shrinking workforce, declining productivity, and Russia's growing isolation from the global economy. ""In an economy subordinate to political imperatives, there are few incentives for sustainable development. Sooner or later, this will hurt the well-being of ordinary Russians,"" Prokopenko concluded, suggesting that temporary economic fixes might lead to significant political and economic challenges for the Kremlin.","Russia's economy may only maintain its current strength for another 18 months before beginning to falter.

Judge to consider gag order violations in Trump hush money trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-to-consider-gag-order-violations-in-trump-hush-money-trial/articleshow/109530418.cms,"NEW YORK: The judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will decide on Tuesday whether the former US president should be punished for violating a gag order that prevents him from criticizing witnesses and others involved in the case.Prosecutors are asking Justice Juan Merchan to fine Trump for criticizing porn star Stormy Daniels and his former lawyer Michael Cohen, both of whom are expected to testify.They also have highlighted Trump's claim last week that people were lying to get on the jury so they could convict him.Merchan could opt to fine Trump $1,000 for each of those violations, as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg 's office has requested.Prosecutors have asked Merchan to remind Trump at the 9:30 a.m. hearing (1330 GMT) he may face more severe consequences if he keeps violating the order. The law permits the judge to send Trump to jail for up to 30 days, in what would be a dramatic twist to the first criminal trial of a former US president.Trump says the partial gag order, which prevents him from publicly criticizing witnesses, court officials and their relatives, is a violation of free speech.Trump is charged with falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment before the 2016 election to buy Daniels' silence about a sexual encounter she says they had in 2006. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies an encounter took place.Prosecutors say it was part of a wider conspiracy to hide unflattering information from voters at a time when he was facing multiple accusations of sexual misbehavior.""It was election fraud , pure and simple,"" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said on Monday.In his opening statement on Monday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche said Trump did not commit any crimes. ""There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy,"" Blanche told jurors on Monday.He said Trump acted to protect his family and his reputation and accused Daniels of trying to profit from a false accusation that they had sex.On Tuesday, jurors are expected to hear more testimony starting at 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker , who prosecutors say participated in a ""catch and kill"" scheme to suppress unflattering stories about Trump and help him get elected.Pecker, 72, testified on Monday that his company paid for stories - an unusual practice in journalism.American Media, which published the National Enquirer, admitted in 2018 that it paid $150,000 to former Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal for her story about a months-long affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. American Media said it worked ""in concert"" with Trump's campaign, and it never published a story.The tabloid reached a similar deal to pay $30,000 to a doorman who was seeking to sell a story about Trump allegedly fathering a child out of wedlock, which turned out to be false, according to prosecutors.Trump has said the payments were personal and did not violate election law. He has also denied an affair with McDougal.The case may be the only one of the Republican Trump's four criminal prosecutions to go to trial before his Nov. 5 election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.A guilty verdict would not bar Trump from taking office but it could hurt his candidacy. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows that half of independent voters and one in four Republicans say they would not vote for Trump if he is convicted of a crime.","Donald Trump is charged with falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment before the 2016 election.

Donald Trump tried to illegally influence the 2016 US presidential election by paying hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels , prosecutors alleged on Monday.The former US president faced court in Manhattan on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records over payments he made to his former lawyer, Michael Cohen , that prosecutors say were reimbursements for money paid to Daniels in order to bury her claims of a sexual encounter.""This was a planned, long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, to help Donald Trump get elected through illegal expenditures to silence people who had something bad to say about his behavior,"" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told the court.""It was election fraud, pure and simple.""Trump's lawyers rejected the allegations during the hearing.""I have a spoiler alert: there's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,"" attorney Todd Blanche said. ""It's called democracy.""The trial could last up to two months and requires Trump — who is the favorite in the Republican presidential primaries — to spend his days in a courtroom rather than on the campaign trail.""I'm the leading candidate ... and this is what they're trying to take me off the trail for. Checks being paid to a lawyer,"" Trump said after the hearing on Monday.A guilty verdict would not preclude Trump from becoming president again, but he would not be able to pardon himself because it is a state case rather than a federal case.The former US president also faces separate indictments on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Biden and for hoarding secret documents at his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida, both of which he denies.While those cases have been repeatedly delayed due to challenges by his legal team, the New York hush money case has so far run on schedule.","The former US president faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.

The home is the mayor's official residence, on Irving Boulevard west of downtown.""Mayor Bass and her family were not injured and are safe,"" her office said in a statement. ""The Mayor is grateful to LAPD for responding and arresting the suspect.""Bass told reporters Monday, ""I am fine. My family is fine.""The LAPD identified the suspect in the burglary investigation as 29-year-old Ephraim Matthew Hunter, a city resident. He was being held on $100,000 bail, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department website said.Public records do not show if Hunter has a lawyer who can speak on his behalf. The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office said in an email that LAPD investigators have been in contact with prosecutors to review the investigation.Bass' office and the LAPD did not respond to questions about security protocols at the residence.The Los Angeles Times, citing public records, said Hunter was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon following a 2015 attack on a man in Massachusetts and served seven years in state prison.The newspaper said Josephine Duah, who identified herself as Hunter's mother, said she spoke with her son Monday from jail and he told her he allegedly entered the property because he believed he was being pursued by someone who wanted to harm him and did not know who owned the residence. She said her son planned to enter a drug treatment clinic on Monday but never made it.Bass served as a Democratic member of Congress from 2011 until her election as the city's 43rd mayor in 2022. The former state Assembly leader is the first woman and second Black person to hold the post, after former Mayor Tom Bradley, who held the position from 1973 to 1993.The arrest recalled the October 2022 break-in at former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco home, in which her husband, Paul Pelosi, was attacked with a hammer. A jury last year found David DePape guilty of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official.The attack raised questions about the security provided for members of Congress and their families. The US Capitol Police had a camera at the residence but it was not being monitored at the time of the attack because Nancy Pelosi was not home.","Ephraim Matthew Hunter, 29, is being held on $100,000 bail.

Pakistan was supposed to finish construction on its territory by the end of 2014, but work stalled, leading to tensions between the two nations.The Iranian president is set to meet with his Pakistani counterpart Asil Ali Zardari who helped launch the pipeline project after travelling to Iran in 2013.He also met with Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.

By-elections were held on Sunday on 21 National and provincial assembly seats amidst tight security and suspension of cellular and internet services in specific districts of Punjab and Balochistan to maintain law and order.Two seats each of the National Assembly in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and one seat in Sindh, while twelve seats of the Punjab Assembly and two each of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan assemblies were up for grabs.Major political parties including the PML-N, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) participated in the by-polls. However, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl of Maulana Fazlur Rehman boycotted the polls.The Election Committee of Pakistan (ECP) has yet to issue the final results but private media channels shared the outcome based on the results of individual polling stations.According to the Dunya News channel, the PML-N won two National Assembly seats while one each was grabbed by PPP, SIC and an independent candidate.The preliminary result showed that PML-N won 10 out of 16 seats in the provincial assemblies , including nine from Punjab and one from Balochistan. One seat each was won by the PPP, the SIC, the Istehkam Pakistan Party, the Pakistan Muslim League, the Balochistan National Party and an independent candidate.Cases of sporadic violence were reported and in one case, a supporter of the PML-N was killed after a clash with PTI voters in the Narowal area of Punjab.

The warning came after Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (FSVPS) issued a notification regarding violations of international and Russian phytosanitary requirements over a shipment of rice imported from Pakistan.Dated April 2, the notification highlights the presence of a quarantine organism, ""Megaselia scalaris (Loew),"" in the rice consignment.Pakistan's trade representative at its embassy in Russia was asked to carry out an immediate investigation into the matter.The Russian authorities have written to the Pakistan embassy to prevent such violations and ensure all Pakistani rice exporters follow phytosanitary standards to ensure the safety of agricultural products traded between the two countries.The trade wing of the Pakistani embassy in Moscow, while forwarding the Russian authority's letter to the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) in the Ministry of Food Security and other relevant government offices, has warned of a possible ban on rice exports in future if more complaints were received from Russian authorities.Russia had previously imposed a ban on rice imports from Pakistan in 2019 because of health safety reasons.Similarly, in December 2006, Russia stopped the import of rice from Pakistan for not meeting food safety standards.Chairman of the Pakistan Rice Exporters Association, Chela Ram Kewlani, said that Pakistani rice exporters needed to be very careful in choosing and packaging all rice for export.He said that Pakistan had benefited from India banning exports of non-Basmati rice last year, given that India has a nearly 40 per cent share in the globally traded rice.Last year, India banned the export of white non-Basmati and parboiled rice.According to a leading Pakistani rice dealer, about 700,000 tonnes of rice were exported in December 2023 alone, the highest in a month for the fiscal year.He said Pakistan exported rice with an increase in higher production and demand and elevated global prices last year.The Rice Export Corporation is projecting a 60 per cent jump in exports of Basmati rice to over a million tonnes and a 36 per cent jump for non-Basmati rice to 4.25 million tonnes from Pakistan.It is eyeing exports of above five million metric tonnes of all rice in the fiscal year of 2023/2024, which would be much higher than last fiscal year's exports of 3.7 million tonnes.",Russia has warned Pakistan that it would ban rice imports again if Moscow's phytosanitary concerns are not addressed in future consignments.

Despite the conflict's international ramifications, it has not garnered widespread attention.In recent months, resistance fighters in Myanmar's remote areas have been consistently defeating the ruling military junta , surprising analysts and raising the possibility of the junta's collapse.The war has become a human rights disaster , with Myanmar's economy in shambles since the 2021 military coup, plunging millions into extreme poverty. The country's reputation as a center for drugs, online scams, and money laundering is growing, and its instability has created strategic challenges for China, India, the United States, and other nations.The civil war has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 3 million others.

The health sector is in crisis, with childhood vaccinations essentially halted and a substantial increase in malaria cases.
