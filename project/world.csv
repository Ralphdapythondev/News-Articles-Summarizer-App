'He was so nice to me ...': Trump reveals what Biden & Kamala said after 2nd assassination attempt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-was-so-nice-to-me-trump-reveals-what-biden-kamala-said-after-2nd-assassination-attempt/articleshow/113440579.cms,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday revealed that President Joe Biden and vice president Kamala Harris were “so nice” in their calls made after the second assassination attempt on him.While speaking at a campaign town hall in Michigan, Trump described his conversation with Biden, saying, “He was so nice to me yesterday. In one way, I sort of wish the call hadn’t been made because I do feel a little — He’s so nice.‘I’m so sorry about what happened and all that.’”Trump also recounted his call with Harris, stating, “Same with Kamala today. She could not have been nicer.” When Trump mentioned the “very nice call” he had with Harris, the crowd responded with boos. However, Trump countered, “No, it was very nice.”The former president was quickly evacuated from Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Sunday after a Secret Service agent discovered a gunman hiding in the bushes. The gunman, Ryan Wesley Routh , 58, was found with an AK-47-style rifle, a GoPro camera, and two backpacks. Routh fled but was later arrested on I-95. This marks the second assassination attempt on Trump since July. Routh has been charged with two gun-related crimes.Both Biden and Harris have condemned the incident and political violence in general.In an interview with Fox News Digital, Trump claimed that Routh was influenced by Biden and Harris' rhetoric, attributing the violence against him to their comments. Trump accused them of inciting attacks on him while he works to save the country.Democrats have accused Trump of escalating tensions and label him a ""threat to democracy,"" particularly due to his involvement in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. President Biden recently criticised Trump for inciting hate, referring to his comments about Haitian immigrants, while Trump contends that Biden and Harris' policies are weakening the US and diminishing its global respect.","The former president was evacuated from Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Sunday after a Secret Service agent discovered a gunman hiding in the bushes.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim govt said on Tuesday that former PM Sheikh Hasina was ""staying"" in India as the neighbouring country's govt ""has given her shelter"" after her departure from Dhaka. ""We will have to see this matter this way. Everything does not go by the law,"" Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Mohammed Touhid Hossain said.The foreign adviser's remarks came while responding to a question on her status in India as her diplomatic passport has been cancelled.He said Bangladesh does not know anything officially from the Indian side except what external affairs minister S Jaishankar said after she went to India.It has been over a month since Hasina landed at a military base near Delhi after a dramatic exit from her country on Aug 5. She was expected to stay in India for just a short period but reports say her attempts to seek asylum in the UK, US and UAE have not been successful so far, according to the BBC.Due to slow progress in the law and order situation in Bangladesh, the interim govt has given magistracy powers to commissioned officers of the Bangladesh army , reports AKM Moinuddin.

According to Bower, Harry expected his family to see similarities between his late mother, Diana, and Meghan, but was left disappointed. “No one agreed that his vulnerable mother had anything in common with his girlfriend. More discomforting for him, they thought Meghan would not fit in with the Royal Family ,” Bower wrote. As Mirror.co.uk reports, this sentiment was voiced by Charles Spencer, Diana's brother, who, at the request of Prince William, weighed in on the matter.Spencer, who had been married three times, reportedly urged his nephew to reconsider rushing into marriage. His words, however, provoked a strong reaction from Harry, who later reflected on how difficult it was to establish Meghan’s place in the family.Earl Spencer wasn’t the only person to express doubts about Harry and Meghan’s relationship. According to Bower, Meghan's former talent agent, Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne, also cautioned the former actress that Royal life would mean giving up her career. Meghan, however, did not take this advice well and reportedly reacted with “hard fury” at the notion she would have to stop acting.Despite these 'warnings', Harry and Meghan went on to marry in 2018. However, tensions within the Royal Family have been well-documented, and the couple stepped back from their Royal duties in 2020.","Earl Spencer was reportedly asked to counsel his nephew on the difficulties Meghan might face in adjusting to royal life.

"World Oldest Living Animal: Jonathan, world's oldest living land animal, who is 191 years old",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/meet-jonathan-worlds-oldest-living-land-animal-who-is-191-years-old/articleshow/113412810.cms,"Jonathan's diet and routine

'He could actually be older'

A popular tourist attraction

Jonathan , born in 1832, holds the title of the world’s oldest living land animal . As of 2024, Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise , is estimated to be 191 years old.Jonathan lives at the governor’s residence on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. He was brought to Saint Helena in 1882 and has since become a beloved figure there.Veterinarian Joe Hollins , who has cared for Jonathan and three other tortoises on Saint Helena since 2009, celebrates Jonathan's birthday each year on New Year’s Day.Although the governor of Saint Helena, Nigel Phillips, has unofficially assigned Jonathan a hatch date of December 4, 1832, Hollins prefers to celebrate on New Year’s Day, honoring Jonathan’s age rather than his exact birthdate. On his birthday, Jonathan typically spends his day slowly roaming in search of fresh clover and taking an afternoon nap, according to Hollins.Jonathan’s diet consists of various vegetation, including grasses, leaves, and fruits, which are essential for his health and longevity. His caretakers ensure he receives a balanced diet.Weighing approximately 200 kg and measuring about 1.2 meters in length, Jonathan remains in relatively good health despite his age. He spends his days basking in the sun, eating grass and leaves, and interacting with visitors. His remarkable longevity has made him a popular tourist attraction.Though Jonathan is blind and lacks a sense of smell, he still has excellent hearing.According to Hollins, Jonathan’s age could be even greater than recorded.Historical records show Jonathan grazing the governor’s mansion grounds between 1882 and 1886. A letter mentions that he was fully grown when he arrived from the Seychelles Islands in 1882, meaning he was at least 50 years old at that time. Hollins highlights Jonathan’s historical significance, noting that he was around 50 years old when the incandescent lightbulb was invented. During his lifetime, Jonathan has seen 31 governors come and go.Jonathan has exceeded the average life expectancy of 150 years for a land tortoise. As he has entered his 92nd year, Hollins remains hopeful that Jonathan will continue to greet visitors well into his third century.Hollins shares a deep affection for Jonathan, calling it a privilege to care for him. When Hollins first arrived, Jonathan had health issues, including cataracts and a deteriorating beak. Hollins introduced fresh fruits and vegetables into Jonathan’s diet, which significantly improved his health.Jonathan has become a major attraction on Saint Helena, drawing around 1,500 tourists annually. Due to high visitor interest, a tortoise corridor was introduced to allow tourists to view Jonathan without disturbing him.“He loves the chatter and interaction,” said Hollins, as quoted by The Washington Post, noting that Jonathan also enjoys the sounds from a nearby tennis court.“Whatever happens, I think we can be satisfied that we’ve done our best for him,” Hollins said, expressing his hope to be present for Jonathan’s 200th birthday celebration.","Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise, is estimated to be 191 years old.

Drugged and raped for a decade, woman becomes symbol of courage and resilience",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-gisele-pelicot-drugged-and-raped-for-a-decade-woman-becomes-symbol-of-courage-and-resilience/articleshow/113383469.cms,"Who is Gisele Pelicot?

Gisele Pelicot case explained

What is going on in court?

Hundreds of people, mostly women, came out in the street in support of Gisele Pelicot, a woman who was allegedly drugged by her ex-husband (who was her husband at that time) for a decade and he recruited dozens of strangers to rape her which has shocked the nation.The feminist associations have called for some 30 gatherings on Saturday in cities ranging from Marseille to Paris, where on the Place de la Republique banners read “Support to Gisele” or “Shame Must Change Camp” or “Victims We believe you”.Pelicot has become France ’s symbol of the fight against sexual violence , AP New reported.A 72-year-old woman caught the attention of headlines when she filed a case against her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot of repeatedly raping her and enlisting strangers to abuse his heavily sedated wife in the couple’s home over the course of a decade.Since the beginning of the case Pelicot has to go through a rough path. She chose to go for a public trial to alert the public to sexual abuse and drug-induced blackouts.During this trial, she had to face 51 of her alleged rapists which is due to run until December. People are praised for her courage and composure.She also allowed journalists to use her full name in their articles or the other platforms and even gave a nod to the court to exhibit explicit videos recorded by her husband showing men engaging in sexual intercourse with her naked, inert body.Her bold and courageous behaviour is praised by the entire France nation and even foreign countries.In an open letter translated into English and published in the French newspaper Le Monde, journalist and author Helene Devynck thanked Pelicot for her bravery, echoing the feelings of many other French people.“You entered our lives like you entered the Avignon court, through the front door,” wrote Devynck, a figure of the French #MeToo movement. “It’s not just you, Gisele, that they’ve treated like a thing. They were telling us, all of us women, how insignificant we are. Your strength restores ours. Thank you for this immense gift.”According to the police, the abuse began in 2011 when the couple lived near Paris and continued after their move to Mazan. Dominique routinely drugged his wife and invited strangers to join him in assaulting her, often filming the encounters. Pelicot has no memory of the attacks but will see many of them played in court as dozens of defendants go on trial in Avignon, France, between now and December. The revelation of his abuse has destroyed a formerly tight-knit family, and the reason behind his actions remains unclear.Pelicot came to know about this horrifying act through the police who gave her the information.Dominique’s crimes came to light in 2020 when he was caught filming women up their skirts in a supermarket. Upon investigation, authorities uncovered the scale of the abuse. He and 50 other men are now on trial for aggravated rape, with the proceedings expected to last four months. The victims of these attacks included various individuals, from a fire brigade officer to a journalist, and while most participated only once, some returned multiple times.Pelicot will face the man with whom she shared her life for over 50 years and the father of their three children on Monday. Her lawyer has said she is planning on attending his testimony.Her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, for health reasons, has been exempted from attending the trial since last week. He is expected to testify on Monday or Tuesday, his lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro, has said.Dominique has previously confessed to the crimes to investigators, but his court hearing will be crucial for the panel of judges to decide on the fate of the 50 other men accused of rape, reported AP news agency.Some defendants have claimed they believed a husband's consent for sexual intercourse was sufficient, while others said they were tricked by Dominique Pelicot into believing his wife was consenting.One lawyer representing six defendants has shocked the nation by arguing that ""there is rape and rape, and without intention, there is no rape.""","Gisele Pelicot, 72, has been accused of repeatedly raping her ex-husband Dominique.

The man did not fire at Trump, who was about 500 yards away golfing with a friend.Soon after the incident, Trump assured his followers that he was safe and well. “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL! Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” he posted on his platform ""Truth Social.""He later thanked the Secret Service and law enforcement for keeping him safe on what he called “an interesting day."" One lawmaker who spoke to Trump after the incident said he had joked about not being able to complete his round of gold.In an oblique reference to an earlier assassination attempt on him in Pennsylvania, Trump later wrote, ""When you’re “hot” the lowlifes really shoot at you... and they try hitting from every angle! Never let the bastards get you down.""In separate statements, President Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris expressed relief that Trump was unharmed and said the was no place for political violence in the country, as activists on both sides accused the other of engendering the atmosphere conducive to such violence.Social media posts matching Routh's name showed him strongly supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia, and urging the US Congress to allow Americans to fight in the conflict.He had also been in the public eye a few times after encounters with the media and law enforcement. In an NYT interview in 2023, he said he was trying to recruit Afghan solders who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine. He had also been arrested in 2002 in Greensboro, North Carolina, after barricading himself inside a building with an automatic weapon.Tracked down by a tabloid, his estranged son Oran Routh told the Daily Mail that his father was a ""great dad"" and a ""nice guy"" and he hates Trump -- like “all reasonable people.”Although Trump praised the Secret Service and law enforcement for acting quickly to protect him, questions raged about how a potential assassin managed to get so close to the former president again.“There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened in Florida,” Republican lawmaker Elise Stefanik said in a statement.""Two assassination attempts in 60 days on a former President & the Republican nominee is unacceptable. The Secret Service must come to Congress tomorrow, tell us what resources are needed to expand the protective perimeter, & lets allocate it in a bipartisan vote the same day,"" California Democrat Ro Khanna tweeted.The Trump campaign responded by promoting the Republican candidate's message of unity and peace, while simultaneously directing supporters to a fundraising page.On the other hand, Democrats focused on gun control issues, questioning how a potential assassin with a criminal record was able to acquire an AK-47.","Man with a gun was lying in ambush at a Florida resort where the MAGA supremo was golfing.

Abiad also mentioned that about 200 people are in critical condition, with victims receiving treatment in over 150 hospitals.When asked about the details of the information the US has collected, Miller explained that the US is gathering facts similarly to journalists but did not provide a public update. He also refrained from speculating on the involvement of any parties, including Israel. Miller stressed that the US aims to see a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and preferred not to comment on the potential implications of the incident at this stage.In response to questions about Iran's possible role, Miller declined to speculate, urging that any information should be confirmed before drawing conclusions. He reiterated that the US would advise Iran against exploiting the incident to heighten regional tensions.""I never want to comment or speculate about the impact of any one incident, especially in the early stages of the incident. I am not going to do so here, that has been our policy to try to avoid doing. Our overall policy remains consistent, which is we do want to see a diplomatic resolution to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. We want to see one that allows the tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes and tens of thousands of Lebanese who have been displaced from their homes to return home. That's what we are continuing to pursue,"" he said.Hezbollah has reported that the explosions, which they attribute to malfunctioning pagers used by their personnel, resulted in the deaths of two fighters and a civilian. The group described the incident as their ""biggest security breach"" in nearly a year. Meanwhile, unverified reports from Arab media suggest that the explosions may be linked to an Israeli cyber attack, although no official statement has been issued by the Israeli military.Israel’s Security Cabinet has updated its war objectives, now including the safe return of northern residents displaced by Hezbollah attacks as a key goal. This comes amid Israel's ongoing conflict with Hamas. The Gaza health ministry reported on Tuesday that 41,252 Palestinians have been killed and 95,497 injured as a result of Israel's military offensive on Gaza since October 7.","The U.S. state department has denied any involvement or prior knowledge of the series of pager explosions that struck Lebanon on Tuesday.

The suspect, 58-year-old Ryan Routh, was arrested and appeared in court on Monday, facing two gun-related charges.This incident follows rising tensions between the Trump campaign and the Secret Service, which have been brewing for the past two months, particularly after the first attempt on Trump's life in July.""Former President Trump is receiving the highest level of protection that the US Secret Service can provide, and we will continue to evaluate and adjust our specific protective measures and methodology based on each location and situation,"" Secret Service spokesperson Melissa McKenzie said on Tuesday.Trump on Tuesday told Fox News ""we've long requested more people"" and that additional Secret Service protection was forthcoming.""I think we are getting it now.

""They say they support IVF—here you go, vote on this,"" Duckworth said, drawing on her own experience with fertility treatments.The push for this legislation gained momentum following a controversial ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court, which classified frozen embryos as children.

Khorram, who has not been charged with any crime, is noted as a potential key figure in the ongoing investigation.An insider close to the federal probe told the New York Post that Khorram, as Combs' Chief of Staff, would have been deeply involved in the management and execution of any illicit activities. ""If anybody is the gatekeeper, Kristina would know everything,"" the source told NYPost.Khorram’s role in the scandal is further highlighted by a lawsuit filed earlier this year by rapper Lil Rod, born Rodney Jones. In the suit, Khorram is likened to Ghislaine Maxwell, suggesting she played a role akin to Maxwell’s in Epstein’s criminal network. Lil Rod’s complaint alleges that Khorram orchestrated the procurement of sex workers for Combs and maintained a system where employees were allegedly required to carry drugs for the rapper’s use.The lawsuit also claims that Khorram was instrumental in managing the operations described as ""Freak Offs,"" where sex workers were provided with drugs and other supplies for illicit activities.

Insiders, as quoted by Daily Mail, said either Kimberly did not know about Bettina or didn't want to know.""She's no fool but it's easy to deceive yourself when you are so committed to someone and believe he's committed to you,"" an insider was quoted.37-year-old Bettina Anderson is a Florida socialite -- the daughter of Inger and the late Harry Loy Anderson Jr. Her closeness with Don Jr is an open secret in Florida town and they are often spotted together -- comfortable and cosy. Photos of them kissing several times during the meal at The Honor Bar triggered speculations that they do not want their relationship to be secret anymore.People believe Donald Trump Jr is wayward and not accountable for what he does to anyone -- at least not to Kimberley, but probably his father.Bettina is a model, a bachelor of arts in art history, criticism and conservation from Columbia University.55-year-old Kimberly Guilfoyle is nine years older than Donald Trump Jr. A former prosecutor, Guilfoyle was married twice -- once to Gavin Newsom, the present California Democratic governor.

Donald Trump: Polls show Kamala Harris edging ahead of Trump with 61 percent chances of winning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/polls-show-kamala-harris-edging-ahead-of-trump-with-61-percent-chances-of-winning/articleshow/113435087.cms,"WASHINGTON: Kamala Harris has widened her lead over Donald Trump in all but one of dozen different polls tracked by the polling aggregator 538 after their presidential debate . Her lead in nationwide popular vote now ranges between 2 points to 7 points, with most of them beyond the typical 3.5 point margin of error. Only one poll by AtlasIntel puts Trump ahead by four.While Trump could lose the national popular vote and still clinch the Presidency by winning the electoral college determined by votes in individual states, the bad news for the Trump campaign is 538 now gives him only a 39 percent chance of winning the electoral college, while boosting Harris's odds to 61 per cent.In 1000 simulations run by the aggregator, Harris won 609 times while Trump won 387 times, with no winner four times.The polls were conducted before the second purported assassination attempt on Trump, which some of the MAGA media is lamenting is not being taken seriously by the mainstream media. 538 is owned by ABC News, which Trump accuses of being in cahoots with the Kamala Harris and tilting last week's debate to favor her.However, Nate Silver , who originally founded 538 before it was bought by ABC News, gives Trump the opposite numbers. His model, on blog Silver Bulletin, had the reverse odds for the election, putting Trump at 60 percent and Harris at 38 percent.Such simulated numbers are dodgy considering Hillary Clinton was given more than 90 percent chances of winning on the eve of the 2016 election.Both sides are accusing each other of manipulating polls to claim victory in the event of a close election, with many analysts concerned about the possibility of gridlock and violence on November 5. Typically election results become apparent by late night on election day, particularly if one side wins convincingly. But close race where getting to 270 electoral college votes needed to win boils down to one or two states is expected to cause tensions because some states -- notably Pennsylvania -- could take a long time to count mail-in ballots.Every state, and sometimes even counties, have different election rules and laws. Pennsylvania does not begin to sort out mail-in ballots till the morning of the election, while some states allow sorting (not opening) before election day to expedite counting. A large percentage of Pennsylvania's ballots come from in and around Democrat-leaning Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and they take a long time to count, usually giving Republicans early leads in the state before Democrats close the gap. Some analysts suggest a candidate could potentially declare a win on the basis of early leads to muddy the waters and not allow the process of counting and certification.Already, there are surveys showing nearly half of Republicans saying they won’t accept the results of the presidential election if their candidate loses, and some of them say they would “take action to overturn” the results. About a quarter of Democrats said they wouldn’t accept the results if their candidate loses, but fewer Democrats than Republicans said they would “take action to overturn” the results.A poll by the nonpartisan World Justice Project did not ask people what specific “action” they would take to overturn the election results, only that that 46% of Republicans and 27% of Democrats wouldn't accept results, and 14% of Republicans compared to 11% of Democrats said they would ""take action.""","Kamala Harris has widened her lead over Donald Trump in all but one of dozen different polls tracked by the polling aggregator 538.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.

According to sources of Geo News, the chief minister was ""busy in various meetings"" in the federal capital following the party's power display.After his return, the opposition party maintained that Gandapur had a lengthy meeting with government representatives to discuss the state of law and order in the province and that he was not reachable because of cell phone jammers at the meeting site.Speaking to the members of the bar council today, the KP CM urged the organisations to change their ways, claiming that doing so would benefit the populace, the nation, and each individual.""Sit with the incarcerated PTI founder and resolve issues"" was another request he made.

Pakistani policeman kills blasphemy suspect inside police station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-policeman-kills-blasphemy-suspect-inside-police-station/articleshow/113288514.cms,"A police officer in Quetta , Pakistan, shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday. Khan had been arrested on Wednesday after being taken from an angry mob that accused him of insulting the Prophet Muhammad.The police officer responsible for the shooting has been arrested, according to police official Mohammad Khurram , who did not provide additional information.In Pakistan, accusations of blasphemy are common and can lead to mob violence and lynching, even if they are just rumors. The country's controversial blasphemy laws allow for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or Islamic religious figures, although no executions have been carried out.Before his arrest, local residents claimed Khan had used derogatory remarks against the prophet and went after him. After his arrest, a mob surrounded the police station, demanding that Khan be handed over to them for execution. One person threw a grenade at the station on Wednesday, and a group of Islamists briefly blocked a key road in the city, demanding punishment for Khan. The crowd eventually dispersed after officials managed to calm them down.Pakistan has seen an increase in attacks on blasphemy suspects in recent years. In June, a mob in Madyan lynched a tourist accused of desecrating the holy Quran, and in 2022, a mob in Punjab province attacked churches and homes of Christians after claiming they saw a local Christian and his friend desecrating pages from a Quran. The attack in Jaranwala drew nationwide condemnation, but Christians say the men linked to the violence have not yet been put on trial.In 2011, a policeman killed a former governor of Punjab province after accusing him of blasphemy. The officer, Mumtaz Qadri , was later sentenced to death and hanged, but support for him grew after his execution, with tens of thousands attending his funeral in Rawalpindi. Many in Punjab still consider him a martyr today.Quetta, a conservative city in southwestern Pakistan, is also the capital of the restive Balochistan province, where militant groups stage near-daily attacks and separatists have waged a decades-long insurgency against the government in Islamabad.","A police officer shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday.

"'SheCTV camera': Pakistani father installs CCTV on daughter's head for security, video gets viral",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shectv-camera-pakistani-father-installs-cctv-on-daughters-head-for-security-video-gets-viral/articleshow/113277489.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking the daughter's security one step ahead, a father in Pakistan attached a CCTV camera to her head. The unusual protective measure has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread discussion and debate.The video which went viral on social media platform X, shows the woman being interviewed with a large camera mounted on her head. When asked about the camera, she explained that her father installed it to monitor her movements and ensure her safety.She further stated that, while it might seem extreme to some, she had no objections to her father's decision.This remarkable act of protection, according to the daughter, was sparked by a recent tragedy in Karachi, where another woman lost her life in a violent incident. Her parents, deeply concerned about her safety, devised this innovative idea as a preventive measure.In the video, the daughter referred to her father as her personal ""security guard,"" noting that he will monitor her closely using the camera. She acknowledged that the risk of violence is real, especially following the incident in Karachi, and said her family wanted to do everything possible to protect her.The clip, captioned ""next level security,"" got huge views from social media users sharing their reactions. While some praised the father's dedication, others responded with humour, questioning the practicality of such an extreme measure.One user sarcastically commented, "" Itna digital bhi nahi hona tha "" (There was no need to be this digital).Another remarked, "" Piche se marega to nahi dikhega "" (It won’t help if someone attacks from behind).","The unusual protective measure has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread discussion and debate.

Opposition party BNP demands for quick election in Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/opposition-party-bnp-demands-for-quick-election-in-bangladesh/articleshow/113435654.cms,"NEW DELHI: Thousands of activists and leaders from the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party took to the streets of Dhaka on Tuesday to call for a democratic change through elections. They gathered outside the BNP headquarters, chanting slogans and demanding a fresh election, as the interim government has not yet provided a timeline for when polling will occur.Headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus , the interim government has announced numerous plans to reform various sectors of the country, ranging from the Election Commission to financial institutions. However, major political parties - including the BNP, headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia - are demanding a new election anytime soon.Yunus took command of the nation after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country during a mass uprising last month, ending a 15-year spell in power, since which she has been living in India. The protests that began in July soon morphed into an anti-government movement.Yunus hasn't outlined the topic of a new national election in his recent speeches and said they would stay in power as long as the people want them to stay. Recently, a team of newspaper editors said that Yunus should complete crucial reforms first and stay in power for at least two years.Initially, BNP demanded an election within three months, but later said it wanted to allow the interim government time for reforms. The country's main Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party, which was once officially an alliance partner under Zia's party, also wants to give the Yunus-led government more time before an election.Tarique Rahman, the BNP's acting chairman and heir apparent to Zia, addressed supporters online from London, where he has been in exile since 2008. On Tuesday, he expressed that while his party supports the interim government's proposed reforms, these changes will only be enduring if the public has a voice in the process. He didn't specify a date for new elections but said any reforms must be endorsed in the next parliament.""Only a free and fair election can ensure the political empowerment of the people,"" he said.He further added that reforms by the Yunus-led government should focus on installing an elected parliament and a new government that would empower the people politically.""To ensure such an election, reforms must be made in the Election Commission, public administration and security agencies, enabling them to perform effectively,"" Rahman said.Meanwhile, two senior journalists were interrogated in a Dhaka court for murder charges while they were held in custody. Shyamal Dutta, editor of Bengali-language Bhorer Kagoj and former general secretary of the National Press Club in Dhaka, and Mozammel Babu, managing director and editor-in-chief of private station Ekattor TV, were arrested on Monday as they attempted to escape to India. The two journalists face murder charges related to student-led protests and were close to Hasina.Since Hasina’s fall from power, more than 150 journalists have faced charges like murder and crime against humanity drawing criticism from groups like Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, and the Human Rights Watch.After two other journalists were arrested last month and more cases were filed against others, the RSF demanded a halt to such cases.""The purge of journalists who are considered to be affiliated with the former government has reached a new level. Media professionals are bearing the brunt of the need for vengeance that permeates this terrible legal cabal, which is hurting the image of the political transition underway in Bangladesh,"" said Antoine Bernard, RSF's director of Advocacy and Assistance.""The interim authorities, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, must do everything in their power to end this vicious process,"" Bernard said.Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy director of the agency's Asia division, told news agency The Associated Press the previous month that it was ""extremely concerning that the justice system is replicating its abusive and partisan behavior since the fall of the Awami League government (of Hasina), with arbitrary arrests and failure in due process, merely reversing those targeted.""","Thousands of activists and leaders from the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party took to the streets of Dhaka on Tuesday to call for a democratic change through elections.
