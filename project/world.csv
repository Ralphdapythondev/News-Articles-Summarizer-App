US believes Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-believes-iran-has-transferred-short-range-ballistic-missiles-to-russia/articleshow/113160521.cms,"WASHINGTON: The United States has informed allies that it believes Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter.They did not offer any details about how many weapons have been delivered or when the transfers may have occurred, but they confirmed the US intelligence finding .They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that has not been publicly disclosed.The White House declined to confirm the weapons transfer but reiterated its concern that Iran is deepening its support of Russia. The White House has been warning Iran for months not to transfer ballistic missiles to Russia.""Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and lead to the killing of more Ukrainian civilians,"" National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement. ""This partnership threatens European security and illustrates how Iran's destabilizing influence reaches beyond the Middle East and around the world.""The US finding comes as the Kremlin tries to repel Ukraine's surprise offensive that has led to the seizure of about 500 square miles (1,300 kilometers) of Russia's Kursk region. Meanwhile, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is pressing allies to allow his country to use Western-supplied missiles to strike deep inside Russia and hit sites from which Moscow launches aerial attacks.Iran, as it has with previous US intelligence findings, denied providing Russia with weapons for its war in Ukraine.""Iran considers the provision of military assistance to the parties engaged in the conflict - which leads to increased human casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and a distancing from ceasefire negotiations - to be inhumane,"" according to a statement from Iran's mission to the United Nations. ""Thus, not only does Iran abstain from engaging in such actions itself, but it also calls upon other countries to cease the supply of weapons to the sides involved in the conflict.""CIA Director William Burns, who was in London on Saturday for a joint appearance with his British intelligence counterpart, warned of the growing and ""troubling"" defense relationship involving Russia, China, Iran and North Korea that he said threatens both Ukraine and Western allies in the Middle East.The White House has repeatedly declassified and publicized intelligence findings that show North Korea has sent ammunition and missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine, while Iran supplies Moscow with attack drones and has assisted the Kremlin with building a drone-manufacturing factory.China has held back from providing Russians with weaponry but has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry, according to US officials.The White House has been on edge for months about a possible deal between Iran and Russia.The Democratic administration said in January that US intelligence officials had determined a Russian-Iran deal had not been completed, but officials were concerned that Russia's negotiations to acquire missiles from Iran were actively advancing.Last September, according to the White House, Iran hosted a top Russian defense official to show off a range of ballistic missile systems, adding to the US concern that a deal could come together.The US and other countries have taken steps aimed at thwarting the supply, sale or transfer involving Iran and ballistic missile-related items, including issuing guidance to private companies about Iranian missile procurement practices to make sure those companies are not inadvertently supporting Iran's development efforts.President Joe Biden is set to host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for talks at the White House on Friday. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said ""continuing robust support to Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression"" will be on their agenda.","The White House has been warning Iran for months not to transfer ballistic missiles to Russia.

Shooting incident

Colt Gray , the 14-year-old suspect in the Georgia school shooting , had lived in multiple rental homes, as revealed in the to court documents. He and his father, Colin Gray , 54, are charged with the killings of two students and two teachers at Apalachee High School in Barrow County .The teen's family lived in two rental properties in Jefferson, Georgia, a small town with approximately 15,000 people.In one rental property, they were evicted in May 2022, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital . Following Colin and Marcee Gray's divorce, the family of five was split, with Colt living with his father while his two younger siblings initially stayed with their mother.After the divorce, Colin and Colt rented a different home in a subdivision in Jefferson. Neighbors said they only lived there for a ""couple of months"" before moving again. This was the home where police interviewed Colt and Colin after Colt allegedly made violent threats in May 2023 to shoot up the middle school.Colin and Colt moved to a new rental property in Winder, Georgia, by November 2023, which was where Colt resided before his arrest following the school shooting. The Winder home was also where Colt's mother vandalized her ex-husband's truck in a rampage that resulted in her imprisonment.In recently released police interrogation transcripts, Colin Gray spoke about his son, saying, ""[Colt's] gone through a lot"" and that Colt wanted a ""simple life.""""Colt just wants us to have a simple life. All that like, he should be excited about getting into 8th grade.

He's dating that guy.' Just ridiculed him day after day after day,"" Colin Gray added.Colin Gray told investigators that Colt struggled with his parents' divorce. The father mentioned that Colt ""had some problems"" at his previous school, West Jackson Middle, but had improved since transferring to Jefferson Middle School, according to Fox News.The Apalachee High School shooting on September 4 was reported at 9:30 a.m., and law enforcement arrived within minutes, according to GBI Director Chris Hosey. Nine people were injured, seven of them shot. Officers quickly arrested 14-year-old Colt Gray, who is being tried as an adult on four counts of murder for allegedly using a semiautomatic AR-style rifle to kill two students and two teachers.

In an interview to detectives last year, Colin Gray who gifted the gun to Colt on Christmas said it was very difficult for him to go to school and not get picked on. But why were the father-son duo interviewed by the investigators last year? The sheriff received a tip from the FBI last year that Gray had possible threated to shoot up a middle school.The threat was made on Discord.""im committing a mass shooting and im waiting a good 2-3 years... I cant kill myself yet, cause I’m not contributing anything to culture I need to go out knowing I did,"" the Discord message read but it could not be linked to Colt at that time.At that time Colin Gray told how difficult it was for Colt after his parents separated and her mother took his younger two kids leaving Colt with his father. ""It went from one thing to another... I was trying to get him on the golf team... [they were like] Oh, look, Colt's gay. He's dating that guy. Just ridiculed him day after day after day,"" the father said. His father then showed the investigators a photo of Colt with blood smeared on his face and said it was from the day when Colt shot his first deer. Colin Gray told the investigators that he taught his son the seriousness of weapons and how to not use them. He told officers that all guns would go away if he learnt that his son made threats.Both the father and son have been charged in connection with the shooting that killed to students and two teachers. Both declined to enter a plea.

MUMBAI: Canada’s Express Entry draws that offer permanent residency to those selected are back with a bang after a considerable hiatus. In May 2024, there were just two draws and only one in the following month. Since then, the periodicity of the draws has picked up, as was the earlier norm. However, there is a marked shift with ‘General’ category rounds conspicuous by their absence.The writing was on the wall – way back in March, Canada’s immigration minister, Marc Miller had said, “…As part of our efforts for temporary residents to transition to permanent residency, we will have more domestic draws for us and ask provinces and territories taking part in the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) to do the same with their allocations.”In other words, it was clear that going forward the focus would be on PNP draws and Canadian Experience Class (CEC) draws which are for skilled workers who have Canadian work experience and want to become permanent residents - typically such individuals are already residing in Canada.An analysis of the draws in July and August clearly reflects this. The main reason was to reduce an additional inflow of new immigrants and thus mitigate the pressure on health care and housing.Express Entry is a system used by the Canadian government to manage applications from skilled and qualified workers for permanent residence (PR) through three economic immigration programs. These are the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Canadian Experience Class (CEC) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program.Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the country’s immigration agency, on its website explains the different types of draws that are held throughout the year.In each draw, aspiring candidates are ranked relative to each other based on a score under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). Those who meet the cut-off score are sent an invitation to apply and become permanent residents. A permanent residency is akin to a green card in the USA and offers a future path to Canadian citizenship.The CRS score is divided into two sections. The core score can reach a maximum of 600 points and is based on the candidate’s age, education, official language proficiency, work experience etc. Second, a maximum of 600 points are awarded to the candidates if they meet policy or other objectives such as: having a provincial nomination, a qualifying offer of arranged employment, Canadian educational credentials, French-language proficiency or a sibling in Canada.Candidates that receive an invitation to apply have 60 days to either decline the invitation or submit an online application for permanent residence to IRCC. After a due process, applicants and their accompanying family members become permanent residents.Here is an analysis of the draws held during the past two months.Immigration experts point out that the cut off scores, except for category based draws be it - French proficiency draws or occupation-related draws, continue to remain high (above 500 points). Recently, IRCC also announced a pilot that offers a direct pathway to permanent residency to Francophone (French speaking) students.Those already in Canada now appear to have a better chance to become permanent residents under the Express Entry mechanism.","Canada’s Express Entry draws that offer permanent residency to those selected are back with a bang after a considerable hiatus.

The path to tragedy

A tragic outcome

Marcee Gray , a former engineer from Fitzgerald, Georgia , has been thrust into the spotlight following the tragic shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia. Her son, Colt Gray , 14, has been charged with the murder of four people in the incident.Marcee Gray’s professional life seemed to be on an upward trajectory.She reportedly earned a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Management from Georgia Southern University in 2005 and a Master’s degree in Occupational Safety and Health from Columbia Southern University in 2008. Her career included notable positions such as Quality Engineering Supervisor at Toyota Industries, North America, and Quality Manager at Olympic Steel.However, her career was cut short in 2021, with her LinkedIn profile showing her final roles as Quality Assurance Manager at Georgia Pacific LLC and Senior Quality Engineer at PCC Airfoils, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Marcee's personal life, however, tells a starkly different story. Arrested in 2023 on charges related to drug possession, trafficking, and vehicle theft, her criminal record reveals a history of drug abuse and domestic violence, reported the New York Post. According to her sister, Annie Polhamus Brown, Marcee's addiction and subsequent actions have deeply affected their family. “Marcee destroyed our family with her drug addiction,” Polhamus Brown said in social media posts.Marcee’s tumultuous relationship with her husband, Colin Gray, was marked by allegations of abuse. Marcee herself detailed the abusive nature of her marriage in social media posts, explaining why she stayed for 14 years: “I made a commitment to the Lord and my husband. No one but me understands the pain that my husband lives with every single day,” she wrote.Neighbors and family members paint a grim picture of Colt’s upbringing, reported the New York Post. Lauren Vickers, a neighbor, described frequent disturbances and neglect: “There were nights where the mom would lock him and his sister out the house… It was constant abuse.” Charles Polhamus, Colt’s maternal grandfather, described Colt as “a good kid” in a “hostile” environment, suffering from the abuse he and his mother endured.Investigations are now focusing on the family's interactions with child protective services. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into Colt’s mental health struggles and his family’s failure to address them adequately.The situation worsened when Colin Gray, who works in construction, reportedly bought Colt an AR-15 rifle for Christmas. Colin has been charged with multiple counts, including involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children. The GBI’s Chris Hosey emphasized that these charges stem from Colin’s decision to allow Colt to possess the weapon.Annie Brown expressed frustration at the adults who failed to help Colt, saying, “The adults around him failed him.”Colt Gray has been charged as an adult with four counts of murder following the Apalachee High School shooting. The tragic case highlights a profound failure within a family that once seemed capable of so much more.","Marcee Gray, a former engineer from Fitzgerald, Georgia, has been thrust into the spotlight following the tragic shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia.

Nile crocodiles: A fearsome species

Cassius: The largest crocodile

A massive 16-foot, 700 kg Nile crocodile named Henry , has been officially recognised as the world's oldest crocodile at 123 years old. The crocodile has fathered over 10,000 offspring with his six mates, according to the zoo where he inhabits.Henry, known for his big size and fearsome fangs, is nearly equivalent to that of a minibus. He was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana , a Unesco World Heritage Site .In the early 1900s, Henry was believed to have preyed on children from a local Botswana tribe. Frustrated with his deadly behavior, the tribe sought the help of renowned hunter Sir Henry Neumann in 1903. Instead of killing Henry, Neumann opted to capture him, sentencing the crocodile to a lifetime in captivity.Henry has spent the last thirty years at the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh, South Africa. He is admired from a safe distance at the conservation centre, far removed from his violent past.Nile crocodiles, found across 26 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, are known for their aggressive nature. These apex predators inhabit various aquatic environments, including lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshes. Known for their brutality, Nile crocodiles often prey on animals such as zebras and porcupines. Tragically, hundreds of people fall victim to these formidable predators each year.Although Henry holds the title of the oldest crocodile, Cassius, a 16-foot saltwater crocodile from Australia, is known as the largest. Captured in 1984, Cassius is a prominent feature at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island, off the coast of Queensland. In 2011, he was officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the world’s largest living saltwater crocodile.","Henry was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.

The world of billionaires offers a sharp contrast. Many of the youngest billionaires inherited their wealth from their parents, whereas older generations frequently established their fortunes through their own efforts. Nonetheless, a few young billionaires have conquered the obstacles of entrepreneurship and innovation. Their success tales are characterised by perseverance, resilience, and the ability to seize opportunities.Regardless of how they become wealthy, today's young billionaires are not only constructing empires, but also shaping the future. Their tales show that with passion and determination, dreams can become reality.Let's examine the world's top 10 youngest billionaires and how they earned their incredible fortunes.Clemente Del Vecchio is the second youngest billionaire on the list. He inherited a 12.5% stake in the Luxembourg-based holding company Delfin from his late father, Leonardo Del Vecchio, who was the chairman of EssilorLuxottica until his death in 2022. Delfin's assets include shares in EssilorLuxottica, insurer Generali, and banks like Mediobanca and UniCredit. Despite inheriting this fortune, Clemente is passionate about science and technology and aims to pursue higher education in these fields.Kim Jung-youn and her sister, Jung-min, hold around 18% of NXC, the largest shareholder in the online gaming company Nexon. Their shares were inherited from their late father, Kim Jung-ju, who founded Nexon in 1994 and passed away in February 2022. Both sisters are not involved in Nexon's daily operations and prefer to maintain a low profile.Livia Voigt is a major shareholder in WEG, the leading electrical motor manufacturer in Latin America. Her grandfather, Werner Ricardo Voigt, co-founded WEG along with other prominent figures. Despite being the largest individual shareholder, Livia remains a university student and does not hold an executive role at the company.Kevin David Lehmann owns a 50% stake in Germany's drugstore chain, dm (Drogerie Markt), which generates about $14 billion in annual revenue. The chain was founded in 1973, and Lehmann's father, Guenther, invested in dm in 1974, later transferring his 50% stake to Kevin David in 2017. Kevin David and his father have kept a low profile and are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the company.Luca Del Vecchio is one of the six children of the late Leonardo Del Vecchio. He inherited a 12.5% stake in Delfin from his father, alongside his brother Clemente. Delfin's portfolio includes shares in EssilorLuxottica, Generali, Mediobanca, UniCredit, and Covivio. Unlike Clemente, Luca is actively involved as the Chief Strategy Officer at Delfin.Kim Jung-min, the sister of Jung-youn, ranks fourth among the youngest billionaires. Both sisters together hold about 31% of NXC, which is the largest shareholder in Nexon. Like her sister, Kim Jung-min maintains a private life and does not participate in Nexon’s daily operations.Remi Dassault is part of the Dassault family, known for founding Dassault Aviation, an aerospace company with origins in World War I. His father, Olivier Dassault, was a notable French politician who passed away in 2021. The Dassault family also owns vineyards, a private aviation company, and the newspaper Le Figaro.Zahan Mistry inherited an 18.4% stake in Tata Sons following the death of his father, Cyrus Mistry, in 2022. He is actively involved in the family’s construction empire and holds a 25% stake in Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which is planning to list Afcons Infrastructure for $850 million as part of its debt reduction strategy.Dora Voigt de Assis, Livia Voigt's older sister, is also a significant shareholder in WEG, the leading electrical motor manufacturer in Latin America. Dora graduated from architecture college in 2020 and, like her sister, does not hold any executive position at WEG.Firoz Mistry, Zahan Mistry's elder brother, inherited a portion of the family's 18.4% stake in Tata Sons following their father’s death. He pursued his education at the University of Warwick and is known for his business acumen and strategic insight. Firoz holds a 25% stake in Shapoorji Pallonji Group.","Clemente Del Vecchio is the second youngest billionaire on the list.

'Misguided approach': Telegram CEO Pavel Durov issues first statement after arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/misguided-approach-telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-issues-first-statement-after-arrest-says-telegram-not-anarchic-paradise/articleshow/113105719.cms,"Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has issued his first statement following his recent arrest at Le Bourget Airport near Paris. Durov described the accusations against him as a “misguided approach,” asserting that Telegram is not the “anarchic paradise” some have portrayed.""Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach,"" Durov said in a post on Telegram.Durov, a Russian-born entrepreneur and founder of the messaging app Telegram, was detained on August 24, 2024, upon arriving in France. The arrest came amid an investigation by French authorities into Telegram’s alleged lack of content moderation , which they claim has facilitated criminal activities on the platform. French media outlets reported that Durov was held for questioning, raising concerns about whether he could be held personally responsible for illegal content posted by users.In his statement, Durov expressed surprise at the arrest, citing several reasons. He noted that Telegram has an official representative in the EU who handles legal requests, and that French authorities had multiple ways to contact him directly. Durov highlighted his previous cooperation with French officials, including helping establish a hotline for terrorism-related issues.""As a platform, you want your processes to be consistent globally, while also ensuring they are not abused in countries with weak rule of law. We’ve been committed to engaging with regulators to find the right balance,"" he saidDurov criticized the notion that a CEO should be held accountable for third-party misuse of their platform. He pointed out that Telegram has a history of resisting government demands that conflict with its principles, such as blocking channels in Russia and Iran.""When Russia demanded we hand over “encryption keys” to enable surveillance, we refused — and Telegram got banned in Russia. When Iran demanded we block channels of peaceful protesters, we refused — and Telegram got banned in Iran,"" the statement read.Despite acknowledging that Telegram is not without flaws, Durov refuted claims that the platform is a haven for lawlessness. He stressed that Telegram actively moderates harmful content, publishes transparency reports, and maintains direct communication channels with NGOs for urgent issues. Durov said that the rapid growth in Telegram’s user base to 950 million has presented new challenges.","Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has issued his first statement following his recent arrest at Le Bourget Airport near Paris.

Boeing Starliner returns: Capsule that took Sunita Williams to ISS lands successfully without astronauts onboard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeings-starliner-heads-back-home-without-any-astronauts-onboard/articleshow/113141292.cms,"Boeing 's Starliner capsule on Saturday landed in New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range after a period of uncertainty about its safety. The two NASA test pilots, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will remain at the space station until next year.The Starliner capsule, operating on autopilot, parachuted into the desert six hours after leaving the International Space Station .It undocked 260 miles (420 kilometers) over China, with springs gently pushing it away from the orbiting laboratory.Cameras on space station and later Nasa plane captured the descending capsule appearing as a white streak.""She's on her way home,"" astronaut Suni Williams radioed after Starliner exited.Williams and Wilmore were supposed to fly Starliner back to Earth in June, a week after launching in it. However, thruster failures and helium leaks compromised their ride to the space station.Nasa then decided it was too risky for them to return on Starliner, which led to the fully automated capsule departing with empty seats and blue spacesuits, along with some old station equipment. SpaceX will bring the duo back in late February, extending their original eight-day mission to more than eight months.A minute after separating from the space station, Starliner's thrusters could be seen firing as the white, blue-trimmed capsule slowly backed away. Nasa Mission Control called it a 'perfect' departure.Following the undocking, flight controllers planned additional test firings of the capsule's thrusters.Engineers believe that the more the thrusters are fired, the hotter they become, causing the protective seals to swell and obstruct the flow of propellant. Unfortunately, they won't be able to examine any of the parts, as the section containing the thrusters will be discarded just before reentry.Starliner will be transported back to Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center for analysis. “We will review the data and determine the next steps for the program,” said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi.Starliner's propulsion system experienced a small helium leak following the June 5 launch, which was initially thought to be isolated. However, four additional leaks emerged after liftoff, and five thrusters failed. Although four of the thrusters were recovered, Nasa expressed concern about potential malfunctions that could hinder the capsule's descent from orbit.Over the summer, Boeing conducted extensive thruster tests both in space and on the ground, and was confident that Starliner could safely return Wilmore and Williams to Earth. However, NASA had a different opinion and decided to go with SpaceX instead.As experienced astronauts and retired Navy captains, Wilmore and Williams anticipated challenges on the test flight. They have kept busy in space, assisting with repairs and experiments. The two are now full-time station crew members, joining the seven others on board.Boeing's first astronaut flight marks the end of a journey filled with delays and setbacks. After the space shuttles retired more than a decade ago, Nasa contracted Boeing and SpaceX for orbital taxi service. Boeing encountered numerous problems on its first uncrewed test flight in 2019, requiring a repeat mission. The 2022 do-over revealed even more flaws, with the repair bill exceeding $1 billion.Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew program manager, stated earlier this week that teams have been so focused on Starliner's return that they haven't had time to consider what's next for Boeing. He said that Nasa remains committed to having two competing US companies transporting astronauts.“We are excited to have Starliner home safely. This was an important test flight for NASA in setting us up for future missions with Boeing,"" said Stich.","Boeing's Starliner capsule landed in New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range after a period of uncertainty about its safety.

The attack was planned to mark the first anniversary of the October 7 attack on Israel from Hamas.Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, 20, also known as Shahzeb Jadoon, was nabbed in or around Ormstown, Canada, which is about 12 miles from the US border, the Justice Department said.The US government said it will seek to extradite him from Canada.“The defendant is alleged to have planned a terrorist attack in New York City around October 7th of this year with the stated goal of slaughtering, in the name of ISIS , as many Jewish people as possible,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.“Jewish communities — like all communities in this country — should not have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist attack,” he added.According to the officials, Khan had planned to attack a Jewish center in Brooklyn in support of the Islamic State group, or ISIS.

The debate will follow these agreed-upon rules:

As the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris draws closer, the stark differences in their preparation methods are becoming clear. Trump, the Republican nominee, has been holding rallies and dismissing the importance of debate prep, while Vice President Harris is intensely focused on crafting her responses during a weekend of debate preparation in Pennsylvania.Both candidates are vying for voter attention in crucial swing states, with Harris in Pennsylvania and Trump in Wisconsin.The polls show a tight race, making this upcoming debate a pivotal moment.While Harris hunkers down with her team to fine-tune her responses for the debate, Trump continues his campaign stops, relying on his instincts rather than structured preparation. He remarked during a town hall with Fox News host Sean Hannity, “You can go in with all the strategy you want, but you have to feel it out as the debate's taking place.”In contrast, Harris has been working closely with Democratic consultants to sharpen her message against Trump, focusing on issues like the economy, abortion, and law enforcement. She has repeatedly emphasized that Trump’s disregard for the truth will be evident during the debate.The ABC News debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is set for Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. Eastern Time. Taking place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, the 90-minute event will be moderated by a panel of ABC journalists.- The debate will last 90 minutes with two commercial breaks.- Only the two seated moderators will ask questions.- A virtual coin toss held on Sept. 3 determined podium placement and the order of closing statements. Former President Donald Trump won the toss and chose to give the final closing statement, while Vice President Kamala Harris selected the right podium (stage left).- Candidates will be introduced by the moderators and will enter from opposite sides of the stage, with the incumbent party introduced first.- There will be no opening statements, and each candidate will have two minutes for closing remarks.- Candidates will stand behind podiums throughout the debate, and props or prewritten notes are not allowed on stage.- No topics or questions will be shared in advance with the candidates.- Each candidate will have a pen, pad of paper, and a bottle of water onstage.- Candidates will be given two minutes for answers, two minutes for rebuttals, and an additional minute for follow-ups or clarifications.- Microphones will only be live for the candidate speaking and muted when it is the other candidate's turn.- Candidates will not be allowed to ask each other questions.- Campaign staff cannot interact with the candidates during commercial breaks.- Moderators will enforce time limits and ensure a civil discussion.- The debate will take place without a live audience.","The ABC News debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is set for Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.

Former President Donald Trump held a rally at Central Wisconsin Airport, addressing his familiar grievances about his legal battles and attacks on the Biden-Harris administration. Speaking behind bulletproof glass, Trump claimed, without evidence, that the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) under the ""Harris-Biden"" administration was working to imprison him due to his efforts to ""expose corruption ."" Trump’s accusations came shortly after his court appearance related to a sexual abuse case appeal.""To every citizen who is sick and tired of the parasitic political class in Washington that sucks our country of its blood and treasure, November 5th will be your new liberation day"" Trump said.During the rally, Trump also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris , warning that her re-election would result in a ""Banana Republic"" and condemned the Biden administration's immigration policies, calling them ""suicidal.""""We will completely overhaul Kamala’s corrupt department of injustice and turn the Justice Department back into the best law enforcement agency on the planet. Instead of persecuting Republicans, they will focus on taking down bloodthirsty cartels, transnational gangs, and Radical Islamic Terrorists,"" Trump said.In his speech, Trump continued to question the integrity of US elections, encouraging attendees to verify their voter registration and vote in large numbers to counteract alleged voter fraud, despite no substantial evidence supporting these claims.As Trump rallied his supporters, the Harris campaign shared key moments from his speech, highlighting his controversial remarks. The campaign shared clips of Trump announcing his plans to pardon January 6 rioters on his first day in office and reaffirming his commitment to the Project 2025 plan, which includes eliminating the Department of Education and building mass detention camps for migrants.","Former President Donald Trump held a rally at Central Wisconsin Airport, addressing his familiar grievances about his legal battles and attacks on the Biden-Harris administration.

""I'm going to be mad as hell if he did, and then all the guns will go away.""Now both Colt, 14, and Colin Gray, 54, are charged in the killings of two students and two teachers Wednesday at Apalachee High School in Barrow County, outside Atlanta. Nine others were hurt, seven of them shot. The Grays appeared Friday for the first time in court, where their attorneys declined to immediately seek bail.The teen is charged with murder, and his father is accused of second-degree murder for providing his son with a semiautomatic, AR 15-style rifle used to kill children. Arrest warrants say the elder Gray did so knowing his son ""was a threat to himself and others.""Jackson County authorities ended their inquiry into Colt Gray a year ago, concluding that there wasn't clear evidence to link him to a threat posted on Discord, a social media site popular with video gamers. The records from that investigation provide at least a narrow glimpse into a boy who struggled with his parents' breakup and at the middle school he attended at the time, where his father said others frequently taunted him.""He gets flustered and under pressure. He doesn't really think straight,"" Colin Gray told the investigator on May 21, 2023, recalling a discussion he'd had with the boy's principal.Shooting guns and hunting, he said, were frequent pastimes for father and son. Gray said he was encouraging the boy to be more active outdoors and spend less time playing video games on his Xbox.When Colt Gray killed a deer months earlier, his father swelled with pride. He showed the investigator a photo on his cellphone, saying: ""You see him with blood on his cheeks from shooting his first deer.""""It was just the greatest day ever,"" Colin Gray said.There's no mention in the investigator's report and interview transcript of either Gray owning an assault-style rifle. Asked if his son had access to firearms, the father said yes.But he said the guns weren't kept loaded and insisted he had emphasized safety when teaching the boy to shoot.""He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do,"" Gray said, ""and how to use them and not use them.""An eviction upended the Grays' family in summer 2022.On July 25 of that year, a sheriff's deputy was dispatched to the rental home on a suburban cul-de-sac where Colin Gray, his wife, Colt and the boy's two younger siblings lived. A moving crew was piling their belongings in the yard.The Jackson County deputy said in a report that the movers found guns and hunting bows in a closet in the master bedroom. They turned the weapons and ammunition over to the deputy for safekeeping, rather than leave them outside with the family's other possessions outside.The deputy wrote that he left copies of receipt forms for the weapons on the front door so that Gray could pick them up later at the sheriff's office.The reason for eviction is not mentioned in the report.

He later told his father his account had been hacked.""The only thing I have is TikTok, but I just go on there and watch videos,"" the teen said.A year before they would both end up charged in the high school shooting, Colin Gray insisted to the sheriff's investigator that his son wasn't the type to threaten violence.""He's not a loner, Officer Miller. Don't get that,"" the father said, adding: ""He just wants to go to school, do his own thing and he doesn't want any trouble.""","Colt Gray, 14, and his father, Colin, 54, are charged in the killings of two students and two teachers. The Grays appeared Friday for the first time in court, where their attorneys declined to immediately seek bail.

On both occasions, the military had publicly denied direct involvement, saying indigenous Kashmiri rebels were fighting Indian forces.In 1999, however, thousands of paramilitary Northern Light Infantry regulars, drawn exclusively from Gilgit-Baltistan and skilled in high-altitude combat, were sent to occupy military posts that Indian troops would vacate in the snowy months.They established positions on the heights and commanded a view of the Srinagar-Leh highway, a major supply route for Indian troops stationed on the Siachen glacier.When India detected the incursion in early May 1999, Pakistan had claimed they were Kashmiri militants fighting Indian rule.According to observers, Pakistan had sent troops to Kargil to cut Indian supplies to Siachen, inflict heavy losses on Indian troops and pressure them into negotiating a settlement of the Kashmir dispute on Pakistani terms. Since Islamabad had conducted nuclear tests a year earlier, Pakistani generals were expecting a muted response from India.But the Indians hit back hard, sending infantry backed by artillery and air support. By mid-June the Pakistani positions on the hills began to fall. There were also international calls for Pakistan to withdraw its forces. Evidence suggested the Pakistani military leadership had not shared details of the Kargil operation with the govt of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif . On July 4, Sharif was forced to announce a unilateral ceasefire. His govt was toppled in a military coup two months later.India had reconquered the Kargil heights by July 26. It lost more than 500 troops in the war, while estimates of Pakistani losses range from 400 to about 4,000. Thousands of people made homeless by the war are displaced in Pakistan to this day.","Pakistan's military had attempted on at least two occasions to send its forces into Kashmir to start a rebellion against Indian rule.

The discovery could potentially offer a drastic boost to the nation's economy, according to a Pakistani senior security official quoted by DawnNewsTV.The official explained that the survey has successfully identified the location of the reserves, and relevant government bodies have been informed.These resources, located in the depths of Pakistani waters, represent a critical step towards capitalising what the official referred to as the "" blue water economy .""While this discovery could lead to a major boost for Pakistan’s energy sector, the process of exploration is still in its early stages.The work of digging wells and actually getting oil out could take several years. The official also talked about the potential of the blue water economy, pointing out that valuable minerals and elements could be extracted from the ocean, providing additional economic benefits for Pakistan.Estimates suggest that this discovery could be among the world’s largest oil and gas reserves , potentially placing Pakistan as the holder of the fourth-largest deposit globally.Venezuela currently leads in terms of oil reserves, with approximately 3.4 billion barrels, followed by countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Canada, and Iraq. The US is also notable for holding the most significant untapped shale oil reserves.In an interview with DawnNewsTV, Muhammad Arif, a former member of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) said that while the discovery is a positive development, there is no guarantee the reserves will be as large or easily recoverable as initially hoped.He said, ""If this is a gas reserve, it can replace LNG imports and if these are oil reserves, we can substitute imported oil.""The significant financial investment needed to explore offshore oil and gas reserves, estimating the cost at around $5 billion just for exploration, further claimed Arif.","A significant deposit of petroleum and natural gas has been discovered within Pakistan's territorial waters.

NEW DELHI: In a first, Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War , during a recent defence day speech. Previous army chiefs and political leaders, such as Pervez Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif, have acknowledged Pakistan's involvement in the Kargil operation.According to several media reports, General Munir -- while addressing a ceremony at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi to mark the country's 59th Defence Day, said: ""Be it 1948, 1965, 1971 or 1999 Kargil war, thousands of Shuhadas (martyrs) have sacrificed their life for the country and nation.""This marks the first time a serving army chief has openly admitted to the army's direct role in a conflict that has long been shrouded in denial and controversy in Pakistan.The audio of the video, which has been circulated widely online, has not been independently verified.For years, Pakistan's military and political leadership has maintained a narrative that distanced itself from the Kargil operations, often referring to the infiltrators as mere ""Kashmiri freedom fighters"".India has, however, repeatedly said that the operation was a calculated military strategy aimed at altering the Line of Control (LoC) and asserting Pakistan's claim over Kashmir.The Kargil War was characterised by its high-altitude combat and brutal conditions, taking place in one of the most challenging terrains on Earth.The Pakistani military's strategy involved infiltrating troops disguised as militants into Indian territory, occupying strategic heights that overlooked key supply routes.The operation was intended to disrupt Indian logistics and draw international attention to the Kashmir issue, thereby internationalising the longstanding conflict.In strong retaliation to the Pakistan 'infiltrators', between mid-May and July 1999, the Indian Armed Forces gradually recaptured critical positions from the Pakistani infiltrators. The Kargil War officially concluded on July 26, 1999, when the Army announced the complete eviction of Pakistani forces from Indian soil.Over two months, intense battles took place in the challenging mountainous terrain. The Indian Army, as part of Operation Vijay, managed to drive out Pakistani intruders and successfully recaptured Tiger Hill and other strategic positions.","Pakistan army chief publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War.

Justice Asim Hafiz, who delivered the verdict, noted that the process was illegal.""Lest anyone misunderstand this, we make it clear that the appointment to any post under the government can only be made after a proper advertisement has been made, inviting applications from eligible candidates. Without holding a proper selection where all eligible candidates get a fair chance to compete would violate the guarantee enshrined under Articles 18 and 27 of the Constitution,"" Hafiz said.""I am afraid that illegality committed by way of an unauthorized appointment, one cannot hide the elephant in a mouse-hole,"" the judge added.The ruling is considered unusual given the powerful role the Pakistan army has traditionally played in the country, including periods of military rule in its more than 75 years of existence.Experts say the high court's decision might be seen as a setback for those who support the current regime, as the military often seeks to place its personnel in major civil positions.",Afsar became the first serving military officer to head Nadra in October 2023.

His arrest, however, has been seen by the opposition as a ploy to implicate Imran in cases linked to May 9 riots. This apprehension had prompted Khan to approach the Islamabad high court on Tuesday, pleading to stop civilian authorities from handing him over to the military. “A few weeks ago, a retired senior army officer (Faiz Hameed) was taken into military custody. It has been widely speculated and reported in the media that he will be made an approver against the petitioner (Imran Khan) in cases pertaining to May 9 and 10, 2023 and the petitioner will be transferred to military custody on this basis,” the petition read.Govt officials have repeatedly said Hameed worked with Khan to plan the riots.Addressing a press conference in Rawalpindi, army’s spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the law takes its own course if a person from the Pakistani army works for personal gain or promotes a specific agenda.“The case of Gen Hameed is a clear example that the army takes violations of its rules very seriously. He (Hameed) had overstepped his legal and constitutional boundaries at the behest of certain political elements,” Chaudhary said.He said Gen Hameed’s case was referred to the Pakistani army through the defence ministry in light of a “full belief in the army’s accountability process”, following which the army ordered a “high-level court of inquiry” into the matter.“There is a clear consensus within the army that it is a national, state-owned institution, which must be prevented from being used against the completion of goals related to specific political agendas.”Khan is being currently tried in a civil court for allegedly abetting the violence on May 9, 2023, a charge he has denied.",Court martial proceedings against former ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (retd) were initiated.

It mentioned that no documentation or order has been attached to the petition. The registrar's office asked how the petitions can be filed in the Islamabad high court when cases have been filed in Punjab.Furthermore, the IHC registrar's office questioned how the petition can be filed in a high court while the matter of military trials is subjudice in the supreme court , according to a Geo News report.Speaking to reporters, Imran Khan's lawyer, Intezar Panjutha said that they talked to the PTI founder regarding his plea in the IHC. ""Nothing is more crucial that an ex-prime minister is being dragged to a military court. How can the leader of a popular political party be taken to a military court,"" Panjutha quoted the the PTI founder as saying.Panjutha further stated that a civilian cannot be tried in a military court in the light of a Supreme Court verdict. Last week, Pakistan's Federal minister for law and justice Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, said that if needed, the Punjab government would take a decision on referring the PTI founder's case to a military court.In an informal talk with reporters on August 29, Tarar said, ""The prosecution of May 9 cases is being done by the Punjab government and the provincial government will decide to refer the case to a military court,"" Geo News reported, citing The News International.Earlier in August, Pakistan Defence Minister Khawaja Asif hinted at the possibility of Imran Khan's trial in military court for the May 9 riots. Asif made the remarks in response to former Pakistan PM Imran Khan's demand for an ""open trial"" of former inter-services intelligence chief (retd) Faiz Hamid.Violent protests erupted in Pakistan after Imran Khan was arrested from the premises of Islamabad High Court in a graft case on May 9, 2023. During the protests, the alleged PTI supporters vandalised military installations, including General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, and were involved in arson at the Lahore Corps commander house.In December 2021, the supreme court in a 5:1 majority verdict suspended its October 23, 2023 order wherein it declared civilians' trials in military courts null and void in connection with the May 9 riots, Geo News reported.The court's verdict came after intra-court appeals were filed by the federal and provincial governments and the defence ministry against the top court's decision announced by Justice Ijazul Ahsan-led bench earlier that year.According to the order issued on December 13, the military court trials would be conditioned on the Supreme Court's final verdict on the intra-court pleas.","The Islamabad high court registrar's office has raised objections on a petition filed by former Pakistan PM Imran Khan.

With inputs from agencies

On Wednesday, a young Hindu man named Utsav Mondal was attacked by an angry mob inside a police station after allegedly making a comment about the Prophet.While several social media users claimed that Mondal had been beaten to death, a report in theconfirmed that he was alive and undergoing treatment. Another report bystated that the young man was being treated under the supervision of the Bangladesh Army and was no longer in critical condition.A press release issued by the Directorate of Inter-Services Public Relations on Thursday stated that Utsav, 22, had posted derogatory comments about a religious figure. On Wednesday, 4th September, he was apprehended by locals and taken to the office of the Deputy Police Commissioner of Khulna (South) to face legal action. As news spread, a crowd of 3,000 to 3,500 people gathered, demanding public punishment. The situation quickly escalated, prompting the deployment of armed forces to manage the unrest.Despite the presence of military personnel, some members of the crowd forced their way into the Deputy Commissioner’s office and attacked Utsav. Thanks to the intervention of the armed forces, he was rescued alive and is now receiving medical treatment under military supervision.The press release also stated that a case has been filed against Utsav for violating religious sentiments, and once he recovers, he will be handed over to the authorities for legal proceedings. It emphasised that the Bangladesh Army is committed to preventing extrajudicial killings and upholding the rule of law. The public was urged not to be misled by rumours circulating on social media regarding Utsav’s death.The incident took place late on Wednesday night, around 11:45 pm, when false announcements were made via mosque loudspeakers claiming Utsav Mondal had died.According to local reports, Utsav had posted offensive comments about a religious figure on social media. By around 8 pm, several students had tracked him down and taken him to the office of Deputy Police Commissioner (South), Mohammad Tazul Islam, in Sonadanga. As word of his detention spread, a large crowd gathered outside, demanding that Utsav be handed over to them.The situation intensified as the angry mob, calling for immediate justice, surrounded the building. The army and navy were deployed to contain the growing unrest. However, despite their presence, the mob managed to break into the office and brutally attack Utsav.Deputy Police Commissioner Tazul later explained that authorities had assured the crowd that legal actions would be taken, including the filing of a case and due legal process. However, the mob ignored these assurances, assaulting the student and leaving him critically injured.In an attempt to disperse the crowd and restore order, police used mosque loudspeakers to falsely announce Utsav’s death.Earlier, Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh's interim government, firmly dismissed claims that Bangladesh would devolve into another Afghanistan without Sheikh Hasina 's leadership. He urged India to abandon this narrative, calling for a focus on improving bilateral ties instead.Yunus argued that the attacks on minority Hindus in Bangladesh were ""more political than communal”. He told PTI in an interview, ""These attacks are political in nature and not communal. And India is propagating these incidents in a big way. We have not said that we can't do anything; we have said that we are doing everything.""The incidents involved vandalism of Hindu-owned businesses and temples, which took place during student-led violence after Hasina fled the country on August 5. Yunus, appointed as Chief Adviser after Hasina's ouster, reiterated that the issue of minority attacks was ""exaggerated"" and linked to political unrest, not communal strife.He urged India to shift its perspective on Bangladesh's leadership, stating, ""The way forward is for India to come out of the narrative. The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, BNP is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan. And Bangladesh is in safe hands with Sheikh Hasina at the helm only. India is captivated by this narrative. India needs to come out of this narrative. Bangladesh, like any other nation, is just another neighbour.""In his Independence Day address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed optimism that the situation in violence-stricken Bangladesh would stabilize soon. He emphasized that the safety of Hindus and other minorities in the neighbouring country is a matter of concern for 1.4 billion Indians","A young Hindu man named Utsav Mondal was attacked by an angry mob inside a police station after allegedly making a comment about the Prophet.
