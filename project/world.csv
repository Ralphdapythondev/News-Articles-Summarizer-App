"After Sweden, more cases of mpox to come in Europe: WHO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/after-sweden-more-cases-of-mpox-to-come-in-europe-who/articleshow/112555161.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a warning on Thursday about the likelihood of further imported cases of the new, more dangerous mpox strain in Europe. This announcement followed Sweden's report of the first such infection outside Africa. The outbreak has resulted in hundreds of deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).A traveller in Sweden has been diagnosed with mpox caused by the Clade 1b subclade, the same strain that has been spreading in the DRC since September 2023.The WHO declared the mpox surge in Africa a public health emergency of international concern, marking it the highest level of alert.The UN health agency expressed concerns due to the increasing cases and fatalities in the DRC and the virus's spread to other African countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Sweden's public health agency confirmed the case in Stockholm but assured that the infection poses a very low risk to the general European population.""A person who sought care in Stockholm has been diagnosed with mpox caused by the Clade 1 variant. It is the first case caused by Clade 1 to be diagnosed outside the African continent,"" stated the Swedish Public Health Agency.The individual was infected during a visit to the affected part of Africa, as noted by state epidemiologist Magnus Gisslen. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control currently considers the risk to the general population in Europe very low.""The fact that a patient with mpox is treated in the country does not affect the risk to the general population, a risk that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) currently considers very low,"" Gisslen said in the statement.The WHO's European regional office in Copenhagen announced it was in discussions with Sweden on how best to manage the newly detected case.""The confirmation of mpox Clade 1 in Sweden is a clear reflection of the interconnectedness of our world,"" the office stated. ""There are likely to be further imported cases of Clade 1 in the European region over the coming days and weeks, and it is imperative that we don't stigmatise travellers or countries/regions.""Regarding travel, the WHO emphasised that travel restrictions and border closures are ineffective and should be avoided.""Travel restrictions and border closures don't work and should be avoided,"" it added.The outbreak has heavily impacted the Democratic Republic of Congo. Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba reported via video that the country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year, affecting all 26 provinces of the DRC.""The country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year,"" Kamba said, stressing that all 26 provinces have been affected. The DRC’s population is around 100 million.Efforts to combat the outbreak in the DRC include a national strategic plan for vaccination against mpox and enhanced disease surveillance at borders and checkpoints. Government-level working groups have been established to improve contact tracing and resource mobilization for controlling the epidemic.The virus, formerly known as monkeypox, was discovered in monkeys in Denmark in 1958 and first identified in humans in 1970 in the DRC. Mpox is an infectious disease transmitted to humans by infected animals and can also be passed between humans through close physical contact. Symptoms include fever, muscular aches, and large boil-like skin lesions.In response to the outbreak, the US Department of Health announced it would donate 50,000 doses of the FDA-approved JYNNEOS vaccine to the DRC.Mpox exists in two subtypes: the more virulent and deadlier Clade 1, endemic to the Congo Basin in central Africa, and Clade 2, endemic to West Africa. A significant surge in mpox infections occurred worldwide in May 2022, primarily affecting gay and bisexual men, due to the Clade 2b subclade.The WHO declared a public health emergency that lasted from July 2022 to May 2023. This outbreak, largely subsided now, resulted in around 140 deaths out of approximately 90,000 cases.The Clade 1b subclade, which is causing the current concern, results in more severe disease and has a higher fatality rate than Clade 2b.","A traveller in Sweden has been diagnosed with mpox caused by the Clade 1b subclade, the same strain that has been spreading in the DRC since September 2023.

However, the quota system was reinstated this year, triggering further protests that ultimately led to the toppling of the government and the prime minister's exile.The former presidential candidate also highlighted the concerning trend of radicals targeting Hindu minorities amidst the chaos. He emphasized that ""bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood"" and suggested that the United States should learn from the lessons unfolding in Bangladesh.""Here's what happened: Bangladesh fought a bloody war for its independence in 1971. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi civilians were raped and murdered. It was a tragedy, and it was rightly mourned. But in its aftermath, Bangladesh implemented a quota system for jobs in their civil service: 80% of the jobs were allocated to specific social groups (war veterans, rape victims, underrepresented residents, etc.), and only 20% were allocated based on merit,"" he said in a post on X.""The quota system proved to be a disaster. In 2018, protests led Bangladesh to scrap most of the quotas, but the victim-patrons fought back…and the quota system was reinstated this year. That triggered more protests which toppled the government, and the prime minister fled. Once chaos begins, it can't easily be reined in. Radicals are now targeting Hindu minorities. A quota conflict created to rectify the wrongs of rape and violence in 1971 is now leading to more rape and violence in 2024. Bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood. It's hard not to look at Bangladesh and wonder what lessons we would do well to learn right here at home,"" he added.Since the ousting of Sheikh Hasina's government on August 5, Bangladesh has been experiencing a volatile political situation.

Gvir garners condemnation from West

US urges Netanyahu to prevent 'provocative actions'

Why the controversy?

Israeli minister Itamar Ben Gvir drew criticism from various quarters after he, along with hundreds of Israelies, entered Jerusalem 's Al-Aqsa mosque compound and performed prayers -- this comes as the Middle East remains on edge amid fear of anticipated large-scale Iran and Lebanon attacks in the wake of Hamas chief's assassination Ben Gvir and some 2,250 other Israelis on Tuesday entered the compound in groups, singing Jewish hymns under the protection of Israeli police, an official from the Waqf, the Jordanian body that is the custodian of the site, told news agency AFP.""Minister Ben Gvir, instead of maintaining the status quo at the mosque is supervising the Judaisation operation and trying to change the situation inside Al-Aqsa mosque,"" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the issue.Israeli police also ""imposed restrictions"" on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, he said.Ben Gvir posted a video statement on social media platform X, which he filmed inside the compound himself, vowing to win the war in Gaza.""We must win this war. We must win and not go to the talks in Doha or Cairo,"" he said, in an apparent reference to US-backed negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal for Gaza scheduled to resume on August 15.""We can defeat Hamas .. we must bring them down to their knees,"" Ben Gvir said.Ben Gvir garnered global condemnation after the mosque visit as he also vowed to ""defeat Hamas"" in Gaza in a video he filmed during the visit.The European Union (EU) condemned ""provocations"" by Gvirm and called it ""violation of status quo"".""The EU strongly condemns the provocations by Israeli Min. Ben Gvir who, during his visit to the Holy Sites, advocated for the violation of the status quo,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell wrote on X.France's foreign ministry also stepped in to condemn Gvir for defying the ban on Jewish prayer at the Al-Aqsa mosque, calling it an unacceptable ""provocation"".The United Nations also slammed the minister, calling his visit ""unduly provocative "".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent further ""provocative actions"" after Gvir's Al-Aqsa visit.Strongly criticising the Israeli minister's visit, Blinken said that Gvir showed ""blatant disregard"" for the status quo.""Prime Minister Netanyahu's office has made clear that the actions of Minister Ben Gvir are inconsistent with Israeli policy. We will look to the government of Israel to prevent similar incidents in the future,"" Blinken said.""These provocative actions only exacerbate tensions at a pivotal moment when all focus should be on the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire agreement and secure the release of all hostages and create the conditions for broader regional stability,"" he said.Al-Aqsa mosque has been a point of contention for a long as it is the third holiest site in Islam and also the most sacred in Judaism as Jews revere the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.Jews and non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during predefined hours but are not allowed to display religious symbols or offer prayers.Interestingly, this is not the first time that Ben Gvir has defied the Israeli government's ban on Jewish prayer at the Al-Aqsa compound.Last month, Ben Gvir said he had prayed inside the mosque compound against the rules that allow Jewish visits but forbid prayer.","Israeli minister Itamar Ben Gvir drew criticism from various quarters after he, along with hundreds of Israelies, entered Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound and performed prayers.

The case involves the police shooting that killed grocery store owner Abu Sayed in Dhaka's Mohammadpur area on July 19.The threat was made shortly after the case was filed, with the caller contacting the plaintiff from a French phone number around 2.30pm on Tuesday.The caller reportedly questioned the plaintiff about the consequences of filing a case against Sheikh Hasina, asking about his home location, his commitment to the case, and whether he had received any money related to it.""Caller asked where is my house, whether I can stay there, whether I have received any money in this case, how far I will go with this case, whether I can survive,"" the man told Dhaka Tribune.Sheikh Hasina, who recently resigned as PM and fled the country amid political unrest, is one of the accused in this case.

Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan 's life was shattered just three days after the birth of his twins, Asser and Aysel.What should have been a time of celebration turned into unimaginable grief when an Israeli airstrike in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, claimed the lives of the newborns, their mother, and their grandmother.On the day of the tragedy, Mohammed had left home to obtain birth certificates for his son and daughter, who were just four days old.While at a local government office, he received the news that his home had been bombed. The strike that killed his entire family occurred while he was away, robbing him of the chance to hold and cherish his newborns in what should have been their first days of life.“I don’t know what happened,” Mohammed tearfully recounted, still in shock from the sudden loss.“I am told it was a shell that hit the house. I didn’t even have the time to celebrate them,” Mohammed told APAccording to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, 115 infants have been born and killed during the ongoing conflict, which began on October 7th following a deadly attack on Israel by Hamas-led gunmen. The attack left 1,200 Israelis dead and sparked a massive military offensive on Gaza that has since claimed over 39,790 Palestinian lives, as reported by the health ministry.The family had sought refuge in the central Gaza Strip after following Israeli army instructions to evacuate Gaza City in the war’s early weeks. Despite their efforts to find safety, they became casualties of the relentless bombing campaign.The Israeli military has stated that it aims to avoid civilian casualties and places the blame on Hamas for operating in densely populated areas. However, the devastation continues, with numerous shelters and civilian homes destroyed in the crossfire.The airstrike on Mohammed's home is one of many that have turned family homes into graves. On Saturday, another strike on a school building sheltering displaced Palestinians in Gaza City killed more than 70 people, adding to the mounting civilian death toll.As Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan prays for his lost family, the world witnesses the tragic cost of war—a cost that has left countless families grieving in its wake, their lives forever changed by the violence that shows no sign of abating.",Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan's twins Asser and Aysel were just four days old when they were killed in an Israeli airstrike.

The denial follows an Axios report suggesting Trump had urged Netanyahu to swiftly conclude the conflict with Hamas .According to reports, Trump while speaking at a New Jersey press conference, said he advised Netanyahu to “get it over with” and end the violence.The report also suggested that Trump also rejected the notion that he was pushing Netanyahu against a ceasefire deal. “You want to get it over with fast. Have victory, get your victory, and get it over with. It has to stop, the killing has to stop,” Trump was quoted as saying by the Times of Israel.The Axios report also suggested that Trump and Netanyahu had discussed the hostage situation in a recent call.However, both Netanyahu’s office and Trump have refuted this claim. ""Contrary to media reports, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not speak with former President Donald Trump,"" a statement from Netanyahu's office said.The report, in Axios, cited two US sources. One source said Trump's call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the deal, but stressed he did not know if this was indeed what the former president told Netanyahu. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Despite these denials, a new round of ceasefire negotiations is set for Thursday, involving Egypt, the US, and Qatar. Netanyahu’s office has confirmed ongoing negotiations, though Hamas announced it would not participate in the talks, with mediators expected to consult with the group afterward.The US views a Gaza ceasefire as crucial to preventing a broader Middle Eastern conflict. Recent tensions have escalated following the killings of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut, both of which prompted threats of retaliation against Israel.The ongoing conflict, sparked by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, has resulted in 1,200 Israeli deaths and about 250 hostages. Israel’s retaliatory assault on Gaza has caused nearly 40,000 Palestinian deaths, displaced nearly 2.3 million people, and led to a severe humanitarian crisis. The World Court has received genocide allegations against Israel, which Israel denies.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed claims that he discussed a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal with former US President Donald Trump.

Talks involving CIA Director William Burns commenced in Doha, Qatar, aiming to end a war that has devastated Gaza, displaced its population, and caused a severe humanitarian crisis.US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, ""Today is a promising start,"" but noted that ""there remains a lot of work to do."" Kirby confirmed that the talks are expected to continue on Friday.Hamas official Osama Hamdan stated that the group did not participate in Thursday's talks but was prepared to join the indirect negotiations if they resulted in new commitments from Israel . Hamdan emphasized that Hamas demands the implementation of a truce plan proposed in late May by US President Joe Biden.""If the mediators succeed in forcing the [Israeli] occupation to agree, we would, but so far there's nothing new,"" Hamdan told AFP. He added that Hamas would not engage in prolonged negotiations that ""give Netanyahu more time to kill the Palestinian people.""The only truce thus far occurred in November when Gaza militants released 105 hostages taken during the October 7 attack on Israel in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The latest push for diplomacy comes as Gaza's Health Ministry reported that the death toll has surpassed 40,000, which UN Chief Antonio Guterres described as ""yet another reason"" for a ceasefire now.""Given the... disturbing number of people who remain unaccounted for, who may be trapped or dead under the rubble, this number may, if anything, be an undercount,"" said Guterres' spokesman Farhan Haq. ""This is yet another reason why we need to have a ceasefire now, as well as the release of all hostages and unimpeded humanitarian assistance.""The Gaza Health Ministry's casualty figures include 40 deaths in the past 24 hours. The Israeli military has reported killing ""more than 17,000"" Palestinian militants since the beginning of the war.British Foreign Minister David Lammy and his French counterpart Stéphane Sejourne are scheduled to discuss the truce talks with Israel's top diplomat, Israel Katz, on Friday. During a visit to Beirut on Wednesday, US envoy Amos Hochstein stated that a deal in Gaza could enable a diplomatic resolution in Lebanon and prevent a broader conflict.""We have to take advantage of this window for diplomatic action and diplomatic solutions. That time is now,"" Hochstein said.Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the current war, resulting in 1,198 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Militants also seized 251 people, of whom 111 are still held in Gaza, including 39 whom the military says are dead.Mediation efforts have repeatedly stalled since the week-long truce in November. Some Hamas officials, analysts, and critics in Israel have suggested that Netanyahu might be prolonging the war for political reasons.Israeli media recently quoted Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as stating privately to a parliamentary committee that a hostage release deal ""is stalling... in part because of Israel."" Netanyahu's office responded by accusing Gallant of adopting an ""anti-Israel narrative,"" stating that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is ""the only obstacle to a hostage deal.""The renewed push for negotiations follows the July 31 killing of Sinwar's predecessor, Hamas political leader and truce negotiator Ismail Haniyeh, during a visit to Tehran. This event escalated fears of a broader conflict, as Iran and its regional allies blamed Israel and promised retaliation, although Israel has not claimed responsibility.Western leaders have urged Tehran to refrain from retaliating against Israel for Haniyeh's killing, which came hours after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Hezbollah's military commander.The conflict's fallout has involved Iran-aligned groups from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. Over 370 Hezbollah members have died in almost ten months of near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces, more than the group lost in the 2006 war with Israel. On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 26 civilians have died, including in the annexed Golan Heights, according to military figures.In Gaza, which has seen massive destruction of housing and infrastructure, relatively few casualties were reported on Thursday. The deadliest incident involved airstrikes that killed five people in Gaza City. Israel's military stated that troops killed about 20 militants in Rafah, southern Gaza.On Wednesday, many dead and wounded, including bloodied children, were brought to Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis following an Israeli strike.""I was not pro-Hamas but now I support them and I want to fight,"" one grieving man shouted.","The United States announced a ""promising start"" to ceasefire talks in Gaza on Thursday.

US Visa bulletin update: Significant delays for employment-based green cards — Will this affect applicants from India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-visa-bulletin-update-significant-delays-for-employment-based-green-cards-will-this-affect-applicants-from-india/articleshow/112554145.cms,"Key changes and delays

Understanding the Visa bulletin

Impact on applicants

Looking ahead

The US Visa Bulletin for September 2024 , released earlier this month, reveals extended waiting times for employment-based green cards , particularly in the EB-3 category . This category, which includes skilled workers and professionals, has seen significant retrogression across most countries, delaying the processing timelines for many applicants.The bulletin indicates that for most countries, including Mexico and the Philippines, the priority date for the EB-3 category has been pushed back to December 1, 2020, leading to a one-year delay.This retrogression means that applicants who were previously closer to receiving their green cards will now face a longer wait.In contrast, applicants from India and China in the EB-3 category have not experienced the same setback and maintain their current priority dates. The EB-1 category, which covers priority workers, also remains stable for India and China, with priority dates holding at February 1, 2022, and November 1, 2022, respectively.The Visa Bulletin, issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), distinguishes between “dates for filing” and “final action dates.” These dates are crucial for applicants to understand, as they dictate when they can submit their applications and when they might expect their cases to be processed.Final action dates: These dates represent the cut-off point for when an application might be approved, paving the way for permanent residency.Dates for filing: These dates indicate when applicants can submit their adjustment of status or immigrant visa applications.The retrogression in the EB-3 category highlights the ongoing challenges in the US immigration system, particularly the growing backlog of applications. As demand for green cards continues to rise, the processing times have lengthened, affecting thousands of applicants who must now wait even longer for their cases to be resolved.For those impacted by the changes in the Visa Bulletin, staying informed and proactive is essential. Consulting with immigration professionals and closely monitoring future updates from USCIS will be crucial in navigating the evolving landscape of US immigration.The September 2024 Visa Bulletin serves as a reminder of the complexities of the immigration process and the importance of planning and patience for those seeking to secure permanent residency in the United States.","The US Visa Bulletin for September 2024 reveals extended waiting times for employment-based green cards.

Sinaloan authorities, in contrast, had said it appeared Cuen was killed at a gas station in Culiacan.In the statement, the attorney general's office said the investigation of Cuen's murder had been poorly conducted by state authorities and that the victim's body had four gunshot wounds whereas in a video circulated of the alleged gas station murder only one gunshot could be heard.The Sinaloan state attorney's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.On Wednesday, Sinaloan prosecutors said they were also investigating the disappearance of two bodyguards who had not been seen since the day of the arrests.US ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar said last week that no US personnel were on the ground when Zambada and Guzman Lopez boarded the plane that took them to the US""No US resources were used in the surrender.

Harris' or Harris's? Apostrophe battle brewing among grammar geeks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harris-or-harriss-apostrophe-battle-brewing-among-grammar-geeks/articleshow/112553975.cms,"Whatever possessed vice-president Kamala Harris to pick Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate, it probably wasn't a desire to inflame arguments about apostrophes. But it doesn't take much to get grammar nerds fired up. ""The lower the stakes, the bigger the fight,"" said Ron Woloshun, a creative director and digital marketer in California who jumped into the fray on social media less than an hour after Harris selected Walz last week to offer his take on possessive proper nouns.The Associated Press Stylebook says ""use only an apostrophe "" for singular proper names ending in S: Dickens' novels, Hercules' labours, Jesus' life. But not everyone agrees.Debate about possessive proper names ending in S started soon after Prez Joe Biden cleared the way for Harris to run last month. Is it Harris' or Harris's? But the selection of Walz with his sounds-like-an-s surname really ramped it up, said Benjamin Dreyer, the retired copy chief at Random House and author of ""Dreyer's English: An Utterly Correct Guide to Clarity and Style"". Dreyer was inundated with questions within minutes of the announcement, which came while he was at the dentist. ""I was like, 'All right, everybody just has to chill.'""While there is widespread agreement that Walz's is correct, confusion persists about Harris' vs. Harris's. Dreyer's verdict? Add the 's. ""To set the 's is just simpler, and then you can take your valuable brain cells and apply them to more important things,"" he said.Woloshun chimed in with a similar opinion on X, where apostrophes are being thrown around like hand grenades. ""The rule is simple: If you say the S, spell the S,"" he argued. That puts them on the same side as New York Times, Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal - and at odds with AP.While AP style has evolved on many fronts over the years, there are no immediate plans to change the guidance on possessives, said Amanda Barrett, AP's vice-president for news standards and inclusion. ""This is a longstanding policy for the AP. It has served us well, and we've not seen any real need to change,"" she said. ""We do know that the conversation is out there and people make different choices, and that's all fine. ""Merriam-Webster, the oldest dictionary publisher in America, splits the difference: For names ending in an S or Z sound, you can add 's or just an apostrophe, though the dictionary says 's is the more common choice. Timothy Pulju, a senior lecturer in linguistics at Dartmouth College, said that until the 17th or 18th century, the possessive of proper names ending in S - such as Jesus or Moses - often was simply the name itself with no apostrophe or additional S. Eventually, the apostrophe was added (Jesus' or Moses') to denote possession, though the pronunciation remained the same.""That became kind of the standard that I was taught and adhere to, even though in retrospect, I don't think it's a great standard,"" he said.

Chicago-area school official sentenced for $1.5 million chicken wings theft during pandemic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chicago-area-school-official-sentenced-for-1-5-million-chicken-wings-theft-during-pandemic/articleshow/112552756.cms,"A former food service director for Harvey School District 152 in the Chicago area, Vera Liddell , has been sentenced to nine years in prison after admitting to stealing $1.5 million worth of chicken wings.Liddell, 68, stole more than 11,000 cases of chicken wings meant for take-home meals for students doing remote learning from July 2020 to February 2022, according to local TV station WGN.Liddell's role as food service director involved placing food orders with Gordon Food Services, the district's main supplier. Between July 2020 and February 2022, Liddell orchestrated an extensive embezzlement scheme by placing hundreds of unauthorized orders for chicken wings, diverting them from the school district's supplies during the Covid-19 pandemic . These wings were intended for take-home meals for students who were learning remotely.“The massive fraud began at the height of Covid during a time when students were not allowed to be physically present in school,” a court document from the Cook County State's Attorney's Office revealed. “Even though the children were learning remotely, the school district continued to provide meals for the students that their families could pick up.”The operation was uncovered in January 2022 when a midyear audit found the food service department had already exceeded its annual budget by $300,000. This prompted the district's business manager to scrutinize the invoices and uncover unauthorized orders for chicken wings, an item not typically served to students because they contain bones. Surveillance footage showed Liddell using the district’s cargo vans to collect the chicken wings, which were never delivered to the students or the school.During a court hearing, Liddell pleaded guilty to the charges, with her lawyer, Patrick O’Byrne, stating, ""She feels incredibly distraught, terrible about what she did. She can't even believe she did it."" Liddell reportedly suffers from a gambling problem, which has prevented her from paying restitution.Chris Jones, a defensive tackle for the Kansas City Chiefs, offered to pay $1.5 million for Liddell's freedom. ""I'll pay for the wings that she stole to get her free,"" Jones wrote in a social media post. Liddell's attorneys stated they had not been contacted by Jones or his representatives.Dr. Reginald Lawrence, superintendent of the Harvey School District 152, and representatives for Gordon Food Service declined to comment on the case. The consequences of Liddell's actions continue to resonate, highlighting vulnerabilities in oversight and accountability within school districts during the pandemic.","Vera Liddell, 68, stole more than 11,000 cases of chicken wings meant for take- home meals for students doing remote learning from July 2020 to February 2022.

The decision was announced by Chief Judge William McConico of the 36th District Court, who stated that King would undergo ""necessary training"" to address the issues that led to the incident.The incident occurred when 15-year-old Eva Goodman, who was visiting King's courtroom as part of a field trip organized by The Greening of Detroit, a nonprofit organization, fell asleep. Judge King said he was more concerned about her attitude, which led him to have her wear jail clothes and handcuffs. ""I wanted this to look and feel very real to her, even though there’s probably no real chance of me putting her in jail,"" King told WXYZ-TV.Eva's mother, Latoreya Till, expressed her frustration, describing King as a ""big bully"" and noting that her daughter was scared and hurt by the experience. Till explained that her family lacks a permanent residence, and the previous night had been challenging, leading to her daughter's sleepiness in court.In response to the incident, McConico emphasised the court's commitment to providing a respectful and intimidation-free environment. ""The actions of Judge King on August 13th do not reflect this commitment,"" McConico stated. He added that the State Court Administrative Office approved the decision to remove King from his criminal case docket and begin training.The duration and details of the training were not disclosed, but King will continue to receive his salary during this period.

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.

How case unfolded

Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal and the process for his court martial was initiated, the army said on Monday.It is for the first time in the country's history that court martial has been initiated against a former intelligence chief, according to Dawn .“Complying with the orders of Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry, was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” a press statement by Pakistan army said further adding that ""the process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody.”“Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), under provisions of Pakistan Army Act,” the release further said.Hameed was regarded as close aide to Imran Khan, who appointed him to lead the ISI during his tenure as prime minister. Khan was removed from office in 2022 through a vote of no-confidence, which he claims was orchestrated by the military, though the military denies this allegation.In 2022, Hameed was one of the six senior-most generals whose names were forwarded by general headquarters to Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif for consideration for the two top military positions. He, however, chose to seek early retirement and submitted his resignation to the high command, as per sources.The Supreme Court, in its order dated November 14 last year, had said that the allegations against Hameed were of ""extremely serious nature"" and ""would undermine the reputation of the federal government, the armed forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.”This came after the management of Top City, a private housing scheme, made allegations against the former spy-master, accusing him of orchestrating a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.The petition was filed on May 12, 2017, and it said that Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials conducted a raid on Top City's office and Moeez’s residence, seizing valuables such as gold and diamond jewelry and money in connection with an alleged terrorism case, Dawn reported.It also alleged the involvement of former ISI officials Irtaza Haroon, Sardar Najaf, Wasim Tabish, Zahid Mehmood Malik, and Mohammad Munir ""in the illegal takeover of the housing society”.In March, a court placed retired naib tehsildar Najaf Hameed, Hameed's brother, under a 14-day judicial remand.Najaf and other co-accused had sought pre-arrest bail in an FIR filed with the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) in Rawalpindi.The FIR alleged that former minister for mineral resources Hafiz Ammar Yasir had acquired properties worth billions of rupees through intermediaries.In April, the military had reportedly established an inquiry committee to investigate allegations of authority misuse involving the former ISI head.","Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal.

While there have been no reported fatalities, the attacks have caused dozens of injuries.Bangladesh's interim leader and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus on Saturday condemned the attacks calling them ""heinous.""

"Pakistan's battle with polio eradication: Infant succumbs in Balochistan, total cases rise to 14 this year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-battle-with-polio-eradication-infant-succumbs-in-balochistan-total-cases-rise-to-14-this-year/articleshow/112441087.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan continues to grapple with cases of polio with the country along with neighbouring Afghanistan being the only two countries in the world where the poliovirus is still an endemic.On August 10, the 14th polio case of the year was reported from Qilla Saifullah district of Balochistan boosting the number of poliovirus cases in the country to 13 for the year 2024.The country has reported three more cases- two in Balochistan and one in Punjab province.Since 2015, Pakistan has reported a total of 362 polio cases, as per a report in Al Jazeera.However, despite administering more than 300 million doses of oral vaccine annually with the help of at least 350,000 vaccinators and an expenditure of over USD 9.3 bn from 2013 to 2023, the country has been unable to eradicate polio, the Qatar-based publication said.The highly infectious Polio disease has no or mild symptoms and can cause paralysis of the limbs. Polio is transmitted through contaminated water or food, or contact with an infected person. Treatment includes bed rest, pain relievers, rehabilitation and portable ventilators.Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO 's regional director of polio eradication was cited by Al-Jazeera as saying that the challenge exists in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. ""This is where there's a lot of militancy, insecurity and community hostility and frustration towards the government because of conflict and a lack of services,"" Jafari said.Over 50 districts across Pakistan are detecting the virus, he said.Compounding to the challenges is the fact, says the WHO official that not only is the polio programme being targeted but also security personnel that are guarding the teams ""because they become soft targets when they are in the community.""At least 102 polio field workers, officials and security personnel have been killed, including at least six in campaigns carried out this year, the Al Jazeera report cited.Meanwhile, the latest victim is an 11-month-old infant from Qila, in Balochistan who has succumbed to paralysis caused by the wild poliovirus.The child from Qila who displayed symptoms of paralysis on July 17, is among the five cases detected in the district. Other cases in Balochistan have been reported in Chaman, Quetta, Zhob, Dera Bugti, and Jhal Magsi as per a report in the Balochistan Post.In Balochistan, the situation is compounded by a recent history of inadequate vaccination coverage and persistent misconceptions about the vaccine. Despite numerous vaccination campaigns, efforts have struggled to keep pace with the actual number of infections, the publication stated.","On August 10, the 14th polio case of the year was reported from Qilla Saifullah district of Balochistan boosting the number of poliovirus cases in the country to 13 for the year 2024.
