Zelenskyy in Philippines to promote peace summit he says China and Russia are trying to undermine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/zelenskyy-in-philippines-to-promote-peace-summit-he-says-china-and-russia-are-trying-to-undermine/articleshow/110650526.cms,"MANILA: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in the Philippines on Monday in a rare Asian trip to urge regional leaders to attend a Swiss-organized global peace summit on the war in Ukraine that he accuses Russia , with China's help, of trying to undermine.Zelenskyy arrived unannounced and under heavy security in Manila late Sunday after speaking over the weekend at the Shangri-La defense forum in Singapore.He had planned but failed to meet with Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on the sidelines of that annual defense gathering and decided to fly here to personally invite Marcos to attend the summit in Switzerland , two Filipino officials told The Associated Press. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss details of Zelenskyy's secretive trip to Manila.Both leaders spoke critically of China at the defense forum in Singapore, which was attended by top defense and government officials from around the world, including from Washington and Beijing. The talks were held amid the raging wars in Gaza and Ukraine as well as growing tensions and rivalry for influence between the United States and China in the Indo-Pacific region.At a news conference at the Singapore forum Sunday, Zelenskyy accused China of helping Russia to disrupt the Swiss-organized peace summit by pressuring other countries and their leaders not to attend the talks.""Russia, using Chinese influence in the region, using Chinese diplomats also, does everything to disrupt the peace summit,"" he said without elaborating. ""Regrettably, this is unfortunate that such a big independent powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin.""The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Zelenskyy's claim.China has taken what it says is a neutral position on the war, putting it at odds with Ukraine, the U.S. and most of Europe and its trade with Russia has grown, easing the economic impact of Western sanctions. American, Ukrainian and other intelligence agencies say there is evidence that Chinese parts are winding up in Russian weaponry, even if China is not directly arming its neighbor.Switzerland had been hoping China would attend the peace conference in mid-June, but Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning signaled Friday that that was unlikely.At the security forum, Zelenskyy urged top defense officials to participate in the talks in Switzerland, expressing disappointment over the failure of some countries to commit to attending. Ukraine, he said, has proposals to make at the summit as a basis for peace, addressing nuclear security, food security, the release of prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.Zelenskyy said Ukraine is ""ready to hear various proposals and thoughts that lead us ... to an end of the war and a sustainable and just peace.""U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the conference and renewed U.S. commitments to Ukraine. In an address to the forum Saturday, Austin said that ""Putin's war of aggression has provided us all with a preview of a world that none of us would want.""Marcos, whose country has had escalating clashes with China over disputed islets in the South China Sea , bluntly underscored the dangers of the regional flashpoint Friday at the defense forum. He said that if ""a willful act"" should result in a Filipino dyring in one of the periodic faceoffs, ""that is, I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war.""""That would certainly increase the level of response,"" Marcos said in response to a question.Marcos restated earlier concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships ""that illegally enter China's territorial waters"" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire on foreign ships if necessary.""Illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdictions,"" Marcos said, without naming China, but he added the Philippines remained committed to a peaceful resolution of the disputes.Austin said at the forum that U.S. commitment to the Philippines as a treaty ally is ""ironclad"" but reiterated the importance of dialogue with China.""There are a number of things that can happen at sea or in the air, we recognize that,"" he said. ""But our goal is to make sure that we don't allow things to spiral out of control unnecessarily.""",Zelenskyy arrived unannounced and under heavy security in Manila late Sunday. He had planned but failed to meet with Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. He decided to fly here to personally invite Marcos to attend the summit in Switzerland.

Feeling flush: Japan's high-tech toilets go global,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/feeling-flush-japans-high-tech-toilets-go-global/articleshow/110649653.cms,"'Smartest toilet'

'Does it hurt?'

KITAKYUSHU: As Japan plays host to a record influx of tourists, one of the country's more private attractions -- the high-tech toilet -- is becoming a must-have in luxury bathrooms worldwide.With their warm seats and precision spray technology, bidet toilets are the norm in Japan, where more than 80 percent of homes have one, according to a government survey.Now sales are surging abroad and especially in the United States, led by A-list bidet fans such as Drake, the Kardashians and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Japanese company TOTO , which pioneered the electric bidets it claims have sparked ""a global revolution from wiping to washing"", says overseas revenue for toilets has roughly doubled from 100 billion yen ($673 million) in 2012.The pandemic was a key driver, bringing a home-renovation boom but also germ-conscious consumers desperate for an alternative to toilet paper after shelves were cleared by panic-buyers.Senior TOTO executive Shinya Tamura, who oversees international business, told AFP the brand's growth has been a word-of-mouth success.When people first learn how the toilets' water jets work, with pressure and temperature controls, ""there's an image that it's not pleasant"".But ""we can't explain how good it is with words. You need to experience it"", Tamura said.""After a while, most users can't live without it.""The company's international net sales for housing equipment are currently less than a third of those in Japan.It wants to boost sales in the Americas by 19 percent over two years to ""establish a solid position"" there and offset less urgent demand in China.But with more people in the market for a squeaky clean bum, US competitors are challenging TOTO and its Japanese rivals such as Panasonic and LIXIL for their throne.At a major tech fair in Las Vegas this year, the marketing manager of US brand Kohler called its Numi 2.0 -- which takes spoken instructions via an in-built Amazon Alexa -- ""the smartest toilet that exists"".Just like top-end Japanese models, the Numi 2.0 has an automatic deodoriser and a motion-activated lid that opens when you enter the bathroom and closes when you leave.Its spray wand has pulsating and oscillating functions, and users can adjust the warm-air dryer in minute detail.But such pampering comes at a price: around $8,500 to $10,000, compared to around $500 for more basic bidet seats.Americans who travel to Japan are often inspired to upgrade their toilet, a salesman at Ardy's Bath Collection in Beverly Hills told AFP.""They see it in the airport, and they see it in public restrooms, and they use it, and they're like, 'wow, this is great,'"" he said.Bidets are ""popular everywhere"" but it's still a ""private experience"" and ""weird to talk about"" for some customers.Although fancy Japanese-style toilets are fast becoming a status symbol, TOTO's executives have long fought prudishness when trying to expand abroad.After the US launch of its Washlet bidet in 1986, the firm struggled to place advertisements, and its pop-up event was kicked out of a high-end mall because other stores complained.","Japanese company TOTO says overseas revenue for toilets has roughly doubled from 100 billion yen ($673 million) in 2012.

'Vicious' atmosphere

LONDON: Stormy Daniels , the adult film actor, broke her silence after former US president Donald Trump 's conviction to say he should be jailed, in an interview published in British tabloid The Mirror at the weekend.""I think he should be sentenced to jail and some community service working for the less fortunate, or being the volunteer punching bag at a women's shelter,"" Daniels said in the interview, published late on Saturday.A jury of 12 New Yorkers on Thursday found Trump guilty on 34 counts of business fraud for trying to cover up hush money payments to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election .Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid $130,000 to keep silent and prevent scandal from breaking ahead of the election, in which Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton After years of exchanging insults with Trump on social media, Daniels now says she finally has been ""vindicated"", although she was ""shocked"" at how quickly the jury made a decision -- one that made Trump the first ever former US president to be convicted of a crime.Daniels also accused the White House hopeful of being ""completely and utterly out of touch with reality"" and compared him to a child at one point in the interview.The former adult film actor and director helped bring Trump down in court with her gripping testimony, which included graphic descriptions of what she says was a casual sexual encounter in 2006.""Being in court was so intimidating with the jurors looking at you,"" she said in the Mirror interview, adding that she was glad it was proved that she had been ""telling the truth the entire time"".""It's not over for me. It's never going to be over for me. Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy.""The 45-year-old had remained uncharacteristically quiet in the days following the Thursday conviction.Daniels's husband Barrett Blade had previously told CNN that she was ""still processing"" the trial. He suggested that she could be threatened by Trump 's supporters.""You know, all the MAGA idiots are going to be coming after her,"" Blade said, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again movement.Daniels also said she would never escape death threats from Trump's supporters, the Mirror reported.""It's so vicious and threatening... from the standpoint of just the fear of what somebody might do,"" Daniels's lawyer Clark Brewster said of the atmosphere around the trial in an interview with a local ABC News channel.Daniels is a self-made woman who rose from a difficult childhood and through the challenging world of adult movies to become a successful businesswoman.But in a recent documentary, she revealed that behind her outwardly tough, humorous persona on social media, she has been hurt by the constant insults from Trump and his supporters.""Back in 2018 that was stuff like 'liar', 'slut', 'gold digger',"" she said in the film, ""Stormy"".""This time around, it is very different. It is direct threats, it is, 'I'm going to come to your house and slit your throat', 'your daughter should be euthanised'.""The trial and its revelations have added to tensions in the already bitterly divided country.On Friday, Trump launched into a stream of insults and non-factual claims, lashing out that the trial and the judge who presided over it.His campaign on Friday said that it had raised nearly $53 million in online donations after the conviction, boasting that the verdict had boosted his support ""like never before"".Trump is due for sentencing on July 11 but is expected to appeal the verdict. He potentially faces a prison sentence but is much more likely to receive probation.","Stormy Daniels says former US president Donald Trump should be jailed.

"South Africa election result confirms no party won a majority, alliance talks start",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/south-africa-election-result-confirms-no-party-won-a-majority-alliance-talks-start/articleshow/110649376.cms,"JOHANNESBERG: South Africa 's governing African National Congress lost its 30-year-old outright majority in this week's election, winning only 159 seats in the 400-seat parliament, official results showed Sunday. Prez Cyril Ramaphosa and the politicians of most of the rival parties attended the announcement, but in a sign he intends to challenge the result, former prez Jacob Zuma stayed away.

No single party won a majority in the National Assembly.

Voters, angry at joblessness, inequality and rolling blackouts, slashed support for the legacy party of Nelson Mandela to 40%, down from 57.5% (or 230 seats) in the 2019 parliamentary vote. Behind the ANC came the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) on 87 seats with 22% of the vote. In third place was Zuma's upstart radical party, the newly-formed uMkonto weSizwe (MK), which grabbed 14.5% of the vote and 58 seats - but had nevertheless denounced the process.

The ANC said that it is open to talking to any party but vowed not to replace Ramaphosa as a condition to forming a governing coalition.

Ceasefire or political survival? Gaza plan puts Bibi in a spot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ceasefire-or-political-survival-gaza-plan-puts-bibi-in-a-spot/articleshow/110649298.cms,"For months, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to offer a timeline for ending the war against Hamas in Gaza , a reticence that his critics see as a political tactic. But he has been put on the spot this weekend by US Prez Biden 's announcement outlining a proposal for a truce.Netanyahu, a conservative, has long juggled competing personal, political and national interests. He now appears to be facing a stark choice between the survival of his hardline, hawkish govt and bringing home hostages held in Gaza while setting himself and Israel on a new course away from growing global isolation.Critics of the PM say there are two Netanyahus: one who functions pragmatically in the war cabinet he formed with some centrist rivals, boosting its public legitimacy; and another who is being held hostage by the far-right members of his coalition, who oppose any concession to Hamas and who ensure his political survival.Biden on Friday outlined broad terms that he said were presented by Israel to the American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators who have been pushing for a deal to pause the fighting. Israeli officials confirmed that the terms matched a ceasefire proposal that had been greenlit by Israel's war cabinet but not yet presented to the Israeli public. Now, analysts say, it is crunchtime for Netanyahu, or Bibi, as he is popularly known. Biden ""booted Netanyahu out of the closet of ambiguity and presented Netanyahu's proposal himself,"" Ben Caspit, a longtime critic of the PM, told a Hebrew daily.Members of two far-right parties in the coalition - Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's minister of finance, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister - have explicitly threatened to bring Netanyahu's govt down if the PM goes along with the deal outlined by Biden before Hamas is fully destroyed. Some hardline members of Netanyahu's own Likud party have said they will join them.At the same time, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, two former military chiefs who joined the emergency govt for the duration of the war, have threatened to withdraw the support of their centrist National Unity party by June 8 if Netanyahu fails to come up with a clear path forward. And opposition parties have begun organising to try to topple the govt.The ceasefire proposal involves three phases. They would see tranches of hostages released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails; a temporary ceasefire would turn into a permanent cessation of hostilities, with the third phase involving an internationally backed bid to rehabilitate Gaza. An estimated 125 hostages, living and dead, are still held in Gaza.Ophir Falk, the chief foreign policy adviser to Netanyahu, told UK's Sunday Times that Biden's proposal was ""a deal we agreed to."" Adding that many details still had to be worked out, he said, ""It's not a good deal but we dearly want the hostages released, all of them."" Israelis were left to parse the two statements that Netanyahu's office put out: They neither forcefully endorsed the proposal nor denied that it had been presented to the mediators. Instead, they were conditional - seemingly designed to leave Netanyahu's options open.","US Prez Biden outlined broad terms that he said were presented by Israel to the American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators.

A special cabinet committee of ministers has been formed to implement this decision.In a press release, the Maldives President's Office said, ""President Dr Mohamed Muizzu, following a recommendation from the Cabinet, has resolved to impose a ban on Israeli passports.""The press release reads, ""The Cabinet decision includes amending necessary laws to prevent Israeli passport holders from entering the Maldives and establishing a Cabinet subcommittee to oversee these efforts.""Maldives will also appoint a special envoy to address Palestine's requests from the Maldives amidst the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.The island nation also plans to organize fundraising events to aid those in the besieged Palestinian territory. These efforts will be coordinated with the UNRWA. Furthermore, a national march titled ""Maldivians with Palestine"" will be held, along with meetings with other Islamic countries to seek a swift resolution to the Palestinian issue.This comes after South Africa initiated legal action against Israel at the International Court of Justice, which has issued a temporary order to prevent violent actions against Palestinians in Gaza.The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.Israel's retaliatory bombardments and ground offensive have killed at least 36,379 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.On Friday, US President Joe Biden announced that Israel has proposed a ""comprehensive new proposal"" aimed at achieving a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza and securing the release of all hostages held by the group.According to Biden, this proposal, conveyed to Hamas via Qatar, details a ""roadmap"" towards a ceasefire.

"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down huge global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities. The US Department of Justice and the FBI have been instrumental in this operation, which has led to significant financial and operational seizures, including millions in cryptocurrency and luxury assets.Here is all you need to know:(With inputs from agencies)","The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries.

NEW DELHI: Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota , near Madison. This significant find includes a canoe dating back to 2500 BC. The Wisconsin Historical Society revealed the discovery on May 23, noting that the initial two canoes were found in 2021 and 2022.Dr Amy Rosebrough, State Archaeologist for the Wisconsin Historical Society, explained the importance of this find, saying, ""The Indigenous peoples of Wisconsin and the wider United States fished, traveled, and traded extensively on inland lakes and streams, and until now we have not had a clear look at the canoes used in the Great Lakes region."" She likened the discovery to understanding life in the Midwest without ever seeing a real pickup truck, emphasizing the crucial role canoes played in transportation and trade.Radiocarbon dating revealed that the oldest canoe dates back to 2500 BC, contemporary with the construction of Stonehenge, and much earlier than the founding of Ancient Rome or the birth of Jesus Christ. The youngest canoe dates to 1250 AD.Not all canoes will be removed from the lake due to their fragility. Rosebrough mentioned that divers also found stone tools in the water, suggesting the presence of an ancient village site, which has yet to be located. ""Even without finding the village, the discovery of these canoes and the tools found within the first canoe reminds us that people have lived and worked alongside the lake for thousands of years,"" she added.Efforts are ongoing to explore the lake further, using non-destructive remote sensing techniques to uncover more about this prehistoric site. Rosebrough highlighted the unique archaeological potential of smaller bodies of water like Lake Mendota, which often receive less funding than the Great Lakes but hold distinct historical significance.The Wisconsin Historical Society, in partnership with Native Nations in Wisconsin, aims to uncover and share the rich history of these discoveries at the new Wisconsin History Center, set to open in early 2027.","Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota.

Lawyers on both sides will recommend sentences, which will be debated at the sentencing hearing where Merchan will make a final decision.

Will Trump go to prison?

That is unlikely. While the maximum sentence for falsifying business records is four years in prison, it is rare for first-time offenders of this crime in New York to receive prison time. ""Punishments like fines or probation are more common,"" and alternatives like home confinement or curfews could be considered, given the logistical challenges of imprisoning a former president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.

Can Trump appeal the conviction?

Yes, Trump is expected to appeal. He may argue that the indictment was legally flawed and politically motivated. His defense will likely focus on several legal points, including that state election laws do not apply to federal elections and that the charges themselves were legally improper.

Could Trump still become president?

Yes, the US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years. Even if he were in jail, Trump could theoretically be sworn in as president on January 20, 2025.

Can Trump vote for himself?

Yes, as long as Trump is not imprisoned in New York, he can vote for himself. Florida defers to other states' rules on felony disenfranchisement, and in New York, felons regain their voting rights once they are out of prison, even if on parole.

Will Trump's conviction affect his campaign?

The conviction does not legally prevent Trump from running for or becoming president. The Republican National Convention, which will take place shortly after his sentencing, has no rules disqualifying a convicted nominee. Trump remains popular among the GOP base, and the party's leadership is aligned with him.

What are the broader implications of this conviction?

The conviction marks unprecedented territory in US politics, especially as Trump faces three other criminal cases. The Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts after deliberating for two days. The trial included explicit testimony and evidence that implicated Trump in approving a $130,000 payment to silence Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.

What are the next steps for Trump legally and politically?

Following his sentencing, Trump can appeal to higher courts. His defense team has already laid groundwork for appeals, citing potential judicial bias and procedural issues. Politically, Trump continues to rally support, painting the conviction as a politically motivated attack. Despite the legal challenges, leading strategists believe Trump remains a formidable candidate for the 2024 election.

"Boeing’s long-awaited space mission, carrying Sunita Williams, aborted just before liftoff",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nasa-boeing-starliner-sunita-suni-williams-space-mission/articleshow/110631968.cms,"Boeing Co and Nasa postponed the first crewed flight of the company’s already long-delayed space taxi on Saturday, halting the countdown less than four minutes before takeoff due to a launchpad computer system issue.The CST-100 Starliner ’s flight from Florida to the International Space Station is a critical test to prove the craft can safely carry people to and from the orbiting research laboratory for Nasa.A launchpad sequencer that controls vital systems during the final countdown triggered the abort, the latest setback for a launch effort years in the making. Nasa said it’s forgoing a possible launch on Sunday to allow the agency, United Launch Alliance and Boeing time to determine what went wrong.The next launch opportunities are June 5 and June 6, Nasa said in a blog post. ULA builds the Atlas V rocket that will loft the Starliner capsule to space.Earlier Sunday, ULA Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno said the remedy might be an easy hardware fix as simple as swapping out a part — or it could be more involved.The launch sequencer is made up of three redundant computers; two of the computers reported normal conditions, while the third one moved more slowly than it was supposed to. That automatically triggered the abort. ULA still doesn’t know what caused the third computer to behave that way.In 2014, Nasa awarded Boeing $4.2 billion and Elon Musk’s SpaceX $2.6 billion in contracts to create vehicles to ferry the agency’s astronauts to space, the centerpieces of its Commercial Crew Program.While Starliner has fallen seven years behind schedule because of to a long line of technical glitches and failures, rival SpaceX has launched nine separate crews to the space station for Nasa since 2020.The repeated delays have added mounting pressure for Boeing, which has racked up roughly $1.5 billion in cost overruns on the program. The company’s defense and space division is expected to lose money during the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Brian West told a conference in May, citing “cost pressure” on fixed-price contracts.Boeing faces questions about the long-term vision for its space business. It’s unclear whether Starliner will be used beyond a half-dozen more missions to the ISS for Nasa. Late last year, West told a small gathering of investors that the company has a decision to make about future investment in the program, Bloomberg has reported.The Saturday launch attempt, meant to carry veteran Nasa astronauts Sunita “Suni” Williams and Barry “Butch” Wilmore, came after weeks of uncertainty about when the mission would get off the ground.Nasa and Boeing tried to launch on May 6, but mission controllers stopped the countdown after noticing some weird behavior with a valve inside the rocket, forcing Williams and Wilmore to exit the spacecraft and wait for another launch day.Engineers replaced the valve, but the launch was delayed again after Boeing discovered a helium leak on one of Starliner’s many thrusters. After weeks of analysis and meetings, Boeing and Nasa ultimately decided to move forward with the launch without fixing the leak, saying it did not pose a safety issue and that engineers would monitor it throughout the flight.It’s possible that recent launch delays will force Boeing to take another incremental charge on Starliner, JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a May 27 research note.For this mission, Williams and Wilmore are slated to stay aboard the space station for about a week. Once their mission is complete, they will undock from the ISS in Starliner and land in the southwestern US under parachutes.","The launchpad sequencer that controls vital systems during the final countdown triggered the abort.

A shooting incident occurred on a street in Akron , Ohio , in the early hours of Sunday morning, resulting in the death of one and injuries to 24 others.

Police received reports of gunshots just after midnight, and multiple victims were reported to have been struck by the gunfire. Shortly after, local hospitals informed emergency dispatchers that people were arriving at their emergency departments with gunshot wounds.

According to Capt. Michael Miller, an Akron police public information officer, the total number of victims was 25, including the deceased. Miller provided an update on Sunday afternoon, stating that at least two of the wounded victims remained in critical condition, while the injuries sustained by the others were not considered life-threatening.

As of now, no arrests have been made in connection with the shooting. The police have stated that the investigation is still in its early stages and have appealed to anyone with information to contact the detectives working on the case. Witnesses at the scene told WEWS-TV that ""hundreds of people were enjoying themselves with everyone in white T-shirts and 'women on top of vehicles dancing'"" before the gunfire erupted.

The station also reported that officers discovered numerous bullet casings and one firearm at the scene.

Oil producers led by Saudis extended supply cuts amid slack prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/oil-producers-led-by-saudis-extended-supply-cuts-amid-slack-prices/articleshow/110644871.cms,"FRANKFURT: Saudi Arabia and allied oil producing countries on Sunday extended output cuts through next year, a move aimed at supporting slack prices that haven't risen even amid turmoil in the middle east and the start of the summer travel season.The Opec+ alliance, made up of members of the producers cartel and allied countries including Russia, extended three different sets of cuts totaling 5.8 million barrels a day.International benchmark Brent has loitered in the $81-$83 per barrel range for the past month. Even the war in Gaza and attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels in Yemen have not pushed prices up toward the $100 per barrel level last seen in September 2022. Reasons include higher interest rates, concerns about demand due to slower than desired economic growth in Europe and China, and rising non-Opec supply including from US shale producers,Yet the Saudis need higher oil prices to fund ambitious plans by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the country's economy away from fossil fuel exports. Higher oil prices would also help Russia maintain economic growth and stability as it spends heavily on its war against Ukraine.Analysts say the cuts could push oil prices higher in coming months, but much depends on demand for oil going forward. The summer usually sees a spike in demand through the July-September quarter, but uncertainty about demand grows after that.US motorists have benefitted from weaker oil prices. Gasoline prices have been quiescent recently, averaging $3.56 per gallon last week, a penny less than a year ago. That is down from a record national average high of $5 per gallon in June 2022. US prices can vary by region and Western states have been paying more, with gas hitting an average $5.05 per gallon in California.US gas prices rise along with crude because the price of oil makes up half the cost of a gallon of gasoline. The price swings are much smaller in Europe because there taxes make up a bigger proportion of the price of fuel.The cuts that are being extended break down as follows: 2 billion barrels a day agreed among all 23 Opec+ members were extended through the end of 2025, according to an Opec statement.Then, voluntary reductions of 1.65 million barrels a day by a smaller group of members was extended until end 2025 as well, according to a report on the official Saudi Press Agency.And another 2.2 million barrels a day in voluntary cuts, due to expire at the end of this month, were extended until September but would then be gradually reduced month by month until they are eliminated by September 2025.","International benchmark Brent has loitered in the $81-$83 per barrel range for the past month.

Dark plumes of smoke traveled high into the sky over the fire area comprised mostly of grassy hills.Early Sunday, the blaze appeared to be growing, fueled by hot and dry conditions in California. Cal Fire updated the size of the fire to 19.5 square miles (50.5 square kilometers), up from 17.2 square miles (44.5 square kilometers) late Saturday.The fire was 15 percent contained as of Sunday morning, the Cal Fire Santa Clara Unit said in a Facebook post that strong winds and dry grass ""have made it difficult for firefighters to contain.""Chief Baraka Carter said two fire workers were injured, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.Interstate 580, which connects the San Francisco Bay Area to San Joaquin County in central California, was closed from the Alameda County line to the Stanislaus County Line.

The parade in the past was dubbed ""Celebrate Israel,"" but organizers said the exuberant atmosphere would be paused this year given the war and Israeli hostages still being held in captivity, as well as outbursts of antisemitism worldwide.People chanted ""Bring them home now!"" and waved Israeli flags as they marched along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Crowds of spectators lined the route of what this year is being called ""Israel Day on Fifth.""Mark Treyger, CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council, said earlier this week that the event would focus on solidarity, strength and resilience.""This is not a mood of confetti and music,"" Treyger said. ""This is more of a mood of unwavering, ironclad solidarity with hostages to bring them home, and also our unwavering love and pride in our Jewish identity.""The parade, which is in its 59th year, kicked off at about 11:30 a.m. Sunday and was expected to draw more than 40,000 participants, including Israeli dignitaries, celebrities and some of the hostages' families.There was never a thought of canceling the parade this year, Treyger said, despite what he termed an astronomical rise in antisemitism.""This is a moment that we have to meet,"" he said.But there was significant security.New York Police Department officials said Friday they plan to implement measures typically used for high-profile events such as New Year's Eve and July 4. That includes drones, K-9 units, bike patrols, fencing and barriers and designated entry points for spectators all along the parade route.Backpacks, large bags and coolers will be prohibited. Spectators will have to pass through metal detectors and only be allowed to line the east side of Fifth Avenue, with police blocking off the west side.City officials stressed Friday there were no specific or credible threats to either the parade or the city and any protestors have the right to demonstrate so long as its done peacefully.""We're not going to allow any unlawfulness and any disruption of any celebration of one's heritage in this city,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said at a security briefing.The parade represents the first large-scale Jewish event in the city since the war started, although there have been roughly 2,800 protests in the city, with about 1,300 of them related to the conflict, the Democrat said.Israel faces growing international criticism for its strategy of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in the besieged territory have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.","The parade comes almost eight months after the unprecedented Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.

The White House seeks to end Chinese-based ownership on national security grounds. TikTok argues it will not share US user data with the Chinese government and has taken measures to protect user privacy.Trump's 2020 attempt to ban TikTok was blocked by the courts.

CAPE CANAVERAL: The first crewed flight of Boeing 's Starliner spaceship was dramatically called off Saturday with just under four minutes left on the launch countdown clock, for reasons that aren't yet clear.It was the second time the test mission to the International Space Station was scrubbed with the astronauts strapped in and ready to lift off, and yet another setback for the troubled program, which has already faced years of delays and safety scares.Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are waiting to be safely removed from the capsule. Mission commander Wilmore had earlier given a short but rousing speech telling tens of thousands of people tuning into the live feed that ""It's a great day to be proud of your nation.""The former US Navy test pilots, who each have two spaceflights under their belts, were previously called back to quarantine after an aborted launch attempt on May 6 due to a faulty valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.A backup date is available for Sunday, but it's not yet known whether the Starship will be ready to launch.Starliner is poised to become just the sixth type of US-built spaceship to fly NASA astronauts, following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the Space Shuttle from 1981 to 2011, and SpaceX 's Crew Dragon from 2020.NASA is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to theISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.Both companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their gumdrop-shaped, autonomously piloted crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.Boeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored over its then-upstart competitor, but its program fell badly behind amid embarrassing setbacks that mirrored the myriad problems afflicting its commercial airline division.These ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.While teams were working to replace the faulty valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of the spacecraft's thrusters came to light.But rather than replace the seal, which would require taking Starliner apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.- Manual flying -Earlier Saturday, Wilmore and Williams emerged from the historic Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building, exchanging thumbs-up signs and waves with their families before boarding a van that took them to their launch pad.When they do fly, they will be tasked with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft.Starliner is set to dock with the ISS for eight days as the crew carry out tests, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event there is a problem on the orbital outpost.After undocking, it will re-enter the atmosphere and carry out a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.A successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its 737 MAX passenger jets.It's also important for more immediate reasons: the Urine Processor Assembly on the ISS, which recycles water from astronauts' urine, suffered a failure this week and its pump needs to be replaced, Dana Weigel, NASA's ISS program manager, told reporters.This mission is thus tasked with carrying spare equipment, which weighs around 150 pounds (70 kilograms).

Donald Trump 's campaign says it raised $52.8 million after a Manhattan jury delivered a guilty verdict in his hush-money trial . Donors contributed that sum in the 24 hours after the verdict was announced.

Both Trump and President Joe Biden 's campaigns sent out fundraising solicitations after the jury Thursday found the presumptive Republican nominee guilty on all 34 counts of mishandling business records to cover up payments to an adult film actress. The $52.8 million fundraising haul is a massive sum for a single day.

The uploads also included pictures of Pakistan’s current civilian and military leaderships and alleged they stole the mandate of the Imran-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in general elections this Feb.“Every Pakistani should study the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and get to know who was the true traitor, General Yahya Khan or Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” said a quote attributed to Imran.The commission had probed Pakistan’s political-military involvement in East-Pakistan --- current-day Bangladesh --- from 1947 to 1971. The video referred to purported crimes by the Pakistani military during the civil war in East Pakistan and claimed former military dictator General Yahya was responsible.Strong backlash followed the posts, especially from government ranks who called it “alarming” and accused PTI of fuelling a narrative of “hatred and incitement” by drawing comparisons between Imran and Mujib.On Friday, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials visited the prison where Imran has been kept to quiz him over the post but he refused to meet them without lawyers. FIA has sent a notice to Imran on the matter.This was followed by a meeting of army commanders, which vowed to defeat what it termed “digital terrorism” by trying to induce despondency and sowing discord by peddling “blatant lies, fake news, and propaganda”. “The nation is fully cognisant of their ugly and ulterior motives and the designs of these nefarious forces,” General Munir was quoted army’s media wing as saying.Imran’s PTI had until recently been trying to disassociate itself from the controversial posts but “owned” them on his directions. A meeting of PTI’s core committee was held on Friday. “Hamoodur Rehman Commission Report must be made public to avoid 1971 like grave challenges, learn a lesson from the past and apprise the people about what exactly happened in 1971,” PTI said in a statement after the meeting.The statement then sought to draw a parallel between 1970 and the current situation in Pakistan. “In 1971 debacle, the most important aspect was rejection of the people’s mandate, which is also presently prevailing in the country,” PTI said.",The posts were uploaded by Imran’s social media team last week on his X account.

NEW DELHI: A Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country. His statements were made in the case of poet and journalist Ahmed Farhad Shah, who the lawyer said cannot be brought to the federal capital for court proceedings from PoJK, as he was in 'foreign territory' that does not come under the country's jurisdiction.During the session, additional attorney general Munawar Iqbal Duggal said that Farhad faced charges in PoK and was in custody until June 2. Duggal mentioned that Farhad's family had met him, suggesting that the habeas corpus petition should be dismissed.Presiding over the proceedings, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani considered the plea filed by Arooj Zainab, Farhad's spouse, as reported by Dunya News.Petitioner's counsel Imaan Mazari emphasised that her client sought not only her husband's return but also action against those responsible for his enforced disappearance.The HC emphasised that the case would only conclude upon Farhad's appearance in court.AAG Duggal argued that PoJK, with its own constitution and courts, was considered foreign territory. Judgments from Pakistani courts were treated akin to those from foreign courts, as per Dunya News.The petitioner's attorney informed the court that Farhad's family had traveled from Islamabad to the Dhirkot police station but were told upon arrival that he had been moved to Muzaffarabad due to terrorism-related charges. When questioned about Farhad's whereabouts before his May 29 detention, the Islamabad prosecutor general deferred to the PoK court.Justice Kayani remarked that everyone should work within the law, to which the prosecutor general maintained that he works within the law, reported Dunya News.""We have to determine the misuse of law,"" Kayani said to the petitioner's attorney's argument that the court should also consider cases involving the misuse of laws and procedures.The court adjourned the hearing of the case until June 7, rejecting the request to dispose of the petition for the recovery of poet Ahmed Farhad.","Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan- Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country.

Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said.

Those that started growing were infected with (parasite) black hopper,"" said Yusuf, who has worked half his life growing mangoes.Now over 60 years old, Yusuf said ""climate change has wreaked havoc"" in his village of Tando Allahyar, around 200 kilometres (124 miles) northeast of economic hub Karachi.Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP.Further south in Tando Ghulam Ali, Arsalan, who manages a 900-acre mango orchard, noticed the damage as soon as the harvest started this week.""We have production losses of 15 to 20 percent, and the picking has only just started so this figure will surely increase,"" said the 32-year-old.Exports will be slashed as a result warned Arsalan, who only goes by one name.""The mangoes turn yellow from the outside but remain underripe or overripe inside,"" he explained.Ziaul Haq, a mango grower and exporter from Tando Ghulam Ali, said the ""many attacks on fruit"" by pests were unprecedented.""This, in our history, has never happened before,"" he told AFP.'Feed our families'The proliferation of parasites has led to an explosion in spending on pesticides.This uptick was confirmed by several farmers in Sindh province, where Tando Allahyar and Tando Ghulam Ali are located, as well as those in the leading agricultural province of Punjab further north.They told AFP that chemicals are now used six to seven times per year, compared to just twice three years ago.Farmers in Sindh said they have been struggling since 2022 when a series of severe heatwaves were followed by unprecedented flooding, while those in Punjab said the declining crops yields date back several years more.""The losses in Punjab reached 35 to 50 percent and in Sindh, 15 to 20 percent"" compared to last year, said Waheed Ahmed, head of the Pakistan Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association (PFVA).Speaking to local media, he said that last year Pakistan had only managed to export 100,000 of the 125,000 tonnes of mangoes it planned to sell abroad.Pakistan's 20 varieties of mangoes come second only to oranges as the most-produced fruit in the country.The income loss from a poor harvest could have a significant impact on the country, which is in talks to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Mashooq Ali, a 30-year-old labourer in Tando Ghulam Ali, wants the government to help farmers cope.""Landowners will earn less this year,"" said Ali, whose wife has started trading clothes to earn extra cash.""And even if they paid us as much as last year, with inflation, we won't be able to feed our families.""",Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP.

It is true that even in Pakistan now a perspective based on reality is coming to the fore.""India's comment came a day after Nawaz Sharif said that Pakistan ""violated"" the agreement signed between him and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1999 which was followed by the Kargil war.""On May 28, 1998, Pakistan carried out five nuclear tests .
