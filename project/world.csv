"Amid renewed assault, Russia 'capture' five villages in northeast Ukraine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/amid-renewed-assault-russia-capture-five-villages-in-northeast-ukraine/articleshow/110046450.cms,"NEW DELHI: Russia has claimed the capture of five villages in Ukraine 's northeastern Kharkiv region , escalating tensions in the ongoing conflict . President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urgently appealed for military aid as Ukrainian troops engage in counterattacks to thwart Russian advances.Moscow's defense ministry announced the ""liberation"" of five villages in Kharkiv near the Russian border, along with the seizure of one village in the Donetsk region.This offensive follows Russia's reported incursion into the Kharkiv region, marking small advancements into a border zone from which it had been repelled nearly two years ago.President Zelenskyy, in a televised address, emphasized the imperative of disrupting Russian offensive plans, labeling it as the country's top priority. Heavy fighting has been reported in the border area, prompting the evacuation of 1,775 individuals. Tragically, two men were killed and two others wounded by guided aerial bomb attacks in the town of Vovchansk.Despite assurances from Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov that there is currently no imminent ground operation threat to the city of Kharkiv, residents from border areas have fled in fear. Evacuees, many of whom are elderly, have sought refuge at reception centers near Kharkiv, receiving essential assistance.The situation remains precarious, with aid workers highlighting the challenges of evacuating residents amid ongoing troop movements and heightened danger. Zelenskyy reiterated the urgent need for international support, stressing the importance of timely arms deliveries to bolster Ukrainian defenses.Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks inside Russia and Russia-held territories, targeting energy infrastructure. In a retaliatory strike, a missile hit a restaurant in the Russian-held city of Donetsk, claiming three lives and injuring several others.Analysts speculate that Russia's ground operation aims to establish a buffer zone near its Belgorod region or divert Ukrainian resources from the Donetsk region. Despite Washington's announcement of a $400 million military aid package for Ukraine and assurances of its capability to repel fresh Russian campaigns, the situation on the ground remains volatile.","Moscow's defense ministry announced the ""liberation"" of five villages in Kharkiv near the Russian border.

"US 'alarmed,' 50,000 protest Georgia's foreign agent bill",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-alarmed-50000-protest-georgias-foreign-agent-bill/articleshow/110044131.cms,"TBILISI: About 50,000 opponents of a ""foreign agents"" bill marched peacefully in heavy rain through the Georgian capital on Saturday, after the United States said the country had to choose between the ""Kremlin-style"" law and the people's Euro-Atlantic aspirations .""We are deeply alarmed about democratic backsliding in Georgia ,"" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan wrote on X.""Georgian Parliamentarians face a critical choice - whether to support the Georgian people's EuroAtlantic aspirations or pass a Kremlin-style foreign agents' law that runs counter to democratic values,"" he said. ""We stand with the Georgian people.""The bill, which would require organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as ""agents of foreign influence"", has touched off a rolling political crisis in Georgia, where thousands have taken to the streets to demand the bill be withdrawn.The crowd on Saturday waved Georgian, European Union and some Ukrainian flags and in a break with the past, included more older protesters as well as the many young people who have thronged the streets over the past month.""The government should hear the free people of Georgia,"" said one protester in her 30s who gave her name as Nino, waved a large Georgian flag and led one of three columns that converged on the city centre, which blocked much of the city's roads and filled the cobblestoned heart of Tbilisi's old town.""We want to enter the European Union with our proud nation and our dignity,"" she said.Anuki, a 22-year-old student of acting, said it was her generation's responsibility ""to make sure that our future and the future of generations after us are safe, that they have freedom of speech, and they are free, basically.""""And we don't want to be part of Russia,"" she added. ""We never wanted to be part of Russia.

Joe Biden wants to remind 2024 voters of a record and an agenda. Often it's Donald Trump's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-biden-wants-to-remind-2024-voters-of-a-record-and-an-agenda-often-its-donald-trumps/articleshow/110043097.cms,"SEATTLE: President Joe Biden is running for reelection on a record and an agenda -- often Donald Trump ’s.In a hotel ballroom in Seattle, at fancy homes in California and at stops in Illinois and Wisconsin over the past week, Biden has been betting that reminding voters about Trump's presidency and highlighting his Republican opponent's latest campaign statements will work to the Democrat's advantage.At a Seattle fundraiser Friday night, Biden brought up Trump's recent interview with Time magazine in which Trump said states should be left to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.“I really urge you to read it,” Biden said.Biden, who headlined another Seattle fundraiser Saturday before returning to the East Coast, has plenty of other Trump material to draw from, too.The president highlights how Trump has promised, if elected, to be “a dictator on Day 1”, how he has suggested the United States would not necessarily defend allies from aggression and how he has pledged to “totally obliterate the deep state” in the federal bureaucracy, which he blames for blocking his first-term agenda.“And he said a whole lot more,” Biden said during a Chicago appearance. “But the bad news is he means what he says. He means what he says. Unless you think I’m kidding, just think back to the 6th of January. This guy means what he says,” referring to the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Biden wants the 2024 to be a referendum on Trump's record and plans, but he also wants voters to look favorably on his own policies and actions.Biden and his allies think the country needs reminding about Trump's tenure and his outlandish and often concerning statements, particularly because the Republican is no longer ubiquitous on X, formerly Twitter, nor is he in front of television cameras as often as he once was.“Chaos is nothing new for Trump,” Biden said in Chicago. “His presidency was chaos. Trump is trying to make the -- the country forget about the dark and unsettling things that he did when he was president. Well, we’re going to not let them forget.”Biden frequently highlights Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and how he stood by when supporters violently stormed the Capitol as Congress met to certify his loss to Biden. He also points to Trump separating children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border, tax cuts the Republican pushed through that benefited corporations and the wealthy and his repeated efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act.Biden's barbs have been getting sharper of late.He opened his Seattle fundraiser on Friday night by telling donors, “Thank you for the warm welcome. Please keep it down, because Donald Trump is sleeping. Sleepy Don.” That was a riff off of news reports that the former president has dozed off during his criminal trial in a New York courtroom. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges in a hush money scheme to illegally influence the 2016 presidential election.Biden also talks about Trump’s admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his self-described “love letters” with Kim Jong Un, the authoritarian leader of North Korea.Biden frequently jabs at Trump for wondering aloud during the COVID-19 pandemic whether disinfectants could be injected or ingested to fight the virus. “That bleach he didn’t inject in his body; he just put it in his hair,” Biden says to laughter every time. “But, look, he’s got more hair than I do.”Trump's campaign said in a statement that “their records speak for themselves. President Trump created the most secure border in history and peace in the world. President Trump was the first president in modern history not to enter the U.S. in any new wars. Joe Biden’s weakness has led to wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, an immigrant invasion of our border, anti-Semitic protests on our college campuses, and crime and chaos in every American city.”Trump doesn't hesitate to criticize Biden and his policies. Trump is spending much of his time lately sitting in court. But before and after the proceedings, he often stands in front of cameras outside the courtroom and goes after Biden.At a recent Wisconsin rally, Trump mentioned Biden within the first 2½ minutes of his speech and referenced the president or his administration more than 60 times during his remarks.Trump's criticism often takes a dark turn. Last weekend, he told donors at his Florida resort that Biden was running a “Gestapo administration.""The Gestapo was the secret police force of the Third Reich that squelched political opposition generally and, specifically, targeted Jewish people for arrest during the Holocaust. Trump’s unfounded comparison to Nazi-era tactics is part of his effort to deny and deflect the charges against him, most notably his effort to overturn Biden’s 2020 victory.Biden's strategy is a gamble. Voters are divided in their views of both men's presidencies.An April poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that nearly half thought Trump’s presidency hurt the country on voting rights and election security, relations with foreign countries, abortion laws and climate change. But more than half of U.S. adults thought Biden’s presidency hurt the country on cost of living and immigration.For all his criticism of Trump, Biden does get around to talking about his agenda and accomplishments. He tells supporters about his work to boost the economy and to bring the country out of the pandemic. He discusses his support for abortion rights even as he highlights how Trump has taken credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade in part because of his Supreme Court nominations.“Folks, the choice is clear,” Biden told supporters recently in the nation's capital. “Donald Trump’s vision of America is one of revenge and retribution.”“I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s chances,” he went on. “Not because I’m president, because of the state of the moment. The world needs us.”","President Joe Biden is running for reelection on a record and an agenda -- often Donald Trump ’s.

Trump may face a $100 million-plus tax bill if he loses IRS audit fight over Chicago tower: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-may-face-a-100-million-plus-tax-bill-if-he-loses-irs-audit-fight-over-chicago-tower-report/articleshow/110042759.cms,"WASHINGTON: Former US president Donald Trump may face an IRS bill in excess of $100 million after a government audit indicates he double-dipped on tax losses tied to a Chicago skyscraper, according to a report by The New York Times and ProPublica that drew on a yearslong audit and public filings.The report's findings could put renewed focus on Trump's business career as the presumptive Republican nominee tries to regain the White House after losing in 2020.Trump used his cachet as a real estate developer and TV star to build a political movement, yet he has refused to release his tax filings as past presidential candidates have. The tax filings that the public does know about have come from past reporting by the Times and a public release of records by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee in 2022.Trump's presidential campaign provided a statement in son Eric Trump's name saying the IRS inquiry “was settled years ago, only to be brought back to life once my father ran for office. We are confident in our position.”The tax records cited by the report indicate that Trump twice deducted losses on the Trump International Hotel and Tower, which opened in 2009 near the banks of the Chicago River that cuts through that city's downtown.The report said Trump initially reported losses of $658 million in his 2008 filings under the premise that the property fit the IRS definition of being “worthless” because condominium sales were disappointing and retail space went unfilled amid a deep US recession.But in 2010, the published report said, Trump transferred the ownership of the property to a different holding company that he also controlled, using the move to save money on taxes by reporting an additional $168 million in losses over the next decade on the same property.The report did not have any updates on the status of the IRS inquiry since December 2022, but said Trump could owe more than $100 million, including penalties, if he were to lose the audit battle.Trump, meanwhile, is appealing a New York judge's ruling from February after a civil trial that Trump, his company and top executives lied about his wealth on financial statements, conning bankers and insurers who did business with him. In early April, Trump posted a $175 million bond, halting collection of the more than $454 million he owes from the judgment and preventing the state from seizing his assets to satisfy the debt while he appeals.Democrat President Joe Biden has said that Trump largely owes his fortune to an inheritance from his father, rather than through his own financial acumen. Biden has gone after Trump for not wanting to pay taxes, while his administration has increased IRS funding in order to increase audits of the ultra-wealthy and improve compliance with the federal tax code.The Trump campaign opposes the additional funding that Biden and Democrats provided to the IRS. At campaign rallies, Trump has said the United States would be destroyed as a country unless his 2017 tax cuts that are largely set to expire after 2025 are extended.",Former US president Donald Trump may face an IRS bill in excess of $100 million.

New Russian space weapon raises alarm in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-russian-space-weapon-raises-alarm-in-us/articleshow/109919862.cms,"NEW DELHI: US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia 's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, which could potentially transform Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) into a perilous battleground. The discussions about this emerging threat were highlighted by Mallory Stewart, the US assistant secretary of state for arms control, and John Plumb, the assistant secretary of defense for space policy, underscoring the serious implications of such developments.The ASAT weapon in question, allegedly already tested by Russia in high radiation orbits under the guise of electronic testing, diverges from typical scientific satellite protocols. This weapon is designed to disrupt a wide array of satellite operations spanning civilian, commercial, and military sectors by detonating in LEO, which extends approximately 100 to 1200 miles above the Earth, a report in Asia Times said.While there is no immediate deployment, the indiscriminate nature of such a weapon could severely damage satellites and impair critical global services including communication, weather forecasting, and security operations. The US officials emphasized the widespread implications of deploying such technology, noting its potential to make LEO unusable for any satellite operations.The concept of using nuclear weapons in ASAT roles isn't new and harks back to Cold War anxieties. Historical precedents like the US's Project 437 during the Kennedy administration, which was later abandoned due to its potential to damage both enemy and US satellites and infrastructure indiscriminately, illustrate the complexities and risks associated with such weapons.Recent simulations, such as those conducted by Chinese military scientists, have explored the effects of a nuclear detonation at altitude on satellite functionality. These studies show that while a high-altitude nuclear explosion would not create a traditional explosive cloud due to the absence of air, it would generate a belt of high-energy particles trapped by Earth’s magnetic field, posing a significant risk to spacecraft.In response to the decisive role satellite constellations like Elon Musk’s Starlink have played in modern warfare, evidenced by their utility in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, both Russia and China have hinted at developing ASAT capabilities to counter these systems. Reports suggest that these nations view the neutralization of such satellite networks as crucial to diminishing their adversaries' operational effectiveness.US and allied commercial satellites, including those like Starlink which have been pivotal in supporting Ukraine, have been identified by Russian officials as potential targets in the event of escalating hostilities. This stance highlights the broader strategy of using space capabilities as a means of asserting dominance and the potential shift towards militarization of space, despite international treaties like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which seeks to bar such activities.The development and potential deployment of nuclear ASAT weapons pose not only a technological or tactical challenge but also a diplomatic and strategic one, threatening the fabric of international space law and the peaceful use of outer space.",US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite weapon.

One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.More than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.The National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.Crews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.In Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties - all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.Kalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.Samantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.Her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.""I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,"" she said. ""My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.""Travis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.""There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,"" Wycoff said. ""It was just a lot of chaos.""In southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.Candice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and ""the wind just picked up all at once.""""It was definitely a scary moment. ...

Report: Trump may face a $100 million-plus tax bill if he loses IRS audit fight over Chicago tower,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/report-trump-may-face-a-100-million-plus-tax-bill-if-he-loses-irs-audit-fight-over-chicago-tower/articleshow/110045400.cms,"WASHINGTON: Former US president Donald Trump may face an IRS bill in excess of $100 million after a government audit indicates he double-dipped on tax losses tied to a Chicago skyscraper, according to a report by The New York Times and ProPublica that drew on a yearslong audit and public filings. The report's findings could put renewed focus on Trump's business career as the presumptive Republican nominee tries to regain the White House after losing in 2020.Trump used his cachet as a real estate developer and TV star to build a political movement, yet he has refused to release his tax filings as past presidential candidates have. The tax filings that the public does know about have come from past reporting by the Times and a public release of records by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee in 2022.Trump's presidential campaign provided a statement in son Eric Trump's name saying the IRS inquiry ""was settled years ago, only to be brought back to life once my father ran for office. We are confident in our position.""The tax records cited by the report indicate that Trump twice deducted losses on the Trump International Hotel and Tower, which opened in 2009 near the banks of the Chicago River that cuts through that city's downtown.The report said Trump initially reported losses of $658 million in his 2008 filings under the premise that the property fit the IRS definition of being ""worthless"" because condominium sales were disappointing and retail space went unfilled amid a deep US recession.But in 2010, the published report said, Trump transferred the ownership of the property to a different holding company that he also controlled, using the move to save money on taxes by reporting an additional $168 million in losses over the next decade on the same property.The report did not have any updates on the status of the IRS inquiry since December 2022, but said Trump could owe more than $100 million, including penalties, if he were to lose the audit battle.Trump, meanwhile, is appealing a New York judge's ruling from February after a civil trial that Trump, his company and top executives lied about his wealth on financial statements, conning bankers and insurers who did business with him. In early April, Trump posted a $175 million bond, halting collection of the more than $454 million he owes from the judgment and preventing the state from seizing his assets to satisfy the debt while he appeals.Democrat President Joe Biden has said that Trump largely owes his fortune to an inheritance from his father, rather than through his own financial acumen. Biden has gone after Trump for not wanting to pay taxes, while his administration has increased IRS funding in order to increase audits of the ultra-wealthy and improve compliance with the federal tax code.The Trump campaign opposes the additional funding that Biden and Democrats provided to the IRS. At campaign rallies, Trump has said the United States would be destroyed as a country unless his 2017 tax cuts that are largely set to expire after 2025 are extended.",Report: Former US president Donald Trump may face an IRS bill in excess of $100 million.

Trump heading to Jersey Shore to rally 'mega crowd' in weekend break from hush money trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-heading-to-jersey-shore-to-rally-mega-crowd-in-weekend-break-from-hush-money-trial/articleshow/110044326.cms,"WILDWOOD: After a long week in court, Donald Trump is heading to the Jersey Shore . And he's being greeted by thousands of his friends.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , drew what his team called a "" mega crowd "" of ""tens of thousands"" to a Saturday evening rally in the southern New Jersey resort town of Wildwood. It was being held 150 miles (241 kilometers) south of the New York City courthouse where he has been forced to spend most weekdays sitting silently through his felony hush money trial .The beachfront gathering, described by Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., as the largest political gathering in state history, was designed to serve as a show of force at a critical moment for Trump, who is facing dozens of felony charges in four separate criminal cases with the election less than six months away. There is a real possibility that Trump could be a convicted felon by Election Day.Hours before he was scheduled to take the stage, thousands of Trump loyalists donning ""Never Surrender"" T-shirts and red ""Make America Great Again"" hats crowded onto the sand between the boardwalk and carnival rides to greet the former Republican president.""The everyday American people are 100% behind him,"" said Doreen O'Neill, a 62-year-old nurse from Philadelphia.""They have to cheat and smear him and humiliate him in that courtroom every single day,"" O'Neill said. ""This country is going to go insane if they steal the election again.""Trump's extraordinary legal woes, which include three other unrelated criminal cases, have emerged as a central issue in the campaign.Trump has repeatedly accused the Biden administration and Democratic officials in New York of using the legal system to block his return to the White House. Prosecutors allege the former president broke the law to conceal an affair with a porn actor that would have hurt his first presidential bid.And while Trump will almost certainly seize on his legal woes Saturday, a judge's gag order - and the threat of jail - will limit Trump's ability to comment publicly on witnesses, jurors and some others connected to the New York trial, which is expected to consume much of the month. The judge in the case already has fined Trump $9,000 for violating the order and warned that jail could follow if he doesn't comply.Trump's responsibilities as a defendant have limited his ability to win over voters on the campaign trail.He spent last week's off-day from court in the general election battlegrounds of Wisconsin and Michigan. And he was campaigning with tens of thousands of voters Saturday in New Jersey, a reliably Democratic state. Parts of New Jersey have deep-red enclaves and the southern shoreline in particular draws tourists and summer homeowners from neighboring Pennsylvania, a key swing state.President Joe Biden , meanwhile, opened his weekend with a series of fundraising events on the West Coast.He avoided Trump's legal challenges - as he has done consistently - while addressing donors in Seattle. Instead, the Democratic president focused on Trump's recent interview with Time magazine in which the Republican former president said states should be left to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.Saturday's visit to the New Jersey Shore resort wasn't Trump's first.While president, Trump held a rally there in January 2020 to thank Van Drew, the New Jersey congressman who had just left the Democratic Party for the GOP as a rebuke for the former president's first impeachment.Trump drew a crowd at the time that lined the streets, filled bars and supported numerous vendors in what is usually a sleepy city in the winter. This time, the summer season is around the corner for the resort known for its wide beaches and boardwalk games and shops.Wildwood is in New Jersey's 2nd District, which Van Drew has represented for three terms and covers all or part of six counties in southern New Jersey. It went for Trump in 2016 and again in 2020 after earlier backing Barack Obama.Trump is set to return to the courtroom next week, when key prosecution witness Michael Cohen, Trump's fixer-turned-foe, is expected to take the witness stand. Last week, he was visibly angry at times as he was forced to sit through testimony from former porn actor Stormy Daniels, who described a sexual encounter with the former president in shocking detail.Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records. The charges stem from paperwork such as invoices and checks that were deemed legal expenses in company records. Prosecutors say those payments largely were reimbursements to Cohen, Trump's attorney, who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet.The prosecution could rest its case by the end of the week. It's unclear if Trump himself will take the stand when the defense presents its case.Back on the Jersey Shore, 65-year-old Pat Day said she felt some urgency to see Trump in person on Saturday.""We want to see Trump before they take him out,"" said Day, who was visiting from the Florida Keys. ""I'm worried. They're going to do everything they can so he doesn't get elected again.""","Trump is facing dozens of felony charges in four separate criminal cases with the election less than six months away.

NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden has expressed optimism about the possibility of a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict, suggesting it could occur as early as ""tomorrow"" if the militant group releases its hostages. Speaking at a fundraiser outside Seattle, hosted at the residence of a former Microsoft executive, Biden addressed the issue after avoiding the topic at three similar events the previous day.""If Hamas would release the hostages, there would be a ceasefire tomorrow,"" Biden emphasized to the audience of about 100 people.He further underscored Israel's position, saying, ""Israel said it's up to Hamas, if they wanted to do it, we could end it tomorrow. And the ceasefire would begin tomorrow.""The president's remarks follow a warning issued to Israel earlier in the week, in which he threatened to halt the supply of weaponry if Israeli forces were to attack the city of Rafah in southern Gaza . Biden expressed concern over civilian casualties resulting from the use of US-supplied munitions.""We're not gonna supply the weapons and the artillery shells that have been used,"" Biden reiterated in a televised interview with CNN.Despite repeated rounds of indirect negotiations, Hamas and Israel have yet to reach a ceasefire agreement. The conflict intensified following an attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, resulting in the abduction of approximately 250 individuals to the Gaza Strip on October 7. Israeli officials report that 128 hostages remain in Palestinian territory, with at least 36 confirmed deceased.The violence has taken a heavy toll, with an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures estimating over 1,170 deaths, primarily civilians, resulting from the Hamas attack. In response, Israel's military campaign in Gaza has led to the deaths of at least 34,971 people, predominantly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.","US President Joe Biden has expressed optimism about the possibility of a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict.

""It's a hideous place.""Thomas stressed that he and his wife try to ignore their critics and focus on the positive.""You don't get to prevent people from doing horrible things or saying horrible things,"" the justice was quoted as saying by the Times. ""But one, you have to understand and accept the fact that they don't, they can't change you unless you permit that.""According to a ProPublica investigation published last year, 75-year-old Thomas went on one trip to Indonesia paid for by Crow that alone was likely worth $500,000.He also joined Crow -- whose friendship with the justice the New York Times in 2011 called ""unusual and ethically sensitive"" -- for trips to an exclusive all-male wilderness resort in California and to properties in Texas and New York state over the past two decades.Crow told ProPublica that his gifts to Thomas were ""no different from the hospitality we have extended to our many other dear friends,"" and that the two had never discussed pending cases.Thomas, who was nominated for the court in 1991 after a confirmation process in which he was accused of sexual harassment by a former aide, joined the majority of judges who ruled to overturn the national right to abortion last year.He went further than his colleagues, saying the conservative-dominated court should also examine its rulings on contraception and same-sex marriage.",US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has found himself under scrutiny over his judicial decisions.

These aircraft, previously ferrying passengers across Asia, are set to become airborne nuclear command centers.The ""Doomsday"" planes, officially designated as E-4B ""Nightwatch,"" are designed to serve as command-and-control centers for the US military in scenarios such as nuclear wars, where ground facilities are compromised.The aircraft are equipped to host essential figures including the US president and the secretary of defense, allowing them to manage US forces globally from the air, a CNN report said.The transformation of these planes includes fortifying them against the effects of electromagnetic pulses, a type of energy burst from nuclear explosions that can severely damage electrical systems. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, such pulses threaten critical infrastructure on a large scale.Sierra Nevada, based in Colorado, confirmed the acquisition of the jets but declined to provide detailed comments. However, this purchase follows closely on the heels of a significant contract awarded to Sierra Nevada by the Air Force on April 26. Valued at $13 billion, this contract tasks the company with developing and producing the Survivable Airborne Operations Center by 2036, as outlined by a Defense Department announcement.""The development of this critical national security weapon system ensures the Department’s Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications capability is operationally relevant and secure for decades to come,"" said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek.The aircraft involved in this upgrade are the newer 747-800 models, which will replace the older 747-200 airframes that have been in service since the 1980s. The shift not only promises enhanced capabilities but also greater resilience for America's airborne military command structures.Korean Air's decision to sell these aircraft is part of its strategy to renew its fleet, with the transaction expected to be finalized by September 30, 2025. The airline had nine 747-800 passenger jets as of October last year.As part of its expansion and to accommodate this new project, Sierra Nevada has recently opened a large aircraft maintenance facility in Dayton, Ohio, and is in the process of building a second hangar of similar size.This move to modernize and secure the United States' airborne command capabilities marks a critical step in national defense, ensuring readiness and operational effectiveness in the face of evolving global threats.","Sierra Nevada Corporation has acquired five Boeing 747 aircraft from Korean Air to transform them into the next generation of US Air Force's strategic command and control planes.

Daniels, a pivotal figure due to her alleged past with Trump, faced a barrage of questions that not only dealt with the core accusations but also strayed into the realms of the paranormal and the absurd.Trump, charged with 34 felony counts related to falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments, vehemently denies the allegations , including any encounter with Daniels. As she recounted her version of events, the courtroom was gripped by her detailed narrative, so much so that Trump’s legal team twice moved for a mistrial, citing the prejudicial nature of her testimony. Both motions were denied by Judge Juan Merchan.As per a Newsweek report, during her testimony, Daniels discussed an array of topics that seemed to stretch the bounds of relevance. The defense attempted to undermine her credibility by questioning her about her paranormal show, Spooky Babes, where she explores ghostly activities. Daniels admitted to profiting from her claims of communicating with the dead, attributing some mysterious happenings at her home to a possum rather than supernatural causes.The cross-examination took another odd turn when Daniels’ “Making America Horny Again” strip club tour was brought up. This tour, playing on Trump's famous slogan, was highlighted by the defense to suggest Daniels had monetized her alleged encounter with Trump. Daniels distanced herself from the tour's name, indicating she had no control over its branding across various venues, despite acknowledging some promotional posts on her social media.Further, Daniels' use of colorful language came under scrutiny when she was confronted about a social media post referring to the flushing of an ""orange turd."" Daniels clarified that the post was hyperbolic and, although not explicitly naming Trump, she conceded under pressure that it was indeed him she was referring to.The trial, with Daniels’ testimony, has not only illuminated the legal challenges Trump faces but also showcased the unusual and sensational elements that can emerge in such high-profile cases.","Adult film actress Stormy Daniels took the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial.

These moves come amid a broader wave of protests that have escalated tensions on campuses nationwide.At the University of Pennsylvania, early morning operations by Philadelphia and campus police led to the dismantling of a protest camp that had been in place for over two weeks.According to university officials, 33 individuals were initially arrested, including faculty and students, with charges related to trespassing. Among the items recovered from the encampment were heavy gauge chains and bolts, which police suggested could be used as weapons.The protests, which have also spread to campuses in Europe, are part of a larger call by students for universities to sever ties with Israel and companies supporting its military efforts. This movement gains context from the ongoing conflict in Gaza, described by organizers as a genocide—a characterization that Israel vehemently denies and which the United Nations has recognized as having a “plausible risk.”In a pre-dawn operation at MIT, police encircled the protesters’ camp and, after giving a short notice, arrested ten students who chose to remain. The removal was swift, amid chants of pro-Palestinian slogans from a dispersing crowd.The scenario was even more intense at the University of Arizona, where police used tear gas against protesters the day before the school's commencement. This intervention followed incidents of property damage and assaults reported by the university, including spiked police vehicles and thrown projectiles.Responses to the protests have varied across institutions. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, protesters agreed to dismantle their camp in exchange for dialogues with university decision-makers. Conversely, at New Mexico State University and George Washington University, responses involved arrests and continued confrontations.The recent actions have sparked a debate on the balance between safety, free expression, and the academic mission of universities, especially as commencement ceremonies approach. These developments also underscore the complex and polarized nature of global geopolitical conflicts as they manifest on university campuses.",Police arrest dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters as encampments at the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are dismantled.

Switchblade 600: How US plans to counter and check China with suicide drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/switchblade-600-how-us-plans-to-counter-and-check-china-with-suicide-drones/articleshow/110037138.cms,"The US is advancing its military capabilities by integrating suicide drones into its Replicator initiative , aiming to bolster its autonomous systems to address China's growing military influence in the Indo-Pacific region . This month, the Pentagon confirmed the inclusion of AeroVironment ’s Switchblade 600 drone as part of the first tranche of technologies under the Replicator project.Announced by Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks in August 2023, the initiative seeks to deploy thousands of unmanned aerial and surface vehicles within two years, a report in Asia Times said.The Switchblade 600 has demonstrated its effectiveness in Ukraine, targeting armored vehicles over distances exceeding 38 kilometers. Its success is pivotal as the Pentagon looks to quickly ramp up operational capabilities through leveraging commercial technology, supported by a significant budget allocation. This year alone, the initiative has secured about US$500 million, with a request for an equal amount for the next fiscal year.Beyond aerial drones, the initiative is expanding into maritime territories with the Production-Ready Inexpensive Maritime Expeditionary (PRIME) program. This effort aims to diversify the maritime drone vendor base and includes developing low-cost, highly autonomous unmanned boats capable of challenging tasks in strategic areas like the Taiwan Strait.Despite its ambitious scope, the Replicator program faces hurdles such as bureaucratic delays, cultural resistance within the military, and the rapid advancements of competing drone technologies by China. The initiative’s success is crucial as it seeks not only to enhance U.S. military readiness but also to maintain a strategic edge in the face of evolving global threats.","The Pentagon confirmed the inclusion of AeroVironment ’s Switchblade 600 drone as part of the first tranche of technologies under the Replicator project.

CIA chief emerges as the real US powerbroker in Middle East,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cia-chief-william-burns-emerges-as-the-real-us-powerbroker-in-middle-east/articleshow/110036650.cms,"One key American official is quietly keeping Washington’s lines of communication open across the Middle East as the US and Israel endure their worst falling-out in decades over the war in Gaza.Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns , a veteran diplomat and Arabic speaker, was in Cairo alongside Qatari and Egyptian mediators this week as US President Joe Biden set off a political firestorm by halting the shipment of about 3,500 bombs to Israel.The White House is increasingly concerned about massive civilian casualties if Israel launches a ground offensive on Rafah, the southern Gaza city where 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering from the war.Biden’s priority is winning a deal to release more of the hostages Hamas took in its deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel. And it’s fallen to the US intelligence chief to balance Biden’s carrots-and-sticks approach as Washington struggles to keep the seven-month-old war from escalating further.Burns is “a man of results and I think one of the best US diplomats I have ever met,” said Amr Moussa, a former Egyptian foreign minister.His involvement, according to Moussa, is a recognition by the US that “the rage” in the Middle East provoked by the Gaza war and Washington’s support for Israel has put the US’s reputation and credibility on the line, particularly with traditional Arab allies such as Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. They believe the White House should have put more pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the conflict.Burns “has assiduously developed personal relationships with leaders across the region for decades,” said William Usher, a former senior Middle East analyst at the CIA. “We are at a critical stage. All sides have incentives to back out of a deal and in moments like this, public posturing can often backfire.”Burns played an integral role in helping craft the week-long cease-fire late last year that led to the release of dozens of prisoners on both sides. For a moment earlier this week, it almost seemed as if Burns and his counterparts had pulled it off again after Hamas, designated a terrorist group by the US and European Union, said it had accepted a Qatari and Egyptian proposal to halt hostilities.But the talks quickly stalled again as it became clear Israel would not accept Hamas’s proposal for a truce effectively to be permanent.While Burns appears to be the most prominent US official on the Middle East file at the moment, given the importance of the ceasefire-for-hostages deal that might end the violence, he’s hardly the only official in what has at times seemed like a full-court press from the Biden administration.National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, White House Middle East envoy Brett McGurk, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and the presidential coordinator on global infrastructure Amos Hochstein — who has experience negotiating with Lebanon, where Iran-backed Hezbollah militants are based — have all made extended trips to and within the region.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who’s made seven marathon trips to the region, has helped persuade the Israelis to open border crossings for aid, coordinate humanitarian pauses in the fighting and implement procedures to ensure aid workers don’t get killed in the crossfire, according to US officials.But Blinken’s extended tours in the region and public warnings have sometimes seemed to have little impact on the most right-wing government in Israeli history. The country’s air and ground assault on Gaza has killed more than 35,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. Hamas fighters killed 1,200 people and abducted 250 when they rampaged through southern Israel on Oct. 7, starting the war.“Arab public opinion has no faith in Biden’s statements and sees Blinken’s shuttle diplomacy over nearly eight months as futile,” said Mohammed Tal, former editor-in-chief of Al-Dustour, one of the main newspapers in Jordan, where Burns served as ambassador between 1998 and 2001. Burns’s involvement “has actually given some hope to people in the region — he does enjoy a certain level of credibility.”The CIA director’s role as an intelligence chief allows him to keep a lower profile and deal directly with Israel’s external intelligence agency Mossad. A veteran State Department official with years of relationships in the Middle East, Burns also has a direct line to the White House. That gets him high-level access in Middle East capitals, where officials often prefer to deal with top spies.“He’s got a pretty deep Rolodex,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday. “He’s got relationships all over the world and those relationships are proving important here as he tries to get those hostages home.”The hostage-release assignment is only becoming more difficult as Israel insists on targeting thousands of fighters in Hamas battalions in Rafah. At the same time, Biden is ratcheting up pressure on Israel by saying he might halt even more weapons shipments. Israeli officials have reacted to Biden’s decision with fury. They argue that disrupting weapons shipments to Israel have sent the wrong message to Hamas at a time when the negotiations were at a critical stage.Burns has also proved adept at using the respect he’s garnered in the region to deliver messages to Israel designed to be both warnings and reassurances of support. He demonstrated that tact last month as Israel was weighing the severity of its response to an attack that saw Iran launch hundreds of drones and missiles, almost all of which were repelled.Burns told the George W Bush Presidential Center in Dallas that the response was Israel’s choice, though he suggested an overwhelming retaliation was unnecessary given how Israeli armed forces had already “clearly demonstrated their superiority.”“It’s a reminder of the quality of the Israeli military,” he said. “It’s a reminder of the fact that the Israelis have friends, starting with the United States.”","Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns was in Cairo alongside Qatari and Egyptian mediators this week.

IMF doubts Pakistan's ability to repay debts as support team arrives in Islamabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-doubts-pakistans-ability-to-repay-debts-as-support-team-arrives-in-islamabad/articleshow/110028404.cms,"NEW DELHI: International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed serious concerns about Pakistan's ability to repay its debts, particularly to the global lender itself. The IMF 's assessment came as its support team arrived in Pakistan on Friday to discuss a new bailout package under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), following Islamabad's request.The IMF staff report, issued earlier this month, stated that ""Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund is subject to significant risks and remains critically dependent on policy implementation and timely external financing."" The report further highlighted the exceptionally high risks that could jeopardize policy implementation and erode repayment capacity and debt sustainability, including delayed adoption of reforms, high public debt and gross financing needs, low gross reserves, the State Bank of Pakistan's net FX derivative position, a decline in inflows, and sociopolitical factors.The report emphasized that restoring external viability is crucial for ensuring Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund, which depends on strong policy implementation, including external asset accumulation and exchange rate flexibility. Geopolitical instability was also mentioned as an additional source of risk, despite some reduction in uncertainty surrounding global financial conditions since the last review.According to the IMF, Pakistan requires gross financing of USD 123 billion over the next five years, with the country expected to seek USD 21 billion in fiscal year 2024-25, USD 23 billion in 2025-26, USD 22 billion in 2026-27, USD 29 billion in 2027-28, and USD 28 billion in 2028-29.Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the IMF support team will discuss the first phase of the next long-term loan programme with Pakistan's financial team, focusing on data collection from various departments and discussions on the upcoming budget for the fiscal year 2025 (FY2025) with the Ministry of Finance officials. The team is expected to stay in Pakistan for over 10 days.Pakistan has decided to seek a rollover of around USD 12 billion in debt from key allies like China in the 2024-25 fiscal year to address the USD 23 billion gap in its external financing. The Finance Ministry insiders stated that USD 5 billion from Saudi Arabia, USD 3 billion from the UAE, and USD 4 billion from China will be rolled over, with estimates of further new financing from China to be included in the next financial year's budget.The country is expected to receive more than USD 1 billion from the IMF under the fresh loan programme, along with new financing from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. The federal government aims to achieve budget targets before the anticipated arrival of the IMF review mission in Pakistan, with negotiations for a new loan programme expected to commence in mid-May, ahead of the budget presentation in June.Despite narrowly avoiding default last summer and experiencing some economic stabilization, Pakistan continues to face high fiscal shortfalls and stagnating growth, with the external account deficit being controlled through import control mechanisms at the expense of economic growth, which is expected to be around 2 per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","IMF has expressed serious concerns about Pakistan's ability to repay its debts, particularly to the global lender itself.
