Taiwan keeping watch after Chinese submarine surfaces in Taiwan Strait,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/taiwan-keeping-watch-after-chinese-submarine-surfaces-in-taiwan-strait/articleshow/111071978.cms,"TAIPEI: Taiwan's defence minister said on Tuesday that they have a ""grasp"" of the situation after pictures appeared online of a Chinese nuclear submarine surfacing in the sensitive Taiwan Strait near Taiwanese fishermen.The narrow strait that separates Taiwan from China is a frequent source of tension. Taiwan reports Chinese warplanes and warships operating there on a daily basis, as Beijing seeks to assert its sovereignty claims against the democratically governed island.Taiwanese media published the pictures of the surfaced craft, which appears to be a nuclear-armed Jin class ballistic missile submarine, taken by a Taiwanese fishing boat in the strait as dawn broke on Tuesday, about 200 km (125 miles) from Taiwan's western coast.Asked about the submarine, Taiwan defence minister Wellington Koo said they have a ""grasp"" of the intelligence situation, but declined to say how they were monitoring it or give details.China's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Military experts say the strategic waters off Taiwan's southwestern shores, where the largely shallow Taiwan Strait descends in depth, provide submarines a location for an ambush, making it a hot spot for militaries including China, Taiwan and the United States.Ballistic missile submarines are not designed to attack ships, but to launch ballistic missiles at targets on land.Taiwan's fleet of P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft are based at the Pingtung air base in southern Taiwan, giving easy access to the southern part of the strait.Taiwan has complained in recent years that China has been using so-called grey zone warfare designed to exhaust a foe without resorting to open combat, such as flying surveillance balloons over the island.""We must be fully alert to China's continued military harassment and grey zone threats and must always understand China's constant salami-slicing attempts to unilaterally change the status quo,"" Koo said.""We must be alert at all times, but not panic nor be apathetic, and calmly deal with the situation in the strait,"" he added. ""We won't be the one provoking, and call on China not to be a troublemaker.""Taiwan detected 20 Chinese military planes and seven vessels around the island in the past 24 hours, Taiwan's defence ministry said in its daily report on Chinese military activities on Tuesday morning.","Taiwanese media published pictures of the surfaced craft, which appears to be a nuclear-armed Jin class ballistic missile submarine.

Mexico's incoming president Claudia Sheinbaum says surveys show support for controversial judicial reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/mexicos-incoming-president-says-surveys-show-support-for-controversial-judicial-reforms/articleshow/111071834.cms,"MEXICO : In a move reminiscent of her political mentor , incoming Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum on Monday displayed a series of surveys commissioned by her political party that she said show a wide majority approve of controversial judicial changes.Sheinbaum said the surveys were just ""informational."" She said the polling was done over the weekend and included face-to-face interviews of thousands of eligible voters across Mexico.Everyone should do ""their own analysis of the results,"" she said.The polls, which are not binding in any way, are a page from the playbook of her political mentor, president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who will be succeeded by Sheinbaum on October 1.Critics have questioned the use of the public surveys, calling them more of a public relations ploy to help build momentum to pass legislation.Lopez Obrador carried out one of his own campaign promises six years ago when he submitted a partially built $13 billion Mexico city airport project to a national consultation between his own election and taking office. That survey also came down on his side and he cancelled the project upon becoming president.In another survey, respondents overwhelmingly supported his pet project, the Maya Train, which now carries tourists around the Yucatan Peninsula.When the National Electoral Institute conducted a national referendum in 2021 on whether former presidents should be prosecuted for wrongdoing, voter turnout was so low that it didn't approach the level necessary to make it binding.Lopez Obrador has said he would pursue 20 constitutional changes after his Morena party won a two-thirds majority in Congress in the June 2 elections. They include making all judges run for election and enshrining a series of unfunded benefit mandates in Mexico's constitution.The country's judiciary has blocked several of Lopez Obrador's previous reforms, ruling them unconstitutional.Sheinbaum's surveys were conducted through private Mexican pollsters Enkoll and De Las Heras Demotecnia, in addition to her party's own commission of surveys. She said Morena did not intervene in any way with the different methodologies, giving them autonomy to conduct surveys throughout the country.Each poll was based on between 1,000 and 1,500 face-to-face interviews conducted between June 14 and 16. They had margins of error of plus or minus three percentage points.The surveys asked five questions, including whether participants knew the party is proposing judicial changes and whether they believe there is corruption within the judicial system.According to Morena, the surveys say nearly nine in 10 participants want the creation of an independent organization that would investigate and hold accountable judges in any act of corruption.The US has signaled concern about judiciary changes in Mexico.Last week, Brian Nichols, US assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, urged that there be transparency in Mexico's judicial overhaul, particularly concerning any impact the changes could have on US investors and companies. The US ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, said last week that a strong judicial system was important, but it was up to Mexicans to decide on the changes.","Incoming Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum displays a series of surveys commissioned by her political party.

Later Tuesday, he is to become the first premier to visit Malaysia since 2015.Li, China's second-most powerful leader after president Xi Jinping, will inspect iron ore miner Fortescue 's clean energy research facility in Perth.Fortescue's chairman Andrew Forrest said Li was interested in the company's plans to produce iron ore without carbon emissions and potentially ""green iron.""""I think China chose us because it's not just the best technology to go green in Australia, it's the best technology to go green in the world, and we've got real examples of it in trains, ship engines, trucks,"" Fortescue said.The Perth facility is testing technology on hydrogen, ammonia and batter power for trains, ships, trucks and heavy mining equipment.Li will also visit Chinese-controlled tianqi lithium energy Australia's processing plant south of Perth to underscore China's interest in investing in critical minerals. The plant produces battery-grade lithium hydroxide for electric vehicles.Australia shares US concerns over China's global dominance in critical minerals and control over supply chains in the renewable energy sector.Citing Australia's national interests, treasurer Jim Chalmers recently ordered five Chinese-linked companies to divest their shares in the rare earth mining company Northern Minerals.Prime minister Anthony Albanese wrote in an opinion piece published in Perth's main newspaper, The West Australian, on Tuesday that his government was acting to ensure foreign investment ""continues to serve our national interests.""""This includes reforming the foreign investment framework so that it's more efficient, more transparent and more effective at managing risk,"" Albanese wrote.Forrest said the national risk from Chinese investment in the critical minerals sector was overstated.""Australia should be producing all the critical minerals in the world because we're a great mining country, so by all means let's go in harder after critical minerals, but let's not do it with panic because there is no reason for panic,"" Forrest said.Qiang and Albanese flew to Perth in separate planes late Monday from the national capital Canberra, where the two leaders held an official annual meeting with senior ministers in Parliament House.Albanese revealed that his office had complained to the Chinese Embassy about the behaviour of two officials during a media event with the two leaders after the meeting.Australia had ""concerns"" about two Chinese officials who stood in the way of cameras taking images of well-known Australian journalist Cheng Lei sitting with other reporters as the leaders spoke, Albanese said.Cheng spent more than three years in detention in China for breaking an embargo with a broadcast on a state-run TV network while she was based in Beijing. She was released last year after interventions by the Australian government and now works for Sky News Australia.""When you look at the footage, it was a pretty clumsy attempt, frankly, by a couple of people to stand in between where the cameras were and where Cheng Lei was sitting,"" Albanese told Australian broadcasting corp.""There should be no impediments to Australian journalists going about their job, and we've made that clear to the Chinese embassy,"" Albanese added.Chinese-born, Cheng told Sky News on Monday, the officials ""went to great lengths to block me from the cameras and to flank me.""""I'm only guessing that it's to prevent me from saying something or doing something that they think would be a bad look. But that in itself was a bad look,"" Cheng said.The embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Li and Albanese made statements during the press event, but neither took questions from the assembled journalists.",Chinese premier Li Qiang ends his Australian tour on Tuesday in the West Coast city of Perth.

South Korea fires warning shots after North Korea's soldiers cross border,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/south-korean-fires-warning-shots-after-north-korean-soldiers-cross-border/articleshow/111071797.cms,"South Korean forces fired warning shots after North Korean troops breached the heavily guarded military demarcation line close to the border on Tuesday, according to a report from the Yonhap news agency which cited information from the country's Joint Chiefs of Staff.""Dozens of North Korean troops invaded the Military Demarcation Line today... (and) retreated northwards after warning shots"", referring to the line of control between the two Koreas, which remain technically at war.South Korea's military reported that a group of 20 to 30 North Korean soldiers temporarily crossed the military demarcation line (MDL) that divides the two countries while conducting construction work on the northern side of the border.The incident occurred at approximately 8:30am and marks the second time this month that North Korean soldiers have breached the land border. South Korean soldiers responded by broadcasting warnings and firing warning shots, prompting the North Korean soldiers to retreat. Following the incident, the South's military did not observe any further suspicious activities.This incident follows a similar incident that occurred on June 11, when South Korean soldiers fired warning shots to deter another group of North Korean soldiers who briefly crossed the MDL. According to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Tuesday's incident took place in a different area along the central frontline region. The South's military believes that the North Korean soldiers did not intentionally intrude across the border, and the North did not return fire.In recent weeks, the South's military has observed an increase in North Korean construction activity along the frontline border areas. These activities include the installation of suspected anti-tank barriers, road reinforcement, and the planting of land mines.The recent border intrusions have taken place amidst rising tensions between the two war-divided nations. In a display of Cold War-style psychological warfare, both sides have made it clear that they are no longer adhering to the landmark military agreement signed in 2018, which aimed to reduce tensions between the two countries.","South Korean forces fired warning shots after North Korean troops breached the heavily guarded military demarcation line close to the border on Tuesday.

A collision between a Philippine ship and a Chinese vessel occurred on Monday near the Spratly Islands in the disputed South China Sea , according to Beijing's Coast Guard .Beijing claims nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, a vital waterway facilitating over $3 trillion in annual maritime trade which is subject to overlapping claims by several nations, including China, the Philippines , Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.China deploys various boats to patrol the waters and has transformed several reefs into militarised artificial islands. A series of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have occurred in disputed areas.New Chinese coast guard rules took effect on Saturday, June 15, which reinforce a 2021 law granting its coastguard the authority to use deadly force against foreign vessels in contested waters.Under these new rules, China's coastguard is empowered to apprehend suspected trespassers and detain them for up to 60 days without the need for a trial.In a statement, the Beijing's Coast Guard said, ""Philippine replenishment ship ignored many solemn warnings from the Chinese side"".It ""approached the... Chinese vessel in an unprofessional way, resulting in a collision"", the statement said.""The Chinese Coast Guard took control measures against the Philippine ship in accordance with the law,"" it added.Beijing accused the ship of having ""illegally broken into the sea near Ren'ai Reef in China's Nansha Islands"", using the Chinese name for the Spratly Islands.Manila has accused the Chinese coast guard of ""barbaric and inhumane behaviour"" against Philippine vessels, and President Ferdinand Marcos has called the new rules a ""very worrisome"" escalation.China has defended its new coast guard rules, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying last month that they were intended to ""better uphold order at sea"".The Group of Seven bloc criticised what it called ""dangerous"" incursions by China in the South China Sea on Friday. Recent confrontations between China and the Philippines have raised concerns about a wider conflict over the sea that could involve the United States and other allies.Multiple dollars in ship-borne trade passes through the South China Sea annually, and vastly unexploited oil and gas deposits that are believed to lie beneath its seabed, although estimates vary greatly.The Philippines has encountered various challenges while attempting to provide supplies to its troops stationed on an old naval vessel that was intentionally grounded to assert the country's maritime claims.Chinese Coast Guard ships have employed water cannons to target boats from the Philippines on multiple occasions and several collisions have occurred, resulting in injuries to the Filipino troops.","Beijing claims nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, a vital waterway facilitating over $3 trillion in annual maritime trade. The waterway is subject to overlapping claims by several nations, including China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.

Record-breaking heat wave sweeps across the United States,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/record-breaking-heat-wave-sweeps-across-the-united-states/articleshow/111070026.cms,"More than 75 million Americans were under extreme heat alerts on Monday as a heat wave moved eastward. The mid-Atlantic and New England regions are expected to experience temperatures in the 90s (Fahrenheit) throughout the week, with excessive humidity making it feel even more oppressive.In 2022, the United States experienced the highest number of heat waves, defined as abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days, since 1936. Officials have once again cautioned residents to take necessary precautions.Phoenix has been particularly vulnerable to the dangerous heat in recent years, with a record-breaking 645 heat-related deaths in 2023. On Saturday, temperatures in the city reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit (44 Celsius).According to National Weather Service forecasters, the first two weeks of June in Phoenix have been an average of 5.6 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than normal, marking the hottest start to June on record. Ted Whittock, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix, advised reducing outdoor activities between 10 am and 6 pm, staying hydrated, and wearing light, looser-fitting clothing. The city and surrounding county have opened more than 100 cooling centers, including two new overnight facilities.In Southern California, firefighters made progress in containing a large wildfire in the mountains north of Los Angeles on Monday, following a weekend of explosive, wind-driven growth along Interstate 5. The nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity sent a petition to the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Monday, urging the agency to recognize extreme heat and wildfire smoke as major disasters. A FEMA spokesperson for the western US states noted that while there is nothing precluding an emergency declaration for extreme heat, there would need to be an immediate threat to life and safety that local authorities could not respond to.In contrast to the sweltering conditions across much of the US, late-season snow was forecast for the northern Rockies on Monday and Tuesday, with parts of Montana and north-central Idaho under a winter storm warning. Meanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast. Forecasts indicate that this year's hurricane season is expected to be among the most active in recent memory.","The mid-Atlantic and New England regions are expected to experience temperatures in the 90s (Fahrenheit) throughout the week.

The shooting occurred on June 12 in northeastern Middlesex County , the county prosecutor said in a press release. Responding to a shooting report, officers located two female victims who had sustained gunshot wounds and airlifted them to the hospital. Jasvir Kaur , 29, of Carteret, was pronounced dead at the hospital, while the other victim, a 20-year-old woman, was critical, it said. The other victim was Kaur's cousin, according to CBS News.

Preservation marvel: 250-year-old cherries discovered at first US president George Washington's mansion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/preservation-marvel-250-year-old-cherries-discovered-at-first-us-president-george-washingtons-mansion/articleshow/111067712.cms,"George Washington , the first US president, is often associated with the famous story of cutting down a cherry tree, which is not historically accurate. However, a recent archaeological discovery at his Mount Vernon estate revealed that Washington had a fondness for cherries and other fruits. During a restoration project, dozens of bottles containing perfectly preserved cherries and berries were found in storage pits in the cellar of his mansion on the Potomac River.The discovery of such well-preserved fruit from over 250 years ago is considered extremely rare and remarkable. Mount Vernon's principal archaeologist, Jason Boroughs, emphasized the significance of the find, stating, ""Finding what is essentially fresh fruit, 250 years later, is pretty spectacular.""Mount Vernon is collaborating with the US department of agriculture to conduct DNA testing on the fruit and examine the cherry pits to determine if any can be used to grow new trees. Although the chances of successfully growing a tree from the waterlogged pits are slim, the bottles themselves provide valuable insights into preservation techniques and the dietary preferences of the Washingtons.Historical records indicate that George and Martha Washington enjoyed cherries, particularly when mixed with brandy, as evidenced by Martha's recipe for a ""cherry bounce"" cocktail. However, the cherries found in the bottles were likely intended to be consumed as fresh fruit. The exceptional preservation quality of the fruit is attributed to the highly skilled work of the enslaved individuals who managed the plantation's kitchen and oversaw the bottling process.The bottles were discovered during a $40 million revitalization project of the mansion, which is expected to be completed by the nation's 250th birthday in 2026. The archaeological work, which is inherently destructive, was necessary due to the structural repairs required for the mansion. The bottles predate 1775, as determined by the expansion of the mansion that led to the area being covered with a brick floor.In total, 35 bottles were found in six distinct storage pits, with 29 bottles intact and six broken. The bottles contained a mix of cherries and other berries, believed to be currants and gooseberries. Archaeologists are excited about the wealth of information that can be gleaned from these bottles, providing valuable insights into the dietary habits and preservation techniques of the time.",The discovery of well-preserved fruit from over 250 years ago is considered extremely rare and remarkable.

No such legislation has yet been introduced in either chamber. A warning label would send a powerful message to parents ""that social media has not been proved safe,"" Dr. Murthy wrote in an essay published in NYT opinion section on Monday.In his essay, he cast the effects of social media on children and teenagers as a public health risk on par with road fatalities or contaminated food. ""Why is it that we have failed to respond to the harms of social media when they are no less urgent or widespread than those posed by unsafe cars, planes or food?"" he wrote. ""These harms are not a failure of willpower and parenting; they are consequence of unleashing powerful technology without adequate safety measures, transparency or accountability.""Murthy pointed to research that showed that teens who spent more than three hours a day on social media faced a significantly higher risk of mental health problems, and that 46% of adolescents said social media made them feel worse about their bodies.US teens are spending an average of 4.8 hours per day on platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, according to a Gallup survey of over 1,500 adolescents released last fall.Past warning labels have had significant effects on behaviour. In 1965, after a landmark report from the surgeon general, Congress voted to require all cigarette packages distributed in the US to carry a warning that using the product ""may be hazardous to your health."" That was the beginning of a 50-year decline in smoking. When the warning labels appeared, around 42% of US adults were daily cigarette smokers; by 2021, that portion had dropped to 11.5%.","Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general, announced Monday that he would push for a warning label on social media platforms advising parents that using the platforms might damage adolescents' mental health.

There was unseasonable cold in the Pacific Northwest, snow headed to the northern Rocky Mountains and heavy rainfall forecast from the northern Plains to the Upper Midwest.The National Weather Service estimated more than 63 million people were under heat advisories on Sunday, stretching from the Southwest northward up through Denver and into Chicago. Much of the Midwest and Northeast were under heat warnings or watches on Monday.Temperatures in Phoenix, which hit 112 degrees Fahrenheit (44.4 Celsius) on Saturday, eased slightly on Sunday to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 Celsius).

""We are recommending that everyone reduce their time outdoors between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., stay hydrated and wear light, looser fitting clothing.""The heat in metro Phoenix will ease a bit Monday through Wednesday, with the highs pushing back up as the week progresses, likely prompting another excessive heat warning, Whittock said.The heat has been especially dangerous in recent years in metro Phoenix, where 645 people died from heat-related causes in 2023, which was a record.The city and Maricopa County have adopted additional measures this year in hopes of keeping people safer, including two new overnight cooling centers where people can rest in air conditioning after the sun goes down. There are more than 100 other cooling centers that have been open since May 1 where people can get cold water and sit in a cool space during daytime hours.In neighboring New Mexico, a heat advisory was in effect over the weekend for the Chavez County plains including Roswell, where the high was forecast to hit 107 degrees F (41.6 degrees C) on Monday. The high for Albuquerque reached 99 degrees F (37 C) on Sunday and is forecast to cool slightly to 98 degrees F (36 C) on Monday. The high Sunday was 104 F (40 C) in El Paso, Texas, which opened five cooling centers.Temperatures in Colorado ranged from near 90 degrees F (32.2 C) in areas of metropolitan Denver Sunday to 100 degrees F (37.7 C) in the southern city of Pueblo, with temperatures expected to surpass 100 degrees F Monday in the southern reaches of the state.The heat wave was moving eastward Sunday into the Plains and the Great Lakes area and was expected to arrive in the Northeast by Tuesday. The threat of thunderstorms with potential high winds and heavy rainfall increased in the Chicago area, even as heat indices were forecast to reach near 100 degrees F (37.7 C) through the middle of the week.As the heat wave spreads eastward, temperatures in Washington, D.C., and the rest of the mid-Atlantic, as well as New England, were likely to see highs in the mid- to upper-90s as the week progresses, with excessive humidity making it feel even more oppressive.The US last year saw the most heat waves, consisting of abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days, since 1936.While much of the country swelters, late season snow was forecast for the northern Rockies Monday and Tuesday. Parts of Montana and north-central Idaho were under a winter storm warning , with as much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of heavy, wet snow expected in the mountains around Missoula, Montana. As much as 20 inches (51 centimeters) was predicted for higher elevations around Glacier National Park.Meanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture will bring an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast late Sunday into Monday. Heavy rain is expected to start Monday morning, with the moisture shifting toward the Gulf Coast by Tuesday.The intense flooding from heavy rains continued to dissipate in southern Florida, where some areas in and around Miami and Fort Lauderdale were left underwater in recent days as storms dumped up to 20 inches (50 centimeters).That unnamed storm system coincided with the early start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.","Extreme heat spreads across Arizona, New Mexico and parts of Texas, Colorado and Kansas.

He emphasized that a consistent supply of weapons to Ukraine is the only way to end the ongoing conflict The upcoming July summit aims to send a strong, enduring message of support for Ukraine, particularly as President Joe Biden faces a challenging reelection campaign against Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism about Western support for Kyiv.Stoltenberg accused China of exacerbating the conflict by rebuilding Russia's defence industry through significant exports, as reported by US officials. He stated, ""Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences.""The Nato summit will include not only the 32 alliance members but also four key partners from the Asia-Pacific region: Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. Stoltenberg highlighted Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent visit to North Korea, which has provided shells to Moscow despite UN sanctions, as further evidence of Russia's reliance on authoritarian leaders.In an effort to ""Trump-proof"" future endeavors, Stoltenberg aims to position Nato at the forefront of coordination on Ukraine and establish a mechanism for long-term military funding. He emphasized, ""The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realize it cannot wait us out."" Despite the apparent paradox, Stoltenberg believes that providing more weapons to Ukraine is the path to peace.Stoltenberg also plans to inform Biden about the increasing number of Nato members meeting the 2014 goal of allocating two percent of their GDP to defence spending. He acknowledged that successive US administrations have had a valid point in criticizing European allies for spending too little on defence.However, he noted that the situation is changing, and while not entirely satisfied, Nato is in a significantly different position compared to 2014.

The US government has cited Donald Trump as the reason for not releasing Prince Harry's US visa in a new twist to the ongoing case. The Heritage Foundation sued the Department of Homeland Security to get Prince Harry's visa records released. The US government lawyers argued that there was a court ruling about former president Donald Trump's privacy which made Prince Harry also eligible for the same protection.The think tank sought the details of what visa Prince Harry used to enter the US and whether he received any preferential treatment in his visa application. In his memoir Spare, Prince Harry admitted that he previously took drugs. And in US law anyone who has taken drugs can be deemed as 'inadmissible'.The Heritage Foundation sought to know whether Harry lied on his visa application or whether he was given special treatment by the DHS.The government cited the Trump case to stop making any information regarding Harry's visa public knowledge. John Bardo, a lawyer for the department, said, ""They found that President Trump, from when he was a private citizen, his privacy interests outweighed any public interest that there may be in previous interactions he may have had with the FBI. And I would argue, if President Trump has a privacy interest in that kind of interaction with the government, Prince Harry's privacy interest is even greater.""""Because he was never a governmental official in this country, has never appeared on a ballot in this country.""After Harry wrote in his memoir that he had taken cocaine, mushrooms and marijuana, the Heritage Foundation questioned his immigration status.

A group of Democrat Senators led by Jeff Merkley, who is also a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling for a strong diplomatic response, following the ``credible allegations’’ about the involvement of an Indian official in the plot.They asked the US government to match words with action to hold the Indian officials involved accountable, and to send a ``clear message’’ that there will be consequences for such behaviour. ``It is imperative that we take an unequivocal stand against such a threat to the rights of a US citizen and violation of US sovereignty, which are examples of India’s increasingly irresponsible efforts to silence critics of its government among its diaspora around the word,’’ said the senators in their official communication.Gupta, who allegedly hired a hitman to eliminate the Khalistan separatist and US-Canadian national at the instance of an Indian government official, was scheduled to be produced in a Manhattan federal court on Monday. The announcement of his extradition to the US, which has an extradition treaty with the Czech Republic, was made by the Czech justice minister Pavel Blazek. Czech authorities arrested and detained Gupta on June 30, 2023.The minister said he approved the extradition on June 3. Sullivan has been pursuing the case with India, saying on several occasions that the US takes it very seriously and has been pressing India to act against the Indian official who allegedly masterminded the plot. He said last week that the US will continue to raise the issue with India at very high levels.Sullivan was widely expected to raise the same issue in his meetings on Monday, but both sides were tight-lipped about whether he actually did that. This was the first time he met his counterpart Ajit Doval since the US Justice Department announced charges against Gupta.Gupta is charged with murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire. Each count carries a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in prison. According to the indictment, the Indian government employee, working together with others, including Gupta, in India and elsewhere, directed a plot to assassinate Pannun. The issue was raised by President Biden himself in his meeting with PM Modi on the margins of the G20 summit last year in Delhi.Gupta allegedly contacted an individual whom he believed to be a criminal associate, but who was in fact a confidential source working with US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), for assistance in contracting a hitman to murder Pannun.",US NSA Jake Sullivan is in India for a review of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET) The arrival of Sullivan coincided with an announced by the Czech government that Indian national Nikhil Gupta was handed over to the US.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111066970,imgsize-64840,width-400,resizemode-4/111066970.jpg"

The initiative is expected to propel the relationship to the next level by removing regulatory barriers and developing a new defence industrial roadmap for joint development and production.Sullivan also held talks with foreign minister S Jaishankar and called on PM Narendra Modi who said in a post on X India remains committed to strengthening the India-US partnership for global good. Sullivan briefed him about the progress in iCET cooperation in areas like AI, semiconductors, defence and space. In the meeting, Modi expressed satisfaction at the speed and scale of the growing partnership and the convergence on regional and global issues.The NSAs exchanged views also on issues like the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in Gaza. According to a joint factsheet issued after the NSA meeting, Doval and Sullivan in what was their second iCET talks underscored the vital importance of adapting their ``technology protection toolkits’’ and resolved to prevent the leakage of sensitive and dual-use technologies to countries of concern.

They acknowledged progress in the GE-HAL jet deal negotiations, India’s planned acquisition of the MQ-9B armed drones and possible co-production of land warfare systems.In defence, they also focused on deepening cooperation to accelerate the joint adoption of cutting-edge commercial technologies for military solutions and capability enhancement of both defense ecosystems, including through an MoU, and expanding defence industrial partnerships, like through the launch of a jointly developed AI Multi-Domain Situational Awareness product.``Our work also continues to be anchored in a shared commitment to ensuring that technology is designed, developed and deployed in a manner consistent with our democratic values and respect for universal human rights, as well as a recognition that the future security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific will hinge on the strength of the India-US,’’ said the joint factsheet.Doval and Sullivan, who twice postponed his visit earlier this year, also underscored their commitment to striving for breakthrough achievements in priority critical and emerging technology areas, by focusing on co-production, co-development and R&D opportunities. They focused on enhancing coordination with like-minded nations to deliver secure, reliable, and cost-competitive technology solutions for the ``Indian and American people and our partners around the world’’.","US NSA Jake Sullivan and his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval committed ""concrete action"" in coming months against long-standing barriers to strategic trade, technology and industrial cooperation.

The Post Fire, which had consumed nearly 23 square miles (60 square kilometers) and prompted the evacuation of at least 1,200 people from the Hungry Valley recreation area on Saturday, was 8 per cent contained.""That 8 per cent is good because it means we are increasing and bolstering our containment lines,"" said Kenichi Haskett, a Los Angeles County Fire Department section chief. Although firefighters aimed to keep the fire at its current size, Haskett noted that further growth was still possible.The fire started as weather conditions turned hot and windy in an area where grasses, which had grown during a rainy winter, had long since dried out and become highly flammable. By Monday morning, the massive smoke columns that had characterized the fire's initial surge had dissipated.Meanwhile, in Northern California , a wildfire that began on Sunday led to evacuation orders and warnings for a sparsely populated region near Lake Sonoma. The Point Fire, located about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of San Francisco, had burned nearly 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) and destroyed at least one structure. It was 20 per cent contained as of Monday.Ben Nicholls, division chief of the Cal Fire district covering the Point fire area, reported that fire activity had decreased overnight. ""Forecasted winds are supposed to be less than we experienced yesterday, which should allow the resources assigned for this operational period to build and strengthen the control lines that were put in place yesterday,"" Nicholls said in a video briefing.In the south, Pyramid Lake was closed as a precautionary measure on Father's Day due to the Southern California fire, which had started on Saturday afternoon near I-5 in Gorman, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles. Two structures within the evacuated recreation area were burned. Residents of Castaic, a town with a population of about 19,000, were warned to prepare for potential evacuation if the fire continued to move farther south. Haskett advised, ""If you're in a warning area, be prepared with a 'go bag,' with overnight clothes and your cellphone, your medicines, your glasses. Have your car fueled up. Be ready to evacuate.""Approximately 75 miles (120 kilometers) to the east, the Hesperia Fire, which had burned nearly 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) in San Bernardino County, was 30 per cent contained after no overnight growth.

Fear of Trump 2.0: Preparations underway in US to counter potential second Trump presidency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fear-of-trump-2-0-preparations-underway-in-us-to-counter-potential-second-trump-presidency/articleshow/111064362.cms,"NEW DELHI: Adversaries of Donald Trump are preparing potential legal actions in anticipation of his possible reelection in November and the implementation of his promised mass deportations , New York Times reported.The fear that Trump's return to power would not only jeopardize their agenda but also American democracy itself has brought together Democratic officials , progressive activists, watchdog groups, and former Republicans, who are taking measures to prepare for a potential second Trump presidency.Despite the Supreme Court 's recent rejection of an attempt to nullify federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, liberals are concerned that a new Trump administration could rescind the approval or criminalize interstate distribution of the drug, the report said.In response, Washington governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, has secured a sufficient supply of mifepristone pills to ensure access for women in his state throughout a potential second Trump administration. ""We have it physically in the state of Washington, which could stop him and his anti-choice forces from prohibiting its distribution,"" Inslee said. ""It has a life span of five or six years. If there was another Trump administration, it'll get us through.""If Trump returns to power, he plans to implement radical changes, including using the Justice Department to seek revenge on his adversaries, deploying federal troops to Democratic cities, conducting mass deportations, establishing camps for immigrant detainees, facilitating the dismissal of civil servants and replacing them with loyalists, and expanding and centralizing executive power.Many centrist and left-leaning group leaders insist that their primary focus is on preventing Trump from regaining power in the first place. They are also cautious about publicly discussing their contingency plans to avoid signaling a lack of confidence in President Joe Biden's campaign prospects.The Biden administration pushed through numerous regulations in the spring, meeting a deadline to ensure that those rules could not be easily overturned next year if Trump wins the election and Republicans gain complete control of Congress. However, administration officials have generally been reluctant to engage in contingency planning, insisting they are confident Biden will secure a second term.A common tactic used to counter the first Trump administration was litigation that tied up his policies in court. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), one of the primary litigants against the first Trump administration, plans to assume a similar role if he regains the White House. The ACLU has identified 63 scenarios in which a new Trump administration could threaten individual rights and the rule of law, focusing on four areas for which it is drafting potential legal filings.Another hub of liberal resistance plans for a second Trump administration is Democracy Forward, an organization formed after Trump's 2016 victory that filed numerous legal challenges to his policies during his first term. The organization has developed a threat matrix covering issues such as abortion, health care, civil rights, environmental protections, immigration, and the ""weaponization of government.""However, there is a widely held view among Democrats that many types of legal actions may be less effective during a second Trump term than they were during his first, due to a more conservative Supreme Court remade by Trump. This legal reality has led those planning for a Trump return to power to focus on state-level actions that can be locked in before the 2024 election.Democratic governors and state attorneys general have been working together to plan litigation, pass shield laws to protect abortion providers and patients from penalties in other states, and secure stockpiles of abortion pills. The Reproductive Freedom Alliance, founded by California governor Gavin Newsom, serves as a hub for governors to coordinate their strategies and could be the foundation for broader collaboration to resist Trump's agenda.",Adversaries of Donald Trump are preparing potential legal actions in anticipation of his possible reelection in November and the implementation of his promised mass deportations.

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching display of their persistent sorrow and discontent, families affected by enforced disappearances in the Balochistan region of Pakistan decided to abandon customary Eid festivities. Instead, they planned to stage a protest to voice their outrage against state agencies alleged to have perpetrated atrocities against the Baloch people.

Mama Qadir Baloch , a key member of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), declared the protest in a video statement, asserting, ""For the past 15 years, the atrocities committed by the Army and intelligence agencies of Pakistan have led the Baloch to boycott Eid celebrations. While Muslims across the world celebrate this occasion, the Baloch mourn.""

Coinciding with this, families of the missing persons organized a sit-in protest at Shaheed Fida Chowk on Eid day, following a similar demonstration in front of the DC office just days prior. The earlier protest concluded after the district administration provided assurances to the families.

The decision to protest on Eid emphasizes the profound impact of enforced disappearances on the Baloch community, who have been tirelessly seeking justice and answers regarding the fate of their loved ones, allegedly taken by state forces.

Pakistan: Tomato prices soar to PKR 200 per kg ahead of Eid festivities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tomato-prices-soar-to-pkr-200-per-kg-ahead-of-eid-festivities/articleshow/111049153.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha, despite the district government setting the price cap at PKR 100 per kilogram, as per reports.This annual occurrence during Ramadan and Eid al-Adha typically goes unnoticed by authorities, despite their assurances to the contrary.In response to the situation, the Peshawar Deputy Commissioner has taken action by imposing a ban, under Section 144, on transporting tomatoes out of the district.With Eid al-Adha merely two days away, local retail markets have seen tomato prices double, aligning with earlier predictions that tomatoes, along with onions, would once again be sold at inflated prices during this festive period.Residents of the area have expressed frustration, noting that prices have escalated by Rs100 per kilogram in just one day. Many believe that the district administration's efforts will likely be limited to verbal instructions, as has been the case in previous instances, as per reports.During the budget presentation, one of the standout assertions was the government's commitment to maintaining inflation at 12 per cent in the upcoming fiscal year. On the surface, this goal appears supported by various planned initiatives aimed at curbing inflation rates.However, the implementation of aggressive tax measures, highlighted as key revenue strategies, seems paradoxical as they could potentially escalate prices instead of stabilising them.Regardless of the method used to gauge inflation, the stark reality is that any figure exceeding the previous fiscal year's average monthly inflation rate of 24.9 per cent will inevitably lead to increased consumer prices.Abid Suleri, Executive Director of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), argues that the government ought to have adjusted the minimum taxable income thresholds to factor in inflation when outlining personal income tax brackets. He criticises the current monthly exemption of PKR 50,000 as insufficient and warns that doubling taxes on those falling within the initial tax slab could reduce their disposable income, thereby exacerbating economic hardships.Moreover, heightened fuel expenses stemming from amplified levies and augmented GST rates in specific sectors are anticipated to drive inflation even higher, intensifying the overall cost of living. Suleri emphasises the absence of any mention regarding the taxation of agricultural income, which he believes could substantially broaden the tax base, Dawn reported.","The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha.

Legal age for marriage in Pakistan

The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72-year-old man named Habib Khan was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town. While the police managed to arrest the groom and the 'Nikah Khwan' (a person who solemnizes the marriage), the girl's father managed to escape.A case has been registered against the girl's father, the 72-year-old man, and the 'Nikkah Khwan' under the Child Marriage Act , according to ARY News. Despite the existence of laws prohibiting child marriage, such incidents continue to occur in various parts of Pakistan.The girl's father, Alam Syed, had reportedly agreed to sell his daughter to the elderly man for PKR 500,000.In recent times, law enforcement agencies have thwarted similar attempts in Rajanpur and Thatta, where young girls were being coerced into marrying older men. In Rajanpur, Punjab, an 11-year-old girl was set to marry a 40-year-old man, while in Thatta, a young girl was forcibly married to a 50-year-old landlord before the police took action and rescued the girl.In another incident on May 6, a 70-year-old man was arrested by the police for marrying a 13-year-old girl in Swat. The girl's father had arranged the marriage, but the police swiftly took the groom and the father into custody. The 'Nikkah Khwan' and the marriage witnesses were also arrested, and the minor girl was sent to a hospital for a medical examination.In Pakistan, the legal age for marriage differs based on gender. While the internationally recognized minimum age for both males and females is 18, the country's laws allow males to marry at 18 but permit females to wed at the younger age of 16.Although Sindh province took a step towards gender equality in 2013 by passing legislation to raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 for both genders, this progressive change has not been adopted and implemented throughout the nation. The disparity in legal marriage age between men and women persists in other parts of the nation.","The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72- year-old man was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town.

Clash between Pakistan judiciary & military establishment intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/clash-between-pakistan-judiciary-military-establishment-intensifies/articleshow/111007675.cms,"Islamabad: The clash between Pakistan’s superior judiciary and the powerful military establishment has intensified as judges have started questioning the conduct of serving army and Inter-Services Intelligence officers over their blatant interference in judicial matters.Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics such as secret surveillance, and even abduction and torture of their family members, to secure favourable outcomes in political cases related to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party and its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.Addressing an event in the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Friday, Lahore high court chief justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad claimed he has received complaints — many verbally — and letters regarding interference in judicial matters by “institutions” (a reference to the army and ISI).“But I have full faith that this interference of the (military) establishment in the judiciary will come to its end very soon,” he asserted.He said he was saying so not just because it was “part of my faith but also includes my experience”.“To get rid of the (military) establishment’s interference, we have to face it with bravery, courage, and without any fear, and with the belief that this interference, God-willing, will end soon,” the Lahore CJ said. “Temporary worries do come but you have to face them eye to eye and not be a target of any of their blackmailing. Do not be hesitant to make any kind of sacrifice,” he added.Justice Ahmad said Pakistan was currently “going through one of the longest periods of a civil government”, adding that the 2007 lawyers’ movement “closed the doors for martial law forever”.On Wednesday, the Lahore HC had summoned Punjab police chief Usman Anwar and other officials on a complaint from a presiding judge of an anti-terrorism court alleging harassment by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.On June 7, the HC registrar’s office had received a special report on district and sessions judge Muhammad Abbas wherein he had said that on May 25, the first day of his new charge, a message was conveyed to him that some ISI authority wanted to meet him in his chamber.Upon refusing to meet the said authority, Abbas alleged that ever since then he had been encountering various incidents, such as firing outside his court in Punjab’s Sargodha city and questioning of family members, among other things.Earlier, in March, six of the eight Islamabad HC judges had penned a startling letter to Supreme Court judges, regarding attempts by the ISI to pressure them through the abduction and torture of their relatives as well as secret surveillance inside their homes. Following the letter, judges from other HCs also acknowledged interference by spy agencies in judicial functions.It led the apex court to take suo motu notice of the matter, with high courts submitting their responses and recommendations as proceedings continued.","Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics.
