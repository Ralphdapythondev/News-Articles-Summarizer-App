'Indecent': Macron's awkward embrace with sports minister at Paris Olympics raises eyebrows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/indecent-macrons-awkward-embrace-with-sports-minister-at-paris-olympics-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/112152686.cms,"The internet is abuzz with discussions about photographs capturing a touchy-feely moment between French President Emmanuel Macron and his sports minister, Amélie Oudéa-Castéra , during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics . The images show the 46-year-old Macron firmly gripping the arm of Oudéa-Castéra, also 46 and a former professional tennis player, who serves as the country's minister of sports.In the photograph, Oudéa-Castéra reacts to the affectionate gesture by holding Macron's bicep with one hand while the other is draped around his neck while kissing.Adding to the awkwardness of the situation is the positioning of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who seems to be deliberately looking away.""Gabriel Attal, he pretends to look elsewhere! He doesn't know where to stand!"" one user commented.Another said, ""It's my lover that I'm kissing like this. Embarrassing.""A disapproving individual expressed, ""I find this photo indecent, it's not worthy of a president and a minister.""The intriguing photograph was brought to the public's attention by French magazine Madame Figaro, which described the kiss as ""strange"" and suggested that Oudéa-Castéra, also known as AOC in France, has a tendency to draw attention to herself.As the first Olympics in France in a century came to life, Oudéa-Castéra has been at the forefront of the event.Oudéa-Castéra recently swam in the Seine River to address concerns about elevated E coli levels in the iconic waterway, which is set to host several events during the upcoming games. However, a pre-race triathlon event scheduled for Sunday was called off due to water quality issues.In January, Macron appointed Oudéa-Castéra as France's education minister, but she was removed from the position in less than a month. This decision followed disclosures that she had enrolled her children in prestigious private schools and made critical comments about the public schools in her area.While some users on X expressed disapproval of the celebratory hug, not everyone shared the same sentiment. ""A slightly warm congratulation to celebrate the moment,"" wrote one user in defence of the gesture.","French President Emmanuel Macron and sports minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra were photographed kissing during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Hundreds of China merchants join protest against Temu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/hundreds-of-china-merchants-join-protest-against-temu/articleshow/112152420.cms,"What Bloomberg intelligence says

Lingering tensions between PDD’s Temu and merchants using the platform — which have prompted protests in China, according to media reports — may force Temu to offer sellers subsidies to avoid defections to other overseas platforms such as Amazon.com, Alibaba’s AliExpress, Shein and TikTok Shop, where our checks show more flexible business practices. Appeasing merchants would drive up costs and spur steeper-than-expected margin declines for PDD into 2025.

- Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, analysts

Hundreds of merchants staged a rally at PDD Holdings Inc ’s offices in southern China this week, protesting what they called unfair penalties that Temu ’s owner is increasingly levying.The suppliers, mainly smaller outfits that sell Chinese goods to Western shoppers via the fast-growing Temu platform, brandished placards and yelled slogans outside a Guangzhou company outpost Monday, according to attendees and videos circulated on social media.Some managed to get into Temu offices though they eventually dispersed without meeting senior executives, according to several witnesses, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution.The protest was the culmination of growing frustration among merchants and third-party sellers, who feel PDD is increasingly squeezing them for revenue as it embarks on a costly global expansion. Their complaints center on PDD’s practice of withholding payments to merchants who’re judged to have fallen short on customer expectations, the people said. That includes anything from missing delivery deadlines to mis-matched product listings.Those penalties or fines have risen sharply in recent months, often without clear explanation, they said. PDD or Temu typically either withhold payment for products already sold, or levy a fine of several times the retail prices, the people added. PDD’s shares slid 3.5% in New York, their biggest single-day fall since June.The dispute coincides with an aggressive expansion that’s taken the Temu brand around the world. PDD and its Temu platform exploded on the scene in 2023 with an expensive Super-Bowl ad. It’s since begun to challenge fellow Chinese online shopping giant Shein, and even Amazon .com Inc in certain segments. It launched in Thailand just this month.That breakneck global expansion at one point helped US-listed PDD — which stands for Pinduoduo — become China’s most valuablee-commerce company, outstripping longtime leaders Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com Inc.This week’s protest cap at least two rallies since May, according to the people, some of which have been described by local media including Yicai. A Temu representative acknowledged that it’s locked in a dispute with roughly a dozen sellers about “after-sales issues” related to the quality and compliance of their products. The disagreement involved several million yuan, the representative said.The spokesperson said several of those merchants recently gathered outside the site of a Temu logistics affiliate, but did not provide further details on Monday’s action.“These merchants have declined to resolve the disputes through the normal arbitration and legal channels stated in the seller agreements,” the company said in a statement. “The situation is stable, and the company is actively working with the merchants to find a solution.”Temu is driving abroad in part because domestic Chinese consumption is flagging, struggling to recover from years of Covid-era malaise. But many others, including Shein, ByteDance Ltd’s TikTok Shop and Alibaba’s own AliExpress have the same idea. That’s threatening to squeeze margins and drive up costs.Beijing on various occasions has openly expressed support for what they call cross-border e-commerce, or the sale of Chinese goods abroad — the driving force behind Shein’s and Temu’s meteoric ascent in the US. But this year, reports began circulating about growing dissatisfaction among Temu’s merchants in China, who supply the bulk of the cheap, fast-moving goods that consumers abroad are hoovering up.Some analysts say loss-making Temu won’t be able to sustain its mix of low prices and quick delivery for long — the key is whether it can get shoppers to return. Others say the company could become a major global player in coming years.It’s unclear whether PDD is making moves to assuage merchants. For Temu, the danger is that suppliers and sellers may migrate to other platforms, disrupting the flow of goods vital for supporting the fledgling platform’s growth.PDD more than doubled revenue in the March quarter. It has expanded to more than 60 countries but that growing profile has raised the risk of regulatory scrutiny in key markets like the US, which barred ByteDance’s ownership of TikTok over data security concerns.European consumer groups filed a complaint this year with the European Commission that accused Temu of failing to protect consumers and employing manipulative practices.",PDD’s Temu and merchants using the platform may force Temu to offer sellers subsidies to avoid defections to other overseas platforms. Appeasing merchants would drive up costs and spur steeper-than-expected margin declines for PDD into 2025.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112152480,imgsize-347158,width-400,resizemode-4/112152480.jpg"
Viral photo: Why this Brazilian Olympic surfer Gabriel Medina's pose has captured the world's attention,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/viral-photo-why-this-brazilian-olympic-surfer-gabriel-medinas-pose-has-captured-the-worlds-attention/articleshow/112152181.cms,"Brazilian Olympic surfer Gabriel Medina's remarkable wave ride in Tahiti , captured by AFP photographer Jerome Brouillet , has garnered global acclaim with the photograph becoming a viral sensation and possibly the defining image of both the sport and the 2024 Paris Summer Games.Brouillet, stationed in a boat in the channel, managed to photograph Medina exiting the wave after earning a record Olympic score, highlighting the surfer's triumphant moment.The photograph captured Medina soaring ashore, pointing a finger to the sky with his surfboard at his side, embodying a moment of sheer triumph.Brouillet had positioned himself strategically in the channel, which allowed him to wait for Medina as he 'kicked out,' or exited, the wave face at the end of his run. This spot, although without a direct view of the initial action, was ideal for capturing the climax of the ride. Brouillet recounted his anticipation:""Every photographer is waiting for that. You know Gabriel Medina, especially at Teahupo'o, will kick off and do something. You know something is going to happen. The only tricky moment is where he is going to kick out? Because I'm blind! Sometimes he makes an acrobatic gesture and this time he did that and so I pushed the button.""""I think that when he was in the tube he knew that he was in one of the biggest waves of the day. He is jumping out of the water like 'man, I think this is a 10'.""Despite the brilliant shot, Brouillet remained cautious. ""When I'm shooting at Teahupo'o I don't shoot in such a high burst mode, because at the end of the day, if you push too hard on the button you come back with 5,000 shots in a day, and I don't like that! I got four shots of him out of the water and one of the four shots was this photo.""The image quickly gained widespread attention, being used by numerous publications globally and shared millions of times online. Australian media conglomerate .au hailed it as 'the greatest sports photo of all time,' while TIME magazine called it 'the defining image of triumph of the 2024 Summer Games .'Medina himself shared the photo on his Instagram account, where it rapidly garnered over 2.4 million likes. Despite the overwhelming response and accolades, Brouillet remained focused on his work. ""I'm sleeping at a friend's house near Teahupo'o and we'll have a quiet one because if tomorrow the event is on, I have to wake up at five in the morning!""Another photo that has gone viral from Paris Olympics 2024 is that of tennis sensations Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, the veteran and future of Spain, both playing for the same side.","Brazilian Olympic surfer Gabriel Medina's remarkable wave ride in Tahiti has garnered global acclaim with the photograph becoming a viral sensation.

Kamala Harris to hold first rally with VP pick in crucial Philadelphia: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-to-hold-first-rally-with-vp-pick-in-crucial-philadelphia-say-sources/articleshow/112152361.cms,"US Vice President Kamala Harris is set to hold her inaugural rally with her newly selected vice presidential nominee in Philadelphia on Tuesday, according to sources. The choice of location implies that Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro has emerged as a top contender on the shortlist of potential running mates.The Harris campaign seems to have concluded that the state, which Democrats reclaimed from Republicans in 2020, is crucial for securing victory once more, according to a report from Reuters.However, a campaign aide cautioned against overinterpreting the significance of the first city chosen for the weeklong battleground state tour, which is expected to span four days and multiple states. The decision on Harris's running mate has taken centre stage since she became the Democratic frontrunner for the November 5 election , following US President Joe Biden 's withdrawal from the race just over a week ago.The shortlist of candidates under consideration includes governor Shapiro, Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, Arizona senator Mark Kelly, Minnesota governor Tim Walz, and secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg.If Shapiro is selected, the Harris campaign is likely banking on the popular 51-year-old governor's ability to help secure the state in November. Shapiro's popularity among Democrats surged after he decisively defeated his Republican opponent, Doug Mastriano, garnering 56 per cent of the vote in a state known for close elections.Additionally, Shapiro would become the second Jewish nominee for vice president on a major ticket in US history, following Joe Lieberman's unsuccessful bid with Al Gore in 2000.Traditionally, campaigns begin considering their vice-presidential pick after the primary race concludes in the spring, allowing ample time for candidate vetting and ensuring personal and political compatibility. However, Harris faces a compressed timeline, with the Democratic National Committee setting an August 7 deadline.Eric Holder Jr, who oversaw Barack Obama's vice-presidential vetting process in 2008, is currently vetting Harris's potential picks through his law firm, Covington & Burling.The candidates are informally showcasing their potential contributions to the Harris ticket through media appearances and campaign stops. Governor Shapiro delivered a compelling testimonial about Harris in the Philadelphia suburbs on Monday, declaring, ""She's not only ready, she's damned ready. And you know who else knows she's ready? Donald Trump knows she's ready.""Meanwhile, Minnesota Governor Walz is credited with advancing the Democrats' new criticism of Trump and his running mate J D Vance, characterising them as ""weird."" Walz said on Saturday, ""The fascists depend on us going back, but we're not afraid of weird people. We're a little bit creeped out, but we're not afraid.""",US Vice President Kamala Harris is set to hold her inaugural rally with her newly selected vice presidential nominee in Philadelphia on Tuesday.

"Kamala Harris unveils $50m 'Fearless' ad campaign, targeting Trump",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-unveils-50m-fearless-ad-campaign-targeting-trump/articleshow/112152042.cms,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Tuesday, launched a $50 million advertising campaign, with a one-minute spot titled ""fearless"", in a bid to capitalize on the growing momentum against the Republican candidate, Donald Trump .This marks Harris' first significant ad purchase since consolidating support for the Democratic nomination following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race on July 21 and his subsequent endorsement of her candidacy.The inaugural ad of the campaign features images of Harris as a young girl and traces her journey as a prosecutor, attorney general, and US vice president, emphasizing that ""The one thing Kamala Harris has always been: fearless.""The advertising campaign will be deployed across television, streaming, and social media channels in crucial battleground states in the weeks leading up to the Democratic National Convention, set to commence on August 19.Harris has ignited newfound energy among key demographics, such as young voters, a group that Biden had struggled to win over which reflects in the recent public opinion polls.The polls indicate that the US vice president is narrowing the gap with her 78-year-old rival who still maintains a lead in some national surveys.Since being declared as the candidate, Harris has turned her focus on Trump's felony convictions in a hush-money trial involving a porn star and the additional criminal charges he faces. She has also portrayed him as responsible for a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-led states nationwide.The scale of the Harris campaign's ad buy overshadows the $10 million advertising campaign announced by Trump's team on Monday, which is set to be launched in six battleground states this week as part of an effort to counter the surge of voter enthusiasm and donations for Harris. This marks Trump's most significant ad purchase since January.","Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Tuesday, launched a $50 million advertising campaign, with a one-minute spot titled ""fearless"" This marks Harris' first significant ad purchase since consolidating support for the Democratic nomination following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112152087,imgsize-69758,width-400,resizemode-4/112152087.jpg"
Kamala Harris's 'weird' campaign strategy: How Democrats are trying to make Trump laughingstock,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harriss-weird-campaign-strategy-how-democrats-are-trying-to-make-trump-laughingstock/articleshow/112151865.cms,"As the 2024 presidential election heats up, the word "" weird "" is becoming the Democrats ' not-so-secret weapon against former President Donald Trump . The term, used repeatedly by Vice President Kamala Harris and her team, is intended to paint Trump as not just a flawed candidate but an outright oddball, a stark contrast to the formal and sometimes grandiose rhetoric of President Joe Biden.In a recent campaign statement, Harris captured the essence of this strategy, referring to Trump as “old and quite weird.” This isn’t just idle chatter; it’s part of a calculated effort to reshape Trump’s public image from a political powerhouse to an unpleasant, laughable figure.“Just plain weird,” Harris herself declared at a recent event, making it clear that her campaign aims to turn the former president into a national punchline.Trump’s response to this tactic has been predictable. Known for his ability to mock opponents with biting humor, Trump has shown visible irritation at being the subject of ridicule. “I hate when people laugh at me,” he lamented at a rally earlier this month. His discomfort with being the butt of jokes seems to play right into Harris’s hands.The Harris campaign has embraced this approach with gusto. Their recent press releases are a masterclass in modern political mockery. Descriptions of Trump include phrases like “bitter, unhinged” and “generally sounded like someone you wouldn’t want to sit near at a restaurant—let alone be president.” The idea is to minimize Trump’s stature and present him as an increasingly erratic figure.The campaign’s jabs extend beyond Trump himself to his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance. Vance’s past remarks about “childless cat ladies,” which belittled women like Harris who haven’t had children, have earned him the label of “super weird” from Democratic senators. Adding fuel to the fire, a viral fake news story about Vance and a sofa, while entirely fabricated, has been used to fuel a deluge of memes and jokes that have further cemented his status as an oddity in the public’s eye.Hillary Clinton, ever the sharp critic, summed up the strategy succinctly: “If Republican leaders don’t enjoy being called weird, creepy, and controlling, they could try not being weird, creepy, and controlling.” Her words echo the new tone of Harris’s campaign, which is less about policy and more about poking fun at Trump and his allies.This approach has caught the Trump campaign off guard. After President Biden’s unexpected withdrawal from the race and Harris’s rapid rise, the Trump team has found itself scrambling. The former president, who has traditionally thrived on verbal sparring, now faces a different kind of battle.In response, Trump and his allies have attempted to turn the tables. Trump has labeled Harris with a series of insults including “dumb,” “nuts,” and “a bum.” His son, Donald Trump Jr., has been leading the charge to flip the “weird” narrative back at the Democrats. On social media, he’s used crude language to attack Harris’s support for gender reassignment surgery for prison inmates, suggesting that her priorities are out of touch.Trump himself has even taken to mocking Harris’s laughter, trying to brand her with a new nickname: “laughing Kamala.” He’s suggested that her laugh reveals something sinister, aiming to discredit her through her mannerisms.As the campaign trail heats up, it’s clear that the battle will be as much about perceptions and humor as it is about policies. Whether the “weird” strategy will stick or if Trump’s counterattacks will shift the narrative remains to be seen. One thing is certain: the 2024 election is shaping up to be one of the most unconventional in recent history.","Vice President Kamala Harris and her team are using the term ""weird"" to attack former President Donald Trump.

The event had over 190,000 participants, including notable figures such as 'Star Wars' actor Mark Hamill and singer Josh Groban.The 'White Dudes for Harris' event lasted over three hours and focused on the importance of white men supporting Harris in the upcoming November 5 presidential election against Republican Donald Trump.Harris is currently serving as vice president.The event was organised by Ross Morales Rocketto, founder of 'Run for Something,' who cited that over 60% of US white men voted for Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.Mitch Landrieu, a Harris campaign co-chair, said ""If white guys would just show up, if we would stand up and be counted, if we would talk about what it really means to be a great partner, and a man, which is to protect, and to help, and to lift up, and to not push down, all of us are going to be better for it,"" Landrieu said during the call.The video call is part of a series of similar events hosted for Harris, which have consistently attracted large audiences and have been successful in raising significant funds since the evening President Joe Biden endorsed Harris.The event featured other high-profile guests like Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and actor Jeff Bridges. Bridges noted his connection to the event through his role as 'The Dude' in the film 'The Big Lebowski.' Other notable attendees included North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.Actor Bradley Whitford, who starred in 'Get Out' and 'The West Wing,' commented on the diversity within the group of white men supporting Harris.""What a variety of whiteness we have here,"" said Whitford. ""We got The Dude. We got Pete (Buttigieg). It's like a rainbow of, uh, beige.""Speakers during the call highlighted the mutual benefits for white men in supporting the rights of others, particularly reproductive rights for women. This has been a key issue in Harris's and the Democratic Party's campaign.LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and filmmaker J.J. Abrams each pledged to match $50,000 in donations accrued during the call. The event generated over 60,000 individual contributions, according to Morales Rocketto.""Smash that donate button,"" 'Frozen' actor Josh Gad urged attendees.Previous video calls supporting Harris have also drawn considerable attention and funds. A call for Black women supporters had over 40,000 participants, another for Black men attracted more than 50,000. Separate calls for South Asian women and LGBTQ allies, as well as a call for white women which raised over $11 million and had more than 200,000 participants, were part of the campaign's strategy.","The 'White Dudes for Harris' event lasted over three hours and focused on the importance of white men supporting Kamala Harris.

North Korea seek medicines from abroad for Kim Jong Un's health problems: Seoul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-seeks-medicines-for-kim-jong-uns-health-problems-seoul/articleshow/112117812.cms,"North Korean officials are seeking new medicines from abroad to treat their leader of North Korea Kim Jong Un who has reportedly regained weight and is now facing health issues related to obesity . Kim jong is reportedly suffering with conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, according to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS).At 40 years old, Kim has a family history of heart problems, with both his father and grandfather dying from heart-related issues. Known for his heavy drinking and smoking habits, Kim is approximately 170 centimeters (5 feet, 8 inches) tall and previously weighed 140 kilograms (308 pounds). Despite appearing to have lost a significant amount of weight in 2021, possibly due to dietary changes, recent state media footage suggests he has regained the lost weight, reported AP.Lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun stated that the NIS estimates Kim's current weight to be around 140 kilograms (308 pounds), placing him in a high-risk group for heart disease. ""Kim has shown symptoms of high blood pressure and diabetes since his early 30s,"" Lee said. Lawmaker Park Sunwon added that the NIS believes Kim's obesity is linked to his drinking, smoking, and stress.The NIS also informed lawmakers that North Korean officials have been attempting to procure new medicines from abroad to address Kim's suspected high blood pressure and diabetes.Kim's health is a topic of significant interest beyond North Korea's borders, as he has not formally named a successor, raising concerns about who would take charge of the country's growing nuclear arsenal in the event of his incapacitation.During Monday's briefing, the NIS reiterated its assessment that Kim's preteen daughter, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae, appears to be bolstering her status as her father's heir apparent. However, the NIS noted that it cannot entirely rule out the possibility that one of her siblings could replace her as the successor, given that she has not been officially designated as her father's successor.Speculation about Kim Ju Ae, who is about 10 years old, began to spread when she started accompanying her father to high-profile public events in late 2022. State media have referred to her as Kim Jong Un's ""most beloved"" or ""respected"" child and have released numerous photos and footage showcasing her increasing political prominence and her close relationship with her father. The NIS reported to lawmakers that at least 60% of Kim Ju Ae's public appearances have involved being present at military events with her father.","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly regained weight and is now facing health issues related to obesity.

Mukbang: 24-year-old Chinese influencer Pan Xiaoting dies during livestream Mukbang session,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/24-year-old-chinese-influencer-pan-xiaoting-dies-during-livestream-mukbang-session/articleshow/111952016.cms,"Tragedy struck the Chinese social media scene as 24-year-old influencer Pan Xiaoting died during a livestream Mukbang session on July 14.Mukbang, a popular trend originating from South Korea, involves hosts consuming large quantities of food in front of a live audience. Pan, who had gained a substantial following, succumbed to the extreme demands of this trend.Initially working as a waitress, Pan Xiaoting started livestreaming as a side hustle to supplement her income.Her popularity soared, prompting her to leave her job and focus on streaming full-time. This career shift brought her significant income and numerous gifts from her fans.Despite her family's concerns about the impact of her profession on her health, Pan continued to push herself to extreme limits. She rented a separate studio for her streaming sessions to ensure a more professional setup. However, her dedication came at a high cost. She often consumed up to 10 kg of food in a single session and spent up to 10 hours a day eating. These extreme eating habits led to multiple hospitalisations, including one due to gastric bleeding.At the time of her death, Pan weighed 300 kg.

The Olympic Games have stood for harmony, superiority, and the unwavering quest of greatness by the human spirit for a very long time. As the 2024 Summer Olympics get underway in Paris, the city of lights gets ready to host this historic event for the third time in its illustrious history. It looks as though the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris will be a wonderful festival of culture, athletics, and global friendship.Modern facilities and iconic sites will provide breathtaking settings for athletes from more than 200 countries to participate in a variety of sports, exhibiting their incredible talent, tenacity, and dedication.But, according to the reports, there have been some countries that have been exempted from the Olympics since the past due to its issues between the countries. Let’s have a look at the countries that have been banned from competing in the Olympics for a variety of reasons.Five nations were left out of the invitation list for the 1920 Games in Antwerp, Belgium, following World War I: Austria, Hungary, Germany, Turkey, and Bulgaria. In the same way, the Axis nations of World War II—Japan and Germany—were not invited to the 1948 London Olympics.An Olympic rival first appeared in the 1960s. Indonesia organised the Games of the New Emerging Forces. Athletes who competed in those events were banned by the IOC.Due to the Apartheid system, South Africa was barred from competing in the Tokyo Games in 1964. Nearly 30 years passed during the ban.Rhodesia was prohibited from competing in the Olympics due to its formation as a government exclusively for White people. The IOC banned them from the Munich Games in 1972 as a result of their racist policies. Before they could compete once more, the nation was later abolished and recreated as Zimbabwe.Afghanistan was not allowed to participate in the Sydney Games in 2000 because of its Taliban-era discrimination against women and ban on all forms of sports.Because of government intervention, the Kuwaiti Olympic Committee has been suspended since October 2015. In 2010, they were also suspended; however, the suspension was revoked prior to the 2012 Olympic Games. Nine Kuwaiti athletes participated in the competition after that under the Olympic flag.Due to drug infractions, the IOC disqualified numerous Russian competitors from the 2016 Rio Olympics. This restriction was expanded to include the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where Russian competitors would have to compete flying the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) flag instead of the Russian flag.Due to their role in the conflict in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus are not allowed to compete in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. Russia broke the Olympic Truce in 2022 when it invaded Ukraine, a UN-backed resolution meant to foster peace during the Olympics.","The 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris will be a wonderful festival of culture, athletics, and global friendship.

"Watch: People without kids 'most deranged', 'psychotic', says JD Vance; Kamala Harris campaign shares video",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vances-another-controversial-remark-on-childless-people-resurface-in-unearthed-video/articleshow/112152577.cms,"The Ohio Senator JD Vance, who has recently been thrust into the national spotlight as Donald Trump’s 2024 running mate, is once again under scrutiny for remarks made in a 2020 podcast where he labeled childless American adults as “more sociopathic .”The resurfaced podcast clip has reignited a firestorm of criticism, particularly from influential Hollywood figures and progressive commentators.In the podcast, Vance argued that adults without children, especially those in leadership positions, exhibit a higher degree of sociopathy. “You know, I worry that it makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less mentally stable,” Vance said. “And of course, you talk about going on Twitter – final point I’ll make is you go on Twitter and almost always the people who are most deranged and most psychotic are people who don’t have kids at home.”The controversy does not stop with the podcast. In 2021, Vance’s rhetoric found its way into fundraising emails, where he continued to target childless individuals. “We’ve allowed ourselves to be dominated by childless sociopaths – they’re invested in NOTHING because they’re not invested in this country’s children,” Vance wrote in one email. Another message described childless Democrats as “miserable in their own lives and want to make the rest of the country miserable too.”The resurfacing of these comments has fueled intense criticism and raised questions about Vance’s suitability as a vice presidential candidate. Critics argue that such divisive language and disdain for individuals without children could alienate voters and undermine the Republican ticket’s appeal.Vance has defended his remarks, claiming they were meant to critique specific left-leaning policies rather than attack individuals personally. “He was talking about politicians on the left who support policies that are explicitly anti-child and anti-family,” a spokesperson for Vance said. “The media can obsess over it all they want, but he’s not going to back down when it comes to advocating for policies that protect parental rights and encourage people to have more kids.”Despite his defense, the timing of these comments is politically sensitive. Vance’s vice presidential nomination under Trump, a figure also known for his polarizing rhetoric, has amplified the scrutiny on his past statements. The Trump campaign, already facing its own controversies, now has to navigate the fallout from Vance’s inflammatory remarks.The reaction from the public and media has been swift and sharp. Prominent voices on social media and in the press have criticized Vance’s characterization of childless individuals, with many arguing that such views reflect an outdated and narrow-minded perspective.As the 2024 election race intensifies, Vance’s remarks add another layer of complexity to the already contentious political landscape. Whether the controversy will have lasting implications for his candidacy and the Republican ticket remains to be seen, but it is clear that Vance’s comments have sparked a significant and ongoing debate.","Ohio Senator JD Vance is being considered as Donald Trump’s 2024 running mate.

What does the Democratic nominee have to do with it?

Where is it going?

Veep Kamala Harris ' sudden candidacy for US president has sparked off a meme fest like no other. Confused about all the green-tinted videos proclaiming, ""Kamala is BRAT""?Last year was Barbiecore, but this one is BRAT summer .Singer Charli XCX recently released her new album, BRAT which has become a critical and commercial success. Young people are channelling their 'inner brat' by using the album's chartreuse (that's French for lime green) aesthetic in different ways.Social media is filled with people sipping green drinks and dyeing their hair that fiery green. The singer says ""brat"" is to be ""that girl who is a little messy and likes to party ... Who feels herself but maybe also has a breakdown ... is very honest, very blunt, a little bit volatile"".Within hours of US President Joe Biden bowing out of the race, a Harris meme with the BRAT theme started doing the rounds. But it was not till Charli XCX posted ""Kamala IS brat"" that all hell broke loose. Harris's official X account, @kamalahq, then changed its banner to the avocado green colour of the album. The campaign accounts has since amassed millions of views across Instagram, TikTok and X this week by engaging with a mix of memes, video clips and jokes in which she is the star including an awkwardly dancing Harris from an old video overlaid on an image out of the ""Brat summer"" viral aesthetic, with a liberal dose of coconut trees or stepping out of Air Force One in different-coloured suits, and screenshots of news articles against the sound, popularised on TikTok, of a cash register bell and someone saying ""I can't stop winning.""Some have already made brat x Kamala Harris merch with t-shirts that include slogans such as ""the election and it's the same but kamala is running so it's not"", ""i'm so kamala,"" and ""brats 4 kamala"" The strategy is risky, experts said.

Did JD Vance spark another controversy? Senator's book endorsement raises eyebrows in Trump campaign's transition plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-jd-vance-spark-another-controversy-senators-book-endorsement-raises-eyebrows-in-trump-campaigns-transition-plans/articleshow/112151866.cms,"Ohio Senator JD Vance , Donald Trump's running mate, has praised Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts in the foreword of Roberts' forthcoming book, “Dawn’s Early Light.” This endorsement could complicate the Trump campaign 's efforts to distance itself from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 transition initiative.The Associated Press obtained a copy of the foreword on Tuesday, the same day a significant shakeup occurred within Project 2025, which has become a contentious election-year issue.Critics, including Democrats, argue that the nearly 1,000-page vision outlined by Project 2025 is extreme.“Never before has a figure with Roberts’s depth and stature within the American Right tried to articulate a genuinely new future for conservatism,” Vance writes in his foreword. “The Heritage Foundation isn’t some random outpost on Capitol Hill; it is and has been the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.”Vance’s endorsement highlights the alignment between Trump’s allies and those driving Project 2025. Despite this, Trump’s top aides have criticized the organizers of Project 2025 for creating a false impression of association with the campaign. Following Tuesday’s shakeup, Roberts has taken direct control of Project 2025 operations.Set for publication on September 24, the book outlines a vision for what the publisher describes as a peaceful ""Second American Revolution.” The subtitle is “Taking Back Washington to Save America,” though earlier versions had listed it as “Burning Down Washington to Save America.”The publisher’s description of the book includes a call to build or reclaim certain institutions, suggesting that some are “too corrupt to save.” Among those listed are Ivy League colleges, the FBI, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.The AP reached out to spokespeople for Vance and the Trump campaign for comments.On Tuesday, Paul Dans, who had directed Project 2025, left the Heritage Foundation amid ongoing criticism of the plan. Roberts stated that Dans’ departure came after the project accomplished its initial goals.In his foreword, Vance advocates for a proactive approach to conservatism, beyond just dismantling past policies. “We need an offensive conservatism, not merely one that tries to prevent the left from doing things we don’t like,” he writes.Vance concludes by quoting Roberts: “When twilight descends and a person hears wolves, you’ve got to circle the wagons and load the muskets.” Vance adds, “We are now all realizing that it’s time to circle the wagons and load the muskets. In the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon.”DNC spokesman Alex Floyd responded, saying Vance's language “echoes the same dangerous rhetoric we’ve heard from him and Donald Trump for years.""Vance’s foreword also touches on personal themes, including his and Roberts’ challenging upbringings, influential grandparents, and shared Catholic faith. He discusses the importance of parenthood, recently a contentious topic for him following resurfaced comments where he criticized “childless cat ladies” in Democratic leadership.In the book, Vance praises the idea of encouraging marriage and parenthood, reflecting the old American Right’s belief that cultural norms and attitudes are significant.The book’s publication and the ongoing debates around Project 2025 promise to keep these issues at the forefront of political discourse as the election approaches.","Ohio Senator JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, has praised Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts in the foreword of Roberts' forthcoming book.

Kamala Harris dares Trump: 'Say it to my face' as she challenges him to debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/say-it-to-my-face-kamala-harris-taunts-donald-trump-at-atlanta-rally-energizes-supporters-ahead-of-2024-us-election/articleshow/112151732.cms,"US Vice President Kamala Harris electrified a packed arena in Atlanta on Tuesday, rallying thousands of enthusiastic supporters and emphasizing that the next 98 days would be a fight worth winning. As she taunted Donald Trump for his indecision about participating in their upcoming debate , Harris declared, “The momentum in this race is shifting. And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.”Just over a week ago, Georgia seemed to be slipping from the Democrats' grasp, with President Joe Biden's campaign focusing on securing the Midwestern ""blue wall"" states, potentially at the expense of the ""Sun Belt"" battlegrounds.However, Biden's abrupt exit from the race and Harris emerging as the likely nominee has rejuvenated Democratic hopes of broadening the electoral map.In a state that handed Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris mirrored a classic Trump-style event: a raucous rally filled with supporters, who cheered her on as she criticized Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, labeling their policies as outdated and dangerous. “I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed and I will sign it and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like,” Harris proclaimed, referencing Trump’s opposition to a bipartisan immigration bill.Trump, who had initially agreed to debate Harris, is now wavering, saying he “probably” will debate but can “also make a case for not doing it.” Harris seized on his indecision, challenging him directly, “Meet me on the debate stage ... because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.” Trump has called for the debate, scheduled for September 10 on ABC News, to be moved to a different network, dismissing ABC as “fake news.”The 8,000-capacity arena at Georgia State University was filled to the rafters with supporters waving signs, dancing to campaign music, and enjoying a performance by Megan Thee Stallion. This vibrant scene contrasted sharply with the uncertainty that surrounded the Democratic party just 10 days ago, as doubts about Biden’s age and capabilities ultimately led to the end of his campaign.“This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,” said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old from suburban Lilburn. “I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.”Harris' campaign asserts that her appeal to young people, working-age women, and non-white voters has altered the dynamics in Georgia and similar states like North Carolina, Nevada, and Arizona. A strategy memo from Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, formerly Biden’s campaign chair, emphasized the necessity of winning Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania but also highlighted the new opportunities Harris brings to attract Black, Latino, and young voters in states like Georgia.“The energy is infectious,” said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams. “My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.”Harris began her day by highlighting her prosecutorial background, contrasting it with Trump’s legal troubles, while vigorously defending the Biden administration's record. She pledged to pass voting rights legislation and restore reproductive rights lost after the fall of Roe v. Wade. “America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back,” she declared, to chants of “we're not going back” from the crowd.Republicans argue that concerns over high consumer prices and immigration issues will impact Harris negatively in the traditionally conservative state. However, they acknowledge that the race now resembles the tightly contested 2020 more than it did a few weeks ago.“Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,” said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. “The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.”In response, Trump announced a rally in the same Georgia State arena for Saturday, underscoring the fierce competition ahead. Robinson admitted that while Harris has her weaknesses, including progressive stances from her 2020 primary campaign, she has been “in command” so far, making the race competitive in Georgia.Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as “just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden,” arguing she must explain her support for policies that allegedly harmed Georgia families. Nonetheless, Harris’ campaign and Georgia Democrats have mobilized significantly, with 24 offices across the state, including two new ones in metro Atlanta.Harris, addressing supporters post-speech, stressed the urgency of the campaign, noting that early voting begins in just 38 days. While she has yet to formally clinch the nomination or choose a running mate, these decisions are expected imminently.“This is a sprint,"" she said. ""And we know what we need to do to cross the finish line.”Harris’ campaign strategy involves winning over voters in Atlanta’s growing suburbs and exurbs, targeting moderates disenchanted with Trump. For many, her candidacy represents a fresh start.“I've voted Republican many times in my life,” said Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite from Forsyth County. “Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,"" he said, expressing disdain for Trump.Allen Smith, a 41-year-old Atlanta native, has become a first-time campaign volunteer for Harris. “I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,” he said, recounting his reaction to Biden’s endorsement of Harris.","US Vice President Kamala Harris electrified a packed arena in Atlanta on Tuesday, rallying thousands of enthusiastic supporters.

This strike, reported by Iraqi sources to have resulted in at least four deaths, is the first by American forces in Iraq since February. During that prior incident, the US military claimed to have killed a pro-Iran commander involved in attacks on US troops.""Tonight, US forces in Iraq conducted a defensive air strike in Babylon province , targeting combatants attempting to launch one-way attack uncrewed aerial systems,"" a US defense official was quoted as saying.The Central Command evaluated that the drones ""posed a threat to US and coalition forces."" The official added, ""We maintain the inherent right to self-defense and will not hesitate to take appropriate action.""The Hashed al-Shaabi, an alliance of pro-Iran former paramilitary groups integrated into Iraq's security forces, reported that apparent missile strikes had killed four people at a base in Babylon. However, they did not mention any drone launch attempts. ""Available information suggests that two patrols were targeted with missiles fired from drones,"" the Hashed said in a statement.An official from the Hashed al-Shaabi was quoted as saying that ""four people were killed and others were critically wounded in blasts that hit a base belonging to the Hashed al-Shaabi."" A security source confirmed the four deaths and noted that the death toll could rise.This air strike follows two recent attacks targeting US and allied forces in Iraq. Last week, several rockets were launched toward the Ain al-Assad base, which hosts US-led coalition troops combating the Islamic State group. On July 16, two drones were launched toward the same facility; one was ""successfully destroyed,"" while the other caused ""minimal damage,"" according to the Pentagon.US troops in Iraq and Syria had not been targeted since April before these recent incidents. However, attacks were frequent during the initial months of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, with more than 175 attacks reported. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, claimed most of these attacks, citing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.In January, a drone strike blamed on these groups killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan. In retaliation, US forces launched dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters. Since then, attacks on US troops have significantly decreased.Baghdad has been engaging in talks with Washington to defuse tensions and discuss the future of the US-led coalition's mission in Iraq. The US military maintains approximately 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria. The coalition was initially deployed to Iraq at the government's request in 2014 to help combat the Islamic State group, which had taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria. Despite the coalition's efforts, IS remnants continue to carry out attacks and ambushes in both countries.","U.S. forces carried out a ""defensive"" air strike against combatants who were attempting to launch drones. This strike, reported by Iraqi sources to have resulted in at least four deaths, is the first by American forces in Iraq since February. Last week, several rockets were launched toward the Ain al-Assad base, which hosts US-led coalition troops.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112151688,imgsize-3520,width-400,resizemode-4/112151688.jpg"
Has Kamala Harris decided on US vice presidential running mate?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/has-kamala-harris-decided-on-us-vice-presidential-running-mate/articleshow/112151648.cms,"In a whirlwind of political activity, Kamala Harris is on the cusp of announcing her choice for vice presidential running mate , with plans for a joint tour of crucial battleground states soon to follow, as per the report by CNN . This decisive step comes just days after Harris was unexpectedly propelled into the presidential candidate role, following President Joe Biden 's sudden withdrawal from the race.As per CNN sources close to the process reveal that Harris has been diligently reviewing extensive dossiers on each of the leading contenders, engaging in preliminary discussions, and seeking counsel from trusted advisers. Formal interviews with top candidates are set to begin this week.The Harris campaign faces an unprecedentedly tight schedule, having to swiftly evaluate and vet potential running mates. This effort has included scrutinizing video footage of the candidates and conducting in-depth background checks. The top names under consideration are Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Notably, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has opted out of the race, while Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear are still in the mix, though not seen as frontrunners.Leading the vetting team is former Attorney General Eric Holder, supported by a cadre of Democratic lawyers examining financial records and personal histories of the contenders. Tony West, Harris' brother-in-law and former Associate Attorney General, is also playing a pivotal advisory role in the selection process.Strategically, the Harris campaign is keenly focused on boosting electoral prospects. Polling indicates that candidates like Shapiro and Kelly could significantly sway voters in key battleground states. Pennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, is deemed particularly critical, potentially being the tipping point for the election's outcome.Choosing Shapiro, who is Jewish, could also offer Harris political leverage on Middle Eastern policy, a topic on which she has taken a more assertive stance than Biden. However, Shapiro's candidacy is not without complications, including the recent scandal involving his former aide, Mike Vereb, who resigned amid a sexual harassment investigation.Despite some Democrats urging an announcement at the upcoming Democratic convention in Chicago, Harris appears intent on naming her vice presidential pick sooner. With only three months left until Election Day, the urgency to solidify the ticket and hit the campaign trail is palpable.“She, better than anyone aside from a couple other people on earth, knows what the job of VP entails, for better and for worse,” a close friend of Harris was quoted as saying, emphasizing her search for a partner who can effectively complement her and address any electoral vulnerabilities.","Kamala Harris is on the cusp of announcing her choice for vice presidential running mate.

"Raging California wildfire swells to over 600 square miles, bigger than city of Los Angeles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/raging-california-wildfire-swells-to-over-600-square-miles-bigger-than-city-of-los-angeles/articleshow/112151474.cms,"The largest wildfire currently burning in the United States expanded to over 600 square miles on Tuesday, surpassing the size of Los Angeles, according to California fire officials. Thousands of firefighters are engaged in a round-the-clock battle against the Park Fire , which is raging through a wilderness area north of Sacramento.More than 5,500 firefighters from across California and other states are working tirelessly to contain the fire, which is burning in the state’s Central Valley, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) north of Sacramento, the capital.The fire has grown to 385,065 acres (155,830 hectares), making it the fifth-largest wildfire in California's history.On Tuesday, the Park Fire overtook the 2020 Creek Fire in Fresno County, which burned nearly 380,000 acres. However, it remains smaller than the state’s largest fire on record, the August Complex Fire of 2020, which scorched more than 1 million acres across seven northern California counties. The Park Fire, driven by dry grass, brush, and timber, is advancing rapidly, said Fire Captain Dan Collins of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).""This fire has plenty of fuel that's highly combustible and difficult to access,"" Collins stated. ""Our fire line stretches 260 miles, which is roughly the size of three Lake Tahoes. It can take two to three hours for personnel to reach certain areas due to the challenging terrain.""The National Weather Service predicts only a slight chance of isolated thunderstorms on Tuesday, with no significant rainfall expected in the near future. Meteorologist Ashton Robinson Cook indicated that the weather would remain hot and extremely dry, with temperatures projected to reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8°C) on Wednesday and persist at that level through next Monday. Relative humidity levels could drop as low as 7%.The Park Fire, which was only 14% contained as of Tuesday, has led to the evacuation of more than 4,000 people and caused damage or destruction to over 192 structures. Fortunately, no injuries or fatalities have been reported.Jeremy Hollingshead, a spokesperson for Cal Fire, mentioned that heavy smoke has grounded the 41 helicopters assigned to drop water and fire-retardant chemicals on the blaze.Evacuations have included the town of Paradise, which was devastated by the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California’s history.The man accused of starting the Park Fire, allegedly by pushing a flaming car down a Butte County gully last Wednesday, has been formally charged with arson. Ronnie Dean Stout II, 42, of Chico, California, denied the allegations during his arraignment on Monday, as stated by Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey during a news conference. It remains unclear if Stout has legal representation.Stout did not enter a plea but was denied bail. His arraignment has been continued to Thursday, as additional charges may be filed, Ramsey noted.","More than 5,500 firefighters from across California and other states are working tirelessly to contain the Park Fire.

El Chapo's son faces trial: Guzman Lopez pleads not guilty to drug trafficking charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/el-chapos-son-faces-trial-guzman-lopez-pleads-not-guilty-to-drug-trafficking-charges/articleshow/112148117.cms,"Joaquin Guzman Lopez , the son of former Sinaloa drug cartel leader El Chapo , entered a not guilty plea on Tuesday in response to a multitude of charges connected to one of the largest illegal drug operations in the world, according to prosecutors.Clad in an orange jumpsuit without handcuffs, Guzman Lopez entered his plea in Chicago federal court during a brief 10-minute hearing before US District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman.The judge subsequently ordered him to remain in detention until his trial commences. If found guilty of the charges brought against him, Guzman Lopez may face the death penalty.Guzman Lopez was apprehended in an operation allegedly orchestrated by Washington without Mexico's involvement, resulting in his arrest in Texas on Thursday. The presiding judge denied bail, remanded him into custody, and scheduled a case management hearing for September 30, as stated by the assistant US Attorney's office in a statement to AFP.Many aspects of the arrest operation, which also led to the apprehension of Ismael Zambada Garcia, known as ""El Mayo,"" a co-founder of the cartel, and his subsequent transfer to US custody, remain unclear. Zambada has also pleaded not guilty and has been remanded in custody.According to US law enforcement sources cited by media outlets, Zambada was unknowingly lured across the Mexico border by Guzman Lopez, one of El Chapo's four sons. A US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) report released in May suggests that the sons were engaged in an ""internal battle"" against Zambada, their father's former partner.Court documents previously released by prosecutors reveal that a federal grand jury indicted Guzman Lopez on charges of drug trafficking, money laundering, and weapons offenses. CNN reported that Jeffrey Lichtman, Guzman Lopez's lawyer, informed reporters that his client faces the death penalty in the case. Lichtman did not respond to AFP's request for comment.Guzman Lopez, who is in his 30s, is one of El Chapo's sons collectively known as Los Chapitos, or ""The Little Chapos."" El Chapo himself was convicted of drug charges in New York in 2019 and is currently serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison.Anne Milgram, the DEA chief, stated that Zambada's arrest ""strikes at the heart of the cartel that is responsible for the majority of drugs, including fentanyl and methamphetamine, killing Americans from coast to coast.""","Joaquin Guzman Lopez is the son of former Sinaloa drug cartel leader El Chapo.

Pakistan to launch new messaging app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-launch-new-messaging-app/articleshow/112152439.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has said it would “soon” launch a new messaging application , “Beep Pakistan”, which will initially be used for communication by govt employees and later made available to the general public.The announcement came as Pakistani users have been facing problems with WhatsApp , especially when sending and receiving media files. Digital rights advocates suspect that the country’s testing and deployment of an internet firewall , intended to stifle dissent and crack down on free speech, may be the cause of the disruption.“Beep Pakistan”, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication which says it will be launched “soon” among other government departments.“The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and telecommunication.When the plan was announced last year, the then IT minister, Syed Aminul Haque, described it as Pakistan’s alternative to WhatsApp.Now, govt is distancing itself from that comparison. “Any comparison to WhatsApp is misplaced as there is no intention to compete with any third-party platform,” Khwaja said, adding the purpose of this app is to protect privacy and data.Haque, who currently heads the National Assembly’s standing committee on IT, said govt plans to roll out the application to all its employees within the next 45 days. “Then we will see the situation and launch it for the public too,” he said. Unlike WhatsApp, the former IT minister said, “Beep’s data centre will be in Pakistan, ensuring 100% safety and security. Just as China has WeChat and America has WhatsApp, Pakistan now has its own app.”Pakistani authorities have long been concerned about WhatsApp’s security features, particularly after reports in Dec 2019 that at least two dozen senior officials were targeted by Pegasus, a spyware developed by an Israeli cybersecurity firm. At that time the Pakistan govt instructed all officials to avoid sharing sensitive and confidential documents over WhatsApp.When asked if WhatsApp would be banned in the country following Beep Pakistan’s public launch, Khwaja, the IT minister, denied any plans to block WhatsApp in the country. Haque said he was not in favour of a ban. “But since Beep Pakistan is safe and secure we wish it to be used in Pakistan and those who want to use WhatsApp can continue to use it,” he said.","“Beep Pakistan’, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication. “The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and tele communication.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112152447,imgsize-401505,width-400,resizemode-4/112152447.jpg"

Pakistan seeks reprofiling of over $27 billion debt with friendly nations: Finance minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-seeks-reprofiling-of-over-27-billion-debt-with-friendly-nations-finance-minister/articleshow/112099105.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF, according to a media report on Monday. The Washington-based International Monetary Fund last month announced that it signed a staff-level agreement with Pakistan to provide a $7 billion loan which would be disbursed for 37 months.However, it attached stringent conditions with it, requiring Pakistan prior action before the fund's board accords final approval for the loan.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb after returning from Beijing told the media on Sunday that talks have been going on with China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE for a re-profiling of $27 billion.Aurangzeb said Pakistan had already asked the friendly bilateral trio of lenders to roll over its more than $12 billion annual debt portfolio by three to five years to secure the IMF board's approval, which is expected next month.This is on top of Islamabad's request to Beijing to convert imported coal-based projects to local coal and re-profile more than $15 billion in energy sector liabilities to create fiscal space amid difficulties in timely repayments.Pakistan has a peculiar financial arrangement with these three countries in the shape of commercial loans and SAFE deposits that are rolled over every year and form a major part of the IMF programme in terms of external financing needs.Pakistan has now requested the maturity period of these loans - $5 billion from China, $4 billion from Saudi Arabia, and $3 billion from the UAE - to be extended to at least three years, offering greater predictability under the IMF programme.Aurangzeb said the Chinese side acknowledged Pakistan's foreign exchange difficulties and wanted to help in new business ventures and the re-profiling of energy sector payments besides playing its role in supporting Pakistan's case at the IMF board as one of the major stakeholders.He said the process of debt and equity rescheduling had been started and would now go to the working groups with relevant financial institutions and sponsors of Chinese projects for which Pakistan hired local Chinese consultants.""Between now and the IMF board meeting (on the 37-month bailout package), we have to ensure confirmation of external financing"" from friendly bilateral partners, the minister said.However, he explained that the Chinese energy sector debt reprofiling had nothing to do with the IMF programme as other prior actions had been completed and structural benchmarks were under implementation.Aurangzeb said he was in contact with the Chinese, Saudi and UAE finance ministers for an extension in debt rollover for three years and they had assured their support that would place Pakistan in a very comfortable position in terms of external financing gap.""I can assure you we are at a very good place on external financing for the next three years, including year one, year two and year three,"" he said.He said the IMF had worked out a financing needs assessment for three years that also included its own $7 billion Extended Fund Facility. After rollovers from friendly countries, the remaining external financing gap would become very manageable, he said.Responding to a question, the minister said Pakistan was not seeking any incremental financing from friendly countries. ""The only incremental thing is an extension in the maturity period for three years instead of yearly rollovers,"" he said.Aurangzeb said that the issue of energy sector repayments was initially taken up by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Beijing and followed it up with formal letters to Prime Minister Li Keqiang.As part of the process, Aurangzeb, along with Power Minister Awais Leghari, held meetings with Chinese finance and energy ministers and the governor of the Chinese central bank to understand the context of Pakistan's ability to pay, economic stability and relief in energy tariffs.He said the two sides discussed conversions of Chinese power projects to local coal and how to take their technical, logistical and financial parameters forward.Secondly, financial re-profiling would also need to be discussed with banks and project sponsors one by one. ""They have recognised this and the process would now move forward on that basis,"" Aurangzeb said.He said the re-profiling of CPEC debt was also discussed with the governor of the Chinese central bank and ""we would need to go project by project given the CPEC structure"".""Very positive discussions have taken place from my perspective,"" he said, adding the debt of Chinese independent power producers (IPPs) was manageable as their legal payments were being made, but the issue pertained to return on equity to project sponsors mainly because of foreign exchange which required to be rescheduled to create fiscal space.The minister, however, clarified that Pakistan was seeking the re-profiling of payments and not ""haircuts"" - debt waiver or interest rate cuts.",Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF.

The two former rivals recently witnessed a war of words. The ruling PML-N accepted all the demands of PPP over the federal budget and allocation of development funds.Since Khan's ouster through a vote of no confidence in 2022, the PTI has maintained a strong opposition to the PPP-PML-N alliance.Political tensions increased after the February 8 elections, which saw the two parties forming a coalition government in the Centre.Calls for reconciliation have been growing from various societal and political quarters, urging the PTI to negotiate with the government.Khan's party had previously rejected talks with what it termed the ""Form-47 government,"" instead showing a preference for dialogue with the military establishment.In April, PTI's Shehryar Afridi indicated a preference for negotiations with Army chief Gen Asim Munir and the Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI).Subsequently, PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub mentioned that Imran Khan had assigned significant responsibility to former President Dr Arif Alvi.Last month, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar confirmed that Khan had approved discussions with the government.Similarly, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Khan's sister Aleema Khan called for state institutions to remain neutral for the country's progress.Meanwhile, the government too has called on the Khan-founded party to come to the table and hold talks.""If you want to remove us then do it.
