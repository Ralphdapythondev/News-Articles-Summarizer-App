A 'miserable relationship'

A regional court in the Bavarian capital , Munich , on Friday issued the German World Cup-winning soccer star Jerome Boateng with a warning over alleged intentional bodily harm against his ex-girlfriend .Ex-Bayern Munich player Boateng received a suspended fine of €200,000 ($227,000), which he would only have to pay if he committed another offense.The proceedings center on allegations of violence made by Boateng's former partner, the mother of his 13-year-old twins, during a vacation together in the Caribbean in 2018.It was the third retrial of the case. The presiding judge spoke of a toxic relationship between Boateng and his former partner.Prosecutors had demanded a fine of €1.12 million, while the defense maintained the incident in question amounted only to a scuffle and argued for a more moderate sentence.Boateng denied hitting his former partner and throwing a lantern and cooling bag at her during the vacation. Early in the trial, he spoke of a ""nightmare,"" while his lawyer maintained there had been a ""fabricated narrative of a wife-beater.""In a summing up on Friday, presiding judge Susanne Hemmerich said this narrative did not stand.Before the closing arguments, a mutual acquaintance of Boateng and his ex-girlfriend had given evidence, describing their relationship as emotionally charged and very difficult. The pair had ""a miserable relationship,"" the man said.The court had heard that Boateng had pushed his ex-girlfriend away to defend himself and that she had injured him on the lip.Boateng was found guilty of domestic violence in the case in September 2021 and ordered to pay a €1.8 million euro fine — the highest possible financial damages that could be imposed by the district court in which he was tried. Boateng's team appealed the verdict.In November 2022, he was ordered to pay €1.2 million to his former partner after the assault sentence was upheld. That decision was overturned at a regional court because of legal errors, meaning the process had to be restarted.The long-time Bayern defender recently transferred from the Italian club US Salernitana to the Austrian side Linzer ASK.","Jerome Boateng receives a suspended fine of €200,000 ($227,000) over alleged intentional bodily harm.

US woman released from jail after 43 years for a murder she did not commit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-woman-released-from-jail-after-43-years-for-a-murder-she-did-not-commit/articleshow/111875195.cms,"Sandra Hemme , an American woman who spent 43 years in prison for a murder she did not commit, was finally released on Saturday despite the Missouri attorney general 's attempts to keep her imprisoned.Hemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St Joseph, Missouri.The 64-year-old reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter, and granddaughter.""You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,"" she said. ""You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.""Judge Ryan Horsman had originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had provided clear evidence of her innocence, overturning her conviction. However, Republican attorney general Andrew Bailey fought against her release .Horsman threatened to hold Bailey's office in contempt if Hemme was not released within hours and scolded the attorney general's office for instructing prison officials to disregard the court order.Hemme's attorney, Sean O'Brien, expressed his frustration with the difficulty of freeing an innocent person, even in the face of court orders. “It shouldn’t be this hard to free an innocent person,"" he said. He also noted that Hemme would need assistance, as she would not be eligible for social security due to her lengthy imprisonment.Despite the agreement of multiple courts that Hemme should be released, Bailey continued to file motions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. Legal experts found this effort shocking, given the strong evidence suggesting Hemme's innocence.Judge Horsman 's extensive review concluded that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a vulnerable mental state when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing.The St Joseph Police department had ignored evidence pointing to a fellow officer, Michael Holman, who died in 2015, and the prosecution was not informed of FBI results that could have cleared Hemme.Judge Horsman called Hemme ""the victim of a manifest injustice.""","Sandra Hemme, 64, was released on Saturday after 43 years in prison for a murder she did not commit.

'If Biden doesn't have cognitive function ...': JD Vance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/if-biden-doesnt-have-cognitive-function-jd-vance-targets-bidens-presidential-bid/articleshow/111875041.cms,"Donald Trump's running mate and Republican vice presidential candidate, JD Vance , criticised US President Joe Biden 's cognitive abilities, questioning his capacity to remain in office and run for re-election.This comes amidst increasing calls from Democrats for Biden to step aside, following his underwhelming debate performance with Trump earlier this month.Despite this, Biden has reaffirmed his commitment to continue his campaign.Ohio Senator JD Vance challenged Biden's cognitive fitness, taking it to social media platform X, he wrote: ""If Joe Biden doesn't have the cognitive function to run for re-election, then he certainly doesn't have the cognitive function to remain as Commander-In-Chief. How can any Dem pushing him to drop out of the presidential race argue in good faith that he should stay on as POTUS?"" Vance questioned.This comment parallels sentiments from several Democrats urging Biden to drop out as the party nominee. Biden's debate performance, lasting 90 minutes, drew critical responses due to his visible struggle with vocal clarity and statistical citations. Democratic dissatisfaction was highlighted when Senator Martin Heinrich and four House Democrats publicly called for Biden to withdraw his re-election bid.Biden faced additional challenges last week as a report indicated that nearly 20 Congressional Democrats suggested he step down from the 2024 race. Most of these lawmakers, including national security Democrats Jim Hines and Adam Smith, hail from safe Democratic districts. Long-serving Congressman Lloyd Doggett of Texas was the first to voice this call, representing a secure seat and with nearly 30 years in Congress.Despite internal party pressure, Biden remained resolute in his candidacy. On Friday, he responded to Trump's previous speech at the Republican National Convention, criticising it as a bleak vision for America's future.""Donald Trump's dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans. Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,"" Biden emphasised.Biden also expressed his eagerness to resume campaigning and counter Trump's agenda while advocating for his own vision. ""I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America: one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms, and create opportunity for everyone,"" Biden stated.Biden's campaigning efforts were temporarily paused after testing positive for Covid-19 during a trip to Las Vegas.

Netanyahu slams ICJ ruling as 'decision of lies'

Why is Israel occupying Palestinian territories?

Israel rejects Palestinian statehood

Israel's settlement policies in the occupied Palestinian territories amount to a violation of international law , the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said on Friday.The ruling from the top UN court is a non-binding advisory opinion that is unlikely to have much direct impact on Israeli policy, but will add to the mounting international pressure on Israel to outline a full strategy to end fighting in Gaza.The ruling is not connected to events since October 7, when Hamas militants led incursions into Israel, taking some 250 hostages and leading to the deaths of around 1,200 people, mostly civilians.The ICJ's panel of 15 judges said ""the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.""The court also said that Israel's use of natural resources in Palestinian territories was ""inconsistent"" with its obligations as an occupying power.The ICJ called the presence of Israeli forces in occupied territories illegal and said it should end ""as rapidly as possible.""The court also said Israel must pay reparations for the damages it caused during its occupation.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the court had made a ""decision of lies.""""The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land — not in our eternal capital Jerusalem, nor in our ancestral heritage of Judea and Samaria,"" Netanyahu said in a statement.""No decision of lies in The Hague will distort this historical truth, and similarly, the legality of Israeli settlements in all parts of our homeland cannot be disputed,"" he added.Israel has occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem since the Six-Day War in 1967. More than 500,000 Israeli settlers have set up home across more than 100 settlements, already deemed illegal by the United Nations, on occupied land .Some 200,000 Israelis also live in East Jerusalem neighborhoods that Palestinians hope would make up their future capital city.The West Bank and East Jerusalem, along with Gaza, would be the foundational territories for a future Palestinian state, a plan backed by Israel's major supporters including the US and Germany.The ruling comes amid the backdrop of Israel's operations in Gaza, in response to the events of October 7, that have killed more than 38,800 people, mostly women and children, according to data from the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, figures that are deemed largely reliable by the UN.Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea of a Palestinian state and has continued to promote Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.The Israeli parliament, the Knesset, also voted against the formation of a Palestinian state on Thursday, drawing condemnation from the German government.While Berlin has been largely reticent to criticize Israel, a spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry on Friday said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the move, adding that ""Israel is isolating itself.""The ICJ took up the case in December 2022, after a large majority of the UN General Assembly voted on requesting an advisory opinion.The court is also considering a separate case filed by South Africa that accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.","International Court of Justice says Israel's settlement policies violate international law.

RNC LIVE: Trump gives speech at Republican National Convention Day 4

Donald Trump , the Republican presidential candidate, on Thursday recounted his personal experience of the assassination attempt on his life during a rally at Pennsylvania rally.While delivering his speech at the closing night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump called for unity among Americans.Trump vividly described the moment when the assassin's bullet nearly struck him, missing by a mere quarter of an inch.He shared the details of the incident, stating, ""I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear. I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet. If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the bullet would have perfectly hit its mark. I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack, and in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground.""Trump said that the attack was swiftly ended by a Secret Service sniper, who took out the assassin with a single shot from a greater distance.“There was blood pouring everywhere, yet, in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side,"" Trump said. “I'm not supposed to be here tonight.""The crowd responded with chants of ""Yes you are,"" to which Trump replied, ""I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God. And watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a 'providential moment.' Probably was.""In the face of the assassination attempt, Trump described how he raised his fist in the air and began shouting ""fight, fight, fight,"" demonstrating his resilience and determination to continue his presidential campaign.Trump's speech served as the culmination of a four-day Republican rally that attracted thousands of conservative activists and elected officials to Wisconsin, a crucial swing state.With both candidates currently facing low popularity, Trump seized the opportunity presented by his near-death experience to adopt a new tone that he believes will generate more momentum in an election that seems to be shifting in his favor.Meanwhile, 81-year-old Democrat Biden faces mounting pressure from key congressional allies, donors, and even former President Barack Obama , who are concerned about his ability to secure reelection following his poor debate performance.","Trump vividly described the moment when the assassin's bullet nearly struck him, missing by a mere quarter of an inch.

This announcement comes as more than 20 other nations have committed to maintaining their military and financial aid to Ukraine, even if the United States withdraws its support under a different administration.US secretary of state, Blinken, for the first time addressed the situation in which former President Donald Trump could win the upcoming November election and potentially retract the support of US to Ukraine, which has been crucial under President Joe Biden in its fight against the Russian invasion.Blinken highlighted the significance of international pledges to assist Ukraine, including those from Nato partners, Japan, and the European Union. He reassured that even if the US were to renege on its support, these countries would continue their commitments to the nation.Trump's previous statements have fluctuated between criticising and supporting US aid to Ukraine, while his running mate, Sen JD Vance, has spearheaded Republican efforts to block substantial military and financial assistance to the country since Russia 's invasion in 2022.Concerns have grown among Ukraine and its supporters about the potential loss of essential US backing amid Trump's ascending campaign and Biden's faltering performance.

Usha Vance's RNC speech on Indian heritage amidst 'send them back' chants a stark contradiction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-is-usha-vance-being-accused-of-hypocrisy-after-her-rnc-speech/articleshow/111875648.cms,"Usha Chilukuri Vance on Wednesday spoke proudly about her Indian roots and immigrant parents at the Republican National Convention .However, social media users criticised her for what they perceive as a glaring inconsistency: the strongly anti-immigrant sentiment prevalent among the audience she addressed.Talking about her Indian roots Usha said, 'I grew up in San Diego in a middle-class community with two loving parents both immigrants from India and a loving sister.'Throughout the event, signs reading ""Mass Deportations Now"" dotted the convention floor, and chants of ""send them back"" echoed multiple times when politicians, including Usha Vance's husband, JD Vance, spoke about ""illegal aliens"" entering the country.According to experts, this contradiction confirms a long-standing strategy employed by the right. Pawan Dhingra, an American studies professor at Amherst College, explained to NBC, ""There are good immigrants and there are bad immigrants. And the Republican Party is just trying to embrace, quote-unquote, 'good immigrants.'"" During her speech, Usha Vance discussed her upbringing and how it differed from her husband's, emphasizing the American Dream and how their love story exemplifies it.“Usha Vance talking about being a daughter of immigrants as the mostly white people at the RNC hold ‘Mass Deportations Now’ signs is quite the scene,” one person tweeted.Businessman and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy also invoked his family's immigrant story during his speech, along with a more explicit message about undocumented immigrants. ""Our message to every legal immigrant in this country is this: You're like my parents,"" he said. ""You deserve the opportunity to secure a better life for your children in America. But our message to illegal immigrants is also this: We will return you to your country of origin.""Dhingra argued that this rhetoric is particularly damaging when expressed by children of immigrants like Ramaswamy and Usha Vance, as it creates a division between communities of colour whose stories are similar. He noted that the binary of good and bad immigrants is nonsensical, as the government's arbitrary limits on legal immigration often contribute to the creation of undocumented immigration.When asked about the criticism, JD Vance's adviser and family friend, Jai Chabria, and Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung dismissed it as an attack on a successful diverse figure by out-of-touch liberals. However, experts point out that JD Vance's political transformation and stances on immigration put him at odds with his wife's immigrant family story.Despite speeches denouncing undocumented immigrants, Trump's presidency saw the restriction of legal immigration pathways, affecting foreign-born workers, particularly Indian nationals who make up the majority of H1B petitioners.As a new face of the MAGA movement, Usha Vance may have a unique role in addressing these issues, with Dhingra suggesting that her presence could support the Republican Party's rhetoric that they are not anti-immigrant but rather want immigrants to ""adapt"" to the country properly without threatening certain ways of life.","Usha Chilukuri Vance spoke proudly about her Indian roots and immigrant parents at the Republican National Convention.

Shooter flew drones over site hours before attempting a shot at Trump: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shooter-flew-drones-over-site-hours-before-attempting-a-shot-at-trump-report/articleshow/111875074.cms,"The shooter who attempted a shot at former US President Donald Trump at the Pennsylvania rally allegedly flew drones above the site of Trump's speech, the Wall Street Journal reported. The new details that have emerged suggest that 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks flew the drone on a pre-programmed flight path to survey the grounds hours ahead of the ex-president's speech.The report said that the drone circled the location several times while Crooks observed the area and examined the event site. The planned route indicate that Thomas Matthew Crooks likely operated the drone multiple times to collect information about the event site. Crooks later made his way to a rooftop only about 430 feet away from where the Republican presidential candidate, 78, was speaking and fired at least six shots toward the former president.Crooks started researching the rally site soon after the Trump campaign announced the event on July 3, registering for it on July 7. Subsequently, visited the farm show grounds a few days later for further examination.Crooks then returned with two homemade bombs, designed to be remotely detonated using receivers similar to those found in fireworks. Investigators discovered these crude explosives in Crooks' car parked near the grounds, along with a ballistic vest containing three 30-round magazines, indicating he planned to cause more significant harm, as the report by the WSJ noted.This revelation also comes as other chilling information about the would-be assassin's sinister attempt emerge. Recently, it was reported that Thomas Crooks had posted a chilling message on social media, carried images of both Donald Trump and President Biden on his phone, and had searched the dates for the Democratic National Convention and Trump's Pennsylvania rally, making his sinister intentions clear before the assassination bid.According to multiple media reports, the individual who climbed onto a roof and opened fire at a Pennsylvania campaign rally had posted a threatening message on the gaming platform ""Steam,"" stating, ""July 13 will be my premiere, watch as it unfolds.""Investigators so far have examined the suspect's technological devices, including cell phones and a laptop, and discovered this message. On reviewing the laptop, they found searches conducted in July for topics like Trump, Biden, the DNC convention schedule, and the July 13 Trump rally.America's top security officials relayed this information to senators recently. Senators were quoted as telling the media that none of the interviewees reported hearing the suspect discuss politics.The suspect possessed two cell phones. The primary phone was recovered at the scene, along with a remote transmitter. A second cell phone, found at the suspect's home, contained only 27 contacts. The FBI is currently in the process of locating and interviewing these individuals.Multiple media reports also stated that Crooks visited a shooting range, stopped at Home Depot, and a gun store, where he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition and a 5-foot ladder ahead of the attack.Meanwhile, CNN reported that the investigating authorities have put together an early portrait of the would be assassin who is believed to be an intelligent loner with an interest in guns and strangely away from the fences of politics.","Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, flew a drone on a pre-programmed flight path to survey the grounds hours ahead of the ex-president's speech.

US presidential election 2024: How Elon Musk chose Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-election-2024-how-elon-musk-chose-trump/articleshow/111872751.cms,"MILWAUKEE: A little over two months ago, Elon Musk found himself at Montsorrel, the palatial Palm Beach compound of Nelson Peltz, a famed activist investor. Musk knew the sprawling grounds well, having stayed in the guesthouse at the Florida property.The topic of conversation was a bit different than usual, though: Peltz had brought together a group of billionaire conservative financiers — including Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas casino magnate, and hedge-funder John Paulson — to dive into concerns about whether Republicans could seize Senate control, as well as the party’s weak ground game, according to a person with direct knowledge of what transpired.But Musk had a darker message that spring day. He told the group that this would be the last free election in America — because if President Joe Biden won, millions of people living in the country illegally would be legalized and democracy would be finished, according to the person.Former President Donald Trump had to win, Musk said. He dispensed some advice for the veteran financiers, who had decades more experience in Republican politics than he did: Their emphasis on political advertising was misplaced, he said. Tesla, his electric car company, barely advertises, he said, but had still built a cult following through word of mouth. Why couldn’t Republicans do the same?The most important thing that the financiers could do, Musk said, was ask two people to support Trump, and urge them to ask two more. Two people by two people — that’s how the former president would win.Musk has transformed himself from an idealistic supporter of Democrats like Barack Obama into a fierce ally of Trump, whom he flirted with for months and endorsed last weekend roughly 30 minutes after the former president survived an assassination attempt.In fact, Trump’s campaign at one point had talked with Musk about him delivering remarks at this week’s Republican National Convention. Musk said Thursday that he was not speaking.Musk is more comfortable than ever revealing his conservative sympathies. But the role that he has played in supporting Republicans financially is not widely known, in part because he has tried to avoid making public donations.He has emerged as a central character in the presidential race, targeted by the Biden campaign and celebrated as an almost mythical figure by Trump’s advisers. Angry at liberals over immigration, transgender rights and the Biden administration’s perceived treatment of Tesla, the mercurial Musk has undergone a midlife reinvention that has many Republicans salivating about him as the party’s moneymaker — if only he will deliver.This article is based on interviews with about two dozen of Musk’s political associates, friends and Republican Party allies, many of whom insisted on anonymity to disclose private conversations. Musk and his aides did not respond to requests for comment.Woody Johnson, a preeminent Republican fundraiser and Trump’s former ambassador to Britain, said he welcomed Musk into the party as an ideological convert.“Explore all ideas — and come up with the best one,” Johnson quipped in an interview. “There’s nobody in the world like Musk. We’re lucky as Americans to have him. He is the most innovative — besides Trump.”Musk was once allergic to Washington. He maintained a decent relationship with Obama and made several White House visits to build support for Tesla and SpaceX, his rocket manufacturer. But he generally disliked meeting with other politicians and saw political donations as a necessary evil, according to four people who worked with him.Days before the 2016 election, he told CNBC that Trump did not “seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.” After Trump won, Musk told some associates that the outcome was proof that they were living in a simulation, according to one person close to him. In 2020, in a private conversation with another associate, Musk called Trump a “stone-cold loser.”In 2022, the former president, for his part, used an expletive to describe the Tesla CEO at a rally.Musk also predicted that Trump’s days as a political force were finished, according to a private message that was viewed by The New York Times, as he prepared to voice support for Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, whose campaign he helped kick off in 2023.Musk has become an obsession of many Trump officials and Republican fundraisers, who see him as the party’s next great hope — or a meal ticket for themselves. But over the years, he has acquired a reputation in political circles as something of a flake.Some conservative activists said they wished that Musk had followed through more on promises to fund free speech lawsuits by people who believed that they had been censored on social media.Musk can be hard to pin down, and rumors fly about him in Republican circles. In 2023, when Kevin McCarthy was elected as House speaker, the California politician gave a party at the Library of Congress, and some aides were told until shortly beforehand to expect Musk to show up and speak. But he didn’t, disappointing some in the crowd, a person involved in the event recalled.Musk has also been unreliable in local politics. He wrote last year on his social platform, X, that he planned to donate $100,000 to GrowSF, a centrist group in San Francisco, so it could help defeat a progressive city official. But Musk did not donate or even contact the group, said Steven Buss, one of GrowSF’s founders. An Embrace of Dark Money Musk has said that he tries to stay out of politics, and he has not donated to a federal political group since the 2020 cycle, according to campaign finance records. He has gone to great lengths to avoid leaving a public footprint of the contributions he does make.Indeed, he learned a tough lesson when he made his largest disclosed gift ever, a $50,000 donation in 2017, to the McCarthy Victory Fund, a group aligned with McCarthy. The disclosure of that donation angered liberals. He learned from that experience to prioritize giving to dark-money organizations, a person familiar with his thinking recalled.In recent communications with Republicans, Musk and his associates have expressed a desire not to make political contributions to groups whose donations must be legally disclosed. He told a friend a few months ago that he wanted to find a way to support Trump but didn’t want to do it publicly, the friend recalled.During the Republican presidential primary race, Musk’s team had detailed talks with allies of Vivek Ramaswamy about making a major donation to a dark-money group backing the entrepreneur’s candidacy, according to a person briefed on the talks. Musk attended two fundraisers for Ramaswamy, in California and Texas, two people briefed said, but he ultimately declined to cut a check.In 2023, he strongly considered making a significant political donation to the American Action Network, a 501(c) (4) dark-money group steered by McCarthy’s political operation, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. It’s not clear if he gave.As Musk sought help on politics, the people he turned to sought to influence him.He had gotten to know McCarthy over the last decade thanks to the former speaker’s advocacy for SpaceX. They now text frequently, and Musk has often relied on McCarthy over the years for advice on politics and lobbying.McCarthy has been eager to highlight his relationship with Musk, and has gone to great lengths to cultivate him, according to people familiar with their relationship.He interviewed the billionaire at an exclusive conference in Sea Island, Georgia, hosted by the conservative American Enterprise Institute, and invited Musk to headline a fundraising retreat for McCarthy’s donors in Wyoming. Musk also flew to Washington for the congressman’s birthday last year.McCarthy has helped develop Musk’s relationship with Trump, but he has not been alone. Three close friends of the former president — Peltz, Wynn and Steve Witkoff, whose firm invested in the billionaire’s Twitter takeover — plus Musk’s emerging confidant, Diesel Peltz, a son of Nelson Peltz — have played a role in encouraging Musk to draw close to Trump, according to people familiar with the relationships. Musk also talks frequently with Ramaswamy, who has become a Trump surrogate, another person said.Wynn said in an interview that Musk was “dedicating himself to making sure this election ends up properly” but downplayed his own role.“He did that without my help,” he said. “Elon is a self-propelled rocket.”Some of Musk’s friends in Silicon Valley have also bent his ear, including members of the so-called PayPal Mafia, a group of early executives at the payments company that includes Trump donors David Sacks and Ken Howery, the people said.Musk used to live primarily in Los Angeles, but people close to him said his politics had been shaped by his more conservative social circle in his new home state of Texas. Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of Palantir who lives in Texas, and his aides have spent considerable time with Musk talking about politics, and Musk has told others that he is worried about what would happen to his businesses if Texas went blue, the people said.But some of Musk’s more liberal friends and associates have expressed unhappiness to him about his rightward drift, according to three people familiar with the situation. Some said they have received private assurances from Musk that he is not donating to support Trump.The extremist direction of Musk has bothered his own high-profile, celebrity lawyer, Alex Spiro, according to two people who have spoken to him. Spiro, who declined to comment, has encouraged Musk not to alienate Democrats from his businesses, citing the famous quip from Michael Jordan that “Republicans buy sneakers, too,” one of the people said.It appears those liberal friends are losing the tug of war. Musk met with Trump in March and now talks with him directly on occasion, according to people familiar with the relationship. The two have spoken about electric vehicles, as well as technology like so-called deepfake videos, the former president has told donors who relayed his remarks.During the Trump term, Musk once asked his top executives at Tesla how many of them had voted for Trump and was alarmed to hear that none of them had, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.“I have had some conversations with him, and he does call me out of the blue for no reason,” Musk said last month at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting.Musk and Sacks organized a private dinner this spring in Los Angeles with several other anti-Biden billionaires, who talked about ways to oppose Biden’s reelection.Whether Musk might financially support the Republican ticket has flummoxed Trump’s aides. For much of this year, Musk entertained to friends the notion of an endorsement, or at least urging his followers explicitly not to vote for Biden, according to two people who spoke directly with Musk. The billionaire told these people that he wanted to wait until the president formally captured the Democratic nomination before he made a proclamation.Then came the assassination attempt.Within an hour of the shooting, Musk went on X and endorsed Trump.Lonsdale has helped start a new super political action committee that its donors say will fund an aggressive field program to aid Trump, and several of Musk’s close friends have pooled their millions behind the group. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had spoken of donating $45 million per month to the group — energizing both the Trump and Biden teams. But Musk has told people close to him that the figure is false, and while people close to the group said that while they expect him to give, they don’t know how much.In recent weeks, Musk privately lobbied Trump to choose Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate. He celebrated vociferously Monday after Vance was announced as the pick.Trevor Traina, a Republican fundraiser in San Francisco who served in the Trump administration and knows Musk socially, said he saw parallels between the two men.“He has had to walk the same road as Trump — silenced, targeted, canceled — and within the last couple weeks,” Traina said of Musk, “he has decided it’s time to take action.”","Musk has transformed himself from an idealistic supporter of Democrats like Barack Obama into a fierce ally of Trump.

However, the full moon will be visible throughout the weekend, from Friday night until Monday morning, offering ample opportunity for moon gazing.The name ""Buck Moon"" originates from the Algonquin tribes in the northeastern United States, referring to the time of year when male deer , or bucks, begin to grow their new antlers .This growth is significant as it marks a seasonal change, aligning with the natural rhythms of wildlife.The antlers, initially covered in a velvety fur, can be prominently seen by July, symbolizing the vitality of the summer season.In addition to the Buck Moon, this full moon is also known by various other names across different cultures.Some Indigenous groups refer to it as the Salmon Moon, coinciding with the salmon migration, while others call it the Thunder Moon, reflecting the frequent thunderstorms typical of early summer. European traditions often label it the Hay Moon, as this period aligns with hay harvesting.This year’s Buck Moon is particularly notable as it coincides with the 55th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.","The full moon will reach its peak illumination in the US at 6.17 am ET on July 21.

The people of Bannu will continue their peaceful resistance with unity and consensus for peace,” said former senator Mushtaq Ahmed.Led by young activist Manzoor Pashteen, PTM is known for its strident criticism of Pakistan’s powerful military for its role in alleged enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings of rights activists and ethnic leaders, as well as the alleged mistreatment of the Pakhtun community by security forces.Pashteen posted on X that the Pakistani army had opened fire on what he described as a “peaceful protest.” The demonstration came in the wake of a militant attack on a military base in the area on July 15 in which eight soldiers were killed.Islamabad has repeatedly raised concerns about cross-border attacks with the Taliban administration in Afghanistan, exacerbating tensions between the two countries.

It stated that security forces killed all 10 assailants in the ensuing gunfight.The attack on Bannu cantonment, the ISPR said, had been orchestrated by militants based in Afghanistan. “The attempt to enter the cantonment was effectively thwarted by security forces personnel, which forced the terrorists to ram an explosives-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall of the cantonment,” ISPR said.It added that the suicide car bombing destroyed a portion of the wall and damaged adjoining infrastructure, resulting in the deaths of the eight soldiers.“In the ensuing operation, our troops effectively engaged the terrorists as a result of which all 10 terrorists were sent to hell,” the army said. “This timely and effective response by the security forces prevented a major catastrophe, saving precious innocent lives,” it added.Locals said the blast was heard miles away and caused damage to nearby houses and shops. They said they saw black smoke billowing above the site and heard gunshots in the cantonment area.A militant outfit allied with the globally designated terrorist group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) took responsibility for the attack shortly after it started.The ISPR statement attributed the assault to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group which, according to it, operates from Afghanistan and has used Afghan soil to orchestrate acts of terrorism inside Pakistan in the past.Bannu and adjoining districts in the border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have particularly seen frequent TTP attacks targeting military and police forces since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan three years ago.Pakistan maintains TTP leaders and fighters are being increasingly facilitated by the de facto rulers of Afghanistan. The Taliban govt dismisses the allegations, saying TTP is an internal problem for Pakistan to deal with.There has been a sharp rise in terror incidents since PM Shehbaz Sharif announced anewmilitary offensive against militancy and extremism in the country’s northwestern and southwestern border regions.

Lahore court remands Imran Khan for 10 days police custody in May 9 riot cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/lahore-court-remands-imran-khan-for-10-days-police-custody-in-may-9-riot-cases/articleshow/111771870.cms,"LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court in Lahore has granted police a 10-day physical remand of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) founder Imran Khan in connection with 12 cases stemming from the May 9 riots , Dawn reported.The unrest erupted nationwide last year after Imran Khan was detained by paramilitary rangers from the Islamabad high court during a corruption case proceeding.During the protests, widespread rioting and vandalism were reported across various locations, including the Lahore corps commander's residence and the general headquarters in Rawalpindi, as captured in social media footage.Lahore police's investigation wing, comprising a 13-member team, visited Adiala Jail on Saturday to question Imran Khan regarding the violence. However, the PTI leader declined to meet with the team, which sought to interrogate him on charges related to inciting public unrest against the state, as reported by Dawn.According to Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Asghar, Imran Khan was arrested as the primary suspect in 12 cases registered at different police stations in Lahore. The charges against him range from provoking the public to attacks on government properties and military installations.Senior police officials specified that the focus of the investigation primarily centred on two cases: the assault on the Lahore corps commander's residence and the Askari Tower.The cases were filed at several police stations, including Sarwar Road, Gulberg, Race Course, Naseerabad, Shadman, and others in Lahore.In today's hearing at anti-terrorism Court-I before Judge Khalid Arshad , the police requested a 30-day physical remand for Imran Khan to facilitate further investigation into the 12 cases. Imran Khan appeared via video call from Adiala Jail, represented by his lawyers, Azhar Siddique and Usman Gul, who objected to the remote proceedings and insisted on his physical presence.After hearing arguments from both sides, Judge Khalid Arshad reserved his verdict briefly and later granted a 10-day physical remand for Imran Khan. This remand applies to cases registered at Sarwar Road, Gulberg, Race Course, Shadman, Model Town, and Mughalpura police stations, totaling five cases at Sarwar Road, three at Gulberg, and one each at the other mentioned stations, Dawn reported.",An anti-terrorism court in Lahore has granted police a 10-day physical remand of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) founder Imran Khan.

"Pakistan govt raises petrol by PKR 9.99, diesel by PKR 6.18 due to global market pressures",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-raises-petrol-by-pkr-9-99-diesel-by-pkr-6-18-due-to-global-market-pressures/articleshow/111769476.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government has announced significant increases in petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) prices, citing fluctuations in international markets as the reason behind the hikes, Dawn reported.According to a notification from the Finance Division, petrol prices surged by PKR 9.99 per litre, reaching PKR 275.6/ltr, while HSD saw a rise of PKR 6.18/ltr, settling at PKR 283.63/ltr for the upcoming fortnight.The adjustment, it clarified, was necessary due to recent price variations in global oil markets.Importantly, the government emphasised that there would be no changes to the current levels of applicable duties and taxes, maintaining them at their existing rates despite the price increases.Sources revealed that international market prices for petrol and HSD had climbed by approximately USD 4.4 and USD 2 per barrel, respectively, over the last two weeks, prompting the adjustments, as reported by Dawn.In anticipation of higher global oil prices, analysts had forecast increases exceeding PKR 7.60 and PKR 3.50 per litre for petrol and HSD, respectively. Import premiums during the period remained unchanged at USD 9.60 and USD 6.50 per barrel for petrol and HSD, respectively, while the Pakistani Rupee depreciated by about 17 paise against the dollar over the same fortnight.The government also disclosed its decision to raise the maximum limit of the petroleum development levy (PDL) to PKR 70 per litre through the Finance Bill. This move aims to bolster revenue collection, targeting PKR 1.28 trillion for the current fiscal year, up from PKR 960 billion in the previous year and surpassing the initial budget target by PKR 91 billion.Taxes on both petrol and HSD currently stand at approximately PKR 77 per litre, alongside a fixed PKR 60 per litre PDL, which notably impacts consumers. Additionally, a PKR 17 per litre customs duty is applied uniformly to both locally produced and imported petrol and HSD.The price hikes in petrol and diesel are expected to impact inflation, with petrol predominantly used in private transport, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, while diesel is crucial for heavy transport vehicles and contributes significantly to the cost of essential commodities such as vegetables, Dawn reported.","Petrol prices surged by PKR 9.99 per litre, reaching PKR 275.6/ltr, while HSD saw a rise of PKR 6.18/ ltr.

""We believe Article 17 of the Constitution gives the govt the right to ban political parties.""Tarar said that besides Imran and Alvi, the govt had decided to slap a treason case on ex-deputy speaker Qasim Suri under Article 6 for dissolving the assemblies in April 2022 despite a no-confidence motion moved against the then government in parliament.“The reference, under Article 6, will be sent to the apex court after being approved by the cabinet,"" he said.Article 6 states, ""Any person who abrogates or subverts or suspends, or holds in abeyance or attempts or conspires to abrogate or subvert or suspend the Constitution by use of force, or show force or by any other unconstitutional means shall be guilty of high treason.""The minister said the Sharif govt would also submit a review petition in the apex court, challenging its verdict on reserved seats.Lawyer-politician Moiz Jaferii said a political party couldn't be banned other than through a reference to the apex court. He termed the govt's move ""ridiculous and desperate posturing by a regime exposed day by day for its lack of legitimacy and popular appeal"".Activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir said the coalition govt's pursuit of a ban on PTI ""not only shows how weak PML-N is but also how desperate and frustrated the establishment has become"".Last week, the govt authorised Pakistan's ISI to intercept phone calls and messages ""in the interest of national security"" amid nationwide outrage over the allegedly unbridled powers the spy agency already enjoys.","The governing coalition's step is seen as an attempt to block PTI from becoming the single largest party in the National Assembly.

""The apex court gave relief to the PTI which had not even asked for it,"" the minister said.Referring to the time when the then-government decided to dissolve the assemblies during the no-confidence motion against Khan in 2022, the minister said the ruling alliance has also decided to move a case against the then-prime minister, then-president Alvi and then National Assembly deputy speaker Qasim Suri.""Whether it was the foreign funding case, the riots of May 9, or the manipulation of the cipher saga, in which the former Pakistani ambassador to the US, Asad Majeed - who authored the cipher - clarified that there was ""no threat"", the PTI continued decrying that the country was in danger.Meanwhile, Khan has been jailed for nearly a year in a series of cases which he claimed were orchestrated to prevent his return to power in February elections.The Supreme Court, however, granted the PTI more seats in parliament in a landmark ruling last week, while Khan's illegal marriage conviction was overturned on Saturday.","Pakistan government has decided to ban the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ), alleging that the former ruling party was involved in number of anti-state activities.
