Iran’s conflict with Israel puts US ally Jordan on edge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/irans-conflict-with-israel-puts-us-ally-jordan-on-edge/articleshow/109350716.cms,"Tough words

Gaza war

Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel and the prospect of escalating hostilities has threatened to embroil Jordan, a key Western ally and a country regarded by Gulf states as pivotal to their own security.When the Islamic Republic fired a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel on Saturday night, Jordan helped shoot down some that flew over its capital Amman, with Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi saying the kingdom saw the projectiles as posing “a real danger” to its territory.While he was quick to say the country would do the same if Israel were to use Jordanian airspace to attack Iran, the move led to a torrent of online abuse in the Islamic Republic. State media reposted a missive on social-media site X calling Jordanian King Abdullah II “a traitor” and pro-Tehran accounts shared memes of the king dressed in an Israel Defense Forces uniform.It was all too much for Jordanian authorities, which summoned the Iranian ambassador to demand an end to the insults.Jordan had already seen weeks of protests in Amman in support of Hamas, the Iran-backed militia that Israel has been fighting in Gaza since October, and the Palestinians who have died or had their lives upended by the conflict. Chants and slogans like ‘all of Jordan is Hamas’ and ‘Jordanian day of rage’ alarmed security officials and led to multiple arrests. Authorities have also been on high alert after Iran-backed Iraqi militia leader Abu Ali Al-Askary vowed to flood Jordan with enough weapons for 12,000 fighters to march on Israel.All of this has raised concerns about Jordan’s stability in both Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, and both Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed have offered their support to King Abdullah.“For Saudi Arabia, Jordan is a bulwark against further Iranian expansion” in the Levant, said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court.It all adds up to a conundrum for Jordan, a kingdom of some 11 million people, many of them descendants of Palestinian refugees, sandwiched between Iraq, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the Palestinian territory of the West Bank. Jordanian officials feel caught between an Israeli government which they openly describe as a threat to regional peace and security, and a confrontational Iranian regime eager to leverage the increasingly unpopular war in Gaza to expand its influence and reach.Jordan’s not the only Arab country trying to balance countering Iran with rising pro-Palestinian sentiment. Saudi Arabia has downplayed reports it also shot down some of the projectiles fired by Iran. The country and the UAE said they were both deeply concerned about the regional political situation following Saturday’s attack, but neither of them explicitly condemned Iran.“Our message to Iran is that your problem is with Israel and any attempt to insult Jordan is unacceptable and categorically rejected,” Safadi told the state-owned Mamlaka (Kingdom) TV on Sunday.But he had equally tough words for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who he accused of attacking Iran’s consulate in Syria on April 1 to provoke confrontation with Tehran, distract the world and alleviate the pressure he’s come under from Washington to end the war in Gaza.“The root cause of tension in the region is Israel’s aggression in Gaza and the measures it has taken to kill the chances for peace,” he said.Speaking to US President Joe Biden on Sunday, King Abdullah warned that any Israeli retaliation to Iran’s missile and drone attacks will expand the conflict in the region. “Jordan will not allow for a regional war to unfold on its land,” the king said in a statement.Amman’s balancing act has grown increasingly precarious as the war in Gaza has entered its seventh month. Authorities have allowed almost daily protests outside the Israeli Embassy and have not permitted the Israeli ambassador to return since November, but have resisted popular demands that it sever ties with Israel completely.Jordan is dependent on billions of dollars of aid from the US and the European Union and enjoys longstanding and deep military and security cooperation with the West, limiting its ability to distance itself from the Jewish state.“Jordan’s economy runs on life support from external donors,” said Ziad Daoud, Chief Emerging Markets Economist at Bloomberg Economics. In addition to almost continuous aid from the International Monetary Fund since 1989 and $1.45 billion a year in US assistance, the country is the third-largest recipient of support from oil-rich Gulf states.Jordan faces a similar dilemma when it comes to Iran. While the kingdom was one of the first Arab countries to warn about what it called Iran’s expansionist agenda in the aftermath of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, it has tried to maintain diplomatic ties with the Islamic Republic.But the growing power of Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria and their involvement in the smuggling drugs and weapons to and through Jordan prompted the king to declare in July that his country was “confronting systematic attacks at its borders” by these groups.And now several current and former Jordanian officials fear Iran and its allies, including Hamas, considered a terrorist organization by the US and European Union, are using the war in Gaza to destabilize Jordan and further their agendas.“The ongoing war in Gaza has been an opportunity for different attempts to infiltrate the Jordanian space,” said Samih al-Mayateh, Jordan’s former information minister.","Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel and the prospect of escalating hostilities has threatened to embroil Jordan, a key Western ally. The move led to a torrent of online abuse in the Islamic Republic.

Pakistan court disposes of Imran Khan's wife Bushra Bibi's plea seeking transfer to Adiala jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-court-disposes-of-imran-khans-wife-bushra-bibis-plea-seeking-transfer-to-adiala-jail/articleshow/109345939.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani high court on Tuesday disposed of a petition filed by Bushra Bibi seeking her transfer to the high-security Adiala jail , where her husband, former prime minister Imran Khan is incarcerated. The Islamabad High Court disposed of her petition as her lawyers failed to turn up before the court.Bushra Bibi is currently jailed at Bani Gala - 71-year-old Khan's home in Islamabad - which was turned into a sub-jail since she was sentenced in the 'un-Islamic nikah' case in February.The Islamabad High Court (IHC) disposed of a petition filed by the 49-year-old former first lady, seeking her transfer from Bani Gala to the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, the Dawn newspaper reported.Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb disposed of the petition after Bushra Bibi's lawyers failed to appear before the courtQuestioning why Bushra Bibi's counsels were absent, Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb said, ""If they had won this case, Bushra Bibi would have gone to [Adiala] jail, but they (lawyers) themselves do not want Bushra Bibi to go to jail.""Bushra Bibi's counsel, Usman Gill, who reached the court after the plea's disposal, was asked by the judge to file an application to restore it.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party founder Khan has been lodged in the Adiala Jail since August last year.Earlier in January, Khan and Bushra Bibi were sentenced to 14 years in jail in the Toshakhana corruption case about the illegal sale of state gifts, which the former premier received during his term.Following the verdict, Bushra arrived at Adiala Jail to surrender to the authorities and was subsequently taken into custody by the National Accountability Bureau.However, she was moved to her Bani Gala residence after it was declared a sub-jail in a late-night notification, the report said.While their sentences in the Toshakhana corruption case were suspended by the IHC, Bushra Bibi remains in custody in the 'un-Islamic' marriage case, while Khan also remains incarcerated in other cases.Bushra Bibi's shifting has been under discussion for weeks as the former first couple has denied submitting any application to declare their residence a sub-jail.Almost a week after her arrest, she challenged the residence's status as a sub-jail, urging the IHC to let her complete her 14-year sentence in Adiala Jail.In a subsequent hearing, the court was informed by the authorities of Adiala Jail that Bushra Bibi could not be shifted to the prison due to a ""security threat"".On Monday, Bushra Bibi moved the IHC seeking a medical examination at the Shaukat Khanum Hospital, which is owned by Khan's charitable organisation, after alleging that she was poisoned while incarcerated at Bani Gala.Earlier this month, during the hearing of a corruption case in the Adiala jail Khan informed the judge that there had been an attempt to poison his wife and said that she had marks on her skin and tongue as a side effect of the ""poisoning"".Since his removal from power in a no-confidence motion in April 2022, the cricketer-turned-politician has been convicted in at least four cases, including the cipher (secret diplomatic communication) case.",Bushra Bibi is currently jailed at Bani Gala - 71-year-old Imran Khan's home in Islamabad.

What Nasa said on mystery object that hit Florida man's home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-nasa-said-on-mystery-object-that-hit-florida-mans-home/articleshow/109346399.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Nasa has verified that a mysterious object that penetrated the roof of a Florida resident's home last month was indeed space debris from the International Space Station. The incident, which happened in Naples on March 8, involved a cylindrical object crashing into Alejandro Otero's home while he was on vacation.The space agency collected the object for examination at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, where it was identified as a metal support once used to mount old batteries on a cargo pallet destined for disposal.This pallet had been jettisoned from the space station back in 2021, with expectations that it would completely disintegrate upon re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. However, a fragment survived and resulted in the damage to Otero's property.The debris, composed of the metal alloy Inconel, weighed 1.6 pounds and measured 4 inches in height and approximately 1.5 inches in diameter. Nasa has committed to investigating why this piece of debris was not fully destroyed in the atmosphere and will update its engineering models to better manage such risks in the future.""I was shaking. I was completely in disbelief. What are the chances of something landing on my house with such force to cause so much damage,"" Otero told WINK television. He expressed his relief that no one was injured during the incident.The report from Ars Technica pointed out that while the batteries were owned by Nasa, they were mounted on a pallet structure launched by Japan's space agency, which could lead to complexities in liability claims. Instances of manmade space debris reaching Earth are rare but not unprecedented, with notable cases including parts of a SpaceX Dragon capsule landing in Australia and fragments of Skylab falling in Western Australia.This recent event has also reignited discussions about space agencies' responsibilities to minimize risks associated with space debris, especially following critiques of China's handling of its Long March rockets' re-entry.",A piece of space debris landed on the roof of a Florida resident's home last month.

Singh had been sentenced to death after being convicted of spying and orchestrating a series of bomb attacks that killed 14 people in Lahore and Faisalabad in 1990.Sarabjit was killed two months after India executed Afzal Guru, convicted as the mastermind of the 2001 Parliament attack,On December 14, 2018, a sessions court in Lahore acquitted Tamba and Munir of the charge of killing Singh and ordered their release after all witnesses retracted their statements.Tamba, 45, was unmarried and lived with his brothers.

Many Iranians feel 'uncertainty' for the future

Experts monitoring developments in Iran have raised concerns about Israel 's potential response to the weekend's drone and missile attacks, warning both sides could quickly launch a dangerous tit-for-tat exchange.General Hossein Salami, the commander of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, said on Iranian state TV that Tehran had entered a ""new equation"" in which any Israeli attack on its ""interests, assets, officials, or citizens would be reciprocated from its own territory.""General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, warned Iran's ""response will be much larger than tonight's military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.""As if to underline the government's position, a mural in Tehran's Palestine Square was unveiled overnight, with the phrase ""The next slap will be fiercer"" written in both Persian and Hebrew.Hamed Mohammadi, an Iranian journalist based in Berlin, told DW Iran is relying on military means to demonstrate its strength, after what Tehran has called an Israeli strike on its Damascus consulate earlier this month killed seven high-ranking officers.""Anti-Israel sentiment is in the DNA of Islamic Republic. With this approach, the level of conflict in the region has incrementally risen,"" he said. ""The recent escalation marks a new phase, effectively giving Israel a green light to take more aggressive actions, even within Iranian territory.""But among the general population, many Iranians appear to be worried about the threat of the escalating conflict and preparing for potential Israeli attacks on Iranian cities.On Sunday, DW's Persian department observed multiple social media posts showing long lines at gas stations, with Iranians anticipating a sudden increase in gas prices. Supermarkets were filled with people buying up essential items such as rice and bread, and Iran's currency, the rial, briefly plunged to a record low against the US dollar on the open market, according to foreign exchange monitoring site Bonbast.Soroush Mozaffar Moghadam, a writer and Iranian affairs analyst who was forced to leave Iran after anti-government protests began in 2022, was in contact with people inside Iran via social networks for hours after the attack. He told DW that many appeared to be confused, fearful, anxious and hesitant.""Among those I spoke with, the consequences of Israel's military attack on Iran, pessimism about the future, and uncertainty were prevalent emotions,"" he said, adding that he believes most Iranians don't back the official policies of the Islamic Republic but feel powerless to effect change.""One individual I spoke with, a young man, stressed that he sees no prospects for his future and believes the majority of people cannot affect the aggressive behavior of the government,"" said Moghadam.","Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander says any Israeli attack on its interests would be reciprocated from its own territory.

Jordan: Interception was self-defense, not normalization

Not-so-secret

defense

deal with US

Jordan's actions aimed at 'preventing regional escalation'

The criticism began almost immediately. Over the weekend, Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel . Neighboring Jordan played a significant role in fending off the attack and it is likely that it shot down Iranian projectiles.""The Jordanian king dropped missiles on his citizens to protect Israel,"" one widely shared post on X, formerly known as Twitter, said.The words were posted alongside a picture of drone wreckage in the Jordanian city of Karak, which is not very far from the border with Israel. The post, in Arabic, was later changed to be less negative of Jordanian leadership, which is known to repress criticism.""Jordan following the money as usual,"" said one commentator.""It's irresponsible of them to shoot missiles down over their own cities,"" another added.A lot of anti-Jordan misinformation also appeared online, including posts that falsely accused the Jordanian king and his daughter, a pilot, of personal involvement. Others suggested that Jordanians had died when flaming wreckage fell on them. Though there was wreckage, the Jordanian government reported no injuries and specific videos showing wreckage turned out to be of oil tankers on fire several weeks earlier.There were even accusations that the Jordanian government had signed a secret deal with Israel and the US to allow them access to Jordanian airspace.Beyond the misinformation, others pointed to what they saw as the hypocrisy of their own government and those of other Arab countries that have condemned Israel's military campaign in Gaza, called for a cease-fire and say they support the Palestinian cause. But then, their critics pointed out, they also helped defend Israel against Iran. Popular anger has largely targeted Jordan, but also the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.One in five people in Jordan, including the queen, are of Palestinian descent, and the Palestinian cause is close to the hearts of many. Many see the Jordanian military cooperation as a betrayal.""I'm very upset at how Jordan defended Israel,"" said Hussein, a political activist who would only give his first name because criticizing the Jordanian government can be dangerous. ""A lot of people here do not accept this. We don't support Iran and see it as a major cause of what is happening in Gaza. But we do stand with any action that deters Israel in Gaza.""""It was a difficult night,"" said Maryam, a university student in Amman, who lives near one of the areas where wreckage fell; she too only gave her first name. ""Iran isn't popular in Jordan in general. But I reject Jordan's interception of Iranian missiles, and its involuntary involvement in this war.""This conflict is ""bringing vulnerable US allies like Jordan to a most unwelcome position between a rock and a hard place,"" Tuqa Nusairat, an expert on US policy in the Middle East for the Atlantic Council, wrote in an analysis on the weekend.The Jordanian government issued a statement saying it had acted in self-defense, intercepting objects that entered Jordanian airspace ""because they posed a threat to our people and populated areas.""What happened over the weekend ""could never be framed as defending Israel, but rather defending Jordanian sovereignty and airspace,"" Mahmoud Ridasat, a retired senior officer and military expert based in the Jordanian capital Amman, told DW.After all, he explained, you cannot know where a drone or missile is going to land. And with regard to Israeli media reports that were celebrating Jordanian military cooperation, he said, ""this is nothing more than Israeli propaganda.""Jordanian society is relatively divided on this issue, explained Tahani Mustafa, senior Palestine analyst at the Brussels-based think tank International Crisis Group. ""And you can understand why,"" she told DW. ""People don't really know much about the details of Jordan's economic, diplomatic and security relationships with the US and Israel because that sort of thing is not often reported here.""The countries are closer than many may be aware of. Mustafa suspected that the ""secret deal"" some Jordanians were debating refers to the 2021 defense cooperation agreement between the US and Jordan, which was condemned by activists because it bypassed parliamentary approvals.The controversial agreement allows US forces, vehicles and aircraft to enter and move around Jordan freely. As a 2023 report to US Congress put it, it ""formalizes years of US-Jordanian military cooperation, which became more visible at the start of [operations] against the [extremist group] Islamic State.""""But it was only when the first protests about Gaza began, that a lot of people started saying Jordan should be kicking the Americans out,"" Mustafa told DW.Over the past few weeks, thousands of locals have gathered regularly outside the Israeli embassy in Amman to protest the situation in Gaza. They have also called for a reversal of the 1994 Israel-Jordan peace treaty.Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, is fairly certain this weekend's action and the ensuing upset won't destabilize the Jordanian government though.""Clearly different sides are going to present it in different ways,"" he told DW. ""But ultimately the Jordanians can justify their actions because drones and missiles were flying through their airspace. The Jordanian response was aimed more at preventing regional escalation than tightening up any strategic alliance with Israel.""What would be far more destabilizing and dangerous for Jordan and many other nations in the Middle East is a regional war, Barnes-Dacey pointed out.""I think that means that they [the nations] are all going to continue to work to stop incidents that could provoke an unravelling,"" he concluded. ""They will keep talking to the Iranians, they will continue to try to de-escalate. And if there are more security incidents, if there are further attacks over their airspace, the Jordanians will likely do the same again.""","Many in Jordan angry about support for Israel.

High-tech defense: How Israel managed to 'confuse' Iranian drones and missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/high-tech-defense-how-israel-managed-to-confuse-iranian-drones-and-missiles/articleshow/109311061.cms,"NEW DELHI: Israeli intelligence 'jammed GPS signals to confuse attackers' - as the IDF claims to have intercepted '99% of Iran's drones and missiles'.Israeli defense and intelligence forces successfully thwarted an attack by a swarm of Iranian drones and missiles by jamming GPS signals, according to reports. The interference disrupted the guidance systems of Iranian weapons aimed at Israeli targets, averting potential harm and demonstrating Israel 's technological prowess in countering regional threats.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deployed sophisticated jamming technology to neutralize the GPS capabilities of Iranian drones and missiles, preventing them from accurately reaching their intended destinations. The strategic maneuver was a proactive measure to safeguard Israeli territory and populations from potential attacks orchestrated by Iran, a Daily Mail report said.Speaking on the operation, an IDF spokesperson affirmed the effectiveness of the GPS jamming technique, saying, ""Israeli intelligence was able to identify and neutralize the imminent threat posed by Iranian drones and missiles through precise jamming of their GPS signals."" The spokesperson emphasized Israel's commitment to defending its sovereignty and ensuring the safety of its citizens against hostile actions.Iran launched the assault in retaliation for what it believes was an Israeli attack on its embassy compound in Syria on April 1, which resulted in the deaths of top Revolutionary Guards commanders. This incident was part of ongoing tensions fueled by the war in Gaza and conflicts with Iran's allies in the region.Despite the launch of over 300 missiles and drones targeting Israel, the damage was relatively minor. The majority of these were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system, with additional support from the US, Britain, France, and Jordan.The most significant injury reported in Israel was to a 7-year-old child, who suffered from shrapnel wounds.But, how far escalation can be avoided remains in question. President Joe Biden has told Israel the United States will not join any Israeli retaliation, a US official said.However, Israel is still weighing its response and will ""exact the price from Iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us"", Israeli minister Benny Gantz said on Sunday.While specific details about the operation remain classified, Israeli officials reiterated their determination to confront any threats to national security head-on.(With inputs from agencies)",The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deployed sophisticated jamming technology to neutralize the GPS capabilities of Iranian drones and missiles.

Anti-Israeli protesters disrupt traffic on Brooklyn Bridge in New York,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/anti-israeli-protesters-disrupt-traffic-on-brooklyn-bridge-in-new-york/articleshow/109346152.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic escalation of tensions in New York City, hundreds of anti-Israeli protesters wreaked havoc in downtown Manhattan on Monday, effectively shutting down traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge. The protesters, part of a larger national movement responding to the ongoing conflict in Gaza , converged on the bridge around 3:45pm, leading to immediate traffic disruptions and a swift response from the NYPD.The chaotic scene saw protesters, some of whom burned American flags, storm the Manhattan-bound side of the bridge, as documented in social media posts and live footage. NYPD officers, equipped in riot gear, quickly moved in to contain the situation, resulting in the arrest of at least two dozen participants. According to a protester on the scene, the police adopted a zero-tolerance policy, blocking further access to the bridge and preventing the demonstrators from advancing toward City Hall, a New York Post report said.The protest in New York is part of a series of nationwide demonstrations, including disruptions at major transportation hubs like Chicago’s O'Hare International Airport and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. These protests have seen roads to arrivals and departures blocked, causing significant delays and forcing some passengers to walk past the protests with their luggage.Back in New York, the protest escalated into the evening with reports of smoke billowing outside One Police Plaza around 7:30pm, as protesters lit flares and chanted pro-Palestinian slogans. This marks yet another significant protest in the city following previous demonstrations that have targeted Midtown holiday festivities and other iconic locations.The NYPD, under the command of Deputy Chief Timothy Beaudette, who clashed with protesters on the bridge, continues to monitor the situation closely. These protests have strained city resources and have highlighted the growing domestic responses to international conflicts.Meanwhile, pro-Palestinian demonstrators disrupted traffic on San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, causing significant delays for commuters entering the city on Monday morning.The California Highway Patrol shut down both directions of the famous bridge when officers worked to redirect vehicles hemmed in by the group of protesters. The demonstrators, numbering in the dozens, displayed a banner proclaiming ""Stop the World for Gaza.""This ongoing unrest underscores the deeply polarized opinions surrounding the Israeli actions in Gaza and the broader implications for communities across the US. As tensions continue to simmer, city officials and law enforcement are bracing for more disruptions, keeping a vigilant watch over these increasingly frequent and volatile demonstrations.","Hundreds of anti-Israeli protesters wreaked havoc in downtown Manhattan on Monday, effectively shutting down traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge.

And it's time for us to seek support. There's fear,"" Thanedar said.""Many Hindu communities are under fear. And what we've seen is that local law enforcement hasn't taken enough action. We have not seen any suspects, any arrests, or any resolution to these issues,"" he added.Congressman Thanedar further said, “That (attack incident) has created a lot of fear among the Indian American community, among the Hindu community, and a lot of misinformation has been spread. And so the purpose of this resolution is to bring that to the attention of Congress and to the Biden administration.”Another Indian-American, Vijay Sadhawal, who was present at the event, expressed his concern over the 'bias of the American media' towards American Hindus and said that the resolution is just the starting point to raising the voice of the Hindu community.""We have enough Hindu Americans in the country that can actually be a steering rod, so to speak, for protecting our minority rights in this country. And yet we see that the instruments of democracy, like the media, civil society, and NGOs, seem to be biased against the Hindu population of the United States,"" he said.Notably, Thanedar also drew similarity between the recent attacks on Hindu temples in US with the attacks on Kashmiri Pandits after the 1990s during the interaction and said that he ""sees a tremendous similarity that serves the institutions.""""The striking similarity is that if I take you back to Kashmir, which is a Hindu minority region in another democracy, and I look back at the events that took place in late last century, especially after the 1980s and beyond, I see a tremendous similarity that serves the institutions that in the democracy are intended to protect you,"" he said.Earlier, Congressman Thanedar introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives condemning Hinduphobia, anti-Hindu bigotry, hate, and intolerance which has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.The resolution that Congressman Shri Thanedar introduced earlier last week reads that Hindu Americans face stereotypes and disinformation about their heritage and symbols, and have been the targets of bullying in schools and on college campuses, as well as discrimination and hate speech.Congressman Thanedar also said that he expects bipartisan support in Congress as it reflects American values, adding that he will continue to fight against racism.",Indian-American Congressman Shri Thanedar on Monday raised the issue of continuous attacks against Hindu temples across the United States.

Charges against Trump and Jan 6 rioters at stake as Supreme Court hears debate over obstruction law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/charges-against-trump-and-jan-6-rioters-at-stake-as-supreme-court-hears-debate-over-obstruction-law/articleshow/109334299.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Supreme Court on Tuesday is taking up the first of two cases that could affect the criminal prosecution of former President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn his election loss in 2020. Hundreds of charges stemming from the Capitol riot also are at stake. The justices are hearing arguments over the charge of obstruction of an official proceeding.That charge, stemming from a law passed in the aftermath of the Enron financial scandal more than two decades ago, has been brought against 330 people, according to the Justice Department. The court will consider whether it can be used against those who disrupted Congress' certification of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump.The former president and presumptive nominee for the 2024 Republican nomination is facing two charges in the case brought by special counsel Jack Smith in Washington that could be knocked out with a favorable ruling from the nation's highest court. Next week, the justices will hear arguments over whether Trump has ""absolute immunity"" from prosecution in the case, a proposition that has so far been rejected by two lower courts.The first former US president under indictment, Trump is on trial on hush money charges in New York and also has been charged with election interference in Georgia and with mishandling classified documents in Florida.In Tuesday's case, the court is hearing an appeal from Joseph Fischer, a former Pennsylvania police officer who has been indicted on seven counts, including obstruction, for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to keep Biden, a Democrat, from taking the White House. Lawyers for Fischer argue that the charge doesn't cover his conduct.The obstruction charge , which carries up to 20 years behind bars, is among the most widely used felony charges brought in the massive federal prosecution following the deadly insurrection.Roughly 170 Jan. 6 defendants have been convicted of obstructing or conspiring to obstruct the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, including the leaders of two far-right extremist groups, the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. A number of defendants have had their sentencings delayed until after the justices rule on the matter.Some rioters have even won early release from prison while the appeal is pending over concerns that they might end up serving longer than they should have if the Supreme Court rules against the Justice Department. That includes Kevin Seefried, a Delaware man who threatened a Black police officer with a pole attached to a Confederate battle flag as he stormed the Capitol. Seefried was sentenced last year to three years behind bars, but a judge recently ordered that he be released one year into his prison term while awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling.The high court case focuses on whether the anti-obstruction provision of a law that was enacted in 2002 in response to the financial scandal that brought down Enron Corp. can be used against Jan. 6 defendants.Fischer's lawyers argue that the provision was meant to close a loophole in criminal law and discourage the destruction of records in response to an investigation. Until the Capitol riot, they told the court, every criminal case using the provision had involved allegations of destroying or otherwise manipulating records.But the administration says the other side is reading the law too narrowly, arguing it serves ""as a catchall offense designed to ensure complete coverage of all forms of corrupt obstruction of an official proceeding,"" including Fischer's ""alleged conduct in joining a violent riot to disrupt the joint session of Congress certifying the presidential election results.""Smith has argued separately in the immunity case that the obstruction charges against Trump are valid, no matter the outcome of Fischer's case.Most lower court judges who have weighed in have allowed the charge to stand. Among them, US District Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee, wrote that ""statutes often reach beyond the principal evil that animated them.""But US District Judge Carl Nichols, another Trump appointee, dismissed the charge against Fischer and two other defendants, writing that prosecutors went too far. A divided panel of the federal appeals court in Washington reinstated the charge before the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case.While it's not important to the Supreme Court case, the two sides present starkly differing accounts of Fischer's actions on Jan. 6. Fischer's lawyers say he ""was not part of the mob"" that forced lawmakers to flee the House and Senate chambers, noting that he entered the Capitol after Congress had recessed. The weight of the crowd pushed Fischer into a line of police inside, they said in a court filing.Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Matt Gaetz of Florida and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia are among 23 Republican members of Congress who say the administration's use of the obstruction charge ""presents an intolerable risk of politicized prosecutions. Only a clear rebuke from this Court will stop the madness.""The Justice Department says Fischer can be heard on a video yelling ""Charge!"" before he pushed through a crowd and ""crashed into the police line."" Prosecutors also cite text messages Fischer sent before Jan. 6 saying things might turn violent and social media posts after the riot in which he wrote, ""we pushed police back about 25 feet.""More than 1,350 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. Approximately 1,000 of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury or judge after a trial.","The justices are hearing arguments over the charge of obstruction of an official proceeding. That charge, stemming from a law passed in the aftermath of the Enron financial scandal, has been brought against 330 people.

Local authorities confirmed the recovery of a fourth body from the incident.FBI agents boarded the cargo ship Dali for authorized law enforcement activities related to the crash, as stated by an FBI spokesperson.The Key Bridge Unified Command announced the discovery of the fourth victim's body on Monday. Divers identified a construction vehicle, inside of which they found the body. The identity of the victim has not been disclosed at the family's request.The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge into the Patapsco River on March 26 claimed the lives of six individuals who were working on the bridge at the time of the accident. The investigation will delve into whether the crew of the Dali was aware of any significant issues with the ship's systems before departing the port, according to the Washington Post.Safety investigators have retrieved the ship's ""black box"" recorder, which contains crucial data such as position, speed, radar information, and bridge audio.Baltimore officials have engaged two law firms for potential legal action against the ship's owner, charterer, and operator. The vessel, flying the flag of Singapore, is owned by Grace Ocean Pte Ltd, managed by Synergy Marine Group, and chartered by Maersk. The National Transportation Safety Board informed Congress that interviews with key crew members have been conducted as part of the probe.Efforts to clear the wreckage and restore traffic in the Baltimore port are ongoing. It is expected that constructing a new bridge will be a lengthy process, with temporary channels set up to facilitate the movement of certain vessels.When the incident occurred, the Dali was departing Baltimore bound for Colombo, Sri Lanka, with a crew of 21 and two pilots. This is not the first time the ship has been involved in an accident, having collided with a quay in Antwerp, Belgium, in 2016.Inspections in Chile revealed propulsion and machinery deficiencies in June 2023.

MAE SOT: A stream of people, some fearing air strikes, queued at a border crossing to flee Myanmar early on Friday, a day after the strategically vital town of Myawaddy near Thailand fell to anti-junta resistance that is gaining strength.The loss of the town robs the junta, already grappling with an economy in free fall, of vital earnings from border trade while strengthening rebel groups such as the Karen National Union (KNU) that led the assault on Myawaddy, analysts say.""I am afraid of air strikes,"" said Moe Moe Thet San, a Myawaddy resident who crossed to Thailand with her son, who is about five years old.""They caused very loud noises that shook my house,"" added the 39-year-old mother, one of those gathered at the single fully-operational border crossing at Mae Sot, who said the sound of bombs drove them to leave home, fearing for their safety.""That's why I escaped here. They can't bomb Thailand,"" she added.Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara is set to visit Mae Sot, just across the Moei River from Myawaddy, on Friday to assess matters after Myanmar's embattled junta lost yet more territory in the latest round of fighting.Junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun told Myanmar media some of its troops had surrendered because they were accompanied by their families and talks with Thailand for their return were in progress.He did not respond to a telephone call from Reuters to seek comment.Myanmar has been in turmoil since 2021, when the powerful military deposed an elected civilian government, triggering widespread protests it sought to crush with brutal force.Simmering anger against the junta turned into a nationwide armed resistance movement that is now increasingly operating in coordination with established ethnic rebel groups to challenge the military across large parts of the Southeast Asian nation.About 200 Myanmar military personnel withdrew on Thursday to a bridge linking to Mae Sot after the KNU said it had taken control of Myawaddy.But the Myanmar military may still seek to mount a counter-attack, supported by its air force, to regain the town, said Dulyapak Preecharush, an associate professor of Southeast Asian Studies at Bangkok's Thammasat University.""So there is a question about possible intensification of fighting in the coming days,"" he told Reuters.As fighting in Myanmar intensified, the numbers crossing to Mae Sot from Myawaddy doubled this week to about 4,000 a day.On Thursday, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said the fighting in Myanmar should not spill into his country's airspace.In an interview with Reuters last week, Srettha said the Myanmar junta was ""losing strength"", as he pushes to open talks with the regime.Thailand, which says it is keeping neutral in the Myanmar conflict and can accept up to 100,000 people displaced by it, has pursued engagement, including aid deliveries, with its neighbour since Srettha came to power last August.Yet the junta could find itself stretched further after the Arakan Army rebel group warned it would renew an offensive in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine.Arakan Army chief Twan Mrat Naing warned residents of the Rakhine cities of Sittwe and Kyauk Phyu to relocate ahead of ""a decisive battle"", the group said in a statement.One of Myanmar's most powerful ethnic armed forces, the Arakan Army was part of Operation 1027, a major assault by three rebel groups last October that seized significant territory from the junta.","Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara is set to visit Mae Sot, just across the Moei River from Myawaddy.

Why the green onion has become a contentious poll issue in the South Korean elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/why-the-green-onion-has-become-a-contentious-poll-issue-in-the-south-korean-elections/articleshow/109105265.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Ahead of South Korea's crucial parliamentary election on April 10, green onions have unexpectedly taken center stage, overshadowing traditional hot topics like foreign policy and the economy. So contentious is the humble allium that it has been banned from polling stations due to concerns of electoral interference, sparking a wave of discussions among voters and election officials.The green onion frenzy began on March 18 when current president Yoon Suk Yeol visited a grocery store in Seoul to check consumer prices.His comment on the reasonable price of green onions, at 875 won ($0.65), stirred controversy as local media revealed the store had discounted the vegetable for his visit.This incident led to online backlash and opposition parties using green onions as a symbol of the president being out of touch with the people.As early voting commenced, photos of voters holding green onions at polling stations flooded social media, accompanied by hashtags like #earlyvotedone and #greenonions875won. Despite the high early voting turnout, reaching 13.8 million out of 44.2 million eligible voters, the National Election Commission (NEC) intervened by prohibiting green onions from polling stations to prevent any potential election interference .The NEC's decision faced ridicule online, with more onion memes circulating on social media platforms. This ban prompted a rush for green onion-themed memorabilia to circumvent the restrictions. Some voters expressed defiance by planning to wear green onion headbands on election day, criticizing the NEC's ban as arbitrary and condescending.One voter, Hyun Jung, voiced her disapproval, questioning the ban's logic and suggesting other items like colored clothing or luxury bags could also be restricted. Despite the ban on green onions, election officials will decide on-site whether green onion-themed items are acceptable, according to an NEC official.Political analyst Yum Seung-yul criticized the NEC's decision, deeming it too hastily implemented. While the ban is within the NEC's discretion, it has raised questions about the reasoning behind prohibiting green onions and the potential impact on voters' freedom of expression .As the election day approaches, the green onion controversy continues to stir debate and creativity among voters. The unexpected focus on this humble vegetable has become a symbol of political discourse and resistance against perceived restrictions on electoral participation.The green onion saga highlights the intersection of political symbolism and everyday life, illustrating how a seemingly mundane item can spark a nationwide conversation during a crucial electoral period. The outcome of the parliamentary election remains uncertain, but one thing is clear – green onions have secured their place in South Korea's political landscape, serving as a reminder of the power of everyday objects in shaping public discourse.",Green onions have taken center stage ahead of South Korea's crucial parliamentary election.

""I am in no doubt that the claimant's submission that his costs liability should be subject to a reduction of 50-60% is unsupportable,"" stated Judge Sir Peter Lane, dismissing Harry's claim as ""without merit.""Sir Peter also rejected Harry's application to appeal the decision, describing it as ""frankly hopeless"" and indicating there were ""no compelling reasons"" to reconsider the case. Despite this, the Duke may still approach the Court of Appeal directly.The court's ruling emphasized that the Home Office's handling of Harry's case, although flawed in certain procedural aspects, did not impact the overarching conclusion that Harry ""comprehensively lost.""

‘Asian Nato’: How Aukus expansion could checkmate China in Indo-Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/asian-nato-how-aukus-expansion-could-checkmate-china-in-indo-pacific/articleshow/109291818.cms,"What is Aukus?

China's concerns

NEW DELHI: Launched in 2021, the Aukus pact, designed to support Australia’s acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines and foster cooperation in emerging technologies, may soon expand to include new partners like Japan . According to defense chiefs from the US, Australia, and the UK, discussions are underway to potentially involve other nations in projects focused on quantum computing, AI, and hypersonics.This could significantly reshape regional security dynamics and complicate China’s strategic calculations, a report in South China Morning Post said.While Beijing has voiced concerns about the expansion, viewing it as an attempt by Japan to align more closely with Western powers, analysts suggest that broader participation in Aukus could help deter China’s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific . The inclusion of additional partners such as South Korea, Canada, and New Zealand is also under consideration, which could enhance the pact’s capabilities in defense technology and intelligence sharing, the SCMP report said.The Aukus expansion aims to integrate more countries into a network that could counterbalance China’s influence and actions in the region, particularly in contentious areas like the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.The Aukus pact, a trilateral security partnership between Australia, United Kingdom and UK, has significantly shaped the security architecture of the Indo-Pacific region. This strategic alliance, which some strategic experts have likened to Asian Nato , initially aimed to enhance Australia's naval capabilities through the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines and to foster collaboration among the US, the UK, and Australia in high-tech fields such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and hypersonics. Recent developments suggest an impending expansion that could further complicate China's ambitions in the region.Recent statements from the defense chiefs of the Aukus nations have hinted at an expansion of the pact to include cooperation with additional countries, notably Japan, in what is termed as Pillar II of the alliance. This phase focuses on cutting-edge technological cooperation, signaling a broader scope than initially perceived. The involvement of Japan, a technologically advanced nation with existing hypersonic and cybersecurity programs, would mark a significant strategic shift, enhancing the collective defense capabilities of the Aukus countries.China has reacted to these developments with apprehension. Beijing has criticized Japan’s potential participation, urging Japan to reflect on its historical military actions and accusing it of contributing to regional militarization. This reaction underscores the tense dynamics and the stakes involved, as Aukus appears to be solidifying a coalition of like-minded nations that could challenge China's influence in the Indo-Pacific.The expansion of Aukus could potentially include South Korea, Canada, and New Zealand, bringing a diverse set of capabilities and strengths to the pact. This would not only enhance the technological and military interoperability among these nations but also serve as a counterbalance to China’s military posture, especially in contentious zones like the South China Sea and near Taiwan.Experts suggest that this expansion could transform Aukus from a focused military collaboration into a broader strategic alliance, shaping security outcomes across the Indo-Pacific.","The Aukus pact, a trilateral security partnership between Australia, United Kingdom and UK, has significantly shaped the security architecture of the Indo- Pacific region.

Thanks to an international coordinated effort in which the United Kingdom participated in almost all of these missiles were intercepted, saving lives not just in Israel, but in neighbouring countries like Jordan as well,"" Sunak stated to broadcasters."" The RAF sent additional planes to the region as part of our existing operations to counter Daesh in Iraq, Iraq and Syria. I can confirm that our planes shot down a number of Iranian attack drones.

'Forgot' Hamas attack: Israel-Ireland spar over Irish PM's first speech condemning war in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/forgot-hamas-attack-israel-ireland-spar-over-irish-pms-first-speech-condemning-war-in-gaza/articleshow/109288003.cms,"Ireland rejects snub

NEW DELHI: Israel foreign ministry issued a harshly worded rebuke of new Ireland Prime Minister Simon Harris, claiming that he referred to the war in Gaza in his first public speech but left out the mention of October 7 Hamas attack.""Even after the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, and even after the war crimes of the Hamas terrorists, there are those in Ireland who insist on being on the wrong side of history,"" said the ministry.The ministry also claimed that Harris aligns with Irish foreign minister Martin, who plans to provide further support to terrorism by issuing a legal opinion alongside 'legal arm of Hamas' South Africa.Israel's foreign ministry affirmed that the nation will continue to protect its citizens according to international law and persist in its efforts to secure the release of the 133 Israelis held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for the past six months, as well as to dismantle 'terrorist organisation Hamas so that October 7th never happens again.'The Irish government dismissed criticism from the Israeli foreign ministry regarding Harris' inaugural speech, saying that the Taoiseach has consistently maintained an impartial stance when addressing the conflict, including denouncing the abduction of the hostages and demanding their release.According to The Irish Times, Harris' spokesperson stated, ""By any fair analysis Ireland has always condemned the atrocity Hamas committed on October 7th and called for hostages to be released. The Taoiseach has repeatedly said it.""In his brief remarks about Gaza during his first speech as Taoiseach on Tuesday, Harris reportedly condemned the Hamas attack on October 7th, which claimed approximately 1,170 lives but also denounced Israel's disproportionate military response, which has resulted in over 33,000 fatalities.Harris in his speech said, ""In Gaza, we are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe and seeing innocent children, women and men being starved and slaughtered. We have not been silent on the unforgivable terrorist actions of Hamas on 7th October, nor can we be silent on the disproportionate reaction of the Israeli Government. As a country, we will play our part in helping bring about a ceasefire and a lasting peace. Later this week I will travel to Brussels and deliver those messages to Europe on behalf of the Irish people.""","Israel foreign ministry issued harshly worded rebuke of new Ireland Prime Minister Simon Harris, claiming that he referred to the war in Gaza in his first public speech but left out the mention of October 7 Hamas attack.
