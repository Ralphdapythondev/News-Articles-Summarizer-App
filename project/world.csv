"Japan's Kishida tells his ruling party he will not run in its September leadership vote, NHK says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/japans-kishida-tells-his-ruling-party-he-will-not-run-in-its-september-leadership-vote-nhk-says/articleshow/112509714.cms,"TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has notified his governing party executives that he will not run in the upcoming party leadership vote in September, meaning Japan will have a new prime minister, Japan's NHK public television and other media reported.Kishida was elected president of his governing Liberal Democratic Party in 2021 and his three-year term expires in September.His drop out of the race means a new leader who wins the party vote will succeed him as prime minister because the LDP controls both houses of parliament.Kishida, stung by his party's corruption scandals, has suffered dwindling support ratings that have dipped below 20%.Kishida was set to explain his decision in a press conference later Monday.Local election losses earlier in the year eroded his clout, and LDP lawmakers have voiced the need for a fresh face ahead of the next general election.Since the corruption scandal broke, Kishida has removed a number of Cabinet ministers and others from party executive posts, dissolved party factions that were criticized as the source of money-for-favor politics, and passed a law tightening political funds control law. But support for his government has dwindled.The scandal centers on unreported political funds raised through tickets sold for party events. It involved more than 80 LDP lawmakers, mostly belonging to a major party faction previously led by assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Ten people - lawmakers and their aides - were indicted in January.",Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has notified his governing party executives that he will not run in the upcoming party leadership vote in September.

'No tax on tips': Trump and Harris find common ground as a populist stance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-tax-on-tips-trump-and-harris-find-common-ground-as-a-populist-stance/articleshow/112509670.cms,"What is tips on tax?

Who stands to gain?

How will it impact?

In the fiercely contested US presidential campaign, an unexpected point of agreement has surfaced between Trump and Harris, the belief that workers' tips should not be taxed.While the move is seen as a populist, it has drawn criticism for being economically irresponsible.Trump introduced his proposal during a rally in June. Harris, his Democratic opponent, voiced her support for the idea this weekend, prompting the Trump campaign to dub her ""copy cat Kamala.""Both candidates disclosed their proposals in Nevada, a critical battleground state with the highest proportion of waiting staff in the country, according to the US Labor Department.In the United States, tipping culture is unique, with customers expected to tip generously for services ranging from take-out coffee to cocktails.A typical tip is between 15 and 20 percent of the bill at restaurants. Some states still allow employers to pay tipped workers as little as $2.13 per hour, provided their tips bring their earnings up to the federal minimum wage of $7.25.Given the major portion ofservice-sector wages that come from tips, the proposal to eliminate taxes on tips has wide appeal, although it is not favored by many economists and think tanks.""There's no particular reason that, in general, people in the service industry should pay lower taxes than somebody on the factory line or somebody that's providing nursing care,"" Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), told AFP.""This creates an equity issue where two people doing similar work that the market has deemed is worth the same amount of money pay different levels of taxes. That doesn't make any sense.""There are about four million tipped workers in the United States, roughly 2.5 percent of all employment, as estimated by the Yale University Budget Lab.This group includes waiting staff, bartenders, and hairdressers. Tipped workers typically have lower weekly wages, and the Budget Lab estimates that around 37 percent of them did not pay any federal income tax in 2022.Once tax credits are considered, the situation becomes more complex, according to Goldwein from CRFB. The United States offers several refundable tax credits, allowing eligible taxpayers to reclaim these credits even if they do not earn enough to pay income taxes.""In other words, just because you pay no taxes doesn't mean you won't benefit from a plan to exempt taxes from tips.""The financial impact remains uncertain: While some congressional proposals target income tax alone, others aim to exempt tips from both income and payroll taxes.The candidates themselves have been unclear on the specifics. According to the Tax Foundation, any such change could cost at least $107 billion over the next decade, with other estimates suggesting even higher figures.Despite the political appeal of eliminating taxes on tips, some analysts caution that it may not be sound policy. They argue that this move could unfairly shift the tax burden onto workers who don't receive tips. Additionally, it might lead to tipping spreading to new professions, potentially resulting in a much larger financial impact than initially anticipated.","US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris agree that workers' tips should not be taxed.

Israel Weapons Sale: US approves $20 billion weapons sale to Israel despite rights activists' concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-approves-20-billion-weapons-sale-to-israel-despite-rights-activists-concerns/articleshow/112508742.cms,"The Biden administration approved more than $20 billion package for new weapons sales to Israel, defying the pressure from rights activists to halt arms deliveries due to the death toll in Gaza. The weapons delivery will take years to complete.In a notification to Congress, the state department announced the approval of a sale consisting of 50 F-15 fighter jets to Israel for $18.82 billion.Along with the jets, Israel will purchase nearly 33,000 tank cartridges, up to 50,000 explosive mortar cartridges, and new military cargo vehicles. The F-15 jets, equipped with advanced radar and secure communications gear, will significantly upgrade Israel's existing fleet when they begin arriving in 2029.""The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defence capability,"" the state department stated in its notice on the F-15s, which Boeing produces.Regarding the tank cartridges, the United States emphasised that the sale ""will improve Israel's capability to meet current and future enemy threats, strengthen its homeland defence, and serve as a deterrent to regional threats.""Congress retains the authority to block weapons sales, but doing so is challenging. Human rights groups and some progressive members of Biden's Democratic Party have urged the administration to halt arms sales to Israel, condemning the high number of civilian casualties in the Gaza conflict . Josh Paul, who resigned from the state department last year over Gaza policy, criticised Israel's actions.""Authorizing billions of dollars in new arms transfers effectively provides Israel a carte blanche to continue its atrocities in Gaza and to escalate the conflict to Lebanon,"" said Paul, who now works at the Middle East rights group, Dawn.Recently, rescuers in Gaza, controlled by Hamas , reported that 93 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school housing displaced Palestinians. Israel claimed it was targeting militants at the school. While Biden administration officials expressed concern over civilian deaths, they did not comment on whether US-supplied weapons were used in the strike.Earlier in May, Biden paused a shipment to Israel that included 2,000-pound bombs and cautioned against a large-scale assault on Rafah in southern Gaza, where many displaced Palestinians reside.However, the administration has not halted other weapons deliveries and dismissed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s complaints in June that the US was delaying shipments.The Gaza war initiated on October 7, when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1,198 people, predominantly civilians, as per an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Militants also captured 251 individuals, with 111 still held captive in Gaza, including 39 whom the military reports are deceased.Israel’s military response in Gaza has led to at least 39,929 deaths, according to the territory's health ministry, though the statistics do not specify the number of civilians versus militants killed.In a recent address to Congress, which was boycotted by numerous Democrats, Netanyahu urged the US to expedite military aid, arguing that it would ""dramatically expedite an end to the war in Gaza.""","50 F-15 fighter jets, 33,000 tank cartridges, up to 50,000 explosive mortar cartridges, and new military cargo vehicles will be delivered to Israel in 2029.

Recently, the Iraqi government introduced a draft measure in the parliament that would lower the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to just 9. This implies that child marriage would become acceptable once more. This is perceived by activists and demonstrators in Iraq as a serious danger to women's rights since it leaves the young girls, who are only nine years old, open to forced marriage and ""child rape.""The legal age of marriage varies from nation to nation throughout the world.While some, like the United Kingdom, have set the age at 18 for both men and women, underage marriage is still permitted with parental approval. In India, the legal age of marriage is fixed at 18 for men and 21 for women. This year, the bill to raise the age at which women may marry expired. A number of nations allow child marriages. Any age of child can get married with the approval of their parents or father figure. Let's examine a few nations in the world for the highest and lowest marriage age.With few exclusions that vary by nation, most governments permit marriages between people under the age of 18. In 2010, 158 nations declared that the legal minimum age for women to marry without parental approval or consent was 18. Males are legally allowed to marry in 180 countries at the age of 18, while males can marry with parental approval in 105 countries. Many EU nations have strengthened their marriage rules in recent years, outlawing unions between people under the age of 18 or demanding judicial consent. Very similar legislation has also been passed by other emerging nations.","The legal age of marriage varies from nation to nation throughout the world.

DDos Attack: What is DDoS attack? Cyber assault Elon Musk says disrupted Donald Trump's interview on X,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-ddos-attack-cyber-assault-musk-says-disrupted-trumps-interview-on-x/articleshow/112482599.cms,"Understanding the DDoS attack

Impact and next steps

Tech billionaire Elon Musk reported a ""massive DDoS attack "" on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter , that disrupted the highly anticipated interview with former US President Donald Trump . The interview was scheduled for this morning, marking Trump's return to the platform ahead of the US Presidential elections in November.Musk addressed the situation on X, saying, ""There appears to be a massive DDoS attack on X .Working on shutting it down. Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later."" The interview failed to air at its scheduled time, leaving users and viewers in limbo.A DDoS attack, or Distributed Denial-of-Service attack, is a type of cyber assault that disrupts normal traffic to a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. The aim is to make the target inaccessible to legitimate users by exhausting its resources.Cybersecurity firm Fortinet describes a DDoS attack as a form of cybercrime where multiple compromised computer systems are used to generate excessive traffic toward the target. These exploited systems can include a variety of devices connected to the internet, all working in concert to overwhelm the target and prevent access to services.As explained by IT service management firm Cloudflare, DDoS attacks are highly disruptive, causing websites and servers to become slow, unresponsive, or completely offline. These attacks can last anywhere from hours to days, causing significant damage and often requiring extensive recovery efforts.Microsoft has also warned about the dangers of DDoS attacks, noting that they can lead to service delays, data breaches, and exploitation of security vulnerabilities. During a DDoS attack, multiple compromised computers flood a single target, effectively pushing out legitimate users and disrupting services.The disruption of the Trump interview highlights the vulnerabilities that even major platforms like X face in the face of coordinated cyber attacks. Musk's quick acknowledgment of the issue and his plan to limit live listeners while posting the conversation later shows an effort to mitigate the damage.While the full impact of the attack is still being assessed, this incident underscores the growing threat of cyberattacks in the digital landscape, particularly as high-profile events and personalities draw the attention of malicious actors.As of now, Musk and his team at X are working to resolve the situation, with updates expected as the platform recovers from the attack. In the meantime, the postponed interview with Trump remains one of the most talked-about events, further amplified by the cyberattack that attempted to silence it.","Elon Musk reported a ""massive DDoS attack "" on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

How case unfolded

Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal and the process for his court martial was initiated, the army said on Monday.It is for the first time in the country's history that court martial has been initiated against a former intelligence chief, according to Dawn .“Complying with the orders of Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry, was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” a press statement by Pakistan army said further adding that ""the process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody.”“Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), under provisions of Pakistan Army Act,” the release further said.Hameed was regarded as close aide to Imran Khan, who appointed him to lead the ISI during his tenure as prime minister. Khan was removed from office in 2022 through a vote of no-confidence, which he claims was orchestrated by the military, though the military denies this allegation.In 2022, Hameed was one of the six senior-most generals whose names were forwarded by general headquarters to Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif for consideration for the two top military positions. He, however, chose to seek early retirement and submitted his resignation to the high command, as per sources.The Supreme Court, in its order dated November 14 last year, had said that the allegations against Hameed were of ""extremely serious nature"" and ""would undermine the reputation of the federal government, the armed forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.”This came after the management of Top City, a private housing scheme, made allegations against the former spy-master, accusing him of orchestrating a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.The petition was filed on May 12, 2017, and it said that Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials conducted a raid on Top City's office and Moeez’s residence, seizing valuables such as gold and diamond jewelry and money in connection with an alleged terrorism case, Dawn reported.It also alleged the involvement of former ISI officials Irtaza Haroon, Sardar Najaf, Wasim Tabish, Zahid Mehmood Malik, and Mohammad Munir ""in the illegal takeover of the housing society”.In March, a court placed retired naib tehsildar Najaf Hameed, Hameed's brother, under a 14-day judicial remand.Najaf and other co-accused had sought pre-arrest bail in an FIR filed with the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) in Rawalpindi.The FIR alleged that former minister for mineral resources Hafiz Ammar Yasir had acquired properties worth billions of rupees through intermediaries.In April, the military had reportedly established an inquiry committee to investigate allegations of authority misuse involving the former ISI head.","Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal.

This 90-minute showdown, expected to be held in Philadelphia, marks a pivotal moment in an unpredictable presidential campaign that has already seen significant twists and turns.The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Although the exact format and ground rules are still being finalized, it is likely that the event will proceed without a live audience, according to sources familiar with the plans.Notably, Trump had proposed three debates with major networks - September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with NBC, and September 25 with ABC. However, Harris has agreed to participate only in the September 10 debate with NBC. Harris has not yet provided reasons for declining the other proposed dates.This announcement follows Trump's initial agreement to debate President Joe Biden on the same date, an arrangement made months ago. However, after Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Trump questioned the validity of that commitment with Harris, leading to uncertainty over whether the debate would take place.Recent events, including Biden's exit and an assassination attempt on Trump, have drawn renewed attention to the presidential race, which had initially been shaping up as a repeat of the 2020 election. The upcoming ABC debate is expected to serve as a critical moment in the campaign's final stretch leading up to the election.Trump has also indicated his willingness to engage in additional debates with Harris, proposing events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. However, the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these additional debates. NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate on September 25, but Harris has not committed to participating.

': What Vivek Ramaswamy said on violence against Hindus in Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cautionary-tale-for-what-vivek-ramaswamy-said-on-violence-against-hindus-in-bangladesh/articleshow/112509529.cms,"Vivek Ramaswamy , a former Republican presidential candidate, strongly denounced the targeted violence against Hindus in Bangladesh following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from office.In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Ramaswamy expressed his concern about the current situation, stating that ""a quota conflict created to rectify the wrongs of rape and violence in 1971 is now leading to more rape and violence in 2024.""Ramaswamy criticized the quota system implemented in Bangladesh after the country's bloody war for independence in 1971, which aimed to allocate jobs in the civil service based on specific social groups, such as war veterans, rape victims, and underrepresented residents.""The targeted violence against Hindus in Bangladesh is wrong, it's concerning, and it's a cautionary tale for victimhood-laced quota systems,"" Ramaswamy said.He argued that the system proved to be a disaster, leading to protests in 2018 that temporarily scrapped most of the quotas. However, the quota system was reinstated this year, triggering further protests that ultimately led to the toppling of the government and the prime minister's exile.The former presidential candidate also highlighted the concerning trend of radicals targeting Hindu minorities amidst the chaos. He emphasized that ""bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood"" and suggested that the United States should learn from the lessons unfolding in Bangladesh.""Here's what happened: Bangladesh fought a bloody war for its independence in 1971. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi civilians were raped and murdered. It was a tragedy, and it was rightly mourned. But in its aftermath, Bangladesh implemented a quota system for jobs in their civil service: 80% of the jobs were allocated to specific social groups (war veterans, rape victims, underrepresented residents, etc.), and only 20% were allocated based on merit,"" he said in a post on X.""The quota system proved to be a disaster. In 2018, protests led Bangladesh to scrap most of the quotas, but the victim-patrons fought back…and the quota system was reinstated this year. That triggered more protests which toppled the government, and the prime minister fled. Once chaos begins, it can't easily be reined in. Radicals are now targeting Hindu minorities. A quota conflict created to rectify the wrongs of rape and violence in 1971 is now leading to more rape and violence in 2024. Bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood. It's hard not to look at Bangladesh and wonder what lessons we would do well to learn right here at home,"" he added.Since the ousting of Sheikh Hasina's government on August 5, Bangladesh has been experiencing a volatile political situation. According to reports from two Hindu organizations in the country, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad, members of minority communities in Bangladesh have faced at least 205 incidents of attacks across 52 districts. As a result, thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have been attempting to seek refuge in neighboring India to escape the ongoing violence.","Vivek Ramaswamy criticized the quota system implemented in Bangladesh after the country's bloody war for independence in 1971.

When Kamala Harris announced her presidential campaign in 2019, she held a press conference at her alma mater Howard University to explain her decision. As one of the most prestigious historically black colleges and universities ( HBCU ), Howard has played a crucial role in shaping Harris' political outlook. Here's a look at Howard's history and influence in American academia and polity.Howard was founded in 1867 in Washington, DC, and named after General Oliver Otis Howard, head of the post-Civil War Freedmen's Bureau, who got the US Congress to appropriate funds for the school.The university is largely supported and funded by the American govt but is privately controlled. After being established, the university's main goal was to provide quality higher education for blacks, although it has always been open to students of any race and colour.Howard played a crucial role in the American civil rights movement. Alain Locke, chair of Howard's department of philosophy, authored the seminal work The New Negro (1925) - an anthology of essays and poetry on African-American art and literature - that helped spur the Harlem Renaissance. It was at Howard in the 1940s that students pioneered protest tactics like 'stool-sitting' where they would occupy stools in local cafeterias that denied service to African-Americans. The term "" Black Power "" is also believed to have been coined at Howard by Stokely Carmichael.Given Howard's influence in black polity and society, it has over the years attracted heavy-weight American politicians. Calvin Coolidge was the first sitting US prez to speak at Howard in 1924. In 1965, then president Lyndon B Johnson outlined his plans for civil rights legislation to the graduating class in Howard when the voting rights bill was still pending in the US Congress. All of this has made Howard the creme de la creme of HBCUs.Howard boasts of a long list of graduates who went on to achieve influential positions in education, society and governance. These include senator Edward William Brooke, playwright Amiri Baraka, Nobel laureates Ralph Bunche and Toni Morrison. Kamala Harris, on becoming vice-president, became the first Howard and HBCU graduate to hold the office.In 1975, Jeanne Sinkford became the first female dean of any American dental school when she was appointed as the dean of Howard University's school of dentistry.Previously known as Freedmen's Hospital, it has served the African-American community in the Washington metropolitan area since 1862. Howard University Hospital is the only teaching hospital located on the campus of an HBCU.The oldest black sorority of which Harris is a member, Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) was founded in 1908 at Howard as a support network for black women. AKA is also one of the 'Divine Nine' or the 'Pan-Hellenic Council' - the most powerful Black sororities in US. AKA is a huge force for Harris, having mobilised campaign funds and voters when Biden picked Harris as his VP nominee in 2020. It can be counted on to do the same this time for Harris's presidential bid.","Howard was founded in 1867 in Washington, DC, and named after General Oliver Otis Howard, head of the post-Civil War Freedmen's Bureau.

JD Vance: JD Vance backed this startup: 'We had to work in 128-degree heat',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-backed-this-startup-we-had-to-work-in-128-degree-heat/articleshow/112504855.cms,"JD Vance's association with the startup

A JD Vance-backed startup is under the heat as former employees of the company have come out in the open complaining about the appalling working condition. The startup -- AppHarvest -- was an indoor farming hub to grow fruits and vegetables. JD Vance was a board member, an early investor and advocated for the app claiming that it was making a big difference in the world.CNN investigation found out that the working condition was terrible with the temperature reaching triple digit and the workers toiling.Complaints were filed with the Department of Lavor and a state of regulator between 2020 and 2023 stating that the workers were not given sufficient water breaks or proper safety equipment. The greenhouses were brutal with the temperatures soaring above 100 degrees. Some staff experienced heat exhaustion and injuries.“I think about the hottest that I experienced was around 128 degrees,” former staff Morgan told CNN. “A couple days a week, you’d have an ambulance show up and you seen people leaving on gurneys to go to the hospital.”Vance joined the board of directors in March 2017 and exited in 2021 as he launched his political career. But even after his exit, he remained an investor and supporter of the company. And in 2023, the company declared bankruptcy with debts of hundreds of millions of dollars.With the new allegations over the working condition, Vance's spokesperson told the CNN that the Ohio Senator was not aware of the workplace policies when he was on the board. “Like all early supporters, JD believed in AppHarvest’s mission and wishes the company would have succeeded.” AppHarvest’s chief restructuring officer, Gary Broadbent, told CNN: “AppHarvest has no continuing operations and is not in a position to respond.”After the success of Hillbilly Elegy when Vance was being seen as a working class's writer, he was hired by AOL co-founder Steve Case to invest in underserved markets. Vance would invest $150,000 in AppHarvest, with other investors chipping in $50,000 each -- this was the deal. Vance's own venture capital firm Narya had AppHarvest as one of its earliest publicly disclosed investments.","Former employees of AppHarvest have come out in the open complaining about the appalling working condition.

Bo is an insider, a family friend

After Donald Trump's live stream with YouTuber Adin Ross where the former US president said that his youngest son Barron told him to come on Adin's livestreaming, speculations are rife whether 18-year-old Barron Trump is influencing father's social media game. DailyMail confirmed the speculations and said it's not only Barron but also his influencer friend Bo Loudon whom the president is listening a lot these days.Barron is 18 and Bo is 17 and these two tech-savvy teens have been briefing Donald Trump about the landscape of streamers and YouTubers.

For example, when Trump sat for a two-hour-long interview with Elon Musk Monday night, Bo's X account posted live. ""Share to make it go viral,"" all posts of Bo's has this message attached.And there's more: when Trump forgave the student loan debt of 50,000 disabled, when Trump wrote a check to the family of a fallen soldier -- the tone is subtle but can not be missed.Donald Trump also shared a post of Bo thanking him which again Bo shared -- making it clear that the 17-year-old is playing a role more than the son's friend in the coming election.Bo was at Trump's residence during the Adin Ross streaming and posted how nice Donald Trump was, how many times he asked him whether he got a photo with him.Bo has close to 350,000 followers across Instagram, TikTok and X where he has been campaigning for Gen-Z stands with Trump.

Can you imagine her and him negotiating, or even standing together? It is, the whole concept is ridiculous. She is terrible. She's terrible. But she's getting a free ride.

Trump has explicitly singled out Venezuela and Congo in this diatribe, but lately his tirade has included rest of the world, including all of Africa and Asia.The allegation, which could potentially endanger legal immigrants and foreigners in the US and is ostensibly aimed at stirring up his MAGA base into disenfranchising legal voters in the upcoming elections, went uncontested by Musk, whose own immigration story is sketchy.Musk's brother Kimbal told a business conference in 2013 that the siblings lacked lawful immigration status when they began business in the US and investors ""when they did fund us, they realized that we were illegal immigrants.” According to the Los Angeles times, Musk, who was present at the conference, added with a laugh, “I’d say it was a gray area.” Both Musk and Trump expressed support for legal immigration during the conversation.About the only issue on which Musk mildly contested Trump was climate change and electric cars, both of which the former President is skeptical about. ""Even to create your electric car and create the electricity needed for the electric car, you know, fossil fuel is what really creates that, at the generating plants,"" Trump lectured Musk when the topic came up.Musk pushed back, saying he wasn't claiming ""the house is on fire immediately,"" but ""it's probably better to move there faster than slower … without vilifying the oil and gas industry and causing hardship in the short term.""""The biggest threat is not not global warming where the ocean's going to rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 400 years and you'll have more oceanfront property right...the biggest threat is nuclear warming,"" Trump responded, before rambling incoherently about the danger from nuclear weapons and proliferation.The conversation included some typically bizarre Trump moments -- often celebrated by his fans as unscripted asides -- including a reference to the latest Time magazine cover featuring Kamala Harris with the headline ""Her Time"" and a story on ""The Swiftest Vibe Shift in Modern Political History.""""She is terrible. She's terrible, but she's getting a free ride. I saw a picture of her on TIME magazine today. She looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live. It was a drawing and actually looked very much like our great first lady, Melania … She didn't look like Kamala,"" Trump said in curious remarks that will likely irk both.While Musk transparently declared his opposition to a Harris presidency and support for Trump, he nevertheless said in post after the interview that he would also be happy to host Harris on X Spaces. Harris has not given any interviews or held any press conferences since she replaced Biden on top of the Democratic ticket, inviting ridicule from Trump, who has called her ""dumb"" ""incompetent"" and afraid to face the media or go off-script.The Harris campaign though mocked the X spaces event in a statement, saying, ""Donald Trump's extremism and dangerous Project 2025 agenda is a feature not a glitch of his campaign, which was on full display for those unlucky enough to listen in tonight during whatever that was on X.com. Trump's entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself — self-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a livestream in the year 2024.""The X Spaces conversation, for which more than a million listeners tuned in, brought Trump back to the platform after he and Musk had fallen out. In a 2022 post, Musk had said ""Trump would be 82 at end of term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America."" Trump in turn had insulted the Tesla honcho saying, “When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it’s electric cars that don’t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he’d be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, ‘drop to your knees and beg,’ and he would have done it.”Musk himself has acknowledged being a left of center Democrat before he was put off by the liberal wokism and excessive government regulations, and on Monday, he threw himself fully behind Trump, saying the US would be in ""massive trouble"" with a Kamala administration, and ""it's essential that you (Trump) win for the good of the country.""","Former President Donald Trump made a glitchy but convivial return to the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. In a two hours engagement that began 40 minutes late after technical issues, Trump ladled out his usual talking points replete with falsehoods.

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.

Hameed has also been accused of multiple violations of the Pakistan Army Act after retirement.“Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City (housing society) case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” the military said in a statement.The management of Top City had accused the former ISI chief of orchestrating a raid on its offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan. As per the petition, filed in May 2017, Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials had taken away valuables, including gold and diamond ornaments and money, in connection with a purported terrorism case.Consequently, according to ISPR, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Hameed under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act.“In addition, multiple instances of violation of Pakistan Army Act post-retirement have also been established,” the statement said.Hameed came into the global spotlight when he was filmed drinking tea in the lobby of a Kabul hotel shortly after the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, forcing the former ruler, Ashraf Ghani, to flee.His transfer out of his ISI post had become a bone of contention between the former PM and the then army chief, Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, which ultimately ended in Imran’s ouster from office in April 2022. Hameed had sought early retirement from the army in Nov 2022.Hameed was among the six senior-most army generals who were nominated by General HQ as a potential candidate for the two top military offices, chief of army staff (COAS) and chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC).

Polio is transmitted through contaminated water or food, or contact with an infected person. Treatment includes bed rest, pain relievers, rehabilitation and portable ventilators.Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO 's regional director of polio eradication was cited by Al-Jazeera as saying that the challenge exists in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. ""This is where there's a lot of militancy, insecurity and community hostility and frustration towards the government because of conflict and a lack of services,"" Jafari said.Over 50 districts across Pakistan are detecting the virus, he said.Compounding to the challenges is the fact, says the WHO official that not only is the polio programme being targeted but also security personnel that are guarding the teams ""because they become soft targets when they are in the community.""At least 102 polio field workers, officials and security personnel have been killed, including at least six in campaigns carried out this year, the Al Jazeera report cited.Meanwhile, the latest victim is an 11-month-old infant from Qila, in Balochistan who has succumbed to paralysis caused by the wild poliovirus.The child from Qila who displayed symptoms of paralysis on July 17, is among the five cases detected in the district. Other cases in Balochistan have been reported in Chaman, Quetta, Zhob, Dera Bugti, and Jhal Magsi as per a report in the Balochistan Post.In Balochistan, the situation is compounded by a recent history of inadequate vaccination coverage and persistent misconceptions about the vaccine. Despite numerous vaccination campaigns, efforts have struggled to keep pace with the actual number of infections, the publication stated.","On August 10, the 14th polio case of the year was reported from Qilla Saifullah district of Balochistan boosting the number of poliovirus cases in the country to 13 for the year 2024.

According to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. FBI director Christopher Wray said the ""dangerous murder-for-hire"" plot allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook. In April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source. In early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a ""finger gun"" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant stated that the intended victims would be ""targeted here"", meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official. Merchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.

The plot by Asif Merchant

A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant , has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil. Prosecutors in Brooklyn announced criminal charges against Asif Merchant, accusing him of travelling to New York for the purposes of trying to hire a hitman for the assassinations. The plot was disrupted before it could be carried out.The document did not name any potential target but CNN reported that former president Donald Trump and other current and former US government officials might be the targets of the plot.Trump was shot at by Thomas Crooks at a Pennsylvania rally last month in which the shooter was killed. This attempt was unrelated to the life threat that Trump had from Iran. US officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump.Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement: ""The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.""Merchant said, as revealed by the document, that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified ""party"" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to ""finalize"" the plan and leave the United States.In mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a ""political person"".Merchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.On June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance. Merchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12 when law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country.(With agency inputs)","A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil.

"Pakistan plans to regulate VPN, Opposition-civil society cry foul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-plans-to-regulate-vpn-opposition-civil-society-cry-foul/articleshow/112257788.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others, according to PTA Chairman Maj General (retd) Hafeezur Rehman, Samaa TV reported.During the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat meeting, Rehman said that once the policy is in place, only whitelisted VPNs will be operational in Pakistan, while all others will be blocked.In 2024, the use of VPNs among local internet users surged significantly, primarily to access X, which has been banned in the country since February 19, according to the Samaa TV report. Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy. For a nation largely comprising very young people, this would be an unmitigated disaster as it could have repercussions that may spill over generations. Already struggling to compete, the Pakistpeople will end up being deprived of even more chances to realise their potential and contribute positively on a global scale,"" the editorial said.According to the website DataReportal, there were 71.70 million active social media user identities in Pakistan in January 2024. YouTube is Pakistan's most-used social media platform in 2024 with a potential ad audience of 71.70 million. Data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 54.38 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Pakistan at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 38.9 per cent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.Meanwhile, according to Samaa TV, the Pakistan government has made previous attempts to regulate VPN usage by requiring registration, but these efforts have not resulted in significant action. In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions. The PTA also passed VPN regulations in 2010, but enforcement has been inconsistent.","Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others.
