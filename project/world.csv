"Hurricane Beryl claims 5 lives, weakens to category 4 but remains 'extremely dangerous'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hurricane-beryl-claims-5-lives-weakens-to-category-4-but-remains-extremely-dangerous/articleshow/111445652.cms,"Hurricane Beryl , an unusually powerful storm for this early in the season, has left a path of destruction across the southeastern Caribbean as it moves towards Jamaica. The hurricane, which weakened to a Category 4 on Tuesday, is still considered ""extremely dangerous"" and is expected to pass near or over Jamaica on Wednesday, according to forecasters.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued a hurricane warning for Jamaica, urging residents to be in their safe place by nightfall and prepared to shelter in place throughout Wednesday. NHC director Michael Brennan warned of life-threatening wind, storm surge, rain, and flash flooding. Prime Minister Andrew Holness advised Jamaicans to stock up on essential supplies and secure their homes and critical documents.Beryl has already claimed at least five lives, with three fatalities in Grenada, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and one in Venezuela. Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell reported that the island of Carriacou, which was directly hit by the storm's eye, has been nearly cut off, with extensive damage to houses, telecommunications, and fuel facilities.The formation of such a powerful storm this early in the Atlantic hurricane season is highly unusual, and experts attribute it to the influence of ocean temperatures on hurricane development and intensity. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned that Beryl ""sets an alarming precedent for what is expected to be a very active hurricane season.""UN climate chief Simon Stiell, whose family's property on Carriacou was damaged, highlighted the role of climate change in driving disasters to unprecedented levels of destruction. As Beryl continues its path towards Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, with hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings also issued for parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the region has been bracing for the impact.","Hurricane Beryl weakened to a Category 4 on Tuesday, but is still considered ""extremely dangerous"" Forecasters warn of life-threatening wind, storm surge, rain, and flash flooding.

Debate with Trump: Biden reveals why he 'nearly fell asleep on stage',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/debate-with-trump-biden-reveals-why-he-nearly-fell-asleep-on-stage/articleshow/111445398.cms,"CNN Presidential Debate: President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump

NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden admitted on Tuesday that his performance during the presidential debate was not his best.In a recent campaign event held in McLean, Virginia, Biden attributed his subpar showing to jet lag, having traveled through approximately 100 time zones during two overseas trips earlier in June.Despite facing increasing questions about his 2024 reelection bid following the lacklustre debate, Biden addressed the issue.Speaking without a teleprompter, he admitted, ""I didn't have my best night, but the fact is that you know, I wasn't very smart.""He explained that he had decided to travel around the world a couple of times before the debate, resulting in fatigue.""Didn't listen to my staff and came back and nearly fell asleep on stage,"" Biden said. ""That's no excuse but it is an explanation."" Prior to the debate, he had travelled to France and Italy during two separate trips within a two-week period.After attending the Group of Seven summit in Bari, Italy, he flew overnight to appear at a fundraiser with former President Barack Obama in Los Angeles on June 15 before returning to Washington the following day. Biden then spent six days at Camp David preparing for the June 27 debate.Although White House officials have attributed Biden's halting debate performance to a cold, he did not mention being sick during Tuesday's fundraiser. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Tuesday revealed that one-third of Democrats believe Biden should end his reelection bid following the debate. However, the poll also indicated that no prominent elected Democrat performs better than Biden in a hypothetical matchup against Trump .The two-day poll found that both Trump, 78, and Biden, 81, maintain the support of 40% of registered voters, suggesting that Biden's support has not diminished since the debate. Election Day is scheduled for November 5.","US President Joe Biden admitted on Tuesday that his performance during the presidential debate was not his best.

"Category 4 Storm: Hurricane Beryl, churning toward Jamaica, threatens Haiti and Dominican Republic",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hurricane-beryl-churning-toward-jamaica-threatens-haiti-and-dominican-republic/articleshow/111445096.cms,"KINGSTON: Hurricane Beryl barreled toward Jamaica as a powerful Category 4 storm on Tuesday, threatening to dump rain on parts of Hispaniola after leaving at least three people dead on smaller islands in the eastern Caribbean.Tropical storm conditions were expected on parts of the southern coasts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Tuesday evening, according to an advisory from the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).""Beryl is expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands Wednesday night and Thursday,"" the NHC said. A hurricane warning is in effect for both places.In Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, which is in the grips of entrenched gang violence and an ongoing humanitarian crisis, strong winds took residents by surprise on Tuesday afternoon.The country's southwestern peninsula could get 4-8 inches (10-20 cm) of rain, with as much as 12 inches in some places, the NHC said. New Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille warned residents to take precautions and stay alert.The unusually early hurricane, whose rapid strengthening scientists said was likely fueled by human-caused climate change , is expected to still be a hurricane when it passes near Jamaica and the Cayman Islands later this week.Beryl, the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, felled power lines and unleashed flash floods across smaller islands.The storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines especially hard, according to Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.""The hurricane has come and gone, and it has left in its wake immense destruction,"" he said. On one island in the Grenadines archipelago, Union Island, 90% of homes had been ""severely damaged or destroyed,"" he added.The prime minister confirmed one death and said more fatalities could be confirmed in the coming days.In a video briefing on Tuesday, Grenada's prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, stressed that Carriacou and Petite Martinique, two of the three islands that make up the country, bore the brunt of the natural disaster.""The situation is grim. There is no power. There is almost complete destruction of homes and buildings,"" he said, citing impassable roads due to downed power lines and destroyed fuel stations crimping supplies.Mitchell said at least two deaths were attributed to the impact of Beryl so far.The hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph), is currently located about 360 miles (579 km) east-southeast of the Jamaican capital of Kingston, according to the NHC.The Miami-based hurricane center estimates that the massive weather system is moving toward the west-northwest at a speed of 22 mph (35 kph).In Jamaica, men hauled fishing boats out of the water and tied them down in preparation for the hurricane's arrival, while others noted there was still time to prepare on Tuesday morning.""We Jamaicans don't take things seriously,"" said Standford Pusey, as he showed off items secured with plastic tarps.In Fort-de-France on the French Caribbean island of Martinique, north of St. Vincent, a video shared on social media showed heavy flooding in the streets as locals attempted to clear away debris.In addition to Haiti's southern coast, the NHC also posted a hurricane watch for Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, dotted with beach resorts popular with tourists.Ahead of the storm's approach expected Thursday night, Mexico's defense ministry said the army, air force, and national guard had activated emergency response protocols in the three Yucatan states, with 120 shelters opened and nearly 4,900 troops on guard on the peninsula.The unusually early timing and rapid intensification of the storm is partly due to warmer ocean temperatures, scientists say.Climate change likely contributed to Beryl's early formation, while also driving how quickly it intensified, according to scientists surveyed by Reuters, which could provide an unsettling preview of future storms.Global warming has helped push temperatures in the North Atlantic to record highs, said Christopher Rozoff, an atmospheric scientist at the US-based National Center for Atmospheric Research. The warmer waters lead to more evaporation, which fuels more intense hurricanes featuring higher wind speeds, he said.Beryl jumped from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm in under 10 hours, according to Andra Garner, a Rowan University meteorologist. That marked the fastest intensification ever recorded before September, the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, she added.","Beryl is the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.

Boris Johnson makes surprise late move to avert Tory wipeout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-polls-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-conservative-party-labour-party/articleshow/111445606.cms,"Boris Johnson made an unexpected campaign appearance on Tuesday night to urge Conservative voters to deny Labour a landslide victory at the UK general election , a last throw of the dice by Rishi Sunak ’s Tories to try to prevent huge losses that are expected at Thursday’s vote.Making his first public appearance of the election campaign in an unscheduled speech in central London, the former premier said: “A Labour government prepares to use a sledgehammer majority to destroy so much of what we have achieved.”Johnson, who is not a Tory candidate at the election, repeated Tory campaign attack lines claiming Labour leader Keir Starmer would use a “super-majority” to put up taxes and allow uncontrolled immigration, allegations the opposition party denies.He urged former Tory voters not to vote for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party, who he called “Kremlin crawlers” and “Putin-istas,” a reference to remarks the right-wing party’s leader made about admiring Russian President Vladimir Putin .Labour is on course to win this week’s public vote with a large majority, an outcome that would end 14 years of Conservative rule in Britain. So far, 10 of 11 so-called MRP polls carried out during the campaign project the opposition party to take more seats than it did in Tony Blair ’s landslide victory in 1997.The intervention will prove controversial ahead of the final day of campaigning on Wednesday, and will likely provoke criticism of Sunak from Starmer’s Labour Party for aligning the Tory campaign with his predecessor-but-one.Johnson, who governed Britain from 2019 until his resignation after a series of scandals in 2022, remains a politically divisive figure. He won the 2019 general election with a large majority and retains backing among supporters ofBrexit and some core Conservative voters — the sorts of people who Sunak is trying to convince to turn out Thursday.Sunak has embraced a strategy of effectively conceding defeat and instead imploring typical Tory voters to go to the polls and back his party, rather than stay at home or vote for the right-wing Reform UK party led by Farage, another Brexit campaigner. A Labour government would have a “blank check” to do what it wants if it wins a majority in line with what opinion polls are suggesting, Sunak said at a series of campaign events earlier Tuesday.However, Johnson’s involvement in the so-called Partygate scandal involving rule-breaking parties in Downing Street during the Covid pandemic, for which he and Sunak were both fined by the police, saw his popularity among the wider voting public crater. When he left office, he had a net personal approval rating of -53 percentage points with the pollster YouGov.Johnson has taken a back-seat role during the Tory campaign, spending much of the last six weeks abroad on vacation. That’s been seen in part as due to his poor relationship with Sunak. Some allies of Johnson blame the current premier, who served in Johnson’s government as his chancellor of the exchequer, for his ouster, because Sunak’s resignation from Johnson’s Cabinet is widely seen as precipitating his downfall.Until Tuesday night, Johnson’s campaign activity had been limited to posting social media endorsements of some Conservative candidates, and writing columns attacking the Labour Party in the Daily Mail newspaper.","Boris Johnson makes first public appearance of the election campaign in unscheduled speech in central London.

China is building and testing lethal attack drones for Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-is-building-and-testing-lethal-attack-drones-for-russia/articleshow/111445416.cms,"Chinese and Russian companies are developing an attack drone similar to an Iranian model deployed in Ukraine, European officials familiar with the matter said, a sign that Beijing may be edging closer to providing the sort of lethal aid that western officials have warned against.The companies held talks in 2023 about collaborating to replicate Iran’s Shahed drone, and started developing and testing a version this year in preparation for shipment to Russia, said the officials, who asked not to be identified to discuss private information.The Chinese drones have yet to be used in Ukraine, they said.Providing Russia a Shahed-like attack drone would mark a deepening of Beijing’s support for Russia despite repeated warnings from the US and its allies. President Xi Jinping has sought to portray China as neutral in the conflict in Ukraine even as western officials say it’s provided components and other support for President Vladimir Putin ’s forces.At the same time, US officials have said China is holding off directly providing weapons and artillery, something that would signal an unprecedented escalation and almost certainly trigger more forceful action — such as sanctions — against the world’s second-biggest economy.Some nations believe that providing Russia with drones for attack purposes would cross the line into lethal aid, two of the officials said. One person familiar with the matter said the US assessment is China is weighing whether to send fully built unmanned aerial vehicles, but in the meantime is sending kits that can be converted into attack drones. The US still doesn’t conclude that China is sending lethal aid to Russia, the person said, while acknowledging that other nations may have a different interpretation.China doesn’t provide weapons to the parties of the Ukraine conflict and strictly controls exports of dual-use articles, Liu Pengyu, the spokesman for China’s embassy in the US, said in a statement.“On the Ukraine crisis, it is quite clear to the international community who is calling for dialogue and striving for peace, and who is fueling the fight and inciting confrontation,” Liu said. “We urge the relevant countries to immediately stop fueling the fight and inciting confrontation.”Russia’s defense and foreign ministries didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.Russia has used thousands of Shahed drones against Ukraine since the beginning of the war, even building a factory to mass-produce the Iranian-developed technology, which is relatively cheap to build but costly to defend against.But Russia still relies on countries like North Korea and Iran for supplies, and on China for critical parts and components. One worry is that China could produce a drone similar to the Shahed at a far greater rate than Iran or Russia, the officials said.The officials didn’t identify the drone under development, but Chinese defense websites and several media outlets have reported the country is developing a kamikaze attack drone called the Sunflower 200, which is described as similar in appearance to the Iranian Shahed 136 drone.Bloomberg News reported in April that China was providing Russia with satellite imagery for military purposes, microelectronics and machine tools for tanks, as well as a swath of technologies used in weapons or needed to produce them.“China takes every effort, every chance it can get to argue that somehow it’s a neutral player in this war in Ukraine, but in reality the PRC is providing a long list of dual-use components, things like machine tools and microelectronics that are enabling Russia to pursue this war of aggression in Ukraine,” US Ambassador to Nato Julianne Smith told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday, referring to China by its official name, the People’s Republic of China.“Here inside Nato, we’re making sure that we can expose the fact that the PRC is no longer a neutral player and warn China about the risk of getting behind Russia in this unprovoked war of aggression,” she said.Back in May, UK Defense Secretary Grant Shapps provoked a tiff with Washington when he suggested that China was working to provide Russia with lethal aid. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that to date, the US hadn’t seen China providing weapons directly to Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at the G-7 summit that President Xi had given him his word he wouldn’t provide Russia with weapons.","Chinese and Russian companies are developing an attack drone similar to an Iranian model deployed in Ukraine, European officials say.

The United Nations Working Group on arbitrary detention has called for Khan's immediate release, stating that his detention lacks legal basis and appears politically motivated.The working group raised serious concerns about multiple cases brought against Khan since his ousting in April 2022.Their opinion, dated March 25 but made public on Monday, highlights that Khan's deprivation of liberty breaches several international laws and norms.""Khan's detention had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office,"" the working group concluded. ""Thus, from the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose.""The five independent experts called on Pakistan 's government to ""take the steps necessary to remedy the situation of Mr Khan without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms.""""The appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Khan immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law,"" they added.Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022 and has faced over 200 legal cases since his removal, which he claims is a campaign to keep him from power. He has been detained since August and barred from standing for office.In April, Pakistan's high court suspended Khan and his wife's 14-year prison sentences for graft. This month, his 10-year sentence for treason was overturned, but he remains in Adiala jail, south of Islamabad, for an illegal marriage conviction.Khan was cleared for release before those convictions in the days leading up to Pakistan's February 8 general elections.Neither Pakistan's interior nor information ministry immediately responded to a request for comment.Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party hailed the ruling as ""a huge victory.""""It has shown without any one percent of doubt that Imran Khan is innocent and has been thrown into prison illegally,"" said PTI spokesman Syad Zulfiqar Bukhari in a statement.",UN Working Group on arbitrary detention calls for immediate release of Imran Khan.

""I don't remember anything,"" he said. The actor explained that his sister and daughter had taken him to a doctor in Atlanta, where he received a cortisone shot. However, it was a subsequent doctor who raised concerns about his condition. ""Something's going on up there,"" Foxx recalled the doctor saying, although he refrained from disclosing the specific diagnosis.""I wouldn’t wish what I went through on my worst enemy because it’s tough when it’s almost over … when you see the tunnel. I saw the tunnel — I didn’t see the light,"" Foxx said.Foxx expressed his gratitude for the outpouring of support and prayers he received during his recovery. In an emotional Instagram post, he shared, ""I went through something that I thought I would never, ever go through. I know a lot of people were waiting, or wanting to hear updates, and to be honest with you – I just didn't want you to see me like that.""The actor's representatives have not provided any additional comments on hishealth scare . However, since his recovery, Foxx has gradually returned to the public eye with the support of his loved ones. He emphasized the importance of cherishing life and pursuing one's goals, a perspective he gained from his near-death experience.Despite the challenges he faced, Foxx remains committed to his acting career and has several projects in the pipeline. Foxx is involved in the long-awaited Mike Tyson biopic and will star alongside Robert De Niro and Scott Eastwood in the action-thriller ""Tin Soldier.""Inspired by his renewed appreciation for life, Foxx has also launched his own BSB Whiskey brand. ""I've learned that life is precious, which is why it's so important for us to go after what we want,"" he said.The actor, who first gained prominence on the sketch comedy show ""In Living Color"" and later starred in his own sitcom, has two daughters, Corinne and Anelise. As he continues to reflect on his journey and the impact of his recent health challenges, Foxx remains determined to embrace life and the opportunities it presents.The mysterious hospitalization of Jamie Foxx has undoubtedly left fans concerned and curious about the details surrounding his medical emergency. While the actor has chosen to keep the specifics private, his openness about the emotional and physical toll of the experience has resonated with many. As he moves forward, Foxx's resilience and gratitude serve as a reminder of the preciousness of life and the importance of cherishing every moment.","Hollywood actor Jamie Foxx recently opened up about his mysterious hospitalization that occurred in April of last year.

Melania Trump was spotted in New York outside Trump Tower Monday, for the first time after skipping husband's first presidential debate on June 27. Reports that she won't be returning to the White House for a full time role if Trump becomes the President again surfaced making Melania most sought-after amid this election season. She has remained elusive as far as campaigning for her husband is concerned.On July 8, she is supposed to attend a fundraiser for Log Cabin Republicans -- the largest conservative LGBTQ+ organization.Monday she was clicked wearing green pants, a black jacket and carrying a large black Louis Vuitton bag.All eyes are on Melania Trump as she is nowhere to be seen at Trump's campaign. She also missed the presidential debate. This was not the scene in 2016 and 2020. Reports claim Melania has made a deal with Trump that if he wins the presidency, she will not be the 24X7 first lady, She will be in the White House only on occasions -- and the rest of the time she will spend with their son Barron Trump who may join New York University in the fall.“Barron has never been completely on his own before — and with the added stress of him being both a freshman in college and potentially the son of a president in a predominantly Democratic city, Melania wants to be close… The added attention he’ll get if his father is president worries Melania who is also concerned about reaction at his school over Barron’s ever-present Secret Service detail,” an insider said.Melania, in fact, did not allow Baron to be a delegate for Florida. “While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments,” Melania's office issued a statement earlier indicating that she was not keen on her son getting involved in politics now.","All eyes are on Melania Trump as she is nowhere to be seen at Trump's campaign.

The turbulence resulted in several injuries among the passengers , prompting the emergency diversion, the airline said on X.The affected passengers received immediate medical attention, with some being transported to Monsenhor Walfredo Gurgel hospital in Natal.The Uruguayan foreign ministry reported that several of the injured passengers have already been discharged.A diplomatic source from Uruguay indicated that ""between 25 and 30"" people sustained injuries, although this figure is not yet final. Most of the injuries were classified as ""mild trauma,"" and there were no immediate life-threatening cases, the source added.Air Europa announced that a replacement plane would depart from Madrid later on Monday to continue the journey to Montevideo with the remaining passengers.Air safety experts emphasize the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during flights to mitigate the risks associated with sudden turbulence. Scientists have noted an increase in clear air turbulence, attributed to climate change, with a 2023 study showing a 17 per cent rise in annual turbulence duration from 1979 to 2020, and severe cases increasing by over 50 per cent.Earlier this year, a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX, and two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 resulted in the deaths of 346 people. These events have intensified scrutiny on Boeing's safety and manufacturing practices.In response to the ongoing safety concerns, Boeing announced the departure of CEO Dave Calhoun in March and revealed plans to acquire its subcontractor Spirit to enhance safety and quality control.Boeing is also under scrutiny from the US Department of Justice (DOJ), which concluded in May that the company could face prosecution for violating a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement related to the 737 MAX crashes. The DOJ has reportedly offered Boeing a plea deal to avoid a trial, but victims' families are calling for criminal prosecution and seeking a nearly $25 billion fine.","Air Europa Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner made an emergency landing in Natal, northeastern Brazil, on Monday after encountering strong turbulence.

Judge's order greatly expands where Biden can't enforce a new rule protecting LGBTQ+ students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judges-order-greatly-expands-where-biden-cant-enforce-a-new-rule-protecting-lgbtq-students/articleshow/111445619.cms,"TOPEKA: Enforcement of a federal rule expanding anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ students has been blocked in four states and a patchwork of places elsewhere by a federal judge in Kansas.US District Judge John Broomes suggested in his ruling Tuesday that the Biden administration must now consider whether forcing compliance remains ""worth the effort.""Broomes' decision was the third against the rule from a federal judge in less than three weeks but more sweeping than the others.It applies in Alaska, Kansas, Utah and Wyoming, which sued over the new rule. It also applies to a Stillwater, Oklahoma, middle school that has a student suing over the rule and to members of three groups backing Republican efforts nationwide to roll back LGBTQ+ rights. All of them are involved in one lawsuit.Broomes, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, directed the three groups - Moms for Liberty, Young America's Foundation and Female Athletes United - to file a list of schools in which their members' children are students so that their schools also do not comply with the rule. Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, a Republican who argued the states' case before Broomes last month, said that could be thousands of schools.The Biden administration rule is set to take effect in August under the Title IX civil rights law passed in 1972, barring sex discrimination in education. Broomes' order is to remain in effect through a trial of the lawsuit in Kansas, though the judge concluded that the states and three groups are likely to win.Republicans have argued that the rule represents a ruse by the Biden administration to allow transgender females to play on girls' and women's sports teams, something banned or restricted in Kansas and at least 24 other states. The administration has said it does not apply to athletics. Opponents of the rule have also framed the issue as protecting women and girls' privacy and safety in bathrooms and locker rooms.""Gender ideology does not belong in public schools and we are glad the courts made the correct call to support parental rights,"" Moms for Liberty co-founders Tina Descovich and Tiffany Justice said in a statement.LGBTQ+ youth, their parents, health care providers and others say restrictions on transgender youth harms their mental health and makes an often marginalized group even more vulnerable. The Department of Education has previously stood by its rule and President Joe Biden has promised to protect LGBTQ+ rights.The Department of Education did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.Besides Broomes, two other federal judges issued rulings in mid-June blocking the new rule in 10 other states. The rule would protect LGBTQ+ students by expanding the definition of sexual harassment at schools and colleges and adding safeguards for victims.Like the other judges, Broomes called the rule arbitrary and concluded that the Department of Education and its secretary, Miguel Cardona, exceeded the authority granted by Title IX. He also concluded that the rule violated the free speech and religious freedom rights of parents and students who reject transgender students' gender identities and want to espouse those views at school or elsewhere in public.Broomes said his 47-page order leaves it to the Biden administration ""to determine in the first instance whether continued enforcement in compliance with this decision is worth the effort.""Broomes also said non-transgender students' privacy and safety could be harmed by the rule. He cited the statement of the Oklahoma middle school student that ""on some occasions"" cisgender boys used a girls' bathroom ""because they knew they could get away with it.""""It is not hard to imagine that, under the Final Rule, an industrious older teenage boy may simply claim to identify as female to gain access to the girls' showers, dressing rooms, or locker rooms, so that he can observe female peers disrobe and shower,"" Broomes wrote, echoing a common but largely false narrative from anti-trans activists about gender identity and how schools accommodate transgender students.","US District Judge John Broomes suggested in his ruling Tuesday that the Biden administration must now consider whether forcing compliance remains ""worth the effort"" Broomes' decision was the third against the rule from a federal judge in less than three weeks.

WASHINGTON: Beryl, the deadly hurricane currently dousing the Caribbean, has already broken records for how early such a powerful storm has formed in the Atlantic Ocean .Here's what to know about the hurricane, which -- powered by hotter than average ocean temperatures -- scientists are describing as unprecedented but perhaps not unexpected in the era of climate change .Beryl formed on Friday southeast of the Antilles, rapidly becoming a Category 1 storm by Saturday.It's ""the furthest east a hurricane has ever formed this early in the year,"" Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami, wrote in a blog post.Waters in that part of the Atlantic are typically too cold to support hurricanes this time of year, Andra Garner, a climate scientist at Rowan University, told AFP.Less than 24 hours later, by Sunday, Beryl became a major Category 4 storm""It's hard to communicate how unbelievable this is,"" McNoldy wrote.""It's startling to see this happen before your eyes, but it's also kind of in line with what the science tells us we might expect in a warmer world,"" added Garner.""While it is unprecedented, I can't say that it's unexpected.""Beryl also broke a record when it became a Category 4 storm: A hurricane of that level had never been recorded in the Atlantic in June.By the first day of July, a day later, it broke records again, as the earliest-ever Category 5 hurricane.The North Atlantic hurricane season runs from the beginning of June to the end of November.According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, major storms -- Category 3 and above -- usually form around the end of August or the beginning of September.The driving principle behind these factors is the temperature of the Atlantic Ocean, which has been at record levels for more than a year.Warm waters ""can allow the storm to get going and to strengthen,"" said Garner.""And when those waters are extra warm, warmer than we expect, it's kind of like having an extra shot of caffeine in your coffee.""North Atlantic waters are currently between 2 and 5 degrees Fahrenheit (1 and 3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to NOAA.Temperatures in May were close to those typically expected in August.Beryl is ""almost exactly what we do expect, from a climate science perspective,"" said Garner.","Hurricane Beryl has already broken records for how early such a powerful storm has formed in the Atlantic Ocean.

The CNN poll, conducted by SRS, shows Trump leading Biden by six points.Interestingly, the poll also indicates that Harris is within close range of Trump in a hypothetical matchup. The results show that ""47% of registered voters support Trump, 45% Harris, a result within the margin of error that suggests there is no clear leader under such a scenario.""The poll attributes Harris' slightly better performance against Trump to ""broader support from women (50% of female voters back Harris over Trump vs. 44% for Biden against Trump) and independents (43% Harris vs. 34% Biden).""When asked about the poll results, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refrained from directly commenting on the matter, stating that it falls under the purview of the campaign.

Garry Conille: Haiti PM vows 'transparency' to population traumatized by gangs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/haiti-pm-vows-transparency-to-population-traumatized-by-gangs/articleshow/111444851.cms,"Haitian responsibility

Trust

WASHINGTON: Garry Conille , a medical doctor by training who once briefly served as Haiti 's prime minister, says he never hesitated to return home to take up the post once again.Despite what he called an ""extremely complicated"" situation in the gang-plagued Caribbean nation, the leader of Haiti's transitional government pledged on Tuesday to offer ""transparency"" to his countrymen as he takes on the challenge of restoring order.Conille, who has had an extensive career within the United Nations, including a stint as UNICEF's regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean sat down for an interview with AFP during a visit to Washington.He also met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to discuss the deployment in June of the first members of a Kenyan-led international force tasked with helping the overwhelmed Haitian police in their battle against powerful armed gangs.The 58-year-old Conille said his transitional government inherited an ""excessively difficult situation.""Gangs control 80 percent of the capital Port-au-Prince and nearly 600,000 people are displaced, he said.""Infrastructure practically is non-existent, ministries no longer even have offices, staff are very unmotivated and the police need help,"" he told AFP.But Conille also sees glimmers of hope, he hailed the spirit of cooperation that allowed for the formation of a transitional council after controversial Prime MinisterAriel Henry stepped down.Despite difficult negotiations, a government was named, to offer Haitians some relief from the political, security and humanitarian crises wracking the country, and organizing the first elections since 2016.Conille said the second contingent of the Kenyan-led force should arrive in the ""coming weeks,"" but offered no further details, citing security reasons.Security is sorely needed in Haiti, where conditions sharply worsened at the end of February, when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in Port-au-Prince, saying they wanted to overthrow Henry.But Conille sought to reassure his people, who are scarred by the bitter memories of past foreign interventions, that the current deployment will support Haiti's national police.""The responsibility for reestablishing security is first and foremost a Haitian responsibility,"" said Conille, who last served as prime minister in 2011-2012.The international force ""will not replace police. It's really an immediate solution that will give us the time to reinforce the capabilities of our own police and army, so these two institutions can more effectively carry out their functions,"" he said.Haitian authorities will be fully in charge, and work alongside the international policing mission, he emphasized.""We have put in place a police-army task force that is thinking about concrete strategies to allow us to move forward on the security issue,"" Conille added.Much of Port-au-Prince is now in the hands of gangs accused of abuses including murder, rape, looting, and kidnappings. Hospitals and clinics have been attacked and looted of supplies. Food insecurity has soared.Conille said he understood that Haitians were ""impatient"" and wanted to see progress on the ground as quickly as possible.But he insisted that time was needed to put the necessary structures in place so that the country could move forward while protecting police officers and regaining territory lost to gangs ""in the not so distant future.""He said he hoped the gang scourge could be resolved ""definitively.""""In this kind of situation, transparency is our best ally,"" Conille said, explaining that Haitians had long ago lost faith in national institutions and were looking carefully to the transitional government to improve their living conditions.""We will communicate regularly. We're going to tell them very clearly what we are doing. We're going to share with them as well when things don't work out,"" Conille said.As for a path to elections, which are meant to take place before February 7, 2026, the prime minister said organizing polls would be ""the very definition of a successful transition.""The government ""is working now"" on nominating members of a provisional electoral council, Conille said.""We are already in the process of putting in place a system and the tools needed to be able to move forward quickly.""","Garry Conille says he never hesitated to return home to take up the post once again.

The Biden campaign noted a record fundraising haul from small-dollar donors on the day of Biden's widely criticized debate against Trump. Despite the debate backlash, Biden's reelection effort has $240 million in cash on hand.“Our Q2 fundraising haul is a testament to the committed and growing base of supporters standing firmly behind the President and Vice President and clear evidence that our voters understand the choice in this election between President Biden fighting for the American people and Donald Trump fighting for himself as a convicted felon,” said Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez.The Biden campaign said that 95% of donations were under $200, showcasing broad support from average Americans rather than heavy reliance on wealthy donors. The total fundraising figures include donations to the Biden campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and joint fundraising committees.The Biden campaign is using its funds to maintain more than 200 campaign offices and over 1,000 staff in key battleground states. However, the president's debate performance has led to calls from some Democrats for him to step aside, prompting difficult conversations between Biden aides and important campaign financiers.Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said that, “This fundraising momentum is likely to grow even more as we head into a world-class convention and see the Democrats continue their circular firing squad in the aftermath of Biden's debate collapse,” said Trump.","Trump's campaign added $111.8 million in June alone, resulting in $284.9 million in cash on hand.

By 9 a.m., he had already been in a pool once - and planned to go back later in the day.""I felt like I needed to be submerged in water,"" he said.With the temperatures rising before noon in Sacramento, Katherine Powers sought refuge in the shade of Cathedral Square. Powers, who is homeless, sipped sparkling water while resting her bare feet on the shaded sidewalk.Powers said she had loaned her shoes to a friend. She had not yet visited one of Sacramento County's nine ""cooling centers,"" she said, because of the difficulty in bringing all the possessions she carries.""I'm just going to go to a park with a water fountain just to stay cool, stay in the shade and just keep pouring water on me, basically,"" she said. ""There's not too much that I can do.""Darlene Crumedy, who lives in Fairfield about an hour's drive from Sacramento, said she doesn't use air conditioning because it's too expensive.""I'm good, I have a hundred fans,"" she said, adding she tries to stay inside and drink cold water.Kim Mims, a Sacramento native, said she prefers the heat - but only up to 100 degrees (38 C).""Anything over that you start to feel that difference,"" she said.An analysis by The Associated Press found that heat killed more than 2,300 people in the U.S. last year, setting a record. That figure is likely a major undercount, dozens of experts told AP reporters.Dr. Arthur Jey, an emergency services physician with Sutter Health in Sacramento, told reporters that getting out of the heat is important, along with wearing a hat and loose clothes, hydration and watching out for signs of heat stroke.""With heat stroke, it looks like a stroke,"" Jey said, describing symptoms that may include acting unusual, significant headaches, blurry vision, profuse sweating and then no sweating.""And that's a really big deal,"" Jey said.

Additionally, he would have had to plead guilty to a federal charge of attempting to provide material support to a designated terrorist organization, which could have added another 20 years to his sentence.Rushdie, who wrote about the attack and his recovery in a memoir, had been living in hiding for years after the Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989 calling for his death due to his novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" which some Muslims consider blasphemous.However, the author had reemerged into public life in the late 1990s and had been traveling freely for the past two decades.Although born in the United States, Matar holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. His mother reported that her son had become withdrawn and moody after visiting his father in Lebanon in 2018.In his memoir, Rushdie recounted seeing a man running towards him in the amphitheater where he was about to speak about the importance of protecting writers from harm.

Ex-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says 'legitimate' to question Biden's condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ex-us-house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-says-legitimate-to-question-bidens-condition/articleshow/111439098.cms,"Will Biden drop out?

Voices of discontent have begun to emerge in the Democratic fold after Joe Biden's debate fiasco , with ex-US Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday saying it is ""legitimate"" to raise concerns over the President's fitness for office.""I think it's a legitimate question to say, 'Is this an episode or is this a condition?'"" Pelosi, as per news agency AFP, told MSNBC when asked about Biden, who frequently stumbled over his words and lost his flow of thought in Thursday's debate.Pelosi is not the lone voice expressing concern over Biden's capacity to rerun for the presidential polls Lloyd Doggett , the Democratic lawmaker, has become the first in the party to publicly ask Joe Biden to step down as the Democratic nominee for president.Doggett, who represents Texas said in a statement Tuesday that Biden should ""make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw"".""My decision to make these strong reservations public is not done lightly nor does it in any way diminish my respect for all that President Biden has achieved,"" Doggett said.""Recognizing that, unlike Trump, President Biden’s first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw. I respectfully call on him to do so,"" Doggett was quoted as saying by the news agency AP.The aftermath of the first presidential debate has not been favorable for the incumbent, Joe Biden, as it intensified concerns about his age rather than alleviating them.Reports suggest that some Democrat politicians and operatives expressed their hopes that the 81-year-old Biden would step aside, with some even considering going to the White House to publicly voice their concerns about his candidacy.""What's Joe Biden's superpower? That he's a good guy who will do the right thing for the country. In this case, that's stepping aside and letting the DNC choose another nominee,"" Andrew Yang, who ran against Biden for the Democratic nomination in 2020 wrote on X, formerly Twitter.If Biden were to withdraw, the Democratic Party's nominee would be officially chosen at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago from 19-22 August. According to DNC rules, delegates are ""pledged"" to Biden and bound to support his nomination.However, if he were to drop out, there would be no official mechanism for him or anyone else in the party to choose his successor, resulting in an open convention where delegates would be free to choose as they please, potentially leading to a frantic contest among Democrats vying for the nomination.","Ex-US Speaker Nancy Pelosi says it is ""legitimate"" to raise concerns over the President's fitness for office.

The latest weapons package for Ukraine is expected to include anti-tank weapons, air defense interceptors, and expedited procurement of NASAMS and Patriot air defense interceptors.Since 2022, the United States has provided Ukraine with military aid valued at more than $50 billion. However, concerns have been raised about the future of US support for Kyiv in the event that Donald Trump wins the presidential election.Two key advisers to Trump have presented him with a plan to end Russia's war in Ukraine if he is elected, which involves telling Ukraine that it will only receive more US weapons if it enters peace talks with Moscow. This proposal would represent a significant shift in the US position on the war and would likely face opposition from European allies and within Trump's own Republican Party.During the meeting with Austin, Umerov expressed Ukraine's desire to become a member of Nato, stating, ""Hopefully soon Ukraine will receive its invitation."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who unsuccessfully lobbied for a political invitation to join the alliance at its summit in Vilnius last summer, has said that this year's summit should resolve the matter of inviting Kyiv to join.While Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg and Washington have both stated that they do not expect the alliance's 32 members to invite Ukraine to join while it remains at war with Russia during the July 9-11 summit, Stoltenberg has expressed hope that the summit will demonstrate to Kyiv that it is moving closer to membership.","The United States is set to unveil a new security assistance package for Ukraine worth over $2.3 billion.

US inks vaccine deal with Moderna as bird flu threat looms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-inks-vaccine-deal-with-moderna-as-bird-flu-threat-looms/articleshow/111437801.cms,"Moderna Inc. secured nearly $200 million from the US government to speed development of an mRNA vaccine for pandemic influenza as a dangerous strain of bird flu sweeps through the nation’s dairy farms, fueling concern about a budding health crisis.The Department of Health and Human Services awarded Moderna $176 million to help pay for late-stage clinical trials that will start in 2025, Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said in an exclusive interview.The vaccine will be tailored so it can target several influenza strains with pandemic potential, including the family of bird flu viruses currently in circulation.Already one such virus, called H5N1, was detected in 136 cattle herds across 12 states and has infected three farmworkers this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nation’s top health officials maintain the risk of H5N1 to the general public remains low. No human-to-human transmission has been identified and vaccination isn’t currently recommended, O’Connell said.“Our job is to be prepared should that change,” she said. “If you had asked any expert in 2018 what they expected to be the next pandemic, they would have said a highly virulent flu.”Moderna shares rose as much as 2.8% in early trading in New York on Tuesday. They are up 18% so far this year.While the focus of the government award is dangerous influenza strains, that could shift should a different pandemic threat emerge, she said.The benefit of mRNA technology, which was the foundation of Covid-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer Inc., is that it can be quickly adapted if the virus mutates. That creates a potential advantage over traditional vaccines, many of which are grown in chicken eggs.Results from Moderna’s early studies of the bird flu shot are expected in the next few weeks. The US government contract is a win for the company, which is looking for new sources of revenue and trying to shake its reliance on the fading market for Covid vaccines.O’Connell said the US wants to help Moderna generate the data it would need to get clearance from US regulators. But the contract, which was made through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, goes much further, she said. It includes options for the US to purchase vaccine supplies, which would be produced domestically and require additional funding.The US has already reached terms with the biotechnology company to ensure “fair pricing” for the American taxpayer, O’Connell said, though she declined to describe the specific details of the contract.Moderna likely isn’t the only pharmaceutical company that will reach a contract to develop mRNA vaccines for pandemic flu. The US anticipates making additional announcements about other awards, she said. Asked about negotiations with Pfizer, O’Connell declined to comment.","The Department of Health and Human Services awarded Moderna $176 million to help pay for late-stage clinical trials that will start in 2025.

"Pakistan slams UN body report calling Imran’s arrest 'arbitrary, politically motivated'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-slams-un-body-report-calling-imrans-arrest-arbitrary-politically-motivated/articleshow/111440399.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday denounced a UN report that termed the detention of former prime minister Imran Khan as “arbitrary and in violation of international law”, asserting that the arrest of the cricketer-turned-politician and the cases against him were an “internal matter” of the country.Imran, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, has been in jail since August last year following his conviction in a Toshakhana case.The Election Commission of Pakistan subsequently disqualified him for five years, ahead of the national elections in Feb. He is also facing prosecution in the cipher and Iddat cases.In an opinion released on Monday, the Geneva-based UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Imran’s detention had no legal basis, and appeared to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office. “…From the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose,” it stated, adding that Imran’s legal woes were part of a “much larger campaign of repression” against him and his party.In the run-up to the 2024 general election, the working group report stated, PTI members were arrested and tortured and their rallies were disrupted. It also alleged “widespread fraud on the election day”.The “appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Khan immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law”, the UN working group said.Imran and his party have always maintained that the charges against him are politically motivated and aimed at thwarting his return to power.In recent months, courts have suspended Imran’s sentence in some cases and also overturned his conviction on charges of leaking state secrets. However, he has remained behind bars following his conviction in the Iddat case, with a trial court ruling that Imran’s 2018 marriage had violated Islamic law. Khan also faces a trial under anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence in May last year.Responding to the UN report, Pakistan’s law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said, “As a sovereign state, the constitution and prevailing laws are enforced by courts in Pakistan. PTI founder has all rights as per the national constitution and law and international norms. He is in jail as a convicted prisoner.”In his statement, Tarar said court relief to the PTI founder in some of the cases was “a reflection of a transparent and fair trial and judicial system”. “Any demand beyond the constitution, law and international norms will be called discriminatory, biased and unfair,” he added.Last Friday, Pakistan’s parliament had denounced a US congressional resolution that called for an independent investigation into allegations that the country’s elections were rigged.",Imran Khan has been in jail since August last year following his conviction in a Toshakhana case.

During his tenure as prime minister, Khan opted to allow the businessman to utilize the funds to partially settle a fine of around Rs 450 billion, previously imposed by the Supreme Court, instead of depositing it into the national treasury.",Bushra Bibi was granted temporary bail by a specialized accountability court in Rawalpindi.

This sentencing follows a severe mob attack targeting Christians in the eastern Punjab province last year.In August 2023, violence erupted in Faisalabad's Jaranwala when some local Muslims claimed to have seen a Christian, Raja Amir, and his friend tearing pages from a Quran, throwing them on the ground, and writing insulting remarks on other pages.Police chief Rizwan Khan said the alleged act angered the local Muslims, who attacked multiple churches and several Christian homes, burning furniture and other household items. Some members of the Christian community fled their homes to escape the mob.Ehsan Shan, who was not directly involved in the alleged desecration, was accused of reposting the defaced Quranic pages on his TikTok account, according to his lawyer, Khurram Shahzad.

Even mere claims of disrespect towards Islam and its Prophet Mohammed can incite violent and deadly responses from vigilante groups.Ever since 2011, when Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer was assassinated by his own bodyguard for advocating the reform of blasphemy laws, since then there has been little to no deliberations over this issue.Earlier this month, 72-year-old Nazir Masih succumbed to injuries sustained during an attack by an angry mob in May, following accusations of blasphemy.","Ehsan Shan was accused of reposting the defaced Quranic pages on his TikTok account, according to his lawyer, Khurram Shahzad.

When the sentry obliged, the prisoner overpowered him, snatched his keys, and opened other barracks from where at least 19 prisoners made their way to the main gate, according to Dawn citing police.At that time, a pistol was thrown inside through the roof , which was used to break the lock from the inside.
