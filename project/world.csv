Jamie Foxx breaks silence on mysterious illness: 'I saw the tunnel',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jamie-foxx-breaks-silence-on-mysterious-illness-i-saw-the-tunnel/articleshow/111418679.cms,"Jamie Foxx , the renowned Hollywood actor, recently opened up about his mysterious hospitalization that occurred in April of last year. The incident, which began with a severe headache, left Foxx unable to recall the events that followed. While speaking to fans outside a restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona, the actor shared the little he could remember about the medical emergency that led to his extended hospital stay.According to Foxx, the ordeal started on April 11 when he experienced a bad headache and asked his friend for an Advil. ""I was gone for 20 days,"" he revealed. The actor's daughter, Corinne Foxx, had initially informed the public about her father's hospitalization on April 12, saying that he was recovering from a medical complication. However, no further details were provided at the time.During his interaction with fans, Foxx admitted that he has no memory of what happened after he requested the Advil. ""I don't remember anything,"" he said. The actor explained that his sister and daughter had taken him to a doctor in Atlanta, where he received a cortisone shot. However, it was a subsequent doctor who raised concerns about his condition. ""Something's going on up there,"" Foxx recalled the doctor saying, although he refrained from disclosing the specific diagnosis.""I wouldn’t wish what I went through on my worst enemy because it’s tough when it’s almost over … when you see the tunnel. I saw the tunnel — I didn’t see the light,"" Foxx said.Foxx expressed his gratitude for the outpouring of support and prayers he received during his recovery. In an emotional Instagram post, he shared, ""I went through something that I thought I would never, ever go through. I know a lot of people were waiting, or wanting to hear updates, and to be honest with you – I just didn't want you to see me like that.""The actor's representatives have not provided any additional comments on hishealth scare . However, since his recovery, Foxx has gradually returned to the public eye with the support of his loved ones. He emphasized the importance of cherishing life and pursuing one's goals, a perspective he gained from his near-death experience.Despite the challenges he faced, Foxx remains committed to his acting career and has several projects in the pipeline. Foxx is involved in the long-awaited Mike Tyson biopic and will star alongside Robert De Niro and Scott Eastwood in the action-thriller ""Tin Soldier.""Inspired by his renewed appreciation for life, Foxx has also launched his own BSB Whiskey brand. ""I've learned that life is precious, which is why it's so important for us to go after what we want,"" he said.The actor, who first gained prominence on the sketch comedy show ""In Living Color"" and later starred in his own sitcom, has two daughters, Corinne and Anelise. As he continues to reflect on his journey and the impact of his recent health challenges, Foxx remains determined to embrace life and the opportunities it presents.The mysterious hospitalization of Jamie Foxx has undoubtedly left fans concerned and curious about the details surrounding his medical emergency. While the actor has chosen to keep the specifics private, his openness about the emotional and physical toll of the experience has resonated with many. As he moves forward, Foxx's resilience and gratitude serve as a reminder of the preciousness of life and the importance of cherishing every moment.","Hollywood actor Jamie Foxx recently opened up about his mysterious hospitalization that occurred in April of last year.

Why did the US judge call Karen Read’s cop boyfriend murder 'mistrial'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-did-the-us-judge-call-karen-reads-cop-boyfriend-murder-mistrial/articleshow/111417973.cms,"A Massachusetts judge in the US declared Karen Read ’s murder trial "" mistrial "" after jurors deadlocked in the case with no decision despite over 26 hours of deliberation .The court came to this conclusion after the jurors sent notes to Cannone saying they were hopelessly deadlocked. The judge delivered Tuey-Rodriguez instructions — sometimes referred to as “dynamite” instructions intended to blast apart deadlocked juries in Massachusetts, the Washington Post reported.Moments after Judge Beverly J Cannone called a mistrial, Norfolk County District Attorney Michael Morrissey’s office announced that they intend to retry the case.The prosecutors said in a statement, “First, we thank the O’Keefe family for their commitment and dedication to this long process. They maintained sight of the true core of this case — to find justice for John O’Keefe. The Commonwealth intends to re-try the case,” according to AP.According to the prosecutor, Karen Read, who was accused of drunkenly driving into her police officer boyfriend and leaving him to die in January 2022, was drinking with her partner O’Keefe before she dropped him off at a party at the home of Brian Albert, a fellow officer. They said she hit him with her SUV before driving away.While prosecutors were blaming her for Keefe's death, the defence lawyers tried to paint her as the victim in the case. The defence said that Keefe was killed inside Albert’s home and then dragged outside and left for dead, reported Washington Post.They argued that investigators focused on Read because she was a “convenient outsider” who saved them from having to consider other suspects, including Albert and other law enforcement officers at the party.After the prosecutors said that they will re-try, defense attorney Alan Jackson said, “They failed. They failed miserably, and they’ll continue to fail... No matter how long it takes, no matter how long they keep trying, we will not stop fighting,” AP reported.The trial, which lasted for two months, centered around police procedures and the connections between those involved. Law enforcement officials admitted to gathering blood evidence using red plastic cups and attempting to remove snow to uncover evidence with a leaf blower. The primary investigator also confessed to sending inappropriate messages about Read from his mobile phone.Read faced a charge of second-degree murder, which carries a potential life sentence with the possibility of parole in Massachusetts. Additionally, she was accused of lesser offenses, including manslaughter while driving under the influence, which is punishable by five to 20 years in prison, and fleeing the scene of a fatal accident, which can result in a sentence of up to 10 years.",Karen Read was accused of drunkenly driving into her police officer boyfriend and leaving him to die in January 2022.

We also need industry to play their part by putting in some effective barriers,"" she added.A spokesperson for Google , a unit of Alphabet, said the company would collaborate with the industry on the new code and a spokesperson for Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said the company continued to engage constructively with the eSafety commissioner.Representatives of X, formerly Twitter, and app store provider Apple were not immediately available for comment.","Australia is giving the internet industry six months to develop an enforceable code to prevent children from accessing pornography and other inappropriate materials online.

'Big win for constitution': Former US President Donald Trump hails Supreme Court's 'immunity' ruling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/big-win-for-constitution-former-us-president-donald-trump-hails-supreme-courts-immunity-ruling/articleshow/111417835.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump hailed the recent ruling of the Supreme Court that former presidents have absolute immunity for their official acts calling it a ""Big win for constitution and democracy"".The US Supreme Court then left it to the lower courts to see how the ruling impacted their case with regards to Trump as he faces charges related to his role in the 6 January 2021 Capitol riots and alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, as reported by Sky News.The former president was charged with conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiring against the right of Americans to vote, and corruptly obstructing an official proceeding. Despite being charged, Trump has pleaded not guilty. Following the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump was "" Proud to be an American"" as he expressed his satisfaction on social media.The decision is significant as it marks the first time the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of a former president's immunity from prosecution. However, the division among the justices was evident. The three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor strongly criticizing the ruling. ""Today's decision to grant former presidents criminal immunity reshapes the institution of the presidency. It makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law,"" wrote Sotomayor. She continued, ""In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law. With fear for our democracy, I dissent.""Former attorney general Eric Holder also voiced his concerns, calling the decision ""absurd and dangerous"" and stating, ""Our democracy has been gravely wounded.""Trump's legal team had contended that he was immune from prosecution for actions taken while serving as president. They argued that his role at the time should shield him from legal consequences. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump in August last year, has opposed this view, emphasizing that ""no one is above the law.""A trial was initially scheduled to begin on March 4, but the decision on immunity has caused delays, leaving the trial date unset. The Supreme Court's referral of the case to lower courts could further extend these delays. With the upcoming presidential election on November 5, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that any trial on these charges will conclude before the election.Trump still faces three other indictments. Special Counsel Jack Smith is heading two federal investigations into Trump, both resulting in criminal charges. The Washington case focuses on Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, while the Florida case involves the mishandling of classified documents. Another case in Georgia also pertains to Trump's actions following his 2020 electoral defeat.Trump has consistently maintained that the cases against him are politically driven attempts to prevent his return to the White House.Trump, aged 78, became the first former president to be convicted of a felony in May as he was found guilty of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment made during the 2016 presidential election to adult film actress Stormy Daniels , who claims to have had a sexual encounter with him, a claim Trump denies.","Former US President Donald Trump hailed the recent ruling of the Supreme Court that former presidents have absolute immunity for their official acts.

North Korea says its recent missile tests involved new ballistic missile with 'super-large warhead',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-says-its-recent-missile-tests-involved-new-ballistic-missile-with-super-large-warhead/articleshow/111417662.cms,"SEOUL: North Korea said Tuesday it had test-fired a new tactical ballistic missile capable of carrying a huge warhead, as the country is pushing to modernize its weapons arsenal to cope with what it calls U.S.-led threats.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency called the weapon Hwasongpho-11Da-4.5 which can carry 4.5 ton-class “super-large warhead.”It said the test-fire on Monday was meant to verify flight stability and hit accuracy at the maximum range of 500 kilometers (310 miles) and the minimum range of 90 kilometers (55 miles).South Korea’s military earlier said that North Korea launched two ballistic missiles from one of its southwestern towns in a northeastern direction on Monday and that the first missile flew 600 kilometers (370 miles) and the second missile 120 kilometers (75 miles). The second missile's flight distance was too short to reach the waters off the North's east coast, a typical landing site for North Korean test missiles.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the second North Korean missile possibly travelled abnormally during the initial stage of its flight. It said if the missile exploded, its debris would likely have scattered on the ground though no damages was immediately reported.The KCNA dispatch didn’t say from where it launched the new missile and where it landed. But the fact that it tested both the missile’s maximum and minimum ranges suggested North Korea performed two launches.KCNA, citing North Korea’s Missile Administration, reported that North Korea will test-fire the missile again later in July to verify the performances of its simulated warhead at the medium range of 250 kilometers (155 miles).Since 2022, North Korea has sharply accelerated weapons testing activities to enlarge its arsenal of nuclear-capable weapons designed to strike key sites in the mainland U.S., South Korea and Japan. The ranges of the newly tested missile suggest it targets South Korea. Experts say North Korea would ultimately want to use an expanded nuclear arsenal to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.Monday's missile's test were the North Korea's first weapons firing in five days. Last Wednesday, North Korea launched what it called a multiwarhead missile in the first known test of a developmental weapon aimed at penetrating its rivals' missile defenses. North Korea said the launch was successful, but South Korea dismissed the North’s claim as deception to cover up a failed launch.The latest launches came a day after North Korea vowed “offensive and overwhelming” responses to a new U.S. military drill with South Korea and Japan.","North Korea test-fired a new tactical ballistic missile capable of carrying a huge warhead.

Tropical Storm Beryl: Hurricane Beryl razes southeast Caribbean as a record-breaking category 4 storm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hurricane-beryl-razes-southeast-caribbean-as-a-record-breaking-category-4-storm/articleshow/111417768.cms,"BRIDGETOWN: Hurricane Beryl ripped off doors, windows, and roofs in homes across the southeastern Caribbean on Monday after making landfall on the island of Carriacou as the earliest storm of Category 4 strength to form in the Atlantic, fueled by record warm waters.There were no immediate reports of possible deaths or injuries, with communications largely down across the region.Streets from St. Lucia island south to Grenada were strewn with shoes, trees, downed power lines, and scores of other debris scattered by winds up to 150 mph (240 kph), just shy of a Category 5 storm. The storm snapped banana trees in half and killed cows that lay in green pastures as if they were sleeping, with homes made of tin and plywood tilting precariously nearby.""Right now, I'm real heartbroken,"" said Vichelle Clark King as she surveyed her damaged shop in the Barbadian capital of Bridgetown that was filled with sand and water. Beryl was still swiping the southeast Caribbean late Monday afternoon even as it began moving into the Caribbean Sea on a track that would take it just south of Jamaica and toward Mexico's Yucatan peninsula by late Thursday as a Category 1 storm.Late Monday, Beryl's winds increased to 155 mph (250) kilometers, on the brink of becoming a Category 5 storm.Beryl was located about 575 miles (925 kilometers) east-southeast of Isla Beata in the Dominican Republic and was moving west-northwest at 21 mph (33 kph), with hurricane conditions possible on Jamaica Wednesday.A hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, and a tropical storm warning for the entire southern coast of Hispaniola, an island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.""Beryl is expected to remain an extremely dangerous major hurricane as it moves over the eastern Caribbean,"" the National Hurricane Center said.The last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.On Monday afternoon, officials received ""reports of devastation"" from Carriacou and surrounding islands, said Terence Walters, Grenada's national disaster coordinator. Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said he would travel to Carriacou as soon as it's safe, noting there's been an ""extensive"" storm surge.Grenada officials had to evacuate patients to a lower floor after the hospital roof was damaged, he said.""There is the likelihood of even greater damage,"" he told reporters. ""We have no choice but to continue to pray.""In Barbados , Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information, said drones - which are faster than crews fanning across the island - would assess the damage once Beryl passes.Historic hurricane Beryl strengthened from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in just 42 hours - a feat accomplished only six other times in Atlantic hurricane history, and with Sept. 1 as the earliest date, according to hurricane expert Sam Lillo.It also was the earliest Category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record, besting Hurricane Dennis, which became a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.Beryl amassed its strength from record-warm waters that are hotter now than they would be at the peak of hurricane season in September, said hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry.Beryl also marked the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher.On Sunday night, Beryl formed a new eye, or center, something that usually weakens a storm slightly as it grows larger in area. Experts say it's now back to strengthening.Jaswinderpal Parmar of Fresno, California, who was among the thousands who traveled to Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup cricket final, said he and his family were now stuck there with scores of other fans, their flights canceled on Sunday.He said by phone that it's the first time he has experienced a hurricane - he and his family have been praying, as well as taking calls from concerned friends and family as far away as India.""We couldn't sleep last night,"" Parmar, 47, said.Looking ahead Even as Beryl bore down on the southeast Caribbean, government officials warned about a cluster of thunderstorms mimicking the hurricane's path that have a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression.""There's always a concern when you have back-to-back storms,"" Lowry said. ""If two storms move over the same area or nearby, the first storm weakens the infrastructure, so the secondary system doesn't need to be as strong to have serious impacts.""Beryl is the second named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall in northeast Mexico and killed four people.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.","Beryl is the earliest storm of Category 4 strength to form in the Atlantic, fueled by record warm waters.

He was unwell,"" said one person who said they appealed to Biden's top aides in the days before, to no avail. ""What a bad decision to send him out looking sick and exhausted.""The debate strategy, approved by campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and backed by Dunn, involved a rigorous preparation schedule at Camp David.Prior to the debate, Biden's poll numbers had begun to improve following Trump's conviction for falsifying documents and the president's successful visits to Europe. However, critics argue that the preparation should have focused more on the broader vision Biden needs to convey to the nation, and that he lacked sufficient rest before the event.The decision to participate in the debate came as a surprise to some advisers, with Biden's team opting to reject the traditional debates organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates in favor of a more controlled setting on CNN. Despite this, Biden's performance was widely criticized, with his appearance and demeanor described as wan, straggly, and frequently incoherent.In the aftermath of the debate, Biden delivered a strong speech in North Carolina and pledged to continue his campaign, with many donors and Democrats rallying around him. However, discussions about potential alternative candidates for the 2024 election are already taking place within the Democratic Party.","US President Joe Biden's lackluster debate performance has drawn criticism from Democratic supporters, donors, and former and current aides.

Amid clamors for replacing Joe Biden as the Democrat's presidential candidate, he said it could cost the Democrat the 2024 election. He said it will be a huge mistake as those who are asking Biden to bow out of the contest are not doctors and they do not know whether Biden is capable of continuing another term or not.""This is foolhardy nonsense,"" the American University historian said on CNN.Lichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every election over the last half century, except for the race in 2000, using a series of 13 historical factors or “keys.” The system includes four factors based on politics, seven on performance, and two on candidate personality. Lichtman said the incumbent party would need to lose six of those actors, or “keys,” to lose the White House, USA Today reported.Lichtman did not undermine the performance of the debate but said in 1984 former president Ronald Regan could swing the election despite performing poorly in the debate. “At the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president.

"Australia foreign student visa policy changes: Fees doubled, extension gets difficult",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-foreign-student-visa-policy-changes-fees-doubled-extension-gets-difficult/articleshow/111391412.cms,"Gets difficult to extend stay

NEW DELHI: Australia has significantly increased the visa fee for international students, more than doubling the cost from A$710 to A$1,600. This new fee structure, effective from July 1, aims to manage record migration numbers that have exacerbated housing market pressures.Furthermore, recent regulations prohibit visitor visa holders and students with temporary graduate visas from applying onshore for a student visa.""The changes coming into force today will help restore integrity to our international education system, and create a migration system which is fairer, smaller and better able to deliver for Australia,"" said home affairs minister Clare O'Neil in a statement.Official data released in March indicated that net immigration surged by 60%, reaching a record-high of 548,800 people in the year leading up to September 30, 2023. This new fee places Australia significantly higher than its competitors, with the US charging approximately $185 and Canada around C$150 ($110) for student visas.In addition to the fee hike, the government is closing existing loopholes that allow foreign students to extend their stay in Australia continuously. The number of students holding a second or subsequent student visa rose by over 30% to exceed 150,000 in the 2022-23 period.This move adds to a series of policy changes since late last year aimed at tightening student visa rules. The removal of Covid-19 restrictions in 2022 has contributed to a substantial increase in annual migration.In March, English language requirements for these visas were made more stringent. In May, the requisite amount of savings international students needed to secure a visa was increased to A$29,710 from A$24,505, marking the second hike in less than a year.International education is a significant export industry for Australia, contributing A$36.4 billion to the economy during the 2022-2023 financial year. These policy changes may impact the sector's strength going forward.","Australia has significantly increased the visa fee for international students, more than doubling the cost from A$710 to A$1,600.

Melania Trump: Melania Trump won't move back to White House if Trump wins because...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/melania-trump-wont-move-back-to-white-house-if-trump-wins-because-/articleshow/111261631.cms,"Donald Trump 's wife Melania Trump , the former First Lady, has no intention to move permanently back into the White House if Trump is elected the President, reports said adding that Melania would probably divide her time between Florida and New York and won't permanently move back to Washington with Trump.Trump's youngest son Barron Trump could be going to college at New York University explaining why his mother would love to spend her time in NY, and at Florida where they have their resort in Palm Beach.If this happens, this will be the first for a First Lady.Axios reported that Melania would choose to be a part-time first lady and would turn up at the White House for ceremonies and special events -- all speculations in case Trump wins the election.“Melania does what Melania wants,” said Mary Jordan, a Washington Post associate editor and the author of the book “The Art of Her Deal: The Untold Story of Melania Trump.”Jordan told Axios that Melania Trump always was a different kind of first lady and didn’t believe that this unelected position put any special obligation on her.“She’s distancing herself even more from her husband and from the Washington social political scene,” author Kate Andersen Brower also told Axios. “I mean, she clearly hated being in Washington.”Melania steered clear of politics since 2021 when the Trumps left the White House. She also did not turn up at Donald Trump's hush money trial and verdict in Manhattan. She was instead spotted at private occasions -- with Barron Trump. As far as the fund-raising events for the election are concerned, she attended some private events. Next month, the former first lady is hosting the conservative LGBT group 'Log Cabin Republicans' for a fundraiser at Trump Tower in New York, reports said.","Melania would probably divide her time between Florida and New York and won't permanently move back to Washington with Trump.

Increase in juvenile crimes: The shocking way China is reacting to brutal murders of little girls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/increase-in-juvenile-crimes-the-shocking-way-china-is-reacting-to-brutal-murders-of-little-girls/articleshow/111391229.cms,"China is grappling with a series of horrific murders of young girls perpetrated by boys as young as 12 years old. However, the way the communist country handles juvenile killers is almost as shocking, often allowing them to avoid jail time and instead sending them to mental institutions for brief periods. In some instances, the young offenders are even permitted to return to school shortly after committing their crimes, according to a news report from New York Post.As China attempts to address the issue of holding children accountable for these heinous acts, which are most notoriously committed against other children, the parents of the victims frequently find themselves waiting for justice that may never arrive.For many years, nations across the globe have grappled with the challenge of striking a balance between imposing penalties and extending mercy to young lawbreakers. This discussion is particularly significant in China, where the historical approach of showing relative clemency to juvenile offenders sharply contrasts with the restricted rights afforded to adult criminal defendants. The Chinese government has long prioritized the education and rehabilitation of young offenders over incarceration.However, in recent times, there has been a growing public outcry in response to this approach. A series of high-profile murders allegedly perpetrated by minors in the past few years has prompted many Chinese citizens to demand stricter measures against juvenile crime . The government has taken notice of these calls for change and has begun to take action in response to the shifting public sentiment.Gong Junli, whose 8-year-old daughter was brutally stabbed to death by a 13-year-old boy, is one of the latest grieving parents awaiting the Supreme People's Court 's (SPC) decision on whether to sentence his child's killer to prison.In March, the story of a single father's ordeal gained attention when authorities decided to file criminal charges against a teenage boy. Red Star News reported that the boy allegedly lured the man's daughter into a wooded area in Xinjing Township in September 2022.Once in the woods, the boy reportedly stabbed the girl several times and left her body among a group of poplar trees, according to officials.The authorities reported that the 13-year-old suspect had allegedly gathered various items, including knives, blades, disposable gloves, and plastic ropes, in preparation for the crime. These tools were strategically hidden in a wooded area where the suspect had asked the victim to join him for play.Authorities reported that the teenage suspect displayed a lack of remorse and spoke about the incident in a casual manner during police questioning.In 2021, China reduced the age of criminal responsibility from 14 to 12. However, unlike in the United States, children are not sent to detention centres, and adult-level punishments are seldom imposed for murder. The lenient sentencing practices were common even before the 2021 amendment, with young offenders often being sent to juvenile rehabilitation centres or psychological correction facilities for short periods.Despite the new law, China continues to witness increased cases against juveniles. Between 2020 and 2023, prosecutors charged 243,000 minors, with an average case increase of 5% per year. The SPC recently announced that it had handed down sentences against 12,000 minors in the first three months of 2024 and issued new guidelines on preventing juvenile crime, suggesting that courts could hold parents and guardians responsible for their children's actions.The court specifically noted that 30% of those who committed violent crimes between 2021 and 2013 were from ""left-behind"" or single-parent families. Left-behind children, who remain in rural areas while their parents work in cities, also make up a significant portion of bullying victims in China. The recent spate of violent incidents has prompted calls for parents to return home and focus on raising their children, with the Supreme People's Court urging communities to work together to address the issue.","China is grappling with a series of horrific murders of young girls perpetrated by boys as young as 12 years old.

Jill Biden: A first lady in the trenches,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jill-biden-a-first-lady-in-the-trenches/articleshow/111417976.cms,"Decorations and campaigning

WASHINGTON: Ever present by the US president's side after his calamitous debate -- and foursquare behind him as he vowed to fight on in his reelection bid -- First Lady Jill Biden has been fighting her husband's battles from the front lines.""I think she is as influential as pundits are claiming and her opinion likely matters more to him than anyone else's,"" said Tammy Vigil, a professor of communications at Boston University.""Without her support, it would be impossible for him to continue in the race.""The 73-year-old community college professor was making headlines of her own on Monday, as Vogue unveiled the cover of its August issue -- with the first lady looking seraphic in a long white tuxedo gown by Ralph Lauren.The picture and the article date from April, long before President Joe Biden struggled to make himself understood during a halting, unfocused performance at a CNN debate against Republican rival Donald Trump.But in a note introducing the article, the magazine's editors revealed they'd had a telephone conversation with the first lady shortly after the debate, as calls mounted for her 81-year-old husband to withdraw his candidacy.- 'The right person' -She told Vogue the Biden family ""will not let those 90 minutes define the four years he's been president.""The woman who has shared her last 47 years with the Democratic leader also told a weekend meeting of donors: ""Joe isn't just the right person for the job. He's the only person for the job.""On Thursday, after the debate, Jill Biden was shown taking her husband's arm to help him down a few steps in the CNN studio.The following day, she was there again in a dress that read ""vote,"" as a much more energetic Joe Biden headlined a rally in North Carolina.Before they married in 1977, Joe Biden had been turned into a widower by a horrific car crash five years earlier that had claimed the lives of his first wife and their infant daughter. His two boys, Beau and Hunter, survived.The family was revisited by tragedy years later as Beau, a cherished son at the start of what looked like a promising political career of his own, died of cancer.Adding to the family's difficulties, Hunter struggled for years with a crack addiction.The first lady is now the center of gravity of the troubled but burgeoning clan, bolstered with the birth of Jill and Joe's daughter Ashley a few years after their wedding -- and eventually the arrival of their grandchildren.Without her support, the Democrat would not have embarked on his quest for a second term.When she arrived at the White House, she continued to teach English at a college near Washington, unheard of for a president's wife.Meanwhile, she assumed the traditional role of first lady -- in charge of Christmas decorations and gala dinner menus, as well as promoting pet causes -- in her case, literacy.Amid the shaky reelection campaign , Jill Biden could well encourage an outpouring of sympathy with her passionate advocacy for the president since his calamitous showdown with Trump -- but also risks alienating a segment of public opinion by doing so.""A contemporary US first lady is supposed to be the 'not-so-secret weapon' that helps her husband by attesting to his character and by helping raise funds, et cetera. Because of that, Jill Biden is expected to participate in the campaign,"" said Vigil.""However, there are also unstated limits to that activity that are hard to figure out until a particular line is crossed. If she is too vigorous in her support and defense of her husband, people will complain.""The first lady has become a prime target on social media since the debate, with Trump supporters painting her as an unscrupulous manipulator.""What Jill Biden and the Biden campaign did to Joe Biden tonight -- rolling him out on stage to engage in a battle of wits while unarmed -- is elder abuse, plain and simple,"" Wyoming Republican Harriet Hageman posted on X after the debate.","First Lady Jill Biden appears on the cover of Vogue's August issue.

Biden voiced his disapproval from the White House , marking his first remarks since a recent shaky debate with Trump.The US Supreme Court's decision was a landmark ruling, acknowledging for the first time any form of presidential immunity from prosecution.The ruling was considered a win for Trump, against whom Biden is running for re-election. Trump cannot be prosecuted for actions within his presidential duties but can face charges for private acts.""This nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America,"" Biden said. ""That fundamentally changed,"" he added, emphasising that no one should be above the law.Biden has been critical of Trump's actions related to the January 6, 2021, raid on the US Capitol . The attack was carried out by Trump's supporters, who were influenced by his false claims that he had won the 2020 election.Biden, who is 81 years old, is facing scrutiny following a debate performance in Atlanta that led to calls for him to step aside as the Democratic Party's candidate. His White House remarks are being closely watched as indicators of his capability to run for re-election and govern for another term.The recent debate against Trump, in which Biden stumbled over his words, has heightened attention on his ability to continue in his role.

US said to seek Boeing guilty plea to avoid trial in 737 Max crashes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-said-to-seek-boeing-guilty-plea-to-avoid-trial-in-737-max-crashes/articleshow/111413451.cms,"The US justice department plans to allow Boeing to avoid a criminal trial if it agrees to plead guilty to a fraud charge stemming from two fatal crashes of its 737 Max more than five years ago, according to two lawyers for families of the crash victims.Federal officials shared details of the offer on a call with the families Sunday before bringing the deal to Boeing, according to the lawyers, Paul G Cassell and Mark Lindquist.The terms include a nearly $244 million fine, a new investment in safety improvements, three years of scrutiny from an external monitor, and a meeting between Boeing's board and the victims' families, said Cassell, a University of Utah law professor. The justice department did not respond to a request for comment, while Boeing declined to comment.Cassell, who represents more than a dozen of the families, said that he and the families found the deal to be ""outrageous"". He described the offer as a ""sweetheart plea deal "" because it would not force Boeing to admit fault in the deaths of the 346 people who died in the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in late 2018 and early 2019.The terms reportedly being offered to Boeing would update a 2021 settlement that resolved the criminal charge accusing the aerospace giant of a conspiracy to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration. The new agreement would require Boeing to plead guilty to that charge, according to the lawyers. The 2021 criminal charge centered on two employees who were accused of withholding information from the FAA about changes made to software known as MCAS, which was later implicated in the crashes.If Boeing agrees to plead guilty to the charge, the company would also admit to a set of facts laid out in that 2021 agreement, which Cassell criticised as a ""whitewashed"" narrative in which Boeing escapes blame for the deaths.Under the earlier deal, the company agreed to pay $500 million to the victims' families. It also agreed to pay more than $1.7 billion to its customers because they could not take deliveries of the Max during a 20-month global ban on the jet. The 2021 settlement is known as a deferred prosecution agreement, a type of deal often used in criminal cases against corporations, allowing companies to avoid charges if they do not engage in wrongdoing for a certain period.The new plea deal comes just days before a July 7 deadline for the justice department to file criminal charges in the case. Boeing will have until the end of the week to decide whether to accept the deal, according to Cassell.","Federal officials shared details of the offer on a call with the families Sunday before bringing the deal to Boeing.

"Pandemic's babies and toddlers are now school-age, and behind",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pandemics-babies-and-toddlers-are-now-school-age-and-behind/articleshow/111413443.cms,"The pandemic's babies, toddlers and preschoolers are now school-age, and the impact on them is becoming increasingly clear: Many are showing signs of being academically and developmentally behind. Interviews with more than two dozen teachers, pediatricians and early childhood experts in the US depicted a generation less likely to have age-appropriate skills - to be able to hold a pencil, communicate their needs, identify shapes and letters, manage their emotions or solve problems with peers.A variety of scientific evidence has also found that the pandemic seems to have affected some young children's early development.Boys were more affected than girls, studies have found. ""I definitely think children born then have had developmental challenges compared to prior years,"" said Dr Jaime Peterson, a pediatrician at Oregon Health and Science University. ""We asked them to wear masks, not see adults, not play with kids. We really severed those interactions, and you don't get that time back for kids.""Researchers said several aspects of the pandemic affected young children - parental stress , less exposure to people, lower preschool attendance, more time on screens and less time playing. Brook Allen, in Martin, Tennessee, has taught kindergarten for 11 years. This year, for the first time, she said, several students could barely speak, several were not toilet trained, and several did not have the fine motor skills to hold a pencil. Children don't engage in imaginative play or seek out other children the way they used to, said Michaela Frederick, a pre-K teacher for students with learning delays in Tennessee. She's had to replace small building materials in her classroom with big soft blocks because students' fine motor skills weren't developed enough.Perhaps the biggest difference Lissa O'Rourke has noticed among her preschoolers in Florida has been their inability to regulate their emotions: ""It was knocking over chairs, it was throwing things, it was hitting their peers, hitting their teachers."" One explanation for young children's struggles, experts say, is parental stress during the pandemic. A baby who is exposed to more stress will show more activation on brain imaging scans in ""the parts of that baby's brain that focus on fear and focus on aggression"", said Rahil D. Briggs, a child psychologist. That leaves less energy for parts of the brain focused on language, exploration and learning, she said. Time on screens also spiked during the pandemic as parents juggled work and children were cooped up at home. Experts believe that this affected attention spans and fine motor skills.It's too early to know whether young children will experience long-term effects from the pandemic, but researchers say there are reasons to be optimistic. ""It is absolutely possible to catch up,"" said Dr. Dani Dumitriu, a pediatrician at Columbia. Sarrah Hovis, a preschool teacher in Michigan. said she has seen great progress. By the end of this year, some of her students were counting to 100, and even adding and subtracting. ""If the kids come to school,"" she said, ""they do learn.""","Pandemic's babies, toddlers and preschoolers are now school-age.

Trump entitled to absolute immunity for clearly official acts: US Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-entitled-to-absolute-immunity-for-clearly-official-acts-us-supreme-court/articleshow/111412845.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Monday ruled that former president Donald Trump is entitled to “absolute” immunity for clearly official acts , implicitly overturning the principle that no person is above the law and paving way for an imperial presidency in America.By a 6-3 majority, conservatives on the SC bench, three of them appointed by Trump, said that broad immunity for official conduct is needed to protect “an energetic, independent executive”.The three liberal justices on the bench dissented, saying the decision was gravely misguided and it ""effectively creates a law-free zone around the president, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the founding”.Although Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, argued that the president “enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the president does is official... (and) the president is not above the law”, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her dissent for the minority said the broad immunity “reshapes the institution of the presidency” and “makes a mockery of the principle” that no man is above the law.The ruling sends back to lower courts the election interference case against Trump and will almost certainly help run the clock down to the 2024 elections.The ruling still leaves it to the trial court to determine what Trump did or instigated constitutes official or unofficial acts, but the process will most certainly take months, effectively letting the voters decide the matter.If Trump wins on Nov 5, he can simply quash the case when he assumes office, by either ordering the justice department to drop the charges against him, or pardon himself.If Biden wins, he too, should he choose to do so, ride into an imperial presidency, forever changing the nature of politics in the self-professed ""greatest democracy in the world"".The Supreme Court conservatives tried to finesse the ruling saying a former president has absolute immunity for his core constitutional powers — and is entitled to a presumption of immunity for his official acts, but lacks immunity for unofficial acts.""No court has thus far considered how to distinguish between official and unofficial acts,"" the conservative majority wrote, while cautioning Trump against asserting ""a far broader immunity than the limited one we have recognised"".But Trump was already gloating over the ruling, posting “BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!” on Truth Social.Democratic leaders raged at the ruling, with New York Senator Chuck Schumer calling it a ""disgraceful decision by the MAGA SCOTUS—which is comprised of 3 justices appointed by Trump himself.""Fundamentally, what the conservative justices ruled upheld Richard Nixon's claim in 1974 during the Watergate scandal: “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal."" Nixon would not have had to resign under current SC ruling even though he tried to cheat his way into a second term.","US Supreme Court rules that former president Donald Trump is entitled to “absolute” immunity for clearly official acts.

The boroughs under the warning include Brooklyn, Manhattan, Richmond, and Queens. Authorities may update or modify the warning for the affected areas or nearby regions in the upcoming hours.Persistent heavy rainfall could lead to flooding in low-lying areas close to rivers, streams, and creeks.Flooding in urban areas is also a possibility, particularly in developed regions with drainage systems that can quickly become overwhelmed by stormwater. Areas situated downstream from sizable reservoirs or rivers may be vulnerable to flash flooding after relatively brief periods of intense rainfall. In hilly or mountainous terrain, especially where the soil has been saturated by heavy precipitation, there is a risk of landslides.In low-lying areas, localized business disruptions may occur due to flood damage to facilities, potential evacuations, and the inability of some employees to reach their workplaces. As a result, some businesses might not be able to operate at full capacity.Google Trends data show a significant spike in searches related to flash flood safety tips and real-time weather updates as residents seek information on how to protect themselves and their property.On Sunday, severe thunderstorms moved through New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, bringing torrential downpours, damaging winds, hail, and the potential for tornado formation. Some regions were forecasted to receive 2 to 3 inches of rainfall, which could result in flash flooding.A severe thunderstorm warning issued for New York City expired at 5.15 pm (local time). The rest of the Tri-State Area was under a severe thunderstorm watch until 7pm.In September 2023, New York City experienced chaos as relentless rainfall caused flash floods , disrupting subway services and transforming city streets into water-filled obstacles.

UN panel declares former Pakistan PM Imran Khan's detention arbitrary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/un-panel-declares-former-pakistan-pm-imran-khans-detention-arbitrary/articleshow/111412979.cms,"A panel of UN experts has determined that the detention of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is arbitrary and violates international law . The United Nations Working Group on arbitrary detention has called for Khan's immediate release, stating that his detention lacks legal basis and appears politically motivated.The working group raised serious concerns about multiple cases brought against Khan since his ousting in April 2022.Their opinion, dated March 25 but made public on Monday, highlights that Khan's deprivation of liberty breaches several international laws and norms.""Khan's detention had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office,"" the working group concluded. ""Thus, from the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose.""The five independent experts called on Pakistan 's government to ""take the steps necessary to remedy the situation of Mr Khan without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms.""""The appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Khan immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law,"" they added.Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022 and has faced over 200 legal cases since his removal, which he claims is a campaign to keep him from power. He has been detained since August and barred from standing for office.In April, Pakistan's high court suspended Khan and his wife's 14-year prison sentences for graft. This month, his 10-year sentence for treason was overturned, but he remains in Adiala jail, south of Islamabad, for an illegal marriage conviction.Khan was cleared for release before those convictions in the days leading up to Pakistan's February 8 general elections.Neither Pakistan's interior nor information ministry immediately responded to a request for comment.Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party hailed the ruling as ""a huge victory.""""It has shown without any one percent of doubt that Imran Khan is innocent and has been thrown into prison illegally,"" said PTI spokesman Syad Zulfiqar Bukhari in a statement.",UN Working Group on arbitrary detention calls for immediate release of Imran Khan.

This sentencing follows a severe mob attack targeting Christians in the eastern Punjab province last year.In August 2023, violence erupted in Faisalabad's Jaranwala when some local Muslims claimed to have seen a Christian, Raja Amir, and his friend tearing pages from a Quran, throwing them on the ground, and writing insulting remarks on other pages.Police chief Rizwan Khan said the alleged act angered the local Muslims, who attacked multiple churches and several Christian homes, burning furniture and other household items. Some members of the Christian community fled their homes to escape the mob.Ehsan Shan, who was not directly involved in the alleged desecration, was accused of reposting the defaced Quranic pages on his TikTok account, according to his lawyer, Khurram Shahzad. Shahzad also stated his intention to appeal the death sentence , which was handed down on Saturday by a court in Sahiwal, Punjab province.Amir Farooq, the police officer responsible for Shan's arrest, said that the man shared ""the hateful content at a sensitive time when authorities were already struggling to contain the violence.""Naveed Kashif, a local priest in Sahiwal, questioned ""why the court ordered such an extreme verdict when those linked to the attacks are yet to be punished,"" while acknowledging that he did not condone Shan's actions, AP reported.In Pakistan, a country with a Muslim majority - Blasphemy is a burning issue.

NEW DELHI: Amid heightened tensions with the Taliban rulers in Kabul and under increasing pressure from China, the Pakistan government has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"", to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan .Speaking about the new initiative, defence minister Khawaja Asif recently told the Voice of America that Pakistan was even willing to go as far as carrying out cross-border strikes to eliminate militant hideouts in Afghanistan -- a move that could potentially trigger a retaliatory move from the Taliban regime.There has been a spike in terror-related incidents in Pakistan ever since the Taliban stormed back to power in Kabul in August 2021 after the US suddenly withdrew from the war-torn country.Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023.Many of the incidents have centered around Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan areas.Terror incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been of particular concern to the Pakistan government as they have resulted in the deaths of many Chinese citizens working on projects related to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have highlighted the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).China has come out strongly against the attacks and has sternly warned Islamabad that it must take strict and effective action or it would re-evaluate its investments and projects in the country.Pakistan has blamed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for majority of the attacks and has repeatedly asserted that the terrorist organisation's leaders are being given a safe haven in the border areas of Afghanistan.The defence minister's strong statement came on the day JUI-F Maulana Fazlur Rehman warned about the critical security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Rehman has claimed that things have reached a point where even the police could not go out at night due to the presence of armed men. The TTP ended its ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022.In an interview with Voice of America, Asif said Islamabad could strike terror havens in Afghanistan and it would not be against international law since Kabul had been ""exporting"" terrorism to Pakistan and the ""exporters"" were being harboured there.He said though the TTP was operating from the neighbouring country, its cadre, about a few thousand in number, ""are operating from within the country"" and blamed the previous Imran Khan-led PTI government for bringing militancy back.The minister also ruled out any chances of dialogue with the banned outfit, saying that there was no common ground.Speaking about 'Azm-i-Istehkam', Asif said parliament would be taken on board in this regard and the concerns of political parties would also be addressed.Dawn reported that in separate remarks to local news channels, the minister said Islamabad would ""stringently enforce international laws at its borders with Afghanistan"" to restrict the movement of smuggled goods.The media outlet reported him as saying that the decision would also ""thwart the infiltration of terrorists"".","Pakistan has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"" The move is to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.

"KP Sharma Oli to be Nepal's next PM? Congress, CPN-UML strike overnight deal to form new coalition",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/kp-sharma-oli-to-be-nepals-next-pm-congress-cpn-uml-strike-overnight-deal-to-form-new-coalition/articleshow/111418185.cms,"In a surprise political shift, the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) ( CPN-UML ) struck a deal to form a new coalition government.This agreement, reached between Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli , is set to see Oli becoming the Prime Minister for the next one and a half years, followed by Deuba for the remaining term until the next election.This development is set to collapse the government formed on March 4, led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda with a formal announcement expected soon.The agreement, signed overnight, allows KP Sharma Oli to lead the government initially while Deuba will take over after one and a half years. The formal announcement of this new alliance is expected soon. “Agreement has been signed between Nepali Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli overnight to form a new government. As per which Oli will lead the government for the next one and a half years and Deuba the remaining time until the election which lies three years ahead,” a senior Nepali Congress leader present at the meeting told news agency ANI.The two parties also agreed on the division of ministries. According to a UML leader, the party leading the government will not get the home ministry. Apart from the central government, the two parties also agreed on the distribution of leadership in various provinces. The CPN-UML will lead the governments in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces, while the Congress will lead in Bagmati, Gandaki, and Far-Western provinces. The Madhesh-based parties will head the government in Madhesh Province. The UML leader confirmed, “The party who will be leading the government will not get the Home Ministry has been agreed. Apart from the union government, the CPN-UML will be forming a government in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces while the Congress will lead the Bagmati, Gandaki and Far-Western provinces. The Madhesh-based parties will lead the government in Madhesh Province has been agreed between the two leaders.”Additionally, the new alliance has established a committee to suggest amendments to the election procedures and the constitution. The committee is led by former Chief Justice Kalyan Shrestha. The largest and second-largest parties in the parliament also drafted a constitutional amendment agreement, which states that the Vice President would be made the chairman of the National Assembly.Before signing, leaders from the Congress and UML briefed President Ram Chandra Paudel about the coalition change. During their meeting, the leaders informed the President about activating Section 76 (2) to form a new government if the incumbent Prime Minister, Prachanda, failed to take a vote of confidence after UML withdrew its support.Prachanda, who came to power after the 2022 general elections and has tested the floor of parliament four times, must now seek a new vote of confidence. There has been no immediate reaction from the Maoist Center, led by Prachanda, regarding the change in coalition. However, during Monday's cabinet meeting, Dahal assured the ministers that the current alliance would remain intact.The minister for communication and information technology Rekha Sharma, quoting Dahal, said, “The reports in the media are just rumors. We are still in dialogue with our coalition partners.” “The Prime Minister briefed us on the internal situation and dismissed external rumors. There are concerns about what will happen to this government, but there will be no changes. Some want this coalition to be short-lived, but we are determined to keep this government stable for a long time,” she added.Earlier on March 4, Prachanda revived a coalition with the CPN-UML, surprising the largest coalition partner, Nepali Congress. A new coalition, including the CPN-UML, CPN-Maoist Center, Rastriya Swatantra Party, and Janata Samajwadi Party, was initially formed. However, the Nepali Congress formally withdrew its support the following day, activating Article 100 Sub-section (2). According to this article, a Prime Minister is required to secure the threshold of 50 percent, which is 138 votes as per the present number of parliamentarians.As a result of the coalition split, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal also left the government and joined the opposition. Pushpa Kamal Dahal came to power in December 2022 by aligning with arch-rival CPN-UML, after previously forging an alliance with the Nepali Congress for the November 2022 election.The vote of confidence on January 10, 2023, saw extensive support for Dahal, with 268 out of 270 present parliamentarians voting in favor, marking the highest percentage in the known history of the Nepali parliament since the establishment of democracy. However, within three months, Dahal realigned with the Nepali Congress, securing a majority in the vote of confidence on March 20, 2023. In this second vote, Dahal received 172 votes out of 262 lawmakers present, with 89 votes against him, while one abstained.","The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) ( CPN-UML ) struck a deal to form a new coalition government.
