"US elections 2024: ‘If you win Pennsylvania, you win the whole thing’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-2024-if-you-win-pennsylvania-you-win-the-whole-thing-trump-prepares-for-debate-with-harris-in-swing-state/articleshow/113178899.cms,"The political spotlight will shine brightly on Pennsylvania Tuesday night, as Donald Trump and Kamala Harris take the stage in Philadelphia for a high-stakes debate in the most populous swing state. With polls showing a tight race, both candidates know that Pennsylvania could determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948, making the stakes even higher for Harris.Trump, meanwhile, is looking to repeat his 2016 success in the state, where he narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton before losing to Joe Biden in 2020.“People say, ‘If you win Pennsylvania, you’re going to win the whole thing,’” Trump told supporters in Wilkes-Barre last month. The former president has made frequent visits to Pennsylvania, where he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt during a speech in Butler County in July. Harris, too, has been a frequent visitor, with plans to return on Friday to continue rallying her base.The debate is set to take place at the National Constitution Center, located in Philadelphia, a Democratic stronghold. Harris aims to reassemble the coalition of voters that helped Biden win in 2020, focusing on mobilizing key groups such as college students, Black voters, and women motivated by the protection of abortion rights. Winning big in Philadelphia and its suburbs will be crucial for Harris as she tries to offset Trump’s dominance in the state’s rural areas.Republicans are banking on voters’ concerns about the economy and inflation, hoping to chip away at Democrats' stronghold in Pennsylvania’s suburban areas. “A lot of people are saying, ‘We need the American economy to become strong again,’” said Lawrence Tabas, chair of Pennsylvania’s Republican Party.While Harris is focused on economic issues like capping prescription drug prices and lowering childcare costs, the debate may prove pivotal in winning over undecided voters. Political experts suggest that many Pennsylvanians are still learning about Harris as a candidate, with her late entry into the race leaving room for voters to make up their minds before Election Day.The path to the presidency runs through Pennsylvania, and with both candidates eyeing the state's electoral votes, the outcome of this debate could play a decisive role in shaping the 2024 race.","Pennsylvania could determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.

Nefertiti Bust: Egyptian scientist starts petition to return Nefertiti bust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/egyptian-scientist-starts-petition-to-return-nefertiti-bust/articleshow/113178139.cms,"What does the petition say?

What does Germany say about the bust?

Egypt 's former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass has launched a petition to urge Germany to return the pharaonic bust of Queen Nefertiti, which is currently housed in Berlin's Neues Museum.Believed to have been crafted in 1345 BC, a German archaeological team discovered the painted limestone bust in 1912 and shipped it to Europe a year later.It was uncovered in the remains of the city of Amarna , the short-lived capital under Pharaoh Akhenaten, Nefertiti's husband.The city was abandoned after he died in 1335 BC.Amarna sits on the east bank of the Nile River and is located in the province of Minya.Hawass asked for the return of the bust, saying it was removed from Egypt illegally after its discovery more than a century ago.""We announce today that Egypt — this is the national committee, it is not a government committee — asks for the return of the bust of Nefertiti,"" Hawass said.""What I need from everyone here is to go to my website...hawasszahi.com, and you will sign, one signature, to show that you would love for this bust to come back.""Hawass said he is not calling for the repatriation of artifacts taken out of Egypt legally.His campaign is focused on repatriating ""three main beautiful objects"" including the bust of Nefertiti, the Rosetta Stone and the Dendera Zodiac .The Rosetta Stone is an ancient Egyptian stone bearing inscriptions in several languages and scripts, which led to the understanding of hieroglyphic writing. It is currently on display in the British Museum in London.The Zodiac of Dendera is a giant stone diagram from a temple in Egypt dating to the mid-1st century BC, which is currently in the Louvre in Paris.The German side says that Egypt authorized Germany to launch an excavation to locate the Nefertiti bust for its museums in Berlin.The deal included a 50:50 split of some 10,000 artifacts found in exchange for financing by German cotton and textile magnate and arts patron James Simon, according to German art experts.A representative from the Egyptian government selected half of the objects, while the other half was taken to Germany, including the bust, which was displayed in the Neues Museum several years later and has become a major tourist attraction.A row between Germany and Egypt, which was then a British protectorate, erupted shortly afterward over who should hold the sculpture.During World War II, the bust was hidden away and, toward the end of the conflict, was moved to the Egyptian Museum in West Berlin where it stayed until it was delivered back to the Neues Museum in 2009.Over several decades, Cairo has repeatedly called for the bust's return, accusing German Egyptologist Ludwig Borchard, who led the excavation, of smuggling it out of the country.When asked by the Reuters news agency, Berlin's Neues Museum was not immediately available for comment on the petition.April marked the bust's 100th anniversary on display in Berlin's Neues Museum.",Egypt's former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass has launched a petition to return the bust.

The shooting , which occurred on Wednesday at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, resulted in the deaths of four individuals and injuries to nine others.On the morning of the shooting, Marcee Gray received an alarming text message from her son, who later confessed to the attack.The message, which read, “I’m sorry, mom,” was sent to Marcee before the shooting occurred. Charles Polhamus, Marcee’s father, described being with his daughter at his home in Fitzgerald, Georgia, when she received the troubling text.According to Polhamus, the cryptic message prompted Marcee Gray to act quickly. She called Apalachee High School to report an unspecified ""extreme emergency"" involving Colt Gray. The 10-minute call took place around 9:50 a.m., approximately 30 minutes before authorities were alerted about the shooting. Marcee’s sister, Annie Brown, confirmed the call to the Washington Post, which was later reported by CNN.Following the call, Marcee Gray and her mother drove 200 miles from Fitzgerald to Winder, Georgia, in a desperate attempt to reach her son and prevent any potential harm. Despite their efforts, the shooting occurred shortly after.Marcee Gray later confirmed to the Washington Post that she had indeed made the call but chose not to elaborate on what specifically prompted her to reach out.

His father, Colin Gray, has been charged with multiple counts including involuntary manslaughter, following revelations that he purchased the rifle used in the shooting as a holiday gift for his son.The shooting has shocked the community, with the Barrow County School District and local authorities facing scrutiny. CNN reached out to both the district and the Piedmont Judicial Circuit District Attorney’s Office for comment but had not received a response by Saturday evening.As the community grapples with the aftermath, Marcee Gray’s apology underscores the profound personal and emotional toll of the tragedy. “I am deeply sorry for what has happened and the impact it has had on so many lives,” she said.","Colt Gray, 14, has been charged with four counts of murder and will be tried as an adult.

Trump threatens 100% tariff to defend dollar’s global dominance: Implications for India and beyond,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-threatens-100-tariff-to-defend-dollars-global-dominance-implications-for-india-and-beyond/articleshow/113177036.cms,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump announced a bold new strategy to safeguard the US dollar ’s global dominance during his rally in Wisconsin on Saturday. Trump vowed to impose a 100% tariff on goods from countries that shift away from using the dollar in international trade.“You leave the dollar and you’re not doing business with the United States because we are going to put a 100 percent tariff on your goods,” Trump declared, underscoring his protectionist stance .This threat is part of a broader tariff platform aimed at countering efforts by countries like China, India, and others to de-dollarize their trade.The announcement follows extensive discussions between Trump and his economic advisers about how to penalize nations engaging in trade with currencies other than the dollar. Possible measures have included export controls, currency manipulation charges, and tariffs, as reported by Bloomberg News.Trump, who has consistently championed protectionist policies, asserted that the dollar has been “under major siege” for the past eight years. This stance comes in the wake of a recent summit where China, India, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa explored de-dollarization strategies. Trump, however, reaffirmed his commitment to maintaining the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.Despite a gradual decrease in dollar dominance, the US currency still represented 59% of official foreign-exchange reserves in early 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund. The euro follows with nearly 20%.In the fiercely contested race for the White House, Wisconsin is a key battleground state where Trump and Democratic rival Kamala Harris are vying for the support of working-class voters disillusioned with President Joe Biden’s economic policies. A recent Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll shows Harris leading Trump by 8 percentage points in Wisconsin, the largest margin in the seven battleground states surveyed.Trump’s rally in Wisconsin capped off a campaign swing that included stops in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, as well as a significant address in New York City focusing on economic issues. Meanwhile, Harris spent Saturday in Pennsylvania preparing for her upcoming debate with Trump, a critical event that could influence the tight race.As Trump’s campaign continues to emphasize economic nationalism and defense of the dollar, the global implications for countries like India, which has been part of de-dollarization discussions, remain significant. The unfolding dynamics between the US and its international trade partners will likely be a key focus in the months leading up to the election.","Donald Trump vowed to impose a 100% tariff on goods from countries that shift away from using the dollar in international trade.

The poll, conducted nationwide with 1,695 respondents, has a margin of error of 2.8 points, making the race effectively a statistical tie.This new data comes as enthusiasm among Democrats surged following President Joe Biden’s unexpected decision to step aside from the 2024 presidential race in July, endorsing Harris to lead the party.Despite the bump in Democratic momentum, polls remain tight, with Harris and Trump alternating between narrow leads or tying in recent surveys.FiveThirtyEight, which ranks pollsters based on accuracy and methodology, named Times/Siena as the most reliable in the nation. Polling averages currently reflect a tight race, with most showing Harris holding a slim national lead.Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told Newsweek, ""Polling shows President Trump is dominating both nationally and in the battleground states because voters want a return to pro-America policies that actually work, not the weak, failed, and dangerously liberal policies of Comrade Kamala.""As national averages give Harris a slight advantage, the race is expected to come down to key battleground states like Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. In recent swing state polling, Harris holds a narrow lead in Michigan and Wisconsin, while the two candidates are tied in Pennsylvania.The tight polling sets the stage for a crucial moment on Tuesday night when Harris and Trump are set to debate on ABC News.

A tragic outcome

Marcee Gray , a former engineer from Fitzgerald, Georgia , has been thrust into the spotlight following the tragic shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia. Her son, Colt Gray , 14, has been charged with the murder of four people in the incident.Marcee Gray’s professional life seemed to be on an upward trajectory.She reportedly earned a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Management from Georgia Southern University in 2005 and a Master’s degree in Occupational Safety and Health from Columbia Southern University in 2008. Her career included notable positions such as Quality Engineering Supervisor at Toyota Industries, North America, and Quality Manager at Olympic Steel.However, her career was cut short in 2021, with her LinkedIn profile showing her final roles as Quality Assurance Manager at Georgia Pacific LLC and Senior Quality Engineer at PCC Airfoils, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Marcee's personal life, however, tells a starkly different story. Arrested in 2023 on charges related to drug possession, trafficking, and vehicle theft, her criminal record reveals a history of drug abuse and domestic violence, reported the New York Post. According to her sister, Annie Polhamus Brown, Marcee's addiction and subsequent actions have deeply affected their family. “Marcee destroyed our family with her drug addiction,” Polhamus Brown said in social media posts.Marcee’s tumultuous relationship with her husband, Colin Gray, was marked by allegations of abuse. Marcee herself detailed the abusive nature of her marriage in social media posts, explaining why she stayed for 14 years: “I made a commitment to the Lord and my husband. No one but me understands the pain that my husband lives with every single day,” she wrote.Neighbors and family members paint a grim picture of Colt’s upbringing, reported the New York Post. Lauren Vickers, a neighbor, described frequent disturbances and neglect: “There were nights where the mom would lock him and his sister out the house… It was constant abuse.” Charles Polhamus, Colt’s maternal grandfather, described Colt as “a good kid” in a “hostile” environment, suffering from the abuse he and his mother endured.Investigations are now focusing on the family's interactions with child protective services. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into Colt’s mental health struggles and his family’s failure to address them adequately.The situation worsened when Colin Gray, who works in construction, reportedly bought Colt an AR-15 rifle for Christmas. Colin has been charged with multiple counts, including involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children. The GBI’s Chris Hosey emphasized that these charges stem from Colin’s decision to allow Colt to possess the weapon.Annie Brown expressed frustration at the adults who failed to help Colt, saying, “The adults around him failed him.”Colt Gray has been charged as an adult with four counts of murder following the Apalachee High School shooting. The tragic case highlights a profound failure within a family that once seemed capable of so much more.","Marcee Gray, a former engineer from Fitzgerald, Georgia, has been thrust into the spotlight following the tragic shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia.

Nile crocodiles: A fearsome species

Cassius: The largest crocodile

A massive 16-foot, 700 kg Nile crocodile named Henry , has been officially recognised as the world's oldest crocodile at 123 years old. The crocodile has fathered over 10,000 offspring with his six mates, according to the zoo where he inhabits.Henry, known for his big size and fearsome fangs, is nearly equivalent to that of a minibus. He was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana , a Unesco World Heritage Site .In the early 1900s, Henry was believed to have preyed on children from a local Botswana tribe. Frustrated with his deadly behavior, the tribe sought the help of renowned hunter Sir Henry Neumann in 1903. Instead of killing Henry, Neumann opted to capture him, sentencing the crocodile to a lifetime in captivity.Henry has spent the last thirty years at the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh, South Africa. He is admired from a safe distance at the conservation centre, far removed from his violent past.Nile crocodiles, found across 26 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, are known for their aggressive nature. These apex predators inhabit various aquatic environments, including lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshes. Known for their brutality, Nile crocodiles often prey on animals such as zebras and porcupines. Tragically, hundreds of people fall victim to these formidable predators each year.Although Henry holds the title of the oldest crocodile, Cassius, a 16-foot saltwater crocodile from Australia, is known as the largest. Captured in 1984, Cassius is a prominent feature at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island, off the coast of Queensland. In 2011, he was officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the world’s largest living saltwater crocodile.","Henry was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.

The discovery could potentially offer a drastic boost to the nation's economy, according to a Pakistani senior security official quoted by DawnNewsTV.The official explained that the survey has successfully identified the location of the reserves, and relevant government bodies have been informed.These resources, located in the depths of Pakistani waters, represent a critical step towards capitalising what the official referred to as the "" blue water economy .""While this discovery could lead to a major boost for Pakistan’s energy sector, the process of exploration is still in its early stages.The work of digging wells and actually getting oil out could take several years. The official also talked about the potential of the blue water economy, pointing out that valuable minerals and elements could be extracted from the ocean, providing additional economic benefits for Pakistan.Estimates suggest that this discovery could be among the world’s largest oil and gas reserves , potentially placing Pakistan as the holder of the fourth-largest deposit globally.Venezuela currently leads in terms of oil reserves, with approximately 3.4 billion barrels, followed by countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Canada, and Iraq. The US is also notable for holding the most significant untapped shale oil reserves.In an interview with DawnNewsTV, Muhammad Arif, a former member of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) said that while the discovery is a positive development, there is no guarantee the reserves will be as large or easily recoverable as initially hoped.He said, ""If this is a gas reserve, it can replace LNG imports and if these are oil reserves, we can substitute imported oil.""The significant financial investment needed to explore offshore oil and gas reserves, estimating the cost at around $5 billion just for exploration, further claimed Arif.","A significant deposit of petroleum and natural gas has been discovered within Pakistan's territorial waters.

Muted microphones to ensure civility

Speaking format and debate structure

Strict rules on props and interaction

High stakes in a close race

In what is shaping up to be a historic and highly anticipated showdown, US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet in a head-to-head debate on Tuesday night. The event marks the first time the two will directly face off as they vie for the presidency in what has become a closely contested race.The debate, which will be hosted by ABC, follows weeks of heated negotiations between the two campaigns regarding the format, rules , and logistics.As the campaigns sharpen their strategies, voters are eager to witness the direct exchange of ideas and positions between two of the country’s most prominent political figures.The debate will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, a fitting location given its historical significance in American democracy. The 90-minute event is scheduled to start at 9:00 pm local time on Tuesday (6.30 IST Wednesday), and it will be aired live across major networks. Unlike previous debates, this one will take place without an audience in the room, an effort to minimize distractions and ensure the focus remains solely on the candidates.Moderating the debate will be ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, both seasoned journalists known for their sharp questioning and ability to handle tense moments. The debate will feature two commercial breaks, offering brief pauses during what promises to be a charged exchange.One of the most hotly debated topics leading up to the event was whether microphones would be muted, a feature used in the past to prevent interruptions. This issue reignited tensions between the campaigns, with each side accusing the other of dodging tough questions. Trump’s team argued against mic muting, claiming it stifles free speech, while Harris’s camp pointed to past debates where constant interruptions derailed meaningful discussion.ABC ultimately decided that each candidate’s microphone would be live only during their allotted speaking time. When one candidate is speaking, the other’s mic will be muted, ensuring a smoother exchange. Only the moderators will have the authority to ask questions, and no topics or questions have been shared with the candidates beforehand, further adding to the anticipation surrounding the event.There will be no opening statements from the candidates, a departure from typical debate formats. Instead, the candidates will dive directly into answering questions, with each given two minutes per question to state their position. Following this, their opponent will have two minutes to rebut, creating an opportunity for direct engagement on each topic. An additional minute will be provided for follow-ups, clarifications, or further responses, allowing both Trump and Harris to refine their arguments or counter the other’s claims.At the end of the debate, both candidates will have the chance to deliver two-minute closing statements, with Trump going last due to the result of a virtual coin toss. This structure ensures that each candidate will have ample time to make their case while maintaining the debate’s brisk pace.To maintain a level playing field and avoid theatrics, the debate will follow strict rules regarding props and materials. Both candidates will stand behind podiums for the entire duration of the event, and neither will be allowed to bring props or pre-written notes to the stage. They will be equipped with only a pen, a pad of paper, and a bottle of water. This eliminates any opportunity for one candidate to gain an advantage through visual aids or pre-prepared statements.Additionally, campaign staff will not be permitted to communicate or interact with the candidates during the commercial breaks, reinforcing the expectation that Harris and Trump must rely solely on their own preparation and quick thinking.This debate comes at a critical juncture in the election, as polls show a dead heat between the two candidates. For Trump, the event represents an opportunity to demonstrate his continued appeal to voters and defend his record in office. For Harris, the debate is a chance to solidify her position as a presidential contender and challenge Trump’s policies head-on.With the nation watching, both candidates are expected to come prepared for a fiery exchange. The outcome of the debate could shape the direction of the race in its final weeks, making it a must-watch event for voters on all sides of the political spectrum.","US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet in a head-to-head debate on Tuesday night.

'India does not have respect for ... '

Rahul on AI

NEW DELHI: Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , on his three-day visit to the United States, addressed pressing issues such as unemployment , education , and technology. He remarked that both the West and India are grappling with job crises and advocated for India to ""boost its own production "" to combat unemployment.Rahul said that while many countries are grappling with unemployment, some, such as China and Vietnam, are not facing such difficulties.Gandhi traced the roots of this issue to historical shifts in global production. “The West, including the United States and Europe, once led global production in the mid-20th century,” he said.He noted a significant change over the decades, with production gradually relocating from the US to South Korea, Japan, and eventually China. Today, China dominates global production, a shift Gandhi attributes to Western and Indian retreat from manufacturing.“The West, including America and Europe, has largely abandoned the manufacturing sector, leaving it to countries like China and Vietnam,” the LoP in Lok Sabha explained.The Congress MP added that India needs to reimagine its approach to production. “India cannot simply accept that manufacturing will be the domain of other countries,” he said. “We need to develop our own manufacturing capabilities in a way that aligns with democratic principles.”Reflecting on his recent Bharat Jodo Yatra, Gandhi shared how it reshaped his political outlook. “The Bharat Jodo Yatra fundamentally changed the way I think about my work,” he said. He discussed how the Yatra introduced the concept of love into political discourse, which is rare globally. “The most powerful thing that happened organically was the introduction of the idea of love in politics,” Gandhi mentioned.Talking about education and skills in India, Rahul suggested that the real issue is not a lack of skills but a lack of respect for skilled individuals. “India does not have respect for people who possess skills,” he remarked. He criticised the disconnect between the education system and the business sector, advocating for better integration through vocational training. “Our education system doesn’t connect with the business system. Bridging that gap through vocational training is fundamental,” Rahul said.Regarding Artificial Intelligence (AI), Gandhi acknowledged both its challenges and opportunities. “Every time you get a new technology, the argument is made that it’s going to take jobs away,” the Congress MP said. However, he also pointed out that while AI might displace some jobs, it will create new ones as well. “It’s going to hit different people differently. If you position it properly, it’s an opportunity; if not, you’re in trouble,” Gandhi explained.Rahul Gandhi made his remarks during a live interaction with students at the University of Texas in Dallas, USA.Gandhi arrived in Dallas on Sunday and was welcomed by Sam Pitroda, Chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress, and members of the Indian diaspora.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi is on a three-day visit to the United States.

Evacuation and firefighting efforts intensify

Heatwave and air quality worsen conditions

An out-of-control wildfire in the foothills of San Bernardino National Forest , east of Los Angeles, is threatening tens of thousands of homes and structures. As of Sunday, over 35,000 buildings, including single-family homes, commercial properties, and apartment complexes, are at risk. The fire, known as the Line Fire, has been burning since Thursday evening, and local authorities have issued evacuation orders across several areas.Three firefighters have been injured as they fight the blaze, which has already scorched about 27 square miles of land. More than 600 firefighters are working to contain the fire, supported by helicopters dropping water over threatened areas. Thunderstorms expected later in the day could complicate efforts, with authorities warning that conditions remain extremely dangerous.With the wildfire spreading rapidly, San Bernardino County declared a local emergency on Saturday evening. Governor Gavin Newsom followed up by proclaiming a state of emergency for the region and securing federal support from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to aid firefighting efforts.The extreme heatwave affecting Southern California , with temperatures exceeding 100°F, has fueled the fire’s intensity. Low humidity and dry vegetation have created ideal conditions for the flames to spread, according to state officials. The National Weather Service has issued warnings about air quality due to smoke and excessive heat, with temperatures soaring across the region.Evacuation orders have been issued for communities including Running Springs, Arrowbear Lake, and several other regions east of Highway 330. Thousands of residents have been displaced as firefighters work to protect homes from the encroaching fire.The fire, which began Thursday evening, remains 0% contained, and its cause is still under investigation. The National Weather Service warned that thunderstorms could spark new fires and worsen conditions for the firefighters on the ground.Despite the intense firefighting efforts, no homes have been reported damaged yet. Helicopters and other aircraft have been deployed to aid ground crews as they attempt to slow the fire’s spread.In addition to the fire, Southern California is enduring sweltering temperatures, with downtown Los Angeles reaching 112°F on Friday, one of the highest temperatures recorded in the city since 1877. Excessive heat warnings remain in place across the region, further complicating the firefighting efforts. Residents are advised to stay indoors due to both the heat and poor air quality resulting from wildfire smoke.The Line Fire is one of several active wildfires in California. Other fires, like the Roblar Fire in San Diego County and the Davis Fire near Reno, Nevada, have also caused significant damage and forced evacuations. In Nevada, the Davis Fire has destroyed 12 structures and burned more than 1,500 acres.","The Line Fire has scorched 27 square miles of land in the San Bernardino National Forest, east of Los Angeles.

Former ambassdor to the UN Nikki Haley took aim at Senator J.D. Vance ’s comments about ""childless cat ladies"" during a recent interview on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" labeling them unproductive and urging Republicans to avoid such rhetoric. Haley underscored the need to focus on substantive issues rather than personal attacks, highlighting the significance of policies over style.""Style is, no, it is not helpful to talk about whether women have children or whether they don't,"" she told CBS, adding, ""I have said that and I will continue to say to Republicans, stop it, that's not helpful.""Haley also discussed her disagreements with former President Donald Trump While she supports many of his policies, she differs on some of his ideas and methods, particularly his recent proposal to mandate insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF).With personal experience in fertility treatments, Haley argued that while IVF should be accessible, mandating coverage could increase insurance costs and may not be the most effective solution.""We want that option to be available to everyone. But the way you do it is you don't mandate coverage. Instead, you go and you make sure that coverage is accessible, and you make sure that you're doing everything you can to make it affordable,"" she told CBS.Haley said that she believes that the implementation of robust immigration measures, the maintenance of law and order, the creation of economic opportunities, and the strengthening of national security would improve the lives of American citizens.On the topic of childcare, Haley contested Trump’s claim that it is relatively inexpensive, recognizing the financial burden it poses for many families. Although she expressed concerns about Trump’s proposal to expand child tax credits, suggesting it could lead to inequities, she advocated for broad tax cuts as a more effective way to provide relief to all Americans.Although Haley disagrees with Trump on certain issues, she has continued to offer her support for his presidential campaign. She revealed that while she hasn't been officially asked to campaign for him, she remains on standby if needed.""I spoke with him in June,"" Haley said. ""He knows I’m ready to help if he ever asks.""Despite their past differences, Haley endorsed Trump at the Republican National Convention. When asked about her position, she explained that her focus is on the policies she believes would benefit the country rather than on personal disagreements.""I don't need to like someone 100% of the time to know their policies are better for America,"" she said.As the first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris approaches, Haley remains ready to assist Trump if called upon, but she’s not actively advising him at this time.""I'm happy to be helpful if he asks,"" Haley said.Indian-American Nikki Haley, who once competed against Donald Trump in the Republican presidential race, suspended her campaign following Super Tuesday’s results.

Popular Hawaii hiking trail shut after 37 fall sick in 'rare' norovirus outbreak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/popular-hawaii-hiking-trail-shut-after-37-fall-sick-in-rare-norovirus-outbreak/articleshow/113173701.cms,"A popular hiking trail on the island of Kauai in Hawaii was closed this week after more than three dozen people fell ill in what officials said was a ""rare occurrence"" of the highly contagious norovirus . Kalalau Trail , a 22-mile round-trip stretch within Napali Coast State Wilderness Park , was recommended to remain closed until at least Sept 19 while health department officials assessed the risk of transmission and as stations along the trail were disinfected.Health department received reports of illness from at least 37 hikers and campers over the past several weeks, though the actual number is expected to be higher, officials said.""This is a very concerning and rare occurrence, magnified by the extreme remote nature of Kalalau Valley,"" Curt Cottrell, an administrator for state parks, said.The trail was closed Wednesday after health officials received several reports of gastrointestinal illnesses from hikers, and Thursday health department said test results from four patients confirmed they had contracted norovirus.The state's department of land and natural resources said dozens of backpackers had reported gastrointestinal illness , and one person was evacuated but no one had been hospitalised. ""All it takes is one person to spread the virus, which can be on surfaces, in soil and in water,"" said department spokesman Dan Dennison.Norovirus is highly contagious and typically causes vomiting, often accompanied by fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea as the stomach or intestines become inflamed. It spreads easily, and is common in tightly packed spaces, but it can also be transmitted across contaminated surfaces. Most people recover after several days, but severe infections can occur in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems.Kalalau Trail allows up to 80 people with permits to camp overnight, and composting toilets are available. One way that norovirus can spread is through contact with fecal matter.The open air might help dilute the virus ""but mostly it's just being around people that are ill and shedding the virus"" that aids in spreading it, said Donald Schaffner of Rutgers University. The spread in a ventilated environment such as a trail ""is possible due to virus transmissibility and challenges to hand hygiene and sanitation,"" department of land and natural resources said.""Hiking is one of the activities that is a risk"" for the virus, said Stuart C Ray, professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. ""The problem is people don't have good access to clean water, and they can't wash their hands.""

"‘Just let him die’ – Donald Trump allegedly insulted disabled family member, claims relative",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/just-let-him-die-donald-trump-allegedly-insulted-disabled-family-member-claims-relative/articleshow/113173451.cms,"Fred Trump , the nephew of former President Donald Trump , has sparked controversy with the release of his new book, All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way. In the book, Fred accuses his uncle of making cruel remarks about disabled Americans, including Fred's own son, William , who suffers from severe developmental disabilities. Fred claims that during Donald Trump’s time in office, he suggested that people with disabilities, like William, “should just die” because of the high cost of care.He made these claims while speaking to The Independent’s Sheila Flynn, recalling a meeting at the White House where Trump allegedly said, “Those people … the shape they’re in, all the expenses, maybe those kinds of people should just die.” Fred was stunned by the comment, especially since William is Donald Trump’s great-nephew.William, born in 1999, requires 24/7 care due to a range of physical and developmental issues. Fred and his wife, Lisa, have been dedicated advocates for disability rights ever since. The family has faced challenges not only due to William’s condition but also because of tensions with the larger Trump family. Fred recounts a phone call in 2020 where he asked Donald Trump for help with William’s mounting medical costs. Trump reportedly responded, “He doesn’t recognize you. Maybe you should just let him die and move down to Florida.” Fred expressed his horror, adding, “How could one human being say that about another human being, least of all his grand-nephew?”The book not only highlights Fred’s personal battle for disability rights but also sheds light on the complicated and, at times, toxic relationships within the Trump family. Fred and his sister Mary were disinherited from their grandfather Frederick Trump’s estate after a legal battle that ended in 2001. He believes his uncle Donald played a key role in pressuring their grandfather, who was suffering from dementia at the time, to cut them out of the will. “It was nowhere near what my grandfather intended,” Fred wrote in his book.Despite these personal grievances, Fred insists that his primary goal is to shine a light on the challenges people with disabilities face and to advocate for better care, resources, and training for caregivers. He believes his famous family name can help amplify this message. “I have a national platform,” Fred told The Independent. “There’s nobody out there just shouting from the rooftops, if you will, saying this needs to be done.”Fred also criticised Donald Trump's capacity to evade responsibility, alleging that his uncle regularly sidesteps criticism and downplays his divisive comments. “Oh, I didn’t mean it that way, I wasn’t making fun of that reporter, what are you talking about?” Fred told the Independent, citing instances in the past where Donald Trump said hurtful things about people with disabilities.While the release of his book has further strained relations with the Trump family, Fred says he is at peace with the fallout. He remains committed to his advocacy work and believes that the exposure of these family dynamics will help the cause of disability rights. “I’ll reach out to him again,” Fred said of Donald Trump. “I have no fear.”","Fred Trump, the nephew of former President Donald Trump, has released his new book, All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way.

New York, Sep 08, 2024 (AFP) -From Gerald Ford's catastrophic Soviet gaffe to Ronald Reagan's witty remark about his age and Joe Biden's infamous implosion, US presidential debates have featured jaw-dropping moments.Here are some of the most memorable in modern US politics.It was the first televised debate of its kind, when broadcasts were in black-and-white, and it established the importance of a politician's public image.Republican Richard Nixon looked poised to win the election, having served two terms as vice president under Dwight Eisenhower.But the debate did not go well for him. Nixon refused to wear makeup and appeared pale and sweaty in front of more than 66 million viewers, while young Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy looked tanned and relaxed. While Nixon addressed the moderator, Kennedy looked at the camera, speaking directly to his voters.How much the debate visuals pushed the needle is disputed, but Kennedy went on to defeat Nixon at the polls.The first debate between Republican president Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter was marked by a 27-minute loss of audio. The second debate didn't go well for Ford either, when he made a gaffe that arguably cost him the presidency.At the height of the Cold War, Ford uttered that ""there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration,"" even though the Soviet Union had troops deployed across the Eastern bloc.Six days passed before Ford explained himself, saying he spoke not of the literal military presence but meant that people's spirits there hadn't been crushed.Republican president Ronald Reagan was 73 when he ran for a second term against 56-year-old Walter Mondale. But he turned his age into his strength with a witty answer that went down in history.""I will not make age an issue of this campaign,"" Reagan said when asked whether he was fit for office. ""I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.""The second presidential debate in the 1992 race pitted incumbent president George Bush against both his future successor Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, an independent candidate.Bush was caught on camera looking at his watch while Clinton talked to an audience member during a town hall debate, a move that cost Bush dearly.Years later, Bush admitted he hated debates. ""Maybe that's why I was looking at it -- 'Only 10 more minutes of this crap.'""During a debate against president Barack Obama, Republican challenger Mitt Romney lamented that the US Navy had fewer ships presently than it did in 1916.""Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed,"" Obama retorted.""We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go under water, nuclear submarines.""Obama's comments went viral.The second debate of the 2016 US presidential election pitting Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was particularly vicious.Coming shortly after the release of a video in which Trump was heard boasting that his fame allowed him to grope women, the Republican billionaire went after his opponent's husband, former president Bill Clinton, accusing him of being ""so abusive to women.""Trump also vowed to have Hillary Clinton investigated over her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state.""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,"" Clinton said.Trump shot back: ""Because you'd be in jail.""The first debate of the 2020 presidential election, featuring Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, devolved into shouting and insults.With Trump constantly interrupting him, Biden snapped, saying, ""Will you shut up, man?""The Democrat also called his opponent a ""clown"" and ""Putin's puppy.""Trump for his part kept evading the question of whether he would recognize the results of the election.Powerless to control the two candidates, the debate moderator, Fox News journalist Chris Wallace, later described feeling ""desperation.""",Gerald Ford's catastrophic Soviet gaffe arguably cost him the presidency. Ronald Reagan's witty remark about his age went down in history. Joe Biden's infamous implosion in the first debate of the 2020 presidential election.

Imran Khan's party stage rally in Islamabad; demand his immediate release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khans-party-stage-rally-in-islamabad-demand-his-immediate-release/articleshow/113173655.cms,"Jailed former premier Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf on Sunday held a power show, demanding his immediate release while slamming the government for its crackdown on the party as police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The rally - postponed twice in the last two months - was held near Sangjani Cattle Market in the suburbs of Islamabad after the capital administration issued a no-objection certificate (NOC).Thousands of PTI supporters attended the rally, proving that the party's power base was intact despite several hurdles it faced, including the incarceration of its 71-year-old founder.Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been in jail in different cases. On Sunday, Khan completed 400 days in prison.The rally was scheduled to end at 7 pm (local time) as per the NOC. As soon as the deadline ended, the district administration directed the police to take action against the rally-goers for not complying with the NOC.The authorities stated that the organisers violated the rules and regulations by not concluding the gathering before the deadline.In response to the crackdown, PTI workers began pelting stones at police, injuring many security personnel, including Senior Superintendent of Police Shoaib Khan .""Strong turnout for PTI rally despite the state's tactics to limit numbers through roadblocks and containers, and despite the risk of violent crackdowns and arrests. Its size and popularity ensure its mobilization capabilities remain intact despite relentless attempts to curb it,"" Micheal Kugleman, a South Asian expert, said in a post on X.Several PTI leaders addressed the gathering, demanding Khan's immediate release. PTI leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan said the party would not sit until Khan was released.""We are soldiers of Imran Khan and will not sit until he is set free,"" he said, adding that soon Khan would be with his supporters.He condemned physical hurdles put on roads to restrict the movement of participants and also announced that the PTI would now hold rallies across the country.It was the first major rally by the PTI in Islamabad since the February 8 elections. The party wants to exert pressure on the government to release Khan, who languishes in jail despite the courts either acquitting him or giving him bail in all cases he was convicted.PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said the government turned the city into a cage, but still thousands of people attended the rally. ""It shows that Imran Khan is a reality, and you will have to accept it...Imran Khan is a leader and will always be a leader,"" he said.He told the participants that Khan was their only leader who never surrendered and would never surrender. He warned that the PTI would not accept new cases against Khan.Gohar said that the PTI planned this rally for six months and followed Khan's instructions to hold the rally after getting permission from the government. He criticised the government for introducing a new law to restrict political activities.Slogans were raised during the rally demanding Khan's release from jail.He ended his speech with the promise that ""Imran Khan will be soon out of jail and with his people"".The key speech was made by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur who came from Peshawar, leading a large number of Khan's supporters from the province.In his emotional address, he vowed to continue the struggle for the rights of people. He said those who put Khan in jail were being humiliated while ""Khan is winning in jail"".He said that the government gave permission for the rally and blocked all roads leading to the venue of the rally. ""Imran Khan you have won while all others lost,"" he said, vowing to go to any length for Khan.He also announced to hold the next rally in Lahore, irrespective of whether the government gives permission or not.Gandapur also rejected that Khan would be tried under army law, saying no one could do it.Khan has repeatedly shown a willingness to hold talks with the establishment while refusing to sit with the government. So far, all his tactics have failed to get any relief. Mass protest is an option, but his party has been facing pressure to avoid it.Today's rally was a test for both the government and the PTI as it will help them gauge the ground power swell for Khan and fine-tune their policies and tactics in the coming days.Sources told PTI that the Islamabad administration put security on high alert this morning and blocked off multiple arteries leading to the capital city. Hospitals were put on alert by the administration. The Metro bus services were stopped in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Addressing the rally, former minister Hammad Azhar said the hindrance created by the rulers showed that they were afraid of Khan and his supporters.He pointed out that most of the party's Punjab leadership is in jail, paying tribute to incarcerated leaders, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Umar Sarfraz Cheema .Another leader Sher Afzal Marwat said they will soon hold rallies in Punjab for Khan's release and the supremacy of law and the Constitution.""We will enter Punjab with 50,000 people from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa within a week,"" he said, adding that they will even set off on foot and face the tear gas.Additional forces have been summoned to the location where the clash between the police and party workers originally started.Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law the Public Order and Peaceful Assembly Bill 2024 hours before the planned rally, instituting strict measures for unauthorised gatherings.The new law introduces penalties for holding gatherings without permission in Islamabad, with violators facing up to three years in prison and fines. The repeat offenders could be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail.","Thousands of PTI supporters attended the rally, proving that the party's power base was intact.

Shameful, despicable, desperate, cowardly behavior by the illegitimate, authoritarian regime , over & over again. These disgraceful, unlawful acts only strengthen the people's resolve to fight for their 'Haqeeqi Azadi'!""PTI further criticised the actions of law enforcement, calling them ""disgusting and shameful"" and asserting that the crowd had delivered a strong message.""These police officers should be ashamed of themselves, for attacking one of the most peaceful crowds ever. IG Islamabad and tout government should STOP playing with people's lives. This is highly disgusting and shameful, the people sent a huge message today!"" the party added.The rally, which had faced multiple delays due to revoked permissions, finally commenced on the outskirts of Islamabad on Sunday. Despite being denied permission several times earlier, the PTI brought together supporters from across the province, as reported by Dawn.Addressing the rally, senior PTI leader Hammad Azhar said that the gathering was a stand for the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution in Pakistan. ""We will, God willing, secure Imran Khan's release,"" Azhar said, adding that no obstacle would deter their cause.The rally had originally been scheduled for July, then postponed to August, before being further delayed due to security concerns cited by authorities. PTI has been pushing for Imran Khan’s release since his imprisonment in August.Although Khan’s conviction in the Iddat case was recently overturned, his release was blocked by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), which arrested him in connection with a new Toshakhana case shortly after. His previous Toshakhana sentences were suspended, and he was also acquitted in the cipher case by the Islamabad high court.PTI has been trying to secure permission for a public meeting in Islamabad for several months, but the district administration has repeatedly denied their requests, citing security risks. The party even approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in March for approval.In July, PTI announced another protest , but the district administration revoked their non-objection certificate (NOC) at the last moment, delaying the rally until September 8. Despite preparations for the event, the capital police blocked major entry points to the city, citing intelligence reports of a ""medium-level"" terrorism threat linked to the gathering.Senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser decried the government’s preventive measures, including the placement of containers and police blockades. ""It is unfortunate that this fascist government with a stolen mandate is creating such a hostile environment,"" Qaiser said in a video message posted on X. ""They approved the NOC and the court has permitted the rally, but Rawalpindi has been closed off.""PTI Punjab spokesperson Shaukat Basra also claimed that the police in Punjab had received ""unconstitutional"" orders to block workers from joining the rally.","The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) has accused the police of opening fire on its supporters during a rally in Islamabad on Sunday.

"Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan likely to face military trial, says defence minister Khawaja Asif",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/former-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-likely-to-face-military-trial-says-defence-minister-khawaja-asif/articleshow/113166679.cms,"Pakistan's defence minister , Khawaja Asif , has indicated that former Prime Minister Imran Khan will likely face a military trial as legal challenges continue to mount against him. Speaking to a private news channel Geo News, Asif said, ""Evidence against the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) points towards military trial.""Imran Khan has been embroiled in numerous legal cases, including one related to the May 9 riots, where military installations were attacked.Fearing prosecution in a military court, Khan filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking to halt the trial. However, the IHC raised concerns about the petition's validity, citing the absence of a specific first information report (FIR) or supporting documentation.Khan's petition comes amid ongoing legal debates. In December 2023, Pakistan's Supreme Court , in a 5:1 majority ruling, suspended an earlier decision that declared civilians' military trials unlawful. This ruling, tied to the May 9 riots, has left the final decision on military trials pending the court's verdict on intra-court appeals filed by the federal and provincial governments and the defence ministry.Asif also commented on former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, who he claimed aspired to become Pakistan's army chief. Asif alleged that Faiz had reached out to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) seeking support for his bid, offering loyalty in exchange. Faiz, currently facing allegations of land grabbing, was arrested by the army in August.""General (retd) Faiz wanted to become army chief, his name was on the list. He contacted the PML-N leadership in this regard and assured of his loyalty against support for his bid for army chief,"" said Asif.He further noted that Faiz's frustrations grew after the appointment of the current army chief. Asif suggested that Faiz may now try to deflect blame onto others, adding, ""He [Faiz] might say that even if he was part of the conspiracy then the objectives [of conspiracy] were of the PTI founder's and not his.""Meanwhile, Imran Khan, who is currently detained in Adiala Jail, has warned of protests if the government undermines the judiciary's independence. In a message shared on social media, Khan said, ""Pakistan's army belongs to everyone – to the whole nation – not just one political party or the army chief. They robbed the election and are now not allowing the judiciary to function independently.""Khan also criticised the treatment of Pakistan's current leadership in prison, claiming they enjoyed preferential conditions compared to him. ""I have not spent a single day at the prison hospital,"" he said, contrasting his treatment with that of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and others, who, according to him, had access to air-conditioned rooms with en-suite bathrooms during their time in custody.","Khawaja Asif says evidence against Imran Khan points towards military trial.

On both occasions, the military had publicly denied direct involvement, saying indigenous Kashmiri rebels were fighting Indian forces.In 1999, however, thousands of paramilitary Northern Light Infantry regulars, drawn exclusively from Gilgit-Baltistan and skilled in high-altitude combat, were sent to occupy military posts that Indian troops would vacate in the snowy months.They established positions on the heights and commanded a view of the Srinagar-Leh highway, a major supply route for Indian troops stationed on the Siachen glacier.When India detected the incursion in early May 1999, Pakistan had claimed they were Kashmiri militants fighting Indian rule.According to observers, Pakistan had sent troops to Kargil to cut Indian supplies to Siachen, inflict heavy losses on Indian troops and pressure them into negotiating a settlement of the Kashmir dispute on Pakistani terms. Since Islamabad had conducted nuclear tests a year earlier, Pakistani generals were expecting a muted response from India.But the Indians hit back hard, sending infantry backed by artillery and air support. By mid-June the Pakistani positions on the hills began to fall. There were also international calls for Pakistan to withdraw its forces. Evidence suggested the Pakistani military leadership had not shared details of the Kargil operation with the govt of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif . On July 4, Sharif was forced to announce a unilateral ceasefire. His govt was toppled in a military coup two months later.India had reconquered the Kargil heights by July 26. It lost more than 500 troops in the war, while estimates of Pakistani losses range from 400 to about 4,000. Thousands of people made homeless by the war are displaced in Pakistan to this day.","Pakistan's military had attempted on at least two occasions to send its forces into Kashmir to start a rebellion against Indian rule.

NEW DELHI: In a first, Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War , during a recent defence day speech. Previous army chiefs and political leaders, such as Pervez Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif, have acknowledged Pakistan's involvement in the Kargil operation.According to several media reports, General Munir -- while addressing a ceremony at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi to mark the country's 59th Defence Day, said: ""Be it 1948, 1965, 1971 or 1999 Kargil war, thousands of Shuhadas (martyrs) have sacrificed their life for the country and nation.""This marks the first time a serving army chief has openly admitted to the army's direct role in a conflict that has long been shrouded in denial and controversy in Pakistan.The audio of the video, which has been circulated widely online, has not been independently verified.For years, Pakistan's military and political leadership has maintained a narrative that distanced itself from the Kargil operations, often referring to the infiltrators as mere ""Kashmiri freedom fighters"".India has, however, repeatedly said that the operation was a calculated military strategy aimed at altering the Line of Control (LoC) and asserting Pakistan's claim over Kashmir.The Kargil War was characterised by its high-altitude combat and brutal conditions, taking place in one of the most challenging terrains on Earth.The Pakistani military's strategy involved infiltrating troops disguised as militants into Indian territory, occupying strategic heights that overlooked key supply routes.The operation was intended to disrupt Indian logistics and draw international attention to the Kashmir issue, thereby internationalising the longstanding conflict.In strong retaliation to the Pakistan 'infiltrators', between mid-May and July 1999, the Indian Armed Forces gradually recaptured critical positions from the Pakistani infiltrators. The Kargil War officially concluded on July 26, 1999, when the Army announced the complete eviction of Pakistani forces from Indian soil.Over two months, intense battles took place in the challenging mountainous terrain. The Indian Army, as part of Operation Vijay, managed to drive out Pakistani intruders and successfully recaptured Tiger Hill and other strategic positions.","Pakistan army chief publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War.

Additionally, the school children also incur difficulty in completing their homework.Residents of new Karachi Industrial Area Sector 11 F and No 6.5 reported that if electricity is available for an hour during the day, it will be unavailable for three hours at night.""The kunda mafia is making profit by illegal sale of electricity,"" said Shoaib, Shahrukh, Badar, Qudrat Qureshi, and Kamran Qureshi.

The incentivised deals included high guaranteed returns and commitments to even pay for unused power.However, a sustained economic crisis has slashed power consumption, leaving the country with excess capacity that it needs to pay for.Short of funds, the government has built those fixed costs and capacity payments into consumer bills, sparking protests by domestic users and industrial associations.Four sources in the power sector told Reuters changes to contracts demanded included slashing guaranteed returns, capping dollar rates and moving away from paying for unused power. The sources requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.On Saturday, local media outlet Business Recorder said in a report citing sources that 24 conditions have been proposed for the transition of capacity based model to take-and-pay model.However, Leghari told Reuters that no new draft agreements or specific demands had been officially sent to power companies and said the government would not force them to sign new watered down contracts.""We would sit and talk to them in a civil and professional manner,"" he said, adding that the government has always maintained contractual obligations to investors, both foreign and local. He said contract revisions would be by ""mutual consent""Energy sector viability was the focus of a critical staff level pact in May with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $7 billion bailout. The IMF's staff report stressed the need to revisit power deals.Pakistan has already initiated talks on reprofiling power sector debt owed to China as well as negotiations on structural reforms, but progress has been slow. Pakistan has also committed to stop power sector subsidies.Leghari said current rates were not affordable for domestic or commercial consumers and this was hurting growth because power prices were no longer regionally competitive, putting critical exports at a disadvantage.He said the aim was to bring tariffs down to 9 US cents per unit for commercial users from about 28 cents currently.","Pakistan is renegotiating contracts with independent power producers to rein in ""unsustainable"" electricity tariffs.

"Pakistan: In blow to Imran Khan, SC restores changes in anti-corruption law",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-in-blow-to-imran-khan-sc-restores-changes-in-anti-corruption-law/articleshow/113142030.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a victory for the ruling coalition government and a blow to former Prime Minister Imran Khan , the Pakistan Supreme Court reinstated amendments made to the country's National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), overturning its own decision from last year, Geo News reported.A five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faiz Isa and comprising Justice Aminuddin, Justice Jamal Khan Mandukhel, Justice Athar Minallah, and Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi announced the unanimous verdict.Approving the intra-court appeals filed by the federal and provincial governments, Pakistan's apex court remarked that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan could not prove that NAB (National Accountability Bureau) amendments were unconstitutional.Notably, the top anti-graft body and the PTI founder were made respondents in the intra-party appeals.The majority judgement had struck down some amendments made to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999.The amendments -- National Accountability (Second Amendment) Act 2022 -- were passed in a joint sitting of the parliament in April 2022 during the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led government, which came into power after ousting ex-premier Khan via a no-trust move in 2022, as reported by Geo News.It modified sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 25 and 26 of the NAB laws, however, 9 out of 10 amendments were declared ""null and void"" by the CJP Bandial-led bench on the PTI founder's petition filed in June 2022.Referring to the September 15 ruling, the court today pointed out that the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 -- which required that a plea must be heard by ""not less than five judges of the SC"" -- was enacted while Khan's petition was pending adjudication.The top court also noted that the petition challenging the amendments made to the Ordinance was not heard and decided in accordance with the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act -- hereinafter referred to as the ""Act"".In a 2-1 majority verdict announced in September last year, a three-member bench had approved Imran Khan's petition, challenging the NAB law amendments made during the tenure of the previous PDM-led government.Subsequently, the federal government, filed an intra-court appeal against the Pakistan SC judgement in October, stating that the majority judgement suffers from ""procedural impropriety"" and is, therefore, ""liable to be set aside.""Following the amendments, the NAB was restricted to investigating any graft case worth less than Pakistrupees (PKR) 500 million. The accountability body's powers were also curtailed to probe into a fraud case unless its victims are more than 100.The amendments also modified the NAB law to keep an accused in its custody for a maximum of 14 days which was later exceeded to 30 days, Geo News reported.","Pakistan Supreme Court reinstated amendments made to the country's National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), overturning its own decision from last year.

Justice Asim Hafiz, who delivered the verdict, noted that the process was illegal.""Lest anyone misunderstand this, we make it clear that the appointment to any post under the government can only be made after a proper advertisement has been made, inviting applications from eligible candidates. Without holding a proper selection where all eligible candidates get a fair chance to compete would violate the guarantee enshrined under Articles 18 and 27 of the Constitution,"" Hafiz said.""I am afraid that illegality committed by way of an unauthorized appointment, one cannot hide the elephant in a mouse-hole,"" the judge added.The ruling is considered unusual given the powerful role the Pakistan army has traditionally played in the country, including periods of military rule in its more than 75 years of existence.Experts say the high court's decision might be seen as a setback for those who support the current regime, as the military often seeks to place its personnel in major civil positions.",Afsar became the first serving military officer to head Nadra in October 2023.

Starting on September 9, vaccination teams will visit households across 115 districts to immunize over 33 million children under the age of five.Muhammad Anwarul Haq, Coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, echoed this sentiment, emphasising the targeted nature of the upcoming campaign. “We are concentrating our efforts particularly in districts where the virus has been detected, as the threat of continued transmission remains high,” he explained. Haq called upon parents to actively cooperate with health workers during the door-to-door campaign, noting that every missed child could potentially lead to a new outbreak.The country reported only one polio case in 2021. However, 2024 has seen a troubling spike in infections, with 12 cases reported in Balochistan, three in Sindh, and now, one each in Punjab and Islamabad.",Pakistani health authorities confirmed the nation’s first polio case in over 16 years.

Court martial initiated against ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/court-martial-initiated-against-ex-isi-chief-faiz-hameed/articleshow/113104543.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistani army said Thursday that court martial proceedings against former ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (retd) were initiated in the wake of several charges that he violated the Pakistan Army Act .Rumours have been swirling in Islamabad these days that Hameed’s arrest last month could pave the way for a possible military trial of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan over charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the army.The allegations are linked to cases which were filed after Imran's supporters went on a rampage last year following his arrest.Hameed was arrested over charges of graft, misuse of authority and violating the Pakistan Army Act. His arrest, however, has been seen by the opposition as a ploy to implicate Imran in cases linked to May 9 riots. This apprehension had prompted Khan to approach the Islamabad high court on Tuesday, pleading to stop civilian authorities from handing him over to the military. “A few weeks ago, a retired senior army officer (Faiz Hameed) was taken into military custody. It has been widely speculated and reported in the media that he will be made an approver against the petitioner (Imran Khan) in cases pertaining to May 9 and 10, 2023 and the petitioner will be transferred to military custody on this basis,” the petition read.Govt officials have repeatedly said Hameed worked with Khan to plan the riots.Addressing a press conference in Rawalpindi, army’s spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the law takes its own course if a person from the Pakistani army works for personal gain or promotes a specific agenda.“The case of Gen Hameed is a clear example that the army takes violations of its rules very seriously. He (Hameed) had overstepped his legal and constitutional boundaries at the behest of certain political elements,” Chaudhary said.He said Gen Hameed’s case was referred to the Pakistani army through the defence ministry in light of a “full belief in the army’s accountability process”, following which the army ordered a “high-level court of inquiry” into the matter.“There is a clear consensus within the army that it is a national, state-owned institution, which must be prevented from being used against the completion of goals related to specific political agendas.”Khan is being currently tried in a civil court for allegedly abetting the violence on May 9, 2023, a charge he has denied.",Court martial proceedings against former ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (retd) were initiated.
