"Climate Crisis: 'Life's too short': US man purchases $395,000 cliffside home despite warnings that it might erode into the ocean",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lifes-too-short-us-man-purchases-395000-cliffside-home-despite-warnings-that-it-might-erode-into-the-ocean/articleshow/113339345.cms,"A US interior painter and designer bought a cliffside home on Cape Cod for $395,000 despite warnings that it could soon fall into the ocean due to the rapidly eroding coastline. David Moot purchased a three-bedroom house overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, located just 7.6 metres from a crumbling cliff.The waterfront property comes at a discounted price because of the risk of being submerged due to rising sea levels and coastal erosion caused by the climate crisis .""Life's too short, and I just said to myself, 'Let's just see what happens,'"" Moot told Bloomberg . ""It's going to eventually fall into the ocean, and it may or may not be in my lifetime,"" he added.Cape Cod is one of many areas along the east coast of the United States experiencing major beach erosion. Stephen Leatherman, a professor and director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at Florida International University, said the area has an average erosion rate of more than 3 feet per year. ""Along the east coast of the United States, 80% to 90% of the beaches are eroding,"" Leatherman explained. ""This house may look good right now because the beach is wide, but wait till that beach narrows up and the waves are hitting the edge of that bluff just below the house.""The 59-year-old's choice to invest in the home is part of a growing trend where buyers opt for scenic properties at high discounts, despite warnings about the possible threats posed by climate change. According to Bloomberg, Moot bought the house at a 67% discount from the seller's original asking price of $1,195 million in 2022.Before buying the property, Moot consulted experts and carefully studied erosion projections for the surrounding area. He also planned and implemented strategies, including planting beach grass to stabilise the sand and considering moving the house further inland. His research led him to believe he could buy some time before the property submerged into the ocean.Experts like Massachusetts state geologist Brian Yellen note that coastlines made of glacial soils, such as those in the eastern US and northern Europe, are particularly vulnerable to shoreline retreat.Moot remains optimistic and hopes to share his dream home with others. He has expressed interest in allowing terminally ill individuals to visit and enjoy the ocean views. ""This is such a wonderful dream for me that has come true that I would love to be able to share it,"" he told the Boston Globe.","David Moot bought a cliffside home on Cape Cod for $395,000 despite warnings that it could soon fall into the ocean due to the rapidly eroding coastline.

Who was Elijah Vue?

Known for his playful spirit, Elijah’s sudden disappearance in February left his family and community in shock, sparking months of searching and unanswered questions.Elijah had been living in Wisconsin Dells with his mother, Katrina Baur , who left him in the care of her boyfriend, Jesse Vang , on February 12.The plan, she said, was for Vang to help “teach him to be a man.” But what was meant to be a routine visit turned into a devastating nightmare. Days later, on February 20, Vang called police, claiming that while he napped, Elijah vanished from his side.The news of Elijah’s disappearance shook the small city of Two Rivers , a tight-knit community where people rallied together, praying for his safe return. However, as days turned to weeks, hope began to fade. Flyers, search parties, and public appeals couldn’t provide the answers his family so desperately needed.Elijah’s short life came to a heartbreaking end when a hunter discovered his skeletal remains on September 7, just three miles from where he was last seen. Forensic experts confirmed the remains, finally bringing closure to months of uncertainty. But the discovery left many grappling with the same question: What really happened to Elijah?“This is not the outcome we hoped for,” said Two Rivers Police Chief Benjamin Meinnert. “The family is devastated. We are devastated. The community is devastated.”Though Elijah is gone, his story remains one of unanswered questions and unfinished justice. His mother, Baur, and her boyfriend, Vang, have both been charged with child neglect , though they have pleaded not guilty.","Elijah Vue was just three years old when he disappeared in February.

AI chatbot that persuades users to stop believing unfounded conspiracy theories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ai-chatbot-that-persuades-users-to-stop-believing-unfounded-conspiracy-theories/articleshow/113339120.cms,"Shortly after generative artificial intelligence hit the mainstream, researchers warned that chatbots would create a dire problem: As disinformation became easier to create, conspiracy theories would spread rampantly.Now, researchers wonder if chatbots might also offer a solution. DebunkBot , an AI chatbot designed to ""very effectively persuade"" users to stop believing unfounded conspiracy theories, made significant and long-lasting progress at changing people's convictions, according to a study published Thursday in journal Science.The new findings challenge the widely held belief that facts and logic cannot combat conspiracy theories. The DebunkBot, built on the technology that underlies ChatGPT, may offer a practical way to channel facts.Until now, conventional wisdom held that once someone fell down the conspiratorial rabbit hole, no amount of explaining would pull her out.The theory was that people adopt conspiracy theories to sate an underlying need to explain and control their environment, said Thomas Costello, co-author of the study and an assistant professor of psychology.But Costello and his colleagues wondered whether there might be another explanation: What if debunking attempts haven't been personalised enough? Since conspiracy theories vary from person to person - and each person may cite different evidence to support one's ideas - perhaps a one-size-fits-all debunking script isn't the best strategy. A chatbot that can counter each person's conspiratorial claim with troves of information might be much more effective, they thought.To test that hypothesis, they recruited over 2,000 adults, asked them to elaborate on a conspiracy they believed in, and rate how much they believed it on a scale from zero to 100. Then, some participants had a brief discussion with the chatbot.One participant, for example, believed the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an ""inside job"" because jet fuel couldn't have burned hot enough to melt the steel beams of World Trade Center. The chatbot responded: ""It is a common misconception that the steel needed to melt for the towers to collapse,"" it wrote. ""Steel starts to lose strength and becomes more pliable at temperatures much lower than its melting point, which is around 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.""After three exchanges, which lasted eight minutes on average, participants rated how they felt about their beliefs again. On average, the ratings dropped by about 20%; about one-fourth of participants no longer believed the falsehood.The authors are exploring how they can re-create this effect in the real world. They have considered linking the chatbot in forums where these beliefs are shared, or buying ads that pop up when someone searches for a common theory. nyt","DebunkBot is an AI chatbot designed to ""very effectively persuade"" users to stop believing unfounded conspiracy theories.

Brazil SC judge seizes $3 million from Elon Musk’s X and Starlink in fines dispute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brazil-sc-judge-seizes-3-million-from-elon-musks-x-and-starlink-in-fines-dispute/articleshow/113338953.cms,"Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has seized nearly $3 million from the bank accounts of social media platform X and satellite internet provider Starlink , both controlled by billionaire Elon Musk , in an effort to collect unpaid fines owed by X.The move, aimed at collecting the amount equivalent to the fines owed by X, has raised legal questions, especially regarding the freezing of Starlink’s bank accounts.Despite Musk's ownership of both X and SpaceX, which operates Starlink, the two companies are separate entities.On Friday, Brazil’s Supreme Court confirmed that over 7.2 million reais ($1.3 million) were transferred from X's account, along with nearly 11 million reais ($2 million) from Starlink's account. The ruling was issued on Wednesday, and the bank accounts were unfrozen after full payment.The case has sparked debate among legal experts. Lenio Streck, a prominent Brazilian jurist, questioned the logic of holding Starlink accountable for X's fines. ""Starlink is a different company... It didn't even have a chance to defend itself,"" Streck argued.However, some, like law professor Luis Henrique Machado, support de Moraes’ ruling. ""The ruling is legitimate in imposing the transfer of the amounts in a compulsory fashion,"" he said, defending the fines imposed on X for refusing to remove flagged content.The platform has repeatedly clashed with de Moraes over its refusal to block users, particularly far-right activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy. Musk has labeled de Moraes a ""dictator"" over his rulings, which culminated in the temporary suspension of X in Brazil in August.Despite its ongoing battles, X remains relatively small in Brazil, with an estimated 22 million users compared to larger platforms like Instagram and Facebook. Starlink, which began operations in the country in 2022, holds a 0.5% share of Brazil's internet market.","Brazil's Supreme Court has seized nearly $3 million from social media platform X and satellite internet provider Starlink.

How quick action by Alaska Airlines pilot prevented near-collision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/quick-action-by-alaska-airlines-pilot-prevents-near-collision-with-southwest/articleshow/113306902.cms,"Alaska Airlines plane aborts takeoff to avoid potential collision

An Alaska Airlines jet on Thursday was forced to abruptly halt its takeoff on the runway in Nashville to prevent a potential collision with a Southwest Airlines plane.Alaska Airlines confirmed that their pilots spotted ""a potential traffic conflict on the runway"" and applied the brakes immediately to prevent the situation from getting worse. No injuries were reported, but the extreme heat from the sudden stop caused the tires on the Boeing 737 Max , scheduled to depart for Seattle, to go flat.The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) is investigating the incident at the Nashville International Airport which occurred at around 9.15 am (ET), according to Chair Jennifer Homendy. ""We are clearly very concerned about this (incident) and others we are investigating,"" Homendy told reporters.The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) is also looking into the incident, which involved Southwest Airlines Flight 2029, a Boeing 737-700 , that had been cleared to cross the end of the same runway as an Alaska Airlines plane, as reported by AP.The Alaska Airlines flight was carrying 176 passengers and six crew members. The airline arranged for another plane to transport the passengers to Seattle by Thursday night while inspecting the affected aircraft. Alaska Airlines expressed gratitude for the pilots' quick response, saying, ""We’re grateful for the expertise of our pilots who immediately applied the brakes to prevent the incident from escalating.""According to tracking website Flightradar24, the Alaska plane was traveling at a speed of 104 knots (120 mph, 193 km per hour) on the runway before slowing down.Southwest stated that they are in contact with the NTSB and FAA and will cooperate with the investigation. Alaska Airlines reported that maintenance technicians in Nashville are currently inspecting the aircraft involved in the incident.There have been several close calls, or ""runway incursions,"" in recent years, raising concerns about the safety of US air travel. NTSB chair Homendy had mentioned last November that while these incidents are ""incredibly rare"" compared to the number of flights, they indicate the aviation system is under stress.Recent incidents include a close call in Austin, Texas, where a FedEx jet flew over a Southwest jet taking off in foggy conditions, and a collision between two Delta Air Lines planes on a taxiway in Atlanta. No injuries were reported in these incidents.Alaska Airlines also made headlines in January when one of the door panels blew out on a plane flying from Portland and bound for Ontario. The plane's pilot first Officer Emily Wiprud on Thursday recalled her experience of operating the flight. Her initial indication of the unfolding crisis was a deafening blast that reverberated in her ears, accompanied by a sudden rush of air. The severity of the situation was immediately apparent to her, although the presence of a breach in the aircraft's fuselage remained unknown until the plane touched down.""I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,"" Wiprud said. ""I knew something was catastrophically wrong."" Further complicating matters, her headset, along with the phones of two passengers and various airplane parts, had been forcibly ejected from the aircraft during the incident.","An Alaska Airlines jet was forced to abruptly halt its takeoff on the runway in Nashville to prevent a potential collision with a Southwest Airlines plane.

'Will be fighting directly with Russia if ...': Putin's stark warning to West,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/will-be-fighting-directly-with-russia-if-putins-stark-warning-to-west-ukraine-missile/articleshow/113307558.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday warned that if Ukrainian armed forces were permitted to attack Russian territory using Western-made long-range missiles , it would mean the West's direct involvement in the conflict, altering its nature and scope.For months, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging Kyiv's allies to allow Ukraine to use Western missiles, such as US ATACMS and British Storm Shadows, to strike deep into Russian territory, aiming to restrict Moscow's ability to launch attacks.In his most assertive remarks on the issue to date, Putin said that such a decision would inevitably draw the countries supplying long-range missiles to Kyiv into the war. He explained that Nato military personnel would need to provide satellite targeting data and program the missiles' flight paths, as Kyiv lacks the necessary capabilities.""So this is not a question of allowing the Ukrainian regime to strike Russia with these weapons or not. It is a question of deciding whether or not Nato countries are directly involved in a military conflict,"" Putin told Russian state TV.Putin added, ""If this decision is taken, it will mean nothing less than the direct involvement of Nato countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine. This will be their direct participation, and this, of course, will significantly change the very essence, the very nature of the conflict.""Putin said that Russia would be forced to make ""appropriate decisions"" based on the new threats, without specifying what those measures could entail. In the past, he has mentioned the possibility of arming the West's enemies with Russian weapons to strike Western targets abroad and, in June, discussed deploying conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its European allies.Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 with tens of thousands of troops, triggering the biggest confrontation between Russia and the West since the peak of the Cold War.Putin portrays the conflict as part of an existential battle with a declining West, which he believes humiliated Russia after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine. The West and Ukraine, on the other hand, describe the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and have pledged to defeat Russia on the battlefield. Currently, Russia controls over 18% of Ukrainian territory.","Vladimir Putin: If Ukraine allowed to use Western-made missiles, it would mean the West's direct involvement in the conflict.

Throughout history, the map of the world has been in constant flux, with numerous countries vanishing or transforming into new entities. From the dissolution of empires and the impact of wars to the waves of decolonization and the rise of nationalist movements, the reasons behind the disappearance of countries are as varied as they are complex.This article will explore countries that no longer exist and the key factors contributing to their cessation, such as political, social, and economic forces, which have reshaped the global landscape and led to the emergence of new countries and geopolitical realities.Abyssinia, now known as Ethiopia, was an ancient kingdom in the Horn of Africa. It is renowned for its rich cultural heritage and history, including its role as one of the few African countries to resist European colonisation.Austria-Hungary was a significant Central European empire that included modern-day Austria, Hungary, parts of Italy, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, and the Balkans. Its dissolution followed World War I, leading to the formation of several independent nations.Basutoland, now Lesotho, was a British protectorate located in Southern Africa. It gained independence in 1966 and became the Kingdom of Lesotho.Bengal was a historical region in South Asia, now divided between India and Bangladesh. It was a prominent centre of culture and politics before becoming part of these two modern nations.Burma, now Myanmar, was a British colony until it gained independence in 1948. The country has undergone significant political changes and conflicts since then.Catalonia, an autonomous region in northeastern Spain, has a rich cultural identity and historical significance. It remains a part of Spain but has a distinct regional government and cultural autonomy.Ceylon is the former name of Sri Lanka, an island nation in the Indian Ocean. It was known as Ceylon until it adopted its current name in 1972.Champa was an ancient kingdom located in what is now Vietnam. It existed from the 2nd century to 1832 before being absorbed into Vietnam.Corsica is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, now a department of France.

It reunified with West Germany to become the modern state of Germany.East Pakistan was a part of Pakistan until 1971 when it gained independence and became Bangladesh. The split was the result of political and ethnic tensions.England is now part of the United Kingdom, having been a sovereign kingdom that unified with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland to form the UK.Gran Colombia was a short-lived republic in South America that included parts of modern-day Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. It dissolved in 1831 into separate countries.Hawaii was an independent kingdom until its annexation by the United States in 1898. It is now a state in the US, known for its unique cultural and geographical features.New Grenada was an early name for what is now Colombia. It was part of Gran Colombia before becoming an independent nation.Newfoundland was a British colony and later a dominion of Canada. It became a Canadian province in 1949.North Yemen united with South Yemen in 1990 to form the Republic of Yemen. The unification marked the end of separate northern and southern Yemeni states.The Ottoman Empire was a vast empire that included parts of modern Turkey, Hungary, Russia, the Middle East, the Balkans, and North Africa. It dissolved after World War I, leading to the establishment of the Republic of Turkey.Persia is the historical name for Iran.

The poll , conducted over two days after the showdown, shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 42%—a five-point margin that has expanded since late August.The debate, marked by sharp exchanges and personal attacks, saw Harris relentlessly press Trump on his fitness for office and ongoing legal troubles.Polling suggests voters saw her as the clear winner, with 53% believing Harris outperformed Trump, compared to just 24% who backed Trump’s performance. A CNN flash poll painted an even starker picture, with 60% of viewers saying Harris dominated the stage.Pundits were quick to declare Harris the victor, noting how she repeatedly backed Trump into a corner. According to Reuters , Harris ""put Trump on the defensive with a barrage of attacks on his record and legal woes,"" a view echoed by 52% of poll respondents who felt Trump struggled to keep up.For Harris, the poll is a welcome rebound after a recent New York Times/Siena College survey—widely regarded as highly accurate—showed her trailing Trump by a single point. That poll had put Trump at 48% to Harris' 47%, a razor-thin margin that had fueled anxiety within Democratic circles.Despite the positive numbers, the race remains tight, with battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin holding the keys to the White House. National polls, while promising, offer only a snapshot of the larger fight for electoral votes.In a bid to capitalize on her debate momentum, Harris' campaign swiftly challenged Trump to a second face-off, with Fox News offering to host the rematch. “Vice President Harris is ready for round two. Is Donald Trump?” her team asked in a pointed post-debate statement.Trump, meanwhile, has wavered on whether he’s game for another debate, calling the push for a second round a sign of desperation from the Harris camp. However, he’s left the door open depending on the host network.As the dust settles, the next major clash will be between the vice presidential nominees—Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—who are scheduled to debate on October 1, setting the stage for yet another high-stakes political face-off.","A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of former President Donald Trump.

Houston shocker: Cats cut in half found in East End amid speculative pet-eating theories in Ohio,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/houston-shocker-cats-cut-in-half-found-in-east-end-amid-speculative-pet-eating-theories-in-ohio/articleshow/113337923.cms,"Bodies cut in half, paws missing, missing limbs

Community reactions and investigation

Over 50 animals found dead in San Leon

Trump vows ""large deportations""

Amid unfounded conspiracy theories alleging that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are involved in eating pet cats , Houston is grappling with a chilling case of animal cruelty after multiple severed cat bodies were discovered in the city's East End over the past two weeks.The first report emerged on August 26th, with subsequent findings on Sunday and Wednesday.The remains of the cats were disturbingly displayed in public areas, cut in half with missing limbs and paws, their internal organs left intact and no blood surrounding the bodies, as reported by Click2Houston.Witness Jackson Hime provided a harrowing account of the discoveries. “My mom was out walking her dog, and she passed by, saw that black cat was severed in half,” Hime said as quoted by Click2Houston. “It doesn’t look natural to me.”Hime’s unsettling observation was corroborated by others who found the mutilated animals. “It’s disgusting. It’s frightening,” Hime continued. “For this to happen three times in two weeks when we haven’t seen anything like this in 30 years, I find it hard to believe that that’s just a random animal attack.”The Houston Police Department's Animal Cruelty Unit has reportedly launched an investigation into these macabre incidents. Detectives are treating the cases with heightened urgency, given the brutal nature of the mutilations and the apparent pattern of the incidents.The discovery of the severed cat bodies has sparked fear and outrage among Houston residents. Reports indicate that the mutilated remains were deliberately left in areas frequented by the public, intensifying the sense of horror within the community.The cases have also drawn attention from animal rights advocates and local organizations, who are rallying for increased vigilance and preventive measures.“There’s a sense of dread and disbelief in the community,” said local resident Grizzy Castillo. “Finding severed and dismembered cats, especially with such precision and care to leave them exposed, is both disturbing and unprecedented in this area.”The investigation is ongoing, with animal cruelty detectives working to determine if the incidents are connected or if they point to a broader issue of animal abuse in the region. Authorities are also considering whether these acts might be part of a larger pattern of cruelty or if they reflect an isolated individual’s behavior.The discovery in Houston comes in the wake of another grim finding in San Leon, Texas, where about 50 dead animals, including cats, horses, cows, a raccoon, and dogs, were found on a property, reported Fox26. The investigation was triggered by the search for a missing cat, Cheesecake, which led to the shocking revelation of widespread animal cruelty.“This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” said Kaylee Humburger, whose cat led to the grim finding, was distraught over the condition of the property. Grizzy Castillo, founder of Grizzy Hood News, described the scene as a “holocaust for cats,” recounting stepping over dead carcasses and empty food cans. “We stepped on dead carcass after dead carcass, and kennel after kennel, with dead carcasses with empty cans of food,” Castillo reported.The property owner, who had been running a trap-and-release (TNR) program with local shelters, is now facing criminal charges. Investigations revealed the owner had a history of animal-related offenses. Neighbors had previously alerted officials about the dire conditions, but the full extent of the cruelty was only recently uncovered.Amid these local tragedies, former President Donald Trump has reignited controversy with his campaign promises. On Friday, Trump vowed to initiate “large deportations” from Springfield, Ohio, citing unfounded claims that Haitian migrants there are involved in eating pets. “We will do large deportations from Springfield, Ohio,”Trump declared, emphasizing his intention to begin with Springfield and Aurora, Colorado. Despite the debunked nature of his claims, Trump’s statements have intensified the national debate on immigration and animal cruelty.","Multiple severed cat bodies were discovered in the city's East End over the past two weeks.

Debunked claims of migrants eating pets

Migrants in Springfield: Legal residents filling workforce gaps

Governor DeWine offers support for strained resources

Biden condemns Trump’s rhetoric

'We need help, not hate'

Former President Donald Trump pledged on Friday to initiate massive deportations from Springfield , Ohio , if re-elected. He claimed, without evidence, that Haitian migrants in the city were eating cats and dogs. Speaking to reporters in California, Trump said, ""We will do large deportations from Springfield, Ohio,"" at a press conference at his golf resort near Los Angeles targeting what he described as ""barbaric criminals"" causing harm in US communities.The majority of the 15,000 Haitians in Springfield are there legally. Trump's longstanding pledge to conduct mass deportations usually refers to those in the country illegally.Trump did not repeat the assertion he made during Tuesday's presidential debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that immigrants were eating dogs and cats, remarks that have been widely mocked.Trump has cited the tensions in Springfield as another example of the need for hardline immigration polices. The influx of Haitians has boosted the economy but also has strained social services.During a recent debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump repeated the false allegation that migrants in Springfield were consuming household pets. ""They're eating the dogs — the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating — they're eating the pets of the people that live there,"" he claimed, despite moderator David Muir pointing out that the city manager had refuted the claim. Trump insisted, ""I’ve seen people saying it on television.""Following the debate, Trump shared AI-generated social media posts showing pets supporting his candidacy.Springfield, a city of 58,000, has seen a significant rise in its Haitian migrant population in recent years, largely due to legal immigration programs. The influx has helped the city meet rising labor demand after decades of industrial decline, reported CBS. Most of these migrants are in the US legally through Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and humanitarian parole programs, which allow them to live and work while their home countries experience crisis.Despite Trump's claims, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, along with Springfield’s mayor and police chief, confirmed that there have been no credible reports of migrants stealing or eating pets.While acknowledging the strain on local healthcare systems, Governor DeWine announced a $2.5 million initiative to expand primary care access in Springfield, where many Haitian migrants have limited health services. ""We will continue to do everything we can to help the community deal with this surge of migrants,"" DeWine said, criticizing the federal government's lack of a clear plan.President Joe Biden denounced Trump’s remarks during a White House event celebrating Black excellence, calling the comments harmful to the Haitian community. ""This has to stop, what he’s doing. It has to stop,"" Biden said, referring to the inflammatory claims Trump and his allies have made about Springfield’s migrants.Despite Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, painting Springfield as a community in crisis, local leaders and experts have consistently rejected their claims, pointing to the important contributions of migrants in the region.Haitian community leaders across the United States said the Republican candidate's remarks could put lives at risk and further inflame tensions in Springfield. ""We need help, not hate,"" Springfield's mayor Rob Rue told ABC News.City officials say they have received no credible reports of anybody eating household animals. Karen Graves, a city spokesperson, said she was not aware of recent hate crimes targeting Haitian residents but that some had been victims of ""crimes of opportunity,"" such as property theft.","Former President Donald Trump pledged on Friday to initiate massive deportations from Springfield, Ohio.

Former president Donald Trump finally reacted to the ongoing Laura Loomer controversy that became the national headline after MAGA veterans distanced from the far right-wing provocateur while Laura was seen hanging out with Donald Trump. Laura called Kamala Harris 'evil bimbo' and said the White House will smell of curry if Kamala Harris wins the election.

She speaks very positively of the campaign. I’m not sure why you asked that question, but Laura is a supporter. I don’t control Laura. Laura has to say what she wants. She’s a free spirit,” Trump said at a news conference in Southern California.“Look, I can’t tell Laura what to do. Laura’s a supporter. I have a lot of supporters.”Laura Loomer was there with Donald Trump when he attended some events to mark the 9/11 anniversary. Her proximity with Donald Trump campaign rattled old-times as they said they have been trying to keep such conspiracy theorists away from Trump. It has been speculated that Trump referred to the Haitian conspiracy theory at the debate stage because he was influenced by Laura.Donald Trump said he heard about it for the first time and he thinks Laura is just a person with strong opinions. “She’s a strong person.

Nasa astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore Friday said that they are looking forward to cast their ballot in the US election from the International Space Station as their return has been delayed. Answering a question on voting, Wilmore said he sent down his request for a ballot today as it is a very important duty and Nasa makes sure that they are able to cast their votes.Sunita agreed and said she is looking forward to be able to vote from Space.The astronauts are stuck in space and now they will return on Elon Musk's SpaceX next year. It was their first public comments since the Boeing Starliner capsule that took them to the ISS in June returned to earth. They were not carried along as the capsule developed many technical snags deemed too much risky for them.Sunita Williams said both she and Butch were aware that it was a test flight and hence it could take more time than just eight days. She said it was not hard to accept that they would be staying at the ISS longer. ""We are trained to handle any kind of situation,"" Butch Wilmore chipped in. ""I don't look back...we deal with all kind of difficulties in all kind of situations. This is not an easy business. Eight days or eight months whatever it is, we are going to do our best job. That's the mindset,"" Butch said.Sunita Williams said she was a little bit nervous that she was not returning home immediately. ""In the back of my mind, there are folks on the ground who have some plans like my family...spending times with my mother. And I think I was fretting more about that.

They along with seven others on board welcomed a Soyuz spacecraft carrying two Russians and an American earlier this week, temporarily raising the station population to 12, a near record.The two Starliner test pilots - both retired Navy captains and longtime NASA astronauts - will stay at the orbiting laboratory until late February. They have to wait for a SpaceX capsule to bring them back. That spacecraft is due to launch later this month with a reduced crew of two, with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams for the return leg.Their Starliner capsule marked the first Boeing spaceflight with astronauts. It endured a series of thruster failures and helium leaks before arriving at the space station on June 6. It landed safely in the New Mexico desert earlier this month, but Boeing's path forward in NASA's commercial crew program remains uncertain.The space agency hired SpaceX and Boeing as an orbital taxi service a decade ago after the shuttles retired.

Gambian Death Squad: US trial of alleged Gambian 'death squad' member postponed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-trial-of-alleged-gambian-death-squad-member-postponed/articleshow/113332876.cms,"LOS ANGELES: The US trial on torture charges of a Gambian man who was allegedly a member of a notorious death squad known as the "" Junglers "" has been postponed at the last minute.Michael Sang Correa , 45, a former captain in the Gambian military, was scheduled to go on trial in a federal court in Denver, Colorado, on Monday.But the presiding judge granted a defense motion on Wednesday to delay the trial to allow Correa's attorneys to travel to The Gambia to collect videotaped depositions from two witnesses.A new trial date has not been set. It is not expected to be held until next year.Correa was indicted in June 2020 and faces six counts of inflicting torture and one count of conspiracy to commit torture. Each count is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.He is being tried in the United States for crimes committed in his home country under what is known as universal jurisdiction , which allows for prosecution of torture, genocide and war crimes.According to Human Rights Watch and Trial International, Correa's torture trial is just the third of its kind to be held in the United States and the first involving a non-US citizen.Correa entered the United States in 2016 to work as a bodyguard for Gambia's vice president, who was visiting the United Nations.He stayed in the country and moved to Denver at some point after Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh , who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1994 to 2017, was voted out of office.Correa was arrested by US authorities in September 2019, initially for overstaying his visa.According to the indictment, Correa joined the Junglers in 2004.The paramilitary unit operated outside the Gambian army's chain of command, taking orders directly from Jammeh, and has been accused by watchdog groups of carrying out widespread human rights violations.In 2006, the indictment says, Jammeh's government learned of a plan to overthrow him and arrested a number of suspected coup plotters.The prisoners were taken to Mile 2 Prison and the National Intelligence Agency headquarters, where Correa and others allegedly tortured them to coerce confessions.Some of the prisoners had molten plastic or acid dripped on their bodies while others were brutally beaten and subjected to electric shocks.Another member of the Junglers, Bai Lowe, was sentenced to life in prison in Germany in November after being convicted of crimes against humanity, murder and attempted murder.A Swiss court in May sentenced Gambian ex-interior minister Ousman Sonko to 20 years in prison for crimes against humanity committed under the Jammeh regime.Victims of the Junglers included an AFP correspondent, Deyda Hydara, who was gunned down in his car on the outskirts of Gambia's capital Banjul on December 16, 2004.","Michael Sang Correa, 45, a former captain in the Gambian military, was scheduled to go on trial in a federal court in Denver, Colorado, on Monday.

Haitian Immigrants: 'Dead cat hanging from a tree': Origin of Haitian immigrants row. Everyone heard it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dead-cat-hanging-from-a-tree-origin-of-haitian-immigrants-row-everyone-heard-it/articleshow/113332477.cms,"How did the rumor start?

'Kamala Harris did this'

The rumor that Haitians immigrants have been stealing and eating cats and dogs has been traced to the source as it has been found that 35-year-old Erika Lee posted an anecdote in a local Facebook group. But she could not believe that the story would find a place in Donald Trump's debate speech. ""Honestly, it blew me away,"" Lee told NewsGuard. ""I didn't think that any of this would explode to the presidency.""Lee said she heard it from a neighbor (Kimberley Newton) who heard it from a friend who heard it from their daughter.The rumor was a cat owner found her dead pet hanging from a tree ready to be skinned, butchered and eaten at a house said to be occupied by Haitian immigrants . But both Lee and Kimberly were not sure about the authenticity of the rumor as they don't know the person who lost the cat.NewsGuard tracked the rumor originating from an alleged cat owner, then travelling to the cat owner's acquaintance, then to Kimberley and Erika and from there to Conservative influencer and then to JD Vance and Donald Trump.So when Lee told the story, it was a fourth-hand fable. On September 5, a screenshot of the post was shared on X and then it went viral. “My neighbor [Newton] informed me that her daughters friend had lost her cat,” Lee wrote in her post without mentioning Newton.“One day she came home from work, as soon as she stepped out of her car, looked towards a neighbors house, where Haitians live, & saw her cat hanging from a branch, like you’d do a deer for butchering, & they were carving it up to eat.”""I 've been told they are doing this to dogs, they have been doing it at snyder park with the ducks and geese, as I was told that last bit by Rangers & Police,"" the post said.Even after being called out for spreading this rumor, JD Vance stayed put on his position and posted Friday that Kamala Harris is responsible for whatever happened to Ohio. ""In Springfield, Ohio, there has been a massive rise in communicable diseases, rent prices, car insurance rates, and crime. This is what happens when you drop 20,000 people into a small community. Kamala Harris's immigration policy aims to do this to every town in our country,"" JD posted.","The rumor was a cat owner found her dead pet hanging from a tree ready to be skinned, butchered and eaten at a house said to be occupied by Haitian immigrants.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.

There has also been a 20-30% tariff increase on electricity and other energy products, hitting the common man hard.Pakistan's external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.The February general election produced Shehbaz Sharif-led shaky coalition government, which now has the challenging task of tackling deep-rooted structural problems to pull the $350-billion economy out of its misery.Since joining the multilateral lender in 1950, Pakistan has secured 24 IMF bailouts, the latest being subject to approval by the lender's executive board and the confirmation of necessary financing assurances from the country's development and bilateral partners.","Islamabad has been working on implementing conditions from the IMF to complete a $7 billion, 37-month loan programme agreed in July.

Khan had been arrested on Wednesday after being taken from an angry mob that accused him of insulting the Prophet Muhammad.The police officer responsible for the shooting has been arrested, according to police official Mohammad Khurram , who did not provide additional information.In Pakistan, accusations of blasphemy are common and can lead to mob violence and lynching, even if they are just rumors. The country's controversial blasphemy laws allow for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or Islamic religious figures, although no executions have been carried out.Before his arrest, local residents claimed Khan had used derogatory remarks against the prophet and went after him. After his arrest, a mob surrounded the police station, demanding that Khan be handed over to them for execution. One person threw a grenade at the station on Wednesday, and a group of Islamists briefly blocked a key road in the city, demanding punishment for Khan. The crowd eventually dispersed after officials managed to calm them down.Pakistan has seen an increase in attacks on blasphemy suspects in recent years. In June, a mob in Madyan lynched a tourist accused of desecrating the holy Quran, and in 2022, a mob in Punjab province attacked churches and homes of Christians after claiming they saw a local Christian and his friend desecrating pages from a Quran. The attack in Jaranwala drew nationwide condemnation, but Christians say the men linked to the violence have not yet been put on trial.In 2011, a policeman killed a former governor of Punjab province after accusing him of blasphemy. The officer, Mumtaz Qadri , was later sentenced to death and hanged, but support for him grew after his execution, with tens of thousands attending his funeral in Rawalpindi. Many in Punjab still consider him a martyr today.Quetta, a conservative city in southwestern Pakistan, is also the capital of the restive Balochistan province, where militant groups stage near-daily attacks and separatists have waged a decades-long insurgency against the government in Islamabad.","A police officer shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday.

Imran’s flock detained after protest for his release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imrans-flock-detained-after-protest-for-his-release/articleshow/113240529.cms,"ISLAMABAD

:

Pakistani police have detained several leaders and lawmakers of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) from parliament’s compound, days after the party held a rally and served a two-week ultimatum for the release of the jailed former PM. The detentions followed alleged violation of norms during the rally.In a separate development, Ali Amin Gandapur , chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) from Imran’s PTI, went missing from Islamabad for eight hours Monday and emerged in his provincial capital Peshawar Tuesday.Sources revealed Gandapur was in the custody of an intelligence agency and added that the CM of the northwestern province was quizzed for hours before his release early Tuesday.Gandapur came under fire for a tirade against the military during PTI’s protest-cum-power show Sunday in Islamabad’s suburbs. “Fix your institution, fix your generals, fix yourself. If the founder of PTI (Imran) is not legally released within one to two weeks, we will have him freed ourselves,” the CM vowed.While several PTI lawmakers apologised for Gandapur’s remarks, Imran defended him, saying he had merely expressed the nation’s sentiments. “Party members who have apologised for Gandapur’s remarks are weak and cowards. They should not remain in PTI,” Imran was quoted as saying at his prison in Rawalpindi.Last week, the federal govt passed a law to “regulate” public gatherings in Islamabad. It set three-year jail terms for participants of “illegal” assemblies, with 10 years for repeat offenders. The Islamabad administration had allowed PTI’s Sunday’s rally from 4pm till 7pm, but the gathering went on until 11pm. “They were arrested due to violation of the new law,” Islamabad police spokespersonTaqi Jawad said, referring to PTI arrests, including that of chairman Gohar Khan .Since his removal from power in April 2022, Imran and his PTI have waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against the military.The PTI says it has faced a months-long crackdown since protesters allegedly linked to the party attacked and damaged govt and military installations on May 9, 2023, after Khan’s brief arrest that day in a land graft case. Hundreds of PTI arrests followed. Many remain behind bars. The military, which says Imran and his party were behind the attacks, has initiated army court trials of at least 103 people accused of involvement in the violence.In Feb this year, Imran and PTI were barred from the national election, which was alleged to have been rigged. Candidates aligned with the party, forced to contest independently, still won most seats in parliament but not enough to form the govt. PTI alleged that its mandate was “stolen” by PM Shebaz Sharif’s governing coalition with the all-powerful military’s backing. Both deny the claim.",Several leaders and lawmakers of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) detained. The detentions followed alleged violation of norms during the rally.

Several top leaders of Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad. The arrests included barrister Gohar Khan, Sher Afzal Marwat, and advocate Shoaib Shaheen, following a violent clash between PTI supporters and police during a protest demanding Khan's release. The arrests have been widely condemned by PTI as politically motivated.PTI has vehemently opposed the arrests, calling them a ""direct attack on democracy."" In posts on X (formerly Twitter), the party criticised the government's actions, arguing that the arrests are an attempt to suppress their movement.PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari condemned the detentions as ""illegal"" and said, ""These arrests won’t change anything; they will only increase public anger against this puppet government.""Omar Ayub Khan, another senior PTI figure, also denounced the arrests and revealed that police had been forming teams to apprehend him and other top PTI members, including Zartaj Gul Wazir . ""This fascist regime has gone completely mad... We will continue raising our voices for our leader, PM Imran Khan ,"" he wrote on X.Despite the crackdown, many PTI lawmakers remained inside Parliament House to avoid arrest, and more detentions are expected in the coming days. The Islamabad high court bar association has also condemned the arrests, demanding the release of Marwat and Shaheen, both respected members of the legal community.The arrests occur amidst growing political tension in Pakistan. Imran Khan, who has been imprisoned since 2022 on corruption charges, remains a central figure in the country's political landscape. His supporters’ continued protests and the government’s aggressive response have only heightened the political discord.The arrests were made under the newly enacted Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Bill, 2024. This legislation, which came into effect just before the PTI rally, empowers authorities to regulate and ban public gatherings in Islamabad. Under this law, the district magistrate can disband any assembly deemed likely to disturb public peace, with penalties including up to three years in prison or fines. Repeat offenders face even harsher penalties, potentially extending to 10 years of imprisonment. The PTI leaders were accused of violating these regulations by inciting their supporters to clash with police during the protest.","Top leaders of Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad.

New intelligence reports reveal that Hamza bin Laden , the son of Osama bin Laden , has taken command of al-Qaida, contradicting claims that he was killed in a 2019 US airstrike. Hamza, known as the ""Crown Prince of Terror,"" is now believed to be playing a pivotal role in the terror group's resurgence, overseeing the establishment of new training camps in Afghanistan, as al-Qaida rebuilds its capabilities to launch attacks against Western nations, including Britain and the US, a report in UK's Mirror said.

, the son of , has taken command of al-Qaida, contradicting claims that he was killed in a 2019 US airstrike. Hamza, known as the ""Crown Prince of Terror,"" is now believed to be playing a pivotal role in the terror group's resurgence, overseeing the establishment of new training camps in Afghanistan, as al-Qaida rebuilds its capabilities to launch attacks against Western nations, including Britain and the US, a report in UK's Mirror said. Experts warn that Hamza’s leadership is reinvigorating the group and deepening its ties with the Taliban. Hamza’s brother, Abdullah bin Laden, is also thought to be involved in al-Qaida’s operations, creating a powerful family-led terror dynasty with a shared mission to spread chaos, much like their father before them.

Hamza bin Laden and his four wives are believed to have sheltered in Iran for several years to evade the CIA. Despite claims of his death in a 2019 US air strike in Afghanistan, no DNA proof was acquired to confirm his demise. The recent intelligence suggests that Hamza uses safe houses in various Afghan provinces to facilitate the movement of al-Qaida members to and from Iran, the Mirror report said.

The reports suggest that Hamza’s survival and resurgence could mark al-Qaida’s most potent revival since the Iraq War, sparking fears of a new wave of terrorist activity aimed at the West, the Mirror report said.

Why it matters

Hamza bin Laden’s leadership represents a renewed threat from al-Qaida, a group that had been largely quiet following the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011 and the killing of Osama’s successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a 2022 US drone strike. With Hamza at the helm, al-Qaida has been regrouping in Afghanistan, taking advantage of the Taliban’s return to power after the US withdrawal in 2021.

This resurgence could have dire consequences for the West. Afghanistan is now home to a growing number of terror training camps, where fighters and suicide bombers are being prepared for attacks on Western targets. The Taliban, despite earlier promises to cut ties with terror groups, has allowed al-Qaida to re-establish itself within the country, further complicating the security situation.

According to some reports, there are as many as 21 different terror networks operating in Afghanistan, making it the world's most concentrated terror hotspot.

The fact that these camps are being built in areas where Western forces previously fought—such as Helmand and Ghazni provinces—underscores the symbolic and strategic threat posed by al-Qaida’s resurgence. The presence of these camps, coupled with the growing strength of al-Qaida, has sparked fears that another 9/11-style attack could be in the works. ""The parallels between the current situation and the prelude to the 9/11 attacks are alarming,"" said one intelligence analysis seen by the Mirror.

The big picture

Al-Qaida’s comeback is closely tied to the Taliban’s resurgence in Afghanistan. Since the fall of Kabul in 2021, the Taliban has maintained a strong relationship with al-Qaida, providing the terror group with safe havens and training facilities.

This collaboration is not new; the Taliban and al-Qaida have shared deep historical ties dating back to the 1990s when Osama bin Laden first established al-Qaida’s headquarters in Afghanistan. These ties persisted despite the US-led invasion in 2001, and they are now stronger than ever.

According to a recent report from the United Nations Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, al-Qaida has opened eight new training camps across Afghanistan in 2024. These camps are situated in provinces like Ghazni, Laghman, Parwan, Uruzgan, and Helmand—many of which were once battlegrounds for US and British forces fighting the Taliban. In addition to these camps, al-Qaida has established five madrasas (religious schools) in areas such as Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, which serve as breeding grounds for new recruits.

Hamza bin Laden has reportedly played a key role in this resurgence. Intelligence suggests that Hamza, now in his 30s, has been living in Afghanistan under the protection of senior Taliban leaders, holding regular meetings with them to coordinate al-Qaida’s activities.

Hamza is also believed to have received support from Sirajuddin Haqqani, an Afghan warlord and leader of the infamous Haqqani network. Haqqani, who is linked to multiple terror attacks in Afghanistan, is said to be sheltering Hamza and his family in the country, further strengthening the ties between the Taliban and al-Qaida.

""The resurgence and stronger ties between the Taliban and al-Qaida and the establishment of its training camps in Afghanistan represent a profound threat to the West,"" said one intelligence dossier. Western officials are particularly concerned that the Taliban is facilitating the movement of al-Qaida operatives between Afghanistan and Iran, allowing them to regroup and plan attacks with minimal interference.

What they’re saying

Colonel Richard Kemp, former chief of UK forces in Afghanistan, has voiced strong concerns about Hamza’s role in al-Qaida’s resurgence. ""Hamza now appears to have an open field in Afghanistan and will be intent on conquest and vengeance for his father,"" Kemp told the Mirror. He warns that Hamza’s leadership, combined with the Taliban’s tolerance for terror groups, could lead to a new wave of attacks on the West.

“Hamza bin Laden is not only alive but actively involved in al-Qaida’s resurgence, a fact well-known among senior Taliban leaders. These leaders engage with him, holding regular meetings and securing him and his family,"" reads an intelligence report. Another source said, ""[Hamza] has ascended to the leadership of al-Qaida, steering [it] towards its most potent resurgence since the Iraq War.""

Beyond Western intelligence, Afghan resistance groups have also expressed alarm over the growing presence of al-Qaida in the country, a Foreign Policy report said. Ali Maisam Nazary, a senior leader of Afghanistan’s National Resistance Front (NRF), said during a visit to Washington: “The Taliban have allowed al-Qaida to build bases and munitions depots in the heart of the Panjshir Valley. We’re seeing all the lights blinking red.”

Between the lines

While Hamza’s survival and leadership have reignited fears of another large-scale attack, the situation in Afghanistan is part of a broader pattern of growing extremism in the region. Alongside al-Qaida, other terror groups, such as the Islamic State’s Khorasan branch (ISIS-K), Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, have been expanding their influence in Afghanistan, thanks to the Taliban’s inability or unwillingness to crack down on extremist factions.

The United Nations has also noted an increasing presence of foreign fighters in Afghanistan, with militants from Arab countries, Central Asia, and even Europe flocking to the country to train and join the fight. This influx of fighters, combined with the training camps run by al-Qaida and other groups, makes Afghanistan a global epicenter of jihadist activity.

Moreover, the growing ties between al-Qaida and ISIS-K are particularly concerning. Previously, the two groups were rivals, but new intelligence reports suggest that they are now cooperating, with reports of inter-marriages between members of the two factions. This alliance mirrors past collaborations between key terrorist leaders and signals a new, more unified threat to the West.

What’s next

The resurgence of al-Qaida in Afghanistan poses significant challenges for Western governments. Despite Taliban assurances that they would prevent Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorism, the reality on the ground suggests that the opposite is happening. The US and its allies must now reassess their counterterrorism strategies, particularly as al-Qaida rebuilds its infrastructure and strengthens its alliances with other terror groups.

Despite Taliban assurances that they would prevent Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorism, the reality on the ground suggests that the opposite is happening. The US and its allies must now reassess their counterterrorism strategies, particularly as al-Qaida rebuilds its infrastructure and strengthens its alliances with other terror groups. Intelligence experts warn that the growth of these training camps and the re-establishment of al-Qaida’s networks could lead to future attacks, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe and the US. ""Al-Qaida is regrouping and preparing for future attacks on Western targets,"" said one report seen by the Mirror. The report also highlighted the possibility of another 9/11-style attack, driven by the symbolic and strategic weight of Hamza bin Laden’s leadership.

With Hamza at the helm and the Taliban providing cover, the threat posed by al-Qaida is as potent as ever. Western governments, particularly in the US and Britain, must remain vigilant and develop new strategies to counter this growing danger.

The world is now, slowly but surely, realising that all the talk of Taliban 2.0 was just a ploy by the militant group to smoothen its take over of Afghanistan.
