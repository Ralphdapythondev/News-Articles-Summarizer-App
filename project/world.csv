"Trump, at Latino event, stands by false claims of immigrants eating pets",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-at-latino-event-stands-by-false-claims-of-immigrants-eating-pets/articleshow/114298375.cms,"US former president Donald Trump

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday stood by debunked claims that immigrants in Ohio were eating pets, telling Latino voters during a town hall he was ""just saying what was reported.""Trump in recent weeks has amplified a false claim that has gone viral that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing residents' pets or taking wildlife from parks for food.There have been no credible reports of Haitians eating pets, and officials in Ohio - including Republicans - have repeatedly said the story is untrue.At a town hall hosted by Spanish-language TV Univision , an undecided Mexican-born Latino Republican voter from Arizona, a battleground state, asked Trump in Spanish whether he truly believed that immigrants were eating pets.""I was just saying what was reported... And eating other things too that they're not supposed to be. All I do is report,"" Trump replied during the event held in Miami. ""I was there, I'm going to be there and we're going to take a look.""Trump added that ""newspapers"" had also reported on the claim, without naming any or providing any details.Trump, who has not yet traveled to Springfield, has previously said he would conduct mass deportations of Haitian immigrants from the Ohio city, even though the majority of them are in the U.S. legally.The city has faced bomb threats since Trump began repeating the false accusations about Haitians.In the final weeks before the Nov. 5 election, Trump is increasingly resorting to darker and more violent language about illegal immigration, an issue that opinion polls show resonates with many voters, especially Republicans.He is competing against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for key votes from the growing Latino population. Latino voters have typically backed Democrats, but the Trump campaign is hoping to win over more of them, especially men, on the back of economic discontent.Harris led Trump by eight percentage points - 47% to 39% - among Hispanic voters in Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted between Sept. 11 and Oct. 7. Harris held her own Latino town hall last week in Nevada, a battleground state with a significant Hispanic population.Farm worker questions TrumpAt the town hall, Trump was asked another immigration question by a Mexican-born California farm worker, who spoke of picking strawberries and broccoli for years. He asked who would do hard farm labor if Trump goes through with his plans to deport millions of people who are in the United States illegally, and how that would impact food prices.Trump dodged the question, instead claiming that African Americans and Hispanic Americans were losing their jobs because of illegal immigration. He also repeated baseless claims that Latin American countries were emptying out mental institutions and jails to send people to the United States.Trump has previously used dehumanizing terminology to describe immigrants in the U.S. illegally, calling them ""animals"" when talking about alleged criminal acts, and saying they are ""poisoning the blood of our country,"" a phrase that has drawn criticism as xenophobic and echoing Nazi rhetoric.","Donald Trump tells Latino voters he was ""just saying what was reported"" Trump has amplified a false claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets.

Mexico's ex-public security chief sentenced to 38-plus years in US for taking cartel bribes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mexicos-ex-public-security-chief-sentenced-to-38-plus-years-in-us-for-taking-cartel-bribes/articleshow/114298017.cms,"Mexico's Genaro Garcia Luna speaks during a ceremony to designate June 2 as Federal Police Day in Mexico City, June 2, 2011. (AP)

NEW YORK: The man once heralded as the architect of Mexico 's war on drug cartels was sentenced to more than 38 years in a US prison on Wednesday for taking massive bribes to aid drug traffickers.Genaro Garcia Luna , Mexico's former secretary of public security, was convicted by a New York jury in 2023 of taking millions of dollars in bribes to protect the violent Sinaloa cartel that he was supposedly combating.He is the highest-level Mexican government official to be convicted in the United States.At his sentencing hearing before a federal judge in Brooklyn on Wednesday, Garcia Luna continued to maintain his innocence and said the case against him was based on false information from criminals and the Mexican government.""I have a firm respect for the law,"" he said in Spanish. ""I have not committed these crimes.""Garcia Luna, 56, led Mexico's federal police before he served in a cabinet-level position as the top security official from 2006 to 2012 under then-President Felipe Calderon. At the time, Garcia Luna was hailed as an ally by the US in its fight on drug trafficking But US prosecutors said that in return for millions of dollars, he provided intelligence about investigations against the cartel, information about rival gangs and the safe passage of massive quantities of drugs.After the sentencing, Calderon said via the social platform X that he respects the court's decision but he never had ""verifiable evidence"" of Garcia Luna's criminal activities. Calderon said taking on the cartels ""was one of the most difficult decisions of my life. But I would do it again, because it is the right thing to do.""Earlier outside the courthouse, a group of about 15 protesters celebrated the verdict. Some held a banner that said, in Spanish, ""Calderon did know,"" while others brandished signs denouncing his political party.Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence. Garcia Luna's lawyers had argued that he should get no more than 20 years.US District Judge Brian Cogan said he wasn't moved by past accolades that Garcia Luna received for his work in the war on drugs.""That was your cover,"" Cogan said before imposing the sentence. ""You are guilty of these crimes, sir. You can't parade these words and say, 'I'm police officer of the year.'""Besides the sentence of 38 years and four months, the judge imposed a $2 million fine.During the trial, photos were shown of Garcia Luna shaking hands with former President Barack Obama and speaking with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Sen. John McCain.But prosecutors said Garcia Luna secretly advanced a drug trafficking conspiracy that resulted in the deaths of thousands of American and Mexican citizens. He ensured that drug traffickers were notified in advance of raids and sabotaged legitimate police operations aimed at apprehending cartel leaders, they said.Drug traffickers were able to ship over 1 million kilograms of cocaine through Mexico and into the United States using planes, trains, trucks and submarines while Garcia Luna held his posts, prosecutors said.During former Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman's trial in the same court in 2018, a former cartel member testified that he personally delivered at least $6 million in payoffs to Garcia Luna and that cartel members agreed to pool up to $50 million to pay for his protection.""He enabled the cartel. He protected the cartel. He was the cartel,"" Assistant US Attorney Saritha Komatireddy told the judge Wednesday.Garcia Luna enabled a corrupt system that allowed violent cartels to thrive and distribute drugs that killed multitudes of people, she added.""It may not have been the defendant pulling the trigger, but he has blood on his hands,"" Komatireddy said.Prosecutors also said Garcia Luna plotted to undo last year's verdict by seeking to bribe or corruptly convince multiple inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to support false allegations that two government witnesses communicated via contraband cellular phones in advance of the trial.Garcia Luna's lawyer, Cesar de Castro, said the defense intends to appeal the sentence. He said his client is someone who ""has served his country"" and has now lost his money, his reputation as well as policies he championed in Mexico.""He has lost close to everything. All that remains is his wonderful family,"" de Castro said.In Mexico, newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum briefly commented on the case Tuesday, saying: ""The big issue here is how someone who was awarded by United States agencies, who ex-President Calderon said wonderful things about his security secretary, today is prisoner in the United States because it's shown that he was tied to drug trafficking.""Garcia Luna's arrest and conviction became a political cudgel that the governing party of Sheinbaum and her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, used in this year's Mexican presidential election against Calderon's weakened National Action Party. They sought to paint Garcia Luna as the poster child of corruption and Calderon as the man responsible for soaring violence from the drug war.Lopez Obrador and now Sheinbaum turned away from direct confrontation with the cartels, instead focusing on what they consider root causes of violence, such as poverty. But the new strategy has failed to significantly lower the level of violence.Lopez Obrador had a very different reaction in 2020 when US authorities arrested former Mexican Defense Secretary Salvador Cienfuegos for allegedly colluding with a drug cartel. In that case, Lopez Obrador accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of fabricating evidence against Cienfuegos and protested until the US government dropped the charges. He was returned to Mexico, where he was promptly cleared and released.","Genaro Garcia Luna, Mexico's former secretary of public security, was convicted by a New York jury in 2023. He is the highest-level Mexican government official to be convicted in the United States. At the time, Garcia Luna was hailed as an ally by the US in its fight on drug trafficking.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114298046,imgsize-627597,width-400,resizemode-4/114298046.jpg"

MAGA supporters claimed Donald Trump was right about the crime data in ABC News debate

When Donald Trump said during the debate that crime incidents increased in the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris administration, he was fact-checked. MAGA supporters Wednesday said the FBI quietly adjusted its 2022 figures in recent weeks -- after the debate and the new numbers show Trump was right.First reported by RealClearInvestigations (RCI), the new numbers show that the raw number of violent crime incidents — including murders, assaults and rapes — rose to 1,256,671 in 2022 from 1,197,930 in 2021, an increase of 4.9 per cent.In October of 2023, the FBI put out a press release unveiling its national crime data for 2022, which found that “national violent crime decreased an estimated 1.7 per cent in 2022 compared to 2021 estimates.”“I have checked the data on total violent crime from 2004 to 2022,” College of William & Mary economics professor Carl Moody, who specializes in studying crime, told RealClearInvestigations. “There were no revisions from 2004 to 2015, and from 2016 to 2020, there were small changes of less than one percentage point.“The huge changes in 2021 and 2022, especially without an explanation, make it difficult to trust the FBI data ,” Moody added.Elon Musk said even the latest FBI crime data ""massively understates"" the problem.The FBI’s crime stats revisions reveal how much guesswork is involved in even the “final” numbers often seized on by politicians. The FBI doesn’t simply count reported crimes. Instead, it offers estimates by extrapolating data from police departments that report only partial-year data. The Bureau also makes estimates for cities that report no data. The FBI’s method of generating these estimates changes over time, and it affects the figures they report, RCI said."," MAGA supporters said the FBI quietly adjusted its 2022 figures in recent weeks.

Harry Meghan News: Did Meghan Markle lie about daughter Lilibet's name? Prince Harry too...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-meghan-markle-lie-about-daughter-lilibets-name-prince-harry-too-/articleshow/114294114.cms,"A new Royal Family book has claimed that Queen Elizabeth II was enraged after Harry and Meghan's daughter was named Lilibet as Lilibet was Elizabeth's childhood name when she could not pronounce Elizabeth. It later became one of the adorable names late Prince Philip used for his wife. Meghan Markle told that she was granted permission to use the name 'Lilibet' for their daughter.Harry too maintained that version but it enraged the Queen. Lilibet was born in June 2021, two years after Harry and Meghan left their royal duties and exited the family to settle in the US.Robert Hardman's book 'Charles III: New King, New Court. The Inside Story' revealed that one member of staff claimed that the late Queen was ""as angry as I'd ever seen her"" after hearing Harry and Meghan's comments.The Queen was never asked for her blessing to use the name Lilibet for Harry and Meghan's daughter, a BBC report said but some other reports claimed that when the Queen was contacted by Harry, she was not in a position to say no.The old issue resurfaced as Meghan Markle is on the radar for her growing distance with Prince Harry and speculations are rife that the royal couple may head for a divorce. On professional front too, Meghan is seeing a bad press after her former staff said she is a dictator in high heels. Harry is more focused on his solo charity engagements and Meghan her own. While work is separating them, according to insiders, they are already on a 'trial separation'.When the controversy over Lilibet's name broke out, a spokesperson of Harry and Meghan said they would not have used the name without the late monarch's permission. ""The Duke spoke with his family in advance of the announcement - in fact his grandmother was the first family member he called. During that conversation, he shared their hope of naming their daughter Lilibet in her honour.

'Pelosis are enemies from within'

Vice president Kamala Harris Wednesday said Donald Trump 's comment at the townhall of women voters that he is the father of IVG is quite bizarre. Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force 2 to Pennsylvania, Harris said Trump should in fact be taking responsibility for the women living under abortion bans or restrictive abortion laws around the country.""So let's not be distracted by his choice of words.The reality is, his actions have been very harmful to women and families in America on this issue,"" she says.“I’m going to say what I’ve said publicly and what I’ve said many times based on my observations. … Donald Trump is increasingly unstable, and as has been said by people who have worked closely with him even when he was president, he’s unfit to be president of the United States,” Kamala said.The abortion issue is a major one this election and when Trump decided to attend an all-women town hall, it was certain that the abortion issue would be raised. Trump said he is the father of IVF without elaborating further, Then he said his daughter Ivanka Trump urged him to pass a child tax credit.“We really are the party for IVF,” Trump told moderator and Fox News host Harris Faulkner on “The Faulkner Focus.” “We want fertilization, and it’s all the way, and the Democrats tried to attack us on it, and we’re out there on IVF, even more than them. So, we’re totally in favor.”""Donald Trump called himself “the father of IVF.” What is he talking about?

How US picks its president: Decoding the election process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-us-picks-its-president-decoding-the-election-process/articleshow/114252324.cms,"US vice president Kamala Harris.

Here’s the lowdown on how America elects its head of state.

Who are the main contenders for the 2024 race?

Electoral College

Early voting and mail-in ballots

Vote counting

Swing states

Electing members of Congress

The United States presidential election is a process that goes beyond a simple tally of votes. Voters elect 538 members of the Electoral College , who ultimately choose the president.Most states follow a winner-take-all system, but a few divide their electoral votes proportionally.The outcome often hinges on pivotal swing states, and although early and absentee voting is common, the official result isn’t finalized until Congress certifies the electoral votes.How is the US election winner decided?Sometimes, a candidate wins despite losing the popular vote, and certain states are more crucial than others to clinch a win.The Democratic Party has, US Vice President Kamala Harris succeeded Joe Biden on July 21, leading the ticket. She will turn 60 this month and has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, 60, as her running mate.Former US President Donald Trump , who is running again at 78 years old, is the Republican Party candidate. Ohio Senator JD Vance, 40, is his vice-presidential candidate.Jill Stein is running for the Green Party, having previously contested in 2012 and 2016, while Chase Oliver is the Libertarian Party’s candidate.And, Robert Kennedy Jr , son of the former attorney general and nephew of US President John F Kennedy , has suspended his independent campaign and endorsed Trump.Stein’s previous runs and the Green Party’s 2020 candidate, Howie Hawkins, reflect the ongoing presence of third-party challengers, though they have yet to pose a serious threat to the two-party dominance in US presidential elections.There are numerous other candidates affiliated with other minor parties or those who are running independently, but do not have majority ballot access.A US voter does not directly vote for president. Instead, voters cast votes for electors in the Electoral College, a body that ultimately chooses the president.There are 538 electors in total, representing 435 members of the House of Representatives , 100 Senators, and 3 electors from Washington DC. The magic number for victory is 270 electoral votes — an absolute majority.Each state’s allocation of electors is proportional to its representation in Congress, so a larger state like California has more electors (55) compared to smaller states like North Dakota (3).The candidate who wins the most votes in a state typically takes all of that state’s electoral votes a system used in 48 states and Washington DC. Maine and Nebraska, however, use a proportional system that can split electoral votes based on district-level and statewide results.The 2020 census altered the distribution of electors by shifting seats in the House of Representatives. For instance, Texas gained two additional seats and now holds 40 electoral votes, while states like California, New York, and Michigan each lost one electoral vote. This redistribution reflects population changes and impacts the electoral weight of different states in upcoming elections.As a result of this system, candidates can lose the popular vote but still win the presidency by securing key electoral votes, as demonstrated in the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton garnered almost 3 million more votes than Trump but lost in the Electoral College.In 2000, George W Bush won the presidency with 271 electoral votes, while his opponent, Al Gore, won the popular vote by over half a million.Early voting and absentee voting also play a vital role. Although the official election date is November 5, 2024, Americans have a choice to cast their votes weeks in advance through mail-in ballots or in-person early voting.Early voting picked up in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with absentee ballots accounting for 42 per cent of the total votes cast, according to the MIT Election Data + Science Lab. In total, 158 million votes were cast in the 2020 election, with absentee voting reaching a high of 66.4 million — up from 28.8 million in 2016.Trump claimed that absentee voting was “fraudulent,” but research has shown that’s a very rare scenario. In the 2022 mid-term elections, absentee voting fell to 32 per cent, but it continues to remain a crucial voting method for many Americans.Early voting is widely accessible in 47 states, along with territories like Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In most states, voters do not need a specific reason to cast their votes early, but some states require individuals to request absentee ballots for early voting.Only three states — Alabama, Mississippi, and New Hampshire — do not offer early in-person voting.The earliest set of results is typically known by the end of election night. Polling stations generally close between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm, with the winner often projected by 11:00 pm Eastern Time.However, the rise in mail-in ballots has led to delays in final results, particularly in swing states where margins are tight. In 2020, for instance, Joe Biden was declared the winner only after multiple days of counting in critical battleground states.Media outlets such as CNN, NBC, and ABC rely on real-time vote counts and exit polls to project winners, while the Associated Press (AP) uses a more conservative approach. The AP employs around 4,000 correspondents across the country and only declares a winner once they are certain that the remaining uncounted ballots will not change the outcome.The final step in the election process occurs in December when the Electoral College formally casts its votes. State governors or secretaries of state certify the results, and on January 6, 2025, Congress will officially count the electoral votes.The newly elected president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, marking the start of a four-year term.Swing states play an outsized role in determining the outcome of presidential elections. These states do not have a consistent pattern of voting for one party and can swing either Republican or Democrat in any given election.Key swing states in 2024 are likely to include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Winning these states is often decisive for candidates due to the significant number of electoral votes at stake.Campaigns pour millions of dollars into advertising and voter outreach in swing states. As of November 2023, Trump was leading in all but Wisconsin, highlighting how competitive these states can be.In addition to presidential votes, voters in many of these states will also be deciding on crucial local issues, including referendums on abortion rights in states like Montana and Arizona.The US presidential election is just one part of the broader voting process. On November 5, 2024, Americans will also elect 468 members of Congress, comprising 33 senators and all 435 members of the House of Representatives.Eleven states and two territories will hold gubernatorial elections, while various local offices and referendums will also be on the ballot. For example, a referendum in Montana will determine whether abortion rights should be enshrined in the state’s constitution.These elections, along with the presidential race, form a dynamic and multifaceted process that reflects the decentralized nature of the US electoral system. Voters play a direct role in shaping not only national leadership but also local and state policies that impact everyday life.","Voters elect 538 members of the Electoral College, who ultimately choose the president.

Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral. Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.

Kamala Harris Fox News Interview: Kamala Harris vows to be different than Joe Biden in fiery Fox interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-vows-to-be-different-than-joe-biden-in-fiery-fox-interview/articleshow/114298692.cms,"Harris's first formal interview with Fox News ran for nearly half an hour.

Vice President Kamala Harris sought to deflect criticism over the administration’s handling of the border crisis, her stance on transgender rights and her ties to President Joe Biden in a combative interview Wednesday on Fox News .“Let me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency, and like every new president that comes in to office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences and fresh and new ideas,” Harris said.The Democratic presidential nominee’s first formal interview with the outlet ran for nearly half an hour, capping a day where Harris sought to broaden her appeal to conservative voters with an event in suburban Philadelphia featuring dozens of Republican officials who had endorsed her campaign. The interview between Harris and Fox chief political anchor Bret Baier was frequently testy, with both frequently interrupting and speaking over each other.Baier opened the interview by pressing Harris on immigration , which voters have pegged as one of the defining issues of the election.Harris argued that the administration has taken the issue of immigration seriously and that many of the problems they were facing pre-dated her and Biden taking office, and hit at Trump for his role in blocking a bipartisan bill that would have surged resources to address the border surge.“We’ve had a broken immigration system transcending by the way Donald Trump ’s administration even before. Let’s all be honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system,” she said.The vice president said she and Biden had offered legislation to address the immigration system within hours of taking office.“Our focus has been on fixing a problem,” she said.But Baier pressed Harris on the number of undocumented migrants who had entered the country in recent years, and confronted Harris with a video clip of a family member blaming the Biden-Harris administration for the death of a woman murdered by someone in the country illegally.Asked if she would apologize to that family, Harris responded that they were “tragic cases.”“I am so sorry for her loss. I am so sorry for her loss, sincerely,” Harris added. “I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.”But she also insisted that Trump had stymied efforts to find a bipartisan solution to the problem, saying: “Let’s talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions.”During the interview, Baier also played an advertisement from the Trump campaign attacking Harris for statements during the 2020 presidential campaign in which she said she would use taxpayer dollars to pay for gender transition surgeries for prisoners.Harris responded by noting a recent New York Times report that federal prisoners had received gender affirming care during Trump’s administration.“I think frankly that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing you know stones when you’re living in a glass house,” Harris said. “I will follow the law, and it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed.”While Harris earned plaudits from supporters who applauded her vigorous exchange with Baier, one moment during the exchanged seemed destined to become fodder in future campaign ads.When the Fox News host defended Trump by saying the Republican didn’t actively advocate the treatment for transgender inmates, Harris said candidates had to take responsibility “for what happened in your administration.”The line could provide a convenient soundbite for Trump at a moment Harris’ campaign is seeking distance from Biden. Harris devoted significant time during the Fox interview to arguing she represented “a new generation of leadership,” after earning criticism for saying during an interview with The View last week that she could not think of a decision she would have approached differently than the current president.Still, asked what voters should turn the page from - particularly with polls showing many unhappy with the direction of the country — Harris focused her response toward her opponent: “The last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump.”","The Democratic presidential nominee’s first formal interview with the outlet ran for nearly half an hour.

Vice President Kamala Harris in her first exclusive interview with Fox News since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, outlined her economic strategy, and claiming that that it is superior to that of former President Donald Trump . Despite some polls indicating that the public trusts Trump more on economic issues, Harris presented her case for a forward-looking plan.When asked why people express greater trust in Trump regarding the economy, Harris responded, “When you look at an analysis of our plans, it’s clear that moving forward requires a shift from the divisiveness and rhetoric associated with Trump.” She said that her economic policy aims to strengthen the nation, contrasting it with Trump's approach, which she characterised as benefiting billionaires and large corporations at the expense of the national deficit.""My plan for the economy does exactly that. His plan would be, again, to give tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations in our country and blow up our deficit,"" she said.Despite the combative tone of the interview, in which Harris often had to contend with interruptions, she conveyed her commitment to new ideas and bipartisan cooperation to address critical issues like housing shortages and support for small businesses.Critics from Trump’s camp labelled the interview a “train wreck,” arguing that Harris failed to take responsibility for her party's shortcomings. However, Democratic supporters pointed out that Harris successfully communicated her policies to a typically unfriendly audience without making significant errors.Harris’s efforts to engage with Republican voters included an event in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where she talked about Trump’s attempts to undermine the 2020 election results. “He refused to accept the will of the people,” she stated, underscoring her belief that unity across party lines is essential for the upcoming election.Recent polling by Reuters/Ipsos revealed a tight race, with Harris leading Trump 45% to 42% nationally, although Trump's support on economic issues stands at 45%, compared to Harris’s 40%.","Kamala Harris gave her first interview since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee.

We have a broken immigration system.""Baier's inquiries intensified, particularly surrounding the Biden administration 's reversal of several Trump-era policies, notably the termination of the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy. ""Do you regret the decision to terminate Remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration?"" he asked. Harris responded by repeating that immigration reform was one of the first legislative priorities of her administration, claiming, ""We recognised from day one that it is a priority for us as a nation.""Throughout the interview, Harris maintained that her administration had made strides to address immigration issues, such as enhancing the asylum system and increasing penalties for illegal crossings. She also pointed to bipartisan efforts to strengthen border security, claiming that a proposed border bill would have allocated additional resources and personnel to combat issues such as the influx of fentanyl. ""Donald Trump learned about that bill and told them to kill it because he preferred to avoid fixing the problem,"" she asserted.As the discussion turned to specific violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants, Baier pressed Harris on whether she owed apologies to the families of victims. Referencing cases such as those of Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin, he asked, ""Do you owe those families an apology?"" Harris acknowledged the tragic nature of these incidents saying, ""I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.""When questioned about the Biden administration's assertions regarding border security, Harris maintained that the issues transcended her tenure and were part of a long-standing problem, stating, ""We've had a broken immigration system... even before [Trump's administration]."" She called for more judges and resources to expedite case processing and reiterated that comprehensive reform was essential.In response to inquiries regarding taxpayer-funded surgeries for transgender individuals in custody, Harris diverted the conversation back to the Trump administration , arguing that such provisions were already in place under his leadership.

"No bilateral but India, Pak ‘break the ice’ with Jaishankar visit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-bilateral-but-india-pak-break-the-ice-with-jaishankar-visit/articleshow/114294074.cms,"Modi, Sharif likely to come face to face at COP29 in Nov



ISLAMABAD: External affairs minister S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days even though there was no formal bilateral meeting between the foreign ministers on the margins of the SCO heads of government summit in Islamabad, diplomatic sources said. The fact that the first visit by an Indian foreign minister to Pakistan in almost 9 years went off without a hitch was seen as a positive development by the Indian government.As he departed after a 24-hour stay in Islamabad from the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, Jaishankar, who had said recently India isn’t passive on Pakistan and will react to positive and negative developments accordingly, thanked Shehbaz and Dar in a post on X for the hospitality and courtesies.While Indian government sources described the talks as casual conversations, Pakistan officials said there was a brief pull aside, which lasted for 5 to 7 minutes, between Jaishankar and Dar on the sidelines of the dinner hosted by Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday evening. Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), is learnt to have joined Jaishankar and Dar.A source speaking on condition of anonymity said Pakistan suggested resumption of bilateral cricketing ties as a way of “breaking the ice”. Naqvi was later quoted as saying that Jaishankar’s visit was an ice-breaker even though neither side proposed a bilateral meeting. Pakistan is looking to host the Champions Trophy next year and would like India to participate.The relationship between the 2 countries has remained in deep-freeze since the abortive bid to resume the dialogue process in 2015 under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. Things only worsened after Pakistan recalled its high commissioner in August 2019, following India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K.Indian government sources appreciated the fact that Shehbaz didn’t rake up any bilateral issue in his remarks as the host of the summit.While Jaishankar’s remarks on terrorism were seen as a message for Pakistan, Indian sources said the minister had only spoken about issues that the SCO has identified as key challenges and that other member-states can also relate to.Jaishankar is learnt to have had another extended conversation with Dar at the SCO lunch table on Wednesday where both were seated next to each other. “It wasn’t initially planned that way but later they sat together and spoke over lunch in the presence of other delegates,’’ said.Both sides denied that there was any proposal for resumption of dialogue. Shehbaz and Indian PM Narendra Modi are expected to come face to face next month at COP29 in Azerbaijan but for any substantive engagement, India will want Pakistan to first reappoint high commissioner.After his return from Pakistan, Jaishankar said in another post on X that India made a positive and constructive contribution to the talks in Islamabad and identified 8 takeaways from India’s perspective from the documents that were signed. These included upholding fair and balanced connectivity projects in accordance with international law, the goals and principles of the UN Charter and SCO Charter and a fair, open, inclusive and transparent multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.Significantly, another Pakistan minister, Ahsan Iqbal, had told visiting Indian journalists on Tuesday that Pakistan wants the 2 countries to return to the 1999 Lahore Declaration that called upon both sides to refrain from intervening and interfering in each other’s internal affairs. Shehbaz’s brother Nawaz Sharif, who reached the agreement with then Indian PM A B Vajpayee, has repeatedly accused former president Pervez Musharraf of scuttling the Declaration through his Kargil adventurism.","S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days.

He said attaining these original SCO objectives was even more important in an uncertain world marred by conflicts and debt.“It is axiomatic that development and growth requires peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the three evils,’’ said the minister.In a message to both China and Pakistan, the minister also said SCO cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and connectivity must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. “It should recognize territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas,’’ said the minister, adding cooperation can’t progress if global practices are cherry-picked, especially of trade and transit.India was again the only country in SCO to not endorse China’s BRI in the SCO joint statement. BRI’s flagship China Pakistan Economic Project ( CPEC ) passes through PoK, which India sees as under illegal occupation of Pakistan. Since it became a full member of SCO in 2017, India has repeatedly reminded member-states that it’s important for them to respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. China was represented by Premier Li Qiang in the meeting.The minister also spoke about the need to make the UN Security Council more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable. “The SCO must be in the lead of advocating such change, not hold back on a matter of such importance,’’ said the minister. China is the only P5 country not to publicly declare support for India’s UNSC permanent membership bid.“While we each make our contribution, the world order is more than the sum of its parts. As it changes, global institutions do need to keep pace. That is why the case for ‘reformed multilateralism’ gets stronger by the day. Comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council, both in the permanent and non-permanent categories, is essential,’’ said the minister.","S Jaishankar said activities across borders characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism would be detrimental to trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges.

Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party

Senior directors of a Pakistan college stated on Wednesday that there was no evidence to support claims of a student being raped on campus, despite reports circulating online that led to several days of protests. The allegations, which spread through social media posts, claimed that a woman was raped in the basement of a Punjab College for Women campus in Lahore .In response to the posts, hundreds of students, mostly male, engaged in protests that involved smashing windows and burning school buses. These demonstrations reflect a growing concern in Pakistan regarding safety, harassment, and sexual violence.Arif Chaudry, the Lahore director of the private Punjab Group of Colleges , which operates the women's college, was quoted by AFP during a press conference saying, ""The incident does not exist. I will resign and I will leave this profession and stand with the students if the incident took place.""Another director of the group, Agha Tahir Ijaz, urged students not to believe misinformation during the same news conference.As the anger grew over the alleged incident, police arrested a security guard who was identified in the online posts. However, they reported that no victim had come forward and that they were unable to verify the incident.The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has initiated an investigation targeting individuals responsible for disseminating the information via social media channels which is now claimed to be false.The protests, which began at two of the college's campuses on Monday afternoon, quickly spread to several other colleges throughout the city and continued for three days and resulted in injuries to at least 28 people.As the college denied the claims, Maryam Nawaz , the chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab also addressed the alleged rape incident, asserting that the accusations were 'fabricated'.Nawaz further claimed that the political party led by Imran Khan , Pakistan's former prime minister who is currently imprisoned, exploited the false allegation to provoke extensive student demonstrations and cause instability throughout the province.The Punjab government has closed the college campus where the alleged rape was said to have occurred until further notice. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said while warning that those responsible for spreading the false posts would face punishment. Addressing PTI founder Imran Khan, the CM added, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are."" She then claimed that the girl in question had suffered a back injury and had been receiving treatment in the hospital's intensive care unit since October 2 and was not raped.","Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party for 'fabricated' rape claims.

Li is likely to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-funded airport in the southwestern province, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.Neither side commented on the reason for a virtual inauguration, but sources cited heightened security concerns following the recent Karachi attack for Li being advised against travelling to a restive region.Islamabad, too, has sought to temporarily curb the movements of Chinese nationals in the country, citing fears of violence from armed groups. Officials said the Karachi blast is likely to figure in talks between Li and his Pakistani counterpart.“We will review progress on existing initiatives, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), and also explore new avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation. The Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership is the cornerstone of regional stability and prosperity,” Shehbaz wrote on X.According to the foreign office, Li will also call on President Asif Ali Zardari and hold meetings with parliamentary members and the senior military leadership.The two-day SCO meeting starts Tuesday in Islamabad.

At least 28 students, including girls, from various campuses of a well-known private college in Lahore, were injured during clashes with the police as they protested against the alleged on-campus rape of a female student, police said on Monday. The protests erupted Monday morning across at least four boys' and girls' campuses of the Punjab Group of Colleges , owned by the Dunya media group , following reports that a female student at the Gulberg girls' campus in Lahore was raped allegedly by a security guard in the institution's basement.As news of the alleged rape spread on social media, students from various campuses began protesting, accusing the college administration of negligence in the matter.A large number of students, including girls, set fire to college furniture and chanted slogans against the administration. As the protests escalated, with students blocking roads, the police resorted to baton charges to disperse the demonstrators.""During the clash, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured. One student's condition is critical,"" a Rescue 1122 official said, adding that the injured students are receiving treatment at Services Hospital.Sharaz Abbas, a student at Punjab College, told PTI that they were protesting to demand justice for the victim.""The Punjab police brutally assaulted us both inside and outside the campus. Even the girl students were not spared,"" he said, adding that the students would continue their protests until justice is served for the victim.A list of 28 injured students shows that their age ranges between 16 and 25.Talking to reporters, senior police officer Faisal Kamran said the police were forced to use batons. He said the students were demanding the custody of the college principal, and had the police not intervened in time, the protesting students might have harmed the principal and other staff members.Kamran also confirmed that the suspect has been arrested, but noted that the victim or her family is yet to report the incident.""So far, the claims related to the alleged rape have not been verified, but an investigation is underway,"" he said.Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said no formal rape report has been filed with the college.""Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz is closely monitoring the situation.

"Pakistan to repay over $30 billion debt in FY25, says central bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-repay-over-30-billion-debt-in-fy25-says-central-bank/articleshow/114208042.cms,"Representative Image

Cash-strapped Pakistan 's central bank has revealed the country is scheduled to repay a total of USD 30.35 billion in maturing foreign debt and interest payments in 12 months (August 2024 to July 2025) including those significant loans which bilateral creditors roll over every year.The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, cited by a JS Global report, showed that the payments from August 2024 to July 2025 include significant loans that bilateral creditors roll over annually.The Express Tribune reported that Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.Under the latest USD 7 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Pakistan's repayments and interest payments are fully secured for the 37-month loan period. Despite the rising repayments and interest payments, the foreign debt-to-GDP ratio has decreased from 27.6 per cent in August of the previous year to 20.2 per cent in August 2024, due to the expansion of Pakistan's economy in FY24 compared to the contraction in FY23.The data highlights the increasing foreign debt repayments and interest payments each year, emphasizing the need for economic managers, planners, and parliamentarians to explore ways to boost foreign income and reduce external expenditures. Compared to the USD 21.2 billion (including rollovers) paid by Pakistan over the past 12 months (August 2023 to July 2024), the current 12-month period's repayment and interest payment sum of USD 30 billion is significantly higher, according to JS Global.The increase in repayments and interest payments for the ongoing 12 months can be attributed to fresh loans provided by Saudi Arabia, UAE, and IMF in late June and July 2023, amounting to around USD 4 billion, as well as an additional USD 2 billion lent by IMF between August 2023 and April 2024. These loans have increased the repayment pressure (including significant rollover) in the coming years.Topline Research, citing the latest IMF documents, reported that Pakistan's gross external financing requirement has dropped to a 9-year low of USD 18.8 billion (excluding expected rollovers and contained current account deficit) for the ongoing fiscal year (July 2024 to June 2025). However, another researcher mentioned that Pakistan is also expected to add fresh foreign loans amounting to USD 3 billion to USD 4 billion in the current fiscal year (FY25).A third researcher emphasized the need for Pakistan to reduce its external expenditures through import substitution. Implementing such measures would help improve the country's ability to make external payments and increase foreign exchange reserves, as reported by The Express Tribune.","Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.

"IMF asks Pakistan to end preferential treatment to agriculture, textile sectors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-asks-pakistan-to-end-preferential-treatment-to-agriculture-textile-sectors/articleshow/114205816.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund has asked Pakistan to swiftly end preferential treatment, tax exemptions and other protections for the agriculture and textile sectors, which it says, have stifled the country's growth potential for decades, a media report said here on Monday. The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ), in its staff report on the diagnosis of the factors behind Pakistan's struggling economy, blamed these two sectors not only for failing to contribute adequately to the national revenue but also for consuming large portions of public funds while remaining inefficient and uncompetitive, The Dawn newspaper said.As part of the recently approved USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the IMF stressed that Pakistan must break from its economic practices of the past 75 years to escape its recurrent boom-bust cycles.The IMF report released on October 10 highlighted the country's significant lag behind similar nations, a stagnation that has compromised living standards and pushed over 40.5 per cent of the population below the poverty line.It said Pakistan had struggled to develop more sophisticated export goods, and the share of knowledge-intensive exports remains low as it failed to innovate. As of 2022, Pakistan ranked 85th in the Economic Complexity Index, the same rank it held in 2000.""With an export basket strongly biased towards agriculture and textiles (cotton yarn, rice, woven fabrics, beef, and leather apparel), the country has struggled to reallocate resources towards more technologically complex products,"" it said.The current focus on agriculture has limited Pakistan's ability to diversify into more technologically complex goods. While Pakistan does export some high-value products, such as medicines, medical instruments and plastic products, these sectors operate in a heavily distorted economic environment, it said.The report highlighted tariffs on intermediate and final goods as barriers to competitiveness and domestic market growth, inhibiting the country's transition towards more advanced manufacturing.""Reallocation, however, is held back by existing microeconomic distortions, including public procurement of agricultural goods, price controls on raw inputs, and fiscal and financial incentives for low productivity sectors,"" it observed.The report identified the textile sector as having the highest tax gap relative to its value added, noting that between 2007 and 2022, the sector benefited from subsidies, favourable pricing on inputs, concessional financing schemes and preferential tax treatment.Earlier, the IMF on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to certain conditions. This USD 1 billion tranche came under an agreement to receive USD 7 billion over 39 months.The latest IMF report pointed out that as of May 2024, 70 per cent of the outstanding concessional central bank loans were tied to the textile sector.The IMF recommended that the government focus on simplifying trade policies under the upcoming National Tariff Policy (2025-29) and urged Pakistan to avoid using tariffs to promote industrialisation or protect inefficient sectors, arguing that such policies weaken exports, hinder participation in global value chains, and incentivise rent-seeking.The report also warned that ""trade policies aimed at promoting specific domestic sectors, including export subsidies and local content requirements, should be discontinued as they are likely to promote resource misallocation and may violate international obligations"".Compared to other regional peers, Pakistan's export growth has been weak, with sales to the world particularly stagnant during the 2010s.It said several complex goods were within likely technological proximity to Pakistan's current export basket, including glassware, paints, chemicals, fabrics for industrial use, paper, cosmetics and rubber products.However, to facilitate the development of such new industries, the country needed a level playing field for business, avoiding targeted policies aimed at picking winners.This includes greater integration into global trade and easier access to imports, both as intermediate inputs for production and as final goods to promote domestic competition, the IMF said, adding, the removal of fiscal incentives would reduce the existing misallocation of resources and promote price discovery across firms.","The International Monetary Fund has asked Pakistan to end preferential treatment, tax exemptions and other protections for the agriculture and textile sectors. The IMF stressed that Pakistan must break from its economic practices of the past 75 years to escape its recurrent boom-bust cycles.

LAHORE: Ahead of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) protest scheduled for October 15, Lahore police have arrested more than 35 PTI activists from various parts of the city, ARY News reported.According to the details, the Punjab police carried out raids in several regions, including Defence, Kot Lakhpat, and Johar Town, targeting people believed to be involved in organising the PTI protest .The police operation is part of a strategy to maintain law and order and stop any disruptions as Pakistan is set to host the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit on October 15-16.The leadership of the Imran Khan-founded party has announced that it will hold a protest on October 15 to voice concerns regarding political grievances, which have sparked tensions between Imran Khan 's party and law enforcement agencies, the report said. It is the first day of the SCO Summit set to be held in Islamabad.Considering these developments, police officials have stressed their commitment to ensuring public safety while also respecting people's right to protest, ARY News reported.The police's action came after PTI last week announced a protest after the party held its political committee meeting. In a post on X, PTI's central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said a 'powerful' protest would be held at D-Chowk in Islamabad on October 15.He said that PTI's protests in Punjab have been called off and called for the release of PTI workers, leaders, and Members of Provincial Assembly (MPAs) detained in Punjab, ARY News reported.The Imran Khan-founded party called for an end to 'unlawful' raids and arrests by the federal and Punjab government. Sheikh Waqas Akram stated that the PTI chairman's life is under threat due to the actions of the government, which have 'stripped' him of basic human rights.Akram also accused the government of oppression and violence, stressing that PTI will not back down. He further said, ""The entire Pakistan will take to the streets on October 15, if Imran Khan is not granted access to basic rights, family, and party leaders,"" the report said.Meanwhile, Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called on PTI to withdraw its October 15 protest call in the ""larger national interest,"" Geo News reported.Speaking to reports following his visit to review arrangements for the upcoming SCO meeting, Dar stated that for the sake of politics, it was not good for a political party that had been repeating activities of 2014.
