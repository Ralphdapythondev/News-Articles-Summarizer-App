President out of danger



Attacker's body returned to family

Who was Azali Assoumani?





A man arrested for attacking Comoros President Azali Assoumani with a knife was found dead in his prison cell under unclear circumstances, authorities said on Saturday.National prosecutor Ali Mohamed Djounaid said that the attacker, identified as 24-year-old soldier Ahmed Abdou , assaulted the president with a kitchen knife during a funeral for a prominent religious leader before being restrained and handed over to investigators.Abdou also attacked a relative of the late religious leader. Assoumani sustained an injury to his hand following the attack.The attacker was placed in an isolated cell to calm him down following his arrest, according to Djounaid.""He (Abdou) was isolated in a cell so that he could calm down yesterday after his arrest. Investigators found his lifeless body lying on the floor this morning. A doctor declared him dead,"" Djounaid said at a press conference attended by nearly all government officials and the governors of two of the Comoros archipelago's three islands.An investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of Abdou's death in detention and the motive behind his attack. Prosecutor Djounaid said that Abdou had been handed over to investigators but ""did not have time to question him"" before his death. ""An inquiry is underway into the reasons for the young man's attempt on the president's life. There will also be an inquiry into the circumstances of his death,"" he added.The government officials have not disclosed details of the president's injuries, but said that he required ""stitches to his scalp.""

A few stitches were given,"" saidenergy minister Aboubacar Saïd Anli.Government spokeswoman Fatima Ahamada also confirmed that 65-year-old Assoumani is at home and ""doing very well.""Abdou's body has been returned to his family for burial according to Muslim tradition.

Assoumani was then elected president in 2002. After a decade out of office, he returned by winning a contested election in 2016. He briefly stepped down in 2019 but quickly reassumed office. Assoumani was re-elected last January amid accusations of ballot stuffing and subsequent deadly protests. His tenure was criticised for increasing authoritarianism.Assoumani also served as president of the African Union from 2023 to 2024.","Comoros President Azali Assoumani was attacked with a kitchen knife at a funeral.

However, satellite images taken Saturday morning by Planet Labs PBC and later analyzed by The Associated Press showed what appeared to be the three salvage vessels close to the Sounion. A warship could be seen nearby.The Greek state news agency ANA-MPA later reported the Aigaion Pelagos, a Greek-flagged tugboat, was involved in the effort. It said ""three frigates, helicopters and a special forces unit"" backed the salvagers.""Despite challenging conditions, with temperatures reaching up to 400 degrees Celsius (752 degrees Fahrenheit) due to the fire, the specialized salvage team successfully secured the tanker to the Aigaion Pelagos,"" the report said.The Sounion came under attack from the Houthis beginning Aug. 21. The vessel had been staffed by a crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, who were taken by a French destroyer to nearby Djibouti.The Houthis later planted explosives aboard the ship and detonated them.

They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. One of the sunken vessels, the Tutor, went down after the Houthis planted explosives aboard it and after its crew abandoned it due to an earlier attack, the rebel group later acknowledged.Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a US-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets.The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the US or the UK to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza.

Swift's endorsement: Beyond the numbers

Global pop star Taylor Swift 's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris has stirred significant buzz and could influence the upcoming election. With the US presidential race heating up, both Harris and former President Donald Trump are intensifying efforts to win over voters before Election Day on November 5, and in early voting which starts next week.Swift's endorsement on Instagram Tuesday night drew a massive response, garnering 10.4 million likes and driving nearly 406,000 people to Vote.gov within 24 hours, according to a US government spokesperson.Swift’s appeal among young voters , notably her fans, could be a crucial factor, especially as voter registrations among those aged 18-29 have declined in recent months.Despite Trump's dismissive comment that he is ""not a Taylor fan,"" Harris's team views the endorsement positively. The campaign, which was unaware of Swift's decision until her post, is keen on leveraging this momentum. Harris's aides are reportedly hopeful for further involvement from Swift, possibly in the form of a rally appearance in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state.Celebrity endorsements have historically had mixed results. A 2008 study highlighted Oprah Winfrey's impact on Barack Obama's vote count, while other endorsements, like those from George Clooney and Angelina Jolie, showed minimal effect. Margaretha Bentley from Arizona State University points out that while some students might be influenced by celebrities, others view their endorsements as unrelated to politics.Swift's endorsement has already shown tangible results. The site Vote.gov experienced a 585% spike in traffic during a critical time window after Swift's post.

New intelligence reports reveal that Hamza bin Laden , the son of Osama bin Laden , has taken command of al-Qaida, contradicting claims that he was killed in a 2019 US airstrike. Hamza, known as the ""Crown Prince of Terror,"" is now believed to be playing a pivotal role in the terror group's resurgence, overseeing the establishment of new training camps in Afghanistan, as al-Qaida rebuilds its capabilities to launch attacks against Western nations, including Britain and the US, a report in UK's Mirror said. Experts warn that Hamza’s leadership is reinvigorating the group and deepening its ties with the Taliban.

, the son of , has taken command of al-Qaida, contradicting claims that he was killed in a 2019 US airstrike. Hamza, known as the ""Crown Prince of Terror,"" is now believed to be playing a pivotal role in the terror group's resurgence, overseeing the establishment of new training camps in Afghanistan, as al-Qaida rebuilds its capabilities to launch attacks against Western nations, including Britain and the US, a report in UK's Mirror said. Experts warn that Hamza’s leadership is reinvigorating the group and deepening its ties with the Taliban. Hamza’s brother, Abdullah bin Laden, is also thought to be involved in al-Qaida’s operations, creating a powerful family-led terror dynasty with a shared mission to spread chaos, much like their father before them.

Hamza bin Laden and his four wives are believed to have sheltered in Iran for several years to evade the CIA. Despite claims of his death in a 2019 US air strike in Afghanistan, no DNA proof was acquired to confirm his demise. The recent intelligence suggests that Hamza uses safe houses in various Afghan provinces to facilitate the movement of al-Qaida members to and from Iran, the Mirror report said.

The reports suggest that Hamza’s survival and resurgence could mark al-Qaida’s most potent revival since the Iraq War, sparking fears of a new wave of terrorist activity aimed at the West, the Mirror report said.

Why it matters

Hamza bin Laden’s leadership represents a renewed threat from al-Qaida, a group that had been largely quiet following the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011 and the killing of Osama’s successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a 2022 US drone strike. With Hamza at the helm, al-Qaida has been regrouping in Afghanistan, taking advantage of the Taliban’s return to power after the US withdrawal in 2021.

This resurgence could have dire consequences for the West. Afghanistan is now home to a growing number of terror training camps, where fighters and suicide bombers are being prepared for attacks on Western targets. The Taliban, despite earlier promises to cut ties with terror groups, has allowed al-Qaida to re-establish itself within the country, further complicating the security situation.

According to some reports, there are as many as 21 different terror networks operating in Afghanistan, making it the world's most concentrated terror hotspot.

The fact that these camps are being built in areas where Western forces previously fought—such as Helmand and Ghazni provinces—underscores the symbolic and strategic threat posed by al-Qaida’s resurgence. The presence of these camps, coupled with the growing strength of al-Qaida, has sparked fears that another 9/11-style attack could be in the works. ""The parallels between the current situation and the prelude to the 9/11 attacks are alarming,"" said one intelligence analysis seen by the Mirror.

The big picture

Al-Qaida’s comeback is closely tied to the Taliban’s resurgence in Afghanistan. Since the fall of Kabul in 2021, the Taliban has maintained a strong relationship with al-Qaida, providing the terror group with safe havens and training facilities.

This collaboration is not new; the Taliban and al-Qaida have shared deep historical ties dating back to the 1990s when Osama bin Laden first established al-Qaida’s headquarters in Afghanistan. These ties persisted despite the US-led invasion in 2001, and they are now stronger than ever.

According to a recent report from the United Nations Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, al-Qaida has opened eight new training camps across Afghanistan in 2024. These camps are situated in provinces like Ghazni, Laghman, Parwan, Uruzgan, and Helmand—many of which were once battlegrounds for US and British forces fighting the Taliban. In addition to these camps, al-Qaida has established five madrasas (religious schools) in areas such as Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, which serve as breeding grounds for new recruits.

Hamza bin Laden has reportedly played a key role in this resurgence. Intelligence suggests that Hamza, now in his 30s, has been living in Afghanistan under the protection of senior Taliban leaders, holding regular meetings with them to coordinate al-Qaida’s activities.

Hamza is also believed to have received support from Sirajuddin Haqqani, an Afghan warlord and leader of the infamous Haqqani network. Haqqani, who is linked to multiple terror attacks in Afghanistan, is said to be sheltering Hamza and his family in the country, further strengthening the ties between the Taliban and al-Qaida.

""The resurgence and stronger ties between the Taliban and al-Qaida and the establishment of its training camps in Afghanistan represent a profound threat to the West,"" said one intelligence dossier. Western officials are particularly concerned that the Taliban is facilitating the movement of al-Qaida operatives between Afghanistan and Iran, allowing them to regroup and plan attacks with minimal interference.

What they’re saying

Colonel Richard Kemp, former chief of UK forces in Afghanistan, has voiced strong concerns about Hamza’s role in al-Qaida’s resurgence. ""Hamza now appears to have an open field in Afghanistan and will be intent on conquest and vengeance for his father,"" Kemp told the Mirror. He warns that Hamza’s leadership, combined with the Taliban’s tolerance for terror groups, could lead to a new wave of attacks on the West.

“Hamza bin Laden is not only alive but actively involved in al-Qaida’s resurgence, a fact well-known among senior Taliban leaders. These leaders engage with him, holding regular meetings and securing him and his family,"" reads an intelligence report. Another source said, ""[Hamza] has ascended to the leadership of al-Qaida, steering [it] towards its most potent resurgence since the Iraq War.""

Beyond Western intelligence, Afghan resistance groups have also expressed alarm over the growing presence of al-Qaida in the country, a Foreign Policy report said. Ali Maisam Nazary, a senior leader of Afghanistan’s National Resistance Front (NRF), said during a visit to Washington: “The Taliban have allowed al-Qaida to build bases and munitions depots in the heart of the Panjshir Valley. We’re seeing all the lights blinking red.”

Between the lines

While Hamza’s survival and leadership have reignited fears of another large-scale attack, the situation in Afghanistan is part of a broader pattern of growing extremism in the region. Alongside al-Qaida, other terror groups, such as the Islamic State’s Khorasan branch (ISIS-K), Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, have been expanding their influence in Afghanistan, thanks to the Taliban’s inability or unwillingness to crack down on extremist factions.

The United Nations has also noted an increasing presence of foreign fighters in Afghanistan, with militants from Arab countries, Central Asia, and even Europe flocking to the country to train and join the fight. This influx of fighters, combined with the training camps run by al-Qaida and other groups, makes Afghanistan a global epicenter of jihadist activity.

Moreover, the growing ties between al-Qaida and ISIS-K are particularly concerning. Previously, the two groups were rivals, but new intelligence reports suggest that they are now cooperating, with reports of inter-marriages between members of the two factions. This alliance mirrors past collaborations between key terrorist leaders and signals a new, more unified threat to the West.

What’s next

The resurgence of al-Qaida in Afghanistan poses significant challenges for Western governments. Despite Taliban assurances that they would prevent Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorism, the reality on the ground suggests that the opposite is happening. The US and its allies must now reassess their counterterrorism strategies, particularly as al-Qaida rebuilds its infrastructure and strengthens its alliances with other terror groups.

The US and its allies must now reassess their counterterrorism strategies, particularly as al-Qaida rebuilds its infrastructure and strengthens its alliances with other terror groups. Intelligence experts warn that the growth of these training camps and the re-establishment of al-Qaida’s networks could lead to future attacks, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe and the US. ""Al-Qaida is regrouping and preparing for future attacks on Western targets,"" said one report seen by the Mirror. The report also highlighted the possibility of another 9/11-style attack, driven by the symbolic and strategic weight of Hamza bin Laden’s leadership.

With Hamza at the helm and the Taliban providing cover, the threat posed by al-Qaida is as potent as ever. Western governments, particularly in the US and Britain, must remain vigilant and develop new strategies to counter this growing danger.

The world is now, slowly but surely, realising that all the talk of Taliban 2.0 was just a ploy by the militant group to smoothen its take over of Afghanistan. The Taliban 2.0 is no different than Taliban 1.0. All the restrictions on girls and women are back. Terror groups are again being allowed to set up based and training camps.Pakistan, the main advocate of Taliban 2.0, has seen a resurgence in terror attacksTehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), popularly known as Pakistan Taliban, is having a free run in Afghanistan.Pakistan, the main advocate of Taliban 2.0, has seen a resurgence in terror attacks by TTP from safe havens in Afghanistan. TTP has openly declared its goal of toppling Pakistan's democratically elected government. The group aims to replace the current system with an emirate that adheres to its strict interpretation of Islamic law.TTP's violent campaign has resulted in the deaths of numerous individuals, including members of Pakistan's defense forces, law enforcement agencies, and civilian population.Now, there are reports that even al-Qaida is regrouping and is acquiring capabilities to plan and launch terror attacks on Western nations.(With inputs from agencies)","Hamza bin Laden is believed to have taken command of al-Qaida, contradicting claims that he was killed in a 2019 US airstrike. Hamza is now believed to be playing a pivotal role in the terror group's resurgence, overseeing the establishment of new training camps in Afghanistan. Experts warn that Hamza’s leadership is reinvigorating the group and deepening its ties with the Taliban. The presence of these camps has sparked fears that another 9/11-style attack could be in the works.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113322608,imgsize-815192,width-400,resizemode-4/113322608.jpg"

The poll , conducted over two days after the showdown, shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 42%—a five-point margin that has expanded since late August.The debate, marked by sharp exchanges and personal attacks, saw Harris relentlessly press Trump on his fitness for office and ongoing legal troubles.Polling suggests voters saw her as the clear winner, with 53% believing Harris outperformed Trump, compared to just 24% who backed Trump’s performance. A CNN flash poll painted an even starker picture, with 60% of viewers saying Harris dominated the stage.Pundits were quick to declare Harris the victor, noting how she repeatedly backed Trump into a corner. According to Reuters , Harris ""put Trump on the defensive with a barrage of attacks on his record and legal woes,"" a view echoed by 52% of poll respondents who felt Trump struggled to keep up.For Harris, the poll is a welcome rebound after a recent New York Times/Siena College survey—widely regarded as highly accurate—showed her trailing Trump by a single point. That poll had put Trump at 48% to Harris' 47%, a razor-thin margin that had fueled anxiety within Democratic circles.Despite the positive numbers, the race remains tight, with battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin holding the keys to the White House. National polls, while promising, offer only a snapshot of the larger fight for electoral votes.In a bid to capitalize on her debate momentum, Harris' campaign swiftly challenged Trump to a second face-off, with Fox News offering to host the rematch. “Vice President Harris is ready for round two. Is Donald Trump?” her team asked in a pointed post-debate statement.Trump, meanwhile, has wavered on whether he’s game for another debate, calling the push for a second round a sign of desperation from the Harris camp. However, he’s left the door open depending on the host network.As the dust settles, the next major clash will be between the vice presidential nominees—Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—who are scheduled to debate on October 1, setting the stage for yet another high-stakes political face-off.","A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of former President Donald Trump.

Barron, whose responsibilities will focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) services, has been described in the project’s white paper, obtained by CoinDesk, as the key architect behind the family’s push to leave traditional banking behind and embrace blockchain technology.""We're embracing the future with crypto and leaving the slow and outdated big banks behind,"" Donald Trump said in a video promoting the new venture.DeFi, short for decentralized finance, represents a new frontier in the financial world, offering services like lending, borrowing, and trading through blockchain technology.

Drawing on historical parallels, he likened Trump’s current predicament to that of Senator Joe McCarthy in the early 1950s, who, despite a strong initial presence, quickly fell out of favor, he told political commentator Kristen Soltis Anderson and former Senator Al Franken.""Every time he's been done crazy shit and gotten himself in trouble, I said, no, no, it's not over. I've said that. I've argued with people. Tonight I'm saying I think it's over,"" he said on the recent episode of “Real Time with Bill Maher”.Anderson, however, offered a counterpoint, and said that that Trump remains competitive in the polls . “When you ask that about Donald Trump, only a fraction of voters say that they do,” she observed. “You look at these battleground states, they're still 50-50.”Maher remained optimistic about the election’s outcome, predicting that Trump would ultimately lose despite a close race. “It'll be tied on election day. As always, the polls will be tied, and then he'll lose. That's my prediction,” he said.Recent polling data shows a tight contest. A Reuters/Ipsos poll indicates Vice President Kamala Harris leading nationwide by 47% to 42%, with a slight increase of one point. Similarly, a Morning Consult survey places Harris at 50% to Trump’s 45%.

Truth behind man carrying geese which led to Haitians eating pets rumour revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/truth-behind-man-carrying-geese-which-led-to-haitians-eating-pets-rumour-revealed/articleshow/113356564.cms,"Woman behind rumor expresses regret

A viral photo of a man carrying two geese which stirred controversy and confusion after being linked to recent claims by former President Donald Trump . The image, which has been widely shared online, was initially used to support rumors that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating pets. However, officials have clarified the real story behind the photograph.According to TMZ, the Ohio Division of Wildlife has confirmed that the man seen in the photo was not involved in any nefarious activities.Instead, he was simply collecting two geese that had been struck by a car in Columbus, Ohio. The location of the incident is significant because it is about 45 minutes away from Springfield, where recent rumors about Haitian immigrants originated.The Franklin County Wildlife Office explained to TMZ that while claiming animal carcasses usually requires documentation, geese are an exception. Therefore, the man was legally allowed to pick up the geese without needing additional paperwork. There is also no evidence to suggest that the man is an immigrant or has any intentions of consuming the geese.The confusion began with a misleading video titled “Haitian Woman Eats Neighbor's Cat in Springfield,” which falsely claimed that a Haitian woman was caught eating a pet. This video, as verified by USA Today, was actually from an unrelated incident in Canton involving Allexis Ferrell, who has no known ties to Haiti. Springfield City Manager Bryan Heck quickly debunked the rumors, stating, “There is no evidence supporting the claims of Haitian immigrants harming or eating cats or other pets in Springfield.”Despite the lack of evidence, Trump and Ohio Senator JD Vance have perpetuated these false claims. During a recent debate, Trump suggested that Haitian immigrants were causing disruptions and eating pets in Springfield. At a rally, Trump further claimed that immigrants were taking geese from local parks and lakes. ""A recording of 911 calls shows residents reporting that the migrants are walking off with the town’s geese. They’re taking the geese. You know where the geese are? In the park, in the lake. And even walking off with their pets,"" the former President said.Erika Lee, whose Facebook post about the supposed pet-eating incidents sparked the controversy, has expressed regret over the situation. Lee’s post, which was based on second-hand information, was not intended to spread misinformation . “I’m not a racist,” Lee told NBC News, emphasizing that her intention was not to fuel racial or xenophobic narratives. Lee, who is mixed race and a member of the LGBTQ community, regretted how her post escalated into a national controversy.The photo of the man with the geese was mistakenly associated with these rumors, but it has now been confirmed that he was simply handling geese involved in an accident.","The Ohio Division of Wildlife has confirmed that the man seen in the photo was not involved in any nefarious activities.

""Nothing justifies violence or the threat of violence levied against Springfield or its residents. We condemn both.

What happened to Springfield?

Amid the major controversy over rumors that Haitians are eating cats and dogs in Ohio's Springfield, a new video posted by Christopher F Rufo, claimed that African migrants last year were filmed grilling cats in Dayton.

He said he spoke to the person who made the video. The person wanted anonymity but confirmed that the ""African dude next door had the damn cat on the grill"".Christopher said they identified their house (the one who hat the cat on the grill) and got to know that they were from Congo. Christopher said new residents now live in the house but the blue grill is still there.""To be clear: this single incident does not confirm every particularity of Trump’s statement. The town is Dayton, not Springfield; cats alone were on the grill, not cats and dogs. But it does break the general narrative peddled by the establishment media and its “fact checkers,” who insisted that this has never happened, and that any suggestion otherwise is somehow an expression of racism,"" Christopher wrote.Ohio's Springfield became the hotbed of a tense situation after several Republicans furthered the conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants there were killing and eating cats, dogs and ducks.

According to Business Insider, the company has made over five emergency 911 calls linked to ""terroristic threats"" between April 2022 and January 2024, prompting Tesla to spend millions to ensure the safety of its personnel and facilities.One of the most serious incidents occurred in March 2023 when then-Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn received a death threat via email. The email demanded $300,000 in bitcoin to spare his life, although authorities later deemed the threat a scam. Kirkhorn stepped down from his position in August 2023, months after the threat. In January 2024, another 911 call was made after a Tesla employee used X, formerly Twitter, to threaten Musk and U.S. President Joe Biden. The employee was arrested, and the threat was classified as ""terroristic.""Musk, who is code-named ""Voyager"" by his security team, rarely goes anywhere without his extensive security detail . The New York Times reported that Musk is typically flanked by as many as 20 security personnel, some armed, and accompanied by a medical professional. His net worth, estimated at over $250 billion by Bloomberg, has placed him at greater risk, necessitating constant protection. His security costs reportedly run into six figures monthly, once reaching over $163,000 in a single month in 2016.As Musk’s wealth and status have grown, so too have the risks. At Tesla's shareholder meeting in June 2024, Musk revealed that ""two homicidal maniacs"" had tried to kill him in recent months, forcing him to become more cautious. ""I probably need to, like, not get assassinated or something,"" Musk said.Musk has also taken personal measures to protect himself, including buying a house with 24/7 security after his address became public. Tesla's SEC filings show that Musk’s security company billed the company $2.4 million in 2023 and another $500,000 by February 2024.Tesla’s increased security also extends beyond Musk. The company has bolstered surveillance and personnel at its factories following recent layoffs, and factory workers in both Nevada and Texas now undergo multiple security checks each day to enter the facilities.","Tesla has made over five emergency 911 calls linked to ""terroristic threats"" between April 2022 and January 2024.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.

Pakistan stand-off over cops seeking army exit from restive province drags on,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-stand-off-over-cops-seeking-army-exit-from-restive-province-drags-on/articleshow/113302897.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The stand-off in northwestern Pakistan involving police units that have gone on strike to demand the withdrawal of military and intelligence agencies from the restive region entered the fourth day Thursday with no sign of the crisis easing.On Sept 9, hundreds of policemen had blocked Indus Highway, which links Peshawar in the northwest with the southern port city of Karachi, in Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to protest alleged military interference in their regular duties.Police officers from the surrounding districts, including Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan and Tank, joined their protesting colleagues, while political parties, tribal leaders and civil society groups expressed solidarity with them.The protesters, who accuse the ISI and Military Intelligence of exacerbating the situation in the region, have seen many of their colleagues kidnapped or ambushed by Taliban fighters and supporters in Lakki Marwat, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan over the last few years. In some cases, their houses and families have been targeted.This is the first instance in Pakistan of uniformed personnel on a sit-in and blocking an inter-provincial highway for four consecutive days. The protesters have so far turned down requests by their bosses to hold talks and end the agitation.Officer Rashid Khan said the army should leave the district and let the police department work freely.“We promise to restore peace in the area within three months if military officers stop their interference,"" he said in Lakki Marwat.""Their game of playing good and bad Taliban is not over. We (police force) arrest militants and they (the military) call us to release them,"" another official at the sit-in told TOI.The army has a large presence in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, where it has been battling the Taliban and other outfits for nearly two decades.Police officials in Bajaur tribal district, bordering Afghanistan, have announced they wouldn't work even with anti-polio teams until the administration identified and arrested the killers of a colleague who was shot dead while escorting once such group in Bajaur this week.“There will be a complete boycott of polio duty,” a video circulating on social media showed a man standing among a group of uniformed personnel as saying. ""They (the government and security officials) will give us the killers of Luqman (the police constable killed in the latest attack while performing polio duty) first.""Pakistan has seen a rise in militant attacks in recent weeks, with many of them taking place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where groups like the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, have stepped up attacks, targeting security forces convoys and checkpoints, and carrying out targeted killings and kidnappings of security personnel and govt officials.At least 75 police personnel have been killed in ambushes and targeted killings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa this year, according to official data.","Hundreds of policemen had blocked Indus Highway, which links Peshawar in the northwest with the southern port city of Karachi.

Authorities on Monday launched a new, nationwide polio vaccination campaign amid stepped-up security to protect the polio workers.On Monday, a roadside bomb exploded near a vehicle carrying officers assigned to protect polio workers in the district of South Waziristan, also in the same province, wounding six officers and three civilians. The militant Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for Monday's attack.Anti-polio campaigns in Pakistan are regularly marred by violence. Militants target vaccination teams and police assigned to protect them, falsely claiming that the campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Since January, Pakistan has reported 17 new cases of polio, jeopardizing decades of efforts to eliminate polio in the country.The potentially fatal, paralyzing disease mostly strikes children under age 5 and typically spreads through contaminated water. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in which the spread of polio has never been stopped.","Gunmen on a motorcycle kill a policeman guarding a group of polio workers.

There has also been a 20-30% tariff increase on electricity and other energy products, hitting the common man hard.Pakistan's external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.The February general election produced Shehbaz Sharif-led shaky coalition government, which now has the challenging task of tackling deep-rooted structural problems to pull the $350-billion economy out of its misery.Since joining the multilateral lender in 1950, Pakistan has secured 24 IMF bailouts, the latest being subject to approval by the lender's executive board and the confirmation of necessary financing assurances from the country's development and bilateral partners.","Islamabad has been working on implementing conditions from the IMF to complete a $7 billion, 37-month loan programme agreed in July.

Pakistani policeman kills blasphemy suspect inside police station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-policeman-kills-blasphemy-suspect-inside-police-station/articleshow/113288514.cms,"A police officer in Quetta , Pakistan, shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday. Khan had been arrested on Wednesday after being taken from an angry mob that accused him of insulting the Prophet Muhammad.The police officer responsible for the shooting has been arrested, according to police official Mohammad Khurram , who did not provide additional information.In Pakistan, accusations of blasphemy are common and can lead to mob violence and lynching, even if they are just rumors. The country's controversial blasphemy laws allow for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or Islamic religious figures, although no executions have been carried out.Before his arrest, local residents claimed Khan had used derogatory remarks against the prophet and went after him. After his arrest, a mob surrounded the police station, demanding that Khan be handed over to them for execution. One person threw a grenade at the station on Wednesday, and a group of Islamists briefly blocked a key road in the city, demanding punishment for Khan. The crowd eventually dispersed after officials managed to calm them down.Pakistan has seen an increase in attacks on blasphemy suspects in recent years. In June, a mob in Madyan lynched a tourist accused of desecrating the holy Quran, and in 2022, a mob in Punjab province attacked churches and homes of Christians after claiming they saw a local Christian and his friend desecrating pages from a Quran. The attack in Jaranwala drew nationwide condemnation, but Christians say the men linked to the violence have not yet been put on trial.In 2011, a policeman killed a former governor of Punjab province after accusing him of blasphemy. The officer, Mumtaz Qadri , was later sentenced to death and hanged, but support for him grew after his execution, with tens of thousands attending his funeral in Rawalpindi. Many in Punjab still consider him a martyr today.Quetta, a conservative city in southwestern Pakistan, is also the capital of the restive Balochistan province, where militant groups stage near-daily attacks and separatists have waged a decades-long insurgency against the government in Islamabad.","A police officer shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday.
