US Presidential Elections: 'She'll cut her own path ...': Biden on Kamala Harris' Presidential vision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shell-cut-her-own-path-biden-on-kamala-harris-presidential-vision/articleshow/114268612.cms,"President Joe Biden speaks at a political event in Philadelphia (Picture Credit: PTI)

President Joe Biden expressed confidence that vice president Kamala Harris would ""cut her own path"" if elected president, emphasising that she could bring change to the White House .Speaking at a Democratic dinner in Philadelphia, Biden reflected on his own experience as vice president under Barack Obama, saying, ""Every president has to cut their own path. I was loyal to Barack Obama, but I cut my own path as president.That's what Kamala's going to do.""Biden highlighted Harris’s loyalty while asserting that her leadership would offer a ""fresh and new"" perspective on the country’s challenges, in contrast to Donald Trump ’s ""old and failed"" approach.Biden added: ""Kamala's perspective on our problems will be fresh and new. Donald Trump's perspective is old and failed and quite frankly thoroughly totally dishonest.""Harris took over as the Democratic Presidential nominee in July after 81-year-old Biden stepped from the race. ""When I decided it was time to pass the torch to the next generation, I knew. I knew who I wanted to replace me,"" Biden said, his recent dinner speech was seen as a strong endorsement of Harris.Harris has faced backlash from Republicans for a recent statement, after a recent interview where she said ""There is not a thing that comes to mind... and I've been part of most of the decisions that have had impact,"" Harris said when asked how she would have done things differently from Biden administration.This has placed her in a critical position where she is advocating for change while not distancing herself from Biden’s policies.A New York Times/Siena poll one week ago found voters were marginally more likely to see her, rather than Trump, as a break from the status quo.Biden also launched a full-blown verbal attack on Trump while portraying the former President as out of touch with modern America, mocking a recent town hall where the former president danced for 30 minutes. He said, ""What's wrong with this guy?""Biden further condemned Trump for his stance on immigration, ""Trump hides all his racism, now it's all out front. He has the same ideas on race as the 1930s. Trump's ideas on the economy are from the 20s. Trump's ideas on women are from the 50s,"" he said.","President Joe Biden expressed confidence that vice president Kamala Harris would ""cut her own path"" if elected president.

Chinese Aquarium: 'Shark-struck': Chinese aquarium criticised for using robot instead of real Whale Shark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/shark-struck-chinese-aquarium-criticised-for-using-robot-instead-of-real-whale-shark/articleshow/114267466.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

A Chinese aquarium in Shenzhen, Xiaomeisha Sea World , has sparked outrage after unveiling a mechanical whale shark as its star attraction, reported the New York Post.Reopened on October 1 after five years of renovations, the park drew approximately 100,000 visitors during its week-long trial period.However, many were disappointed to discover that the much-anticipated whale shark was, in fact, a robot.Photos shared by visitors show visible gaps in the mechanical shark's body, leading many to criticise the aquarium for creating unrealistic expectations. Angry guests took to social media, calling the robot ""uninteresting"" and voicing their frustrations over the high entry fee of around $40.Earlier, Chinese zoos have been accused of misleading people by swapping or modifying animals. The recent case came into the limelight when a zoo in China painted dogs to resemble pandas.Xiaomeisha Sea World defended the decision, explaining that the robotic whale shark adheres to laws prohibiting the trade of live whale sharks . However, this did little to appease disgruntled visitors, with one stating, ""I’d rather they didn’t have one at all than show a fake one.""Complaints were also made regarding the live exhibits, with some guests pointing out the poor health of the fish, claiming some displayed signs of white spot disease.","Aquarium in Shenzhen, Xiaomeisha Sea World has sparked outrage after unveiling a mechanical whale shark as its star attraction.

Journalist Olivia Nuzzi ’s ex-fiancé, Ryan Lizza , has made shocking claims in a recent court filing at Washington, DC’s Superior Court last week about her relationship with RFK Jr This legal battle follows Nuzzi’s filing of a no-contact order against Lizza, in which she accused him of harassment, blackmail related to an affair, and allegedly hacking her devices.According to Lizza’s filing, Nuzzi described RFK Jr, who is married to actress Cheryl Hines , as a “70-year-old sex addict” who told her he wanted to ‘possess,’ ‘control,’ and ‘impregnate’ her.” She claimed that he manipulated her due to a “huge power disparity.” She characterised the affair as “toxic, unhealthy, stupid, psychotic,” and expressed regret over it.Lizza, who works as Politico’s chief Washington correspondent, denied Nuzzi’s accusations in the filing, as reported by the New York Post. He refuted claims that he leaked details of her affair, to her editors at New York Magazine or to the media, stating that he had actually encouraged her to disclose the relationship to her superiors, which she refused to do.Lizza also denied hacking her devices and claimed that he learnt everything about the nearly year-long affair after Nuzzi’s tearful admission as she tried to mend their relationship.Lizza, 50, described Nuzzi, 31, as a heartbroken lover who desperately tried to save their engagement after he ended it in August. The court documents also revealed that Nuzzi repeatedly contacted Lizza after their breakup, begging him to rekindle their relationship.Lizza also said that this was not Nuzzi's first affair and blamed a previous one for derailing their joint book deal in 2020.Nuzzi is on leave from New York Magazine since the news broke in September.Robert F. Kennedy Jr stated that he and Olivia Nuzzi met only once and told The Wall Street Journal that Ryan Lizza’s account of their relationship was inaccurate.Nuzzi’s attorneys also responded to Lizza’s court filing, stating, “We reiterate that Lizza intends to harass and humiliate Nuzzi, using the press to do so—issues that prompted her to seek a protective order in DC Superior Court. This filing, filled with salacious and irrelevant claims, only furthers his harassment. Nuzzi’s goal in seeking legal intervention is to ensure her safety and to be left alone.”Nuzzi allegedly started sexting with Robert F. Kennedy Jr shortly after interviewing him for New York Magazine during his run as an independent presidential candidate.According to a source cited by Page Six, she reportedly sent him ""demure nudes,"" and the two engaged in ""incredible"" FaceTime sex.","Olivia Nuzzi's ex-fiancé, Ryan Lizza, has made shocking claims in a recent court filing at Washington, DC’s Superior Court last week about her relationship with RFK Jr. Lizza denied claims that he leaked details of her affair, to her editors at New York Magazine or to the media, stating that he had actually encouraged her to disclose the relationship to her superiors, which she refused to do.

UN says Yemen risks being dragged into Mideast conflict that could spiral out of control,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/un-says-yemen-risks-being-dragged-into-mideast-conflict-that-could-spiral-out-of-control/articleshow/114267052.cms,"UNITED NATIONS: Yemen risks being dragged further into the military escalation in the Middle East that keeps intensifying and could spiral out of control, the UN special envoy for the Arab world's poorest nation said Tuesday. Hans Grundberg told the UN Security Council that regrettably Yemen is part of the escalation - and he warned that repeated attacks on international shipping by its Houthi rebels ""have significantly increased the risk of an environment disaster"" in the Red Sea.Both Grundberg and the UN's acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya urged the Iranian-backed Houthis to halt their attacks on international shipping, which the rebel group began to support fellow Iranian-backed militant group Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack in Israel that sparked Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.The U.N. officials also demanded the release of dozens of UN personnel, staff of non-governmental organizations and diplomatic missions, and members of civil society, most detained since June.Msuya called the Houthis' recent referral of a significant number of those detained for ""criminal prosecution"" unacceptable and accusations against them false. She said three are UN personnel - two from the Paris-based UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and one from the Geneva-based UN human rights office. They were detained earlier in 2021 and 2023.Days after the June detentions, the Houthis said those being held were members of what they called an ""American-Israeli spy network,"" an allegation vehemently denied by the UN, NGO organizations, governments and others.The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen's internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of the capital Sanaa and most of the north. Hopes for peace talks vanished after the Oct. 7 attack, which killed about 1,200 people in Israel, mainly civilians, and saw about 250 taken hostage, with about 100 still being held. . Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities.Grundberg told council members ""Yemenis continue to yearn and work for peace,"" but he said hopes for progress to end the escalating violence in the Middle East ""seem distant.""""Now, like many in the Middle East, their hopes for a brighter future are falling under the shadow of potentially catastrophic regional conflagration,"" he said.The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started a year ago. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors, and have seriously disrupted traffic in the Red Sea which once saw $1 trillion in goods move through it in a year.Grundberg said the Houthi attack on the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion in August narrowly avoided an environmental disaster and warned that repeated attacks increase the risk of an environmental catastrophe.In response to the Houthi attacks, a US-led coalition has carried out airstrikes in Yemen, and the Israelis have attacked the port of Hodeida, a key location for delivery of aid and commercial goods which are critical as the country is reliant on imports.Msuya said the U.N. is ""very alarmed"" at the ongoing attacks on Hodeida and the smaller port of Ras Issa. The airstrikes damaged critical energy and port infrastructure but she said both ports are able to receive commercial and humanitarian imports.""Power stations throughout Hodeida city are, however, running at very limited capacity,"" Msuya said, and the UN is assisting health facilities to continue essential services.Last month, Msuya told the council the UN was cutting back its activities in Yemen in response to the Houthi crackdown on staff working for the UN and other groups.She warned the council on Tuesday that despite escalating needs, the arbitrary detentions and ""false accusations against them continue to significantly hinder our ability to provide life saving humanitarian assistance in Yemen.""""The humanitarian situation in Yemen continues to worsen, both in scale and severity,"" Msuya said, and ""hunger continues to rise.""The number of Yemenis without enough to eat ""soared to unprecedented levels"" in August, and in Houthi-controlled areas severe levels of food deprivation have doubled since last year, she said.Msuya said the UN appeal for $2.7 billion for Yemen this year to help 11.2 million people is 41% funded. She said $870 million is needed urgently, and warned that without the additional funds 9 million Yemenis across the country won't get emergency food aid in the last quarter of this year.While cholera continues to spread, with more than 203,000 suspected cases and over 720 deaths since March, Msuya said cholera funding has already run out, and the UN's health partners have been forced to close 21 of 78 diarrhea treatment centers and 97 of 423 oral rehydration centers.","Yemen risks being dragged further into the military escalation in the Middle East.

"Georgia Early Voting: Georgia kicks off early voting with record-breaking 2,50,000 ballot casts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/georgia-kicks-off-early-voting-with-record-breaking-250000-ballot-casts/articleshow/114266607.cms,"The first day of early in-person voting in Georgia (Picture Credit: AP)

Early voting started in Georgia on Tuesday, during which a record-breaking 2,52,000 early votes were cast, surpassing the previous day's turnout of 1,36,000 in 2020, as reported by CNN.“Spectacular turnout. We are running out of adjectives for this.” The previous first-day record was 136,000 in 2020, Sterling said.This vote increase highlights Georgia's role as a key battleground state, as former President Donald Trump seeks to reclaim it after losing narrowly to President Joe Biden in 2020.Former US President Jimmy Carter , who turned 100 on October 1, has also participated in Georgia’s early voting, making him the oldest former president in American history to do so.Just two months earlier, his grandson, Jason Carter, revealed to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that his grandfather had expressed his wish to live long enough to cast his vote for Vice President Kamala Harris As Georgia recovers from Hurricane Helene which impacted the region last month, Georgia officials confirmed thatabsentee ballots were mailed on time, with over 250,000 requests submitted and this could rise to 300,000 representing 5-6% of voters, said Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.New laws tightening absentee ballot rules and limiting drop boxes, however, may reduce the appeal of voting by mail.In 2020, drop boxes were available 24/7, but now they are fewer and only accessible during business hours at election offices or early vote locations.Georgia’s law now mandates two Saturdays of early voting, with optional Sunday voting, which could contribute to sustained high turnout.Raffensperger reassured voters about the election’s security, highlighting race audits and random equipment checks on Election Day to ensure accuracy and guard against interference.","2,52,000 early votes were cast in Georgia on Tuesday, surpassing the previous day's turnout of 1,36,000 in 2020.

How US picks its president: Decoding the election process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-us-picks-its-president-decoding-the-election-process/articleshow/114252324.cms,"US vice president Kamala Harris.

Here’s the lowdown on how America elects its head of state.

Who are the main contenders for the 2024 race?

Electoral College

Early voting and mail-in ballots

Vote counting

Swing states

Electing members of Congress

The United States presidential election is a process that goes beyond a simple tally of votes. Voters elect 538 members of the Electoral College , who ultimately choose the president.Most states follow a winner-take-all system, but a few divide their electoral votes proportionally.The outcome often hinges on pivotal swing states, and although early and absentee voting is common, the official result isn’t finalized until Congress certifies the electoral votes.How is the US election winner decided?Sometimes, a candidate wins despite losing the popular vote, and certain states are more crucial than others to clinch a win.The Democratic Party has, US Vice President Kamala Harris succeeded Joe Biden on July 21, leading the ticket. She will turn 60 this month and has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, 60, as her running mate.Former US President Donald Trump , who is running again at 78 years old, is the Republican Party candidate. Ohio Senator JD Vance, 40, is his vice-presidential candidate.Jill Stein is running for the Green Party, having previously contested in 2012 and 2016, while Chase Oliver is the Libertarian Party’s candidate.And, Robert Kennedy Jr , son of the former attorney general and nephew of US President John F Kennedy , has suspended his independent campaign and endorsed Trump.Stein’s previous runs and the Green Party’s 2020 candidate, Howie Hawkins, reflect the ongoing presence of third-party challengers, though they have yet to pose a serious threat to the two-party dominance in US presidential elections.There are numerous other candidates affiliated with other minor parties or those who are running independently, but do not have majority ballot access.A US voter does not directly vote for president. Instead, voters cast votes for electors in the Electoral College, a body that ultimately chooses the president.There are 538 electors in total, representing 435 members of the House of Representatives , 100 Senators, and 3 electors from Washington DC. The magic number for victory is 270 electoral votes — an absolute majority.Each state’s allocation of electors is proportional to its representation in Congress, so a larger state like California has more electors (55) compared to smaller states like North Dakota (3).The candidate who wins the most votes in a state typically takes all of that state’s electoral votes a system used in 48 states and Washington DC. Maine and Nebraska, however, use a proportional system that can split electoral votes based on district-level and statewide results.The 2020 census altered the distribution of electors by shifting seats in the House of Representatives. For instance, Texas gained two additional seats and now holds 40 electoral votes, while states like California, New York, and Michigan each lost one electoral vote. This redistribution reflects population changes and impacts the electoral weight of different states in upcoming elections.As a result of this system, candidates can lose the popular vote but still win the presidency by securing key electoral votes, as demonstrated in the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton garnered almost 3 million more votes than Trump but lost in the Electoral College.In 2000, George W Bush won the presidency with 271 electoral votes, while his opponent, Al Gore, won the popular vote by over half a million.Early voting and absentee voting also play a vital role. Although the official election date is November 5, 2024, Americans have a choice to cast their votes weeks in advance through mail-in ballots or in-person early voting.Early voting picked up in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with absentee ballots accounting for 42 per cent of the total votes cast, according to the MIT Election Data + Science Lab. In total, 158 million votes were cast in the 2020 election, with absentee voting reaching a high of 66.4 million — up from 28.8 million in 2016.Trump claimed that absentee voting was “fraudulent,” but research has shown that’s a very rare scenario. In the 2022 mid-term elections, absentee voting fell to 32 per cent, but it continues to remain a crucial voting method for many Americans.Early voting is widely accessible in 47 states, along with territories like Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In most states, voters do not need a specific reason to cast their votes early, but some states require individuals to request absentee ballots for early voting.Only three states — Alabama, Mississippi, and New Hampshire — do not offer early in-person voting.The earliest set of results is typically known by the end of election night. Polling stations generally close between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm, with the winner often projected by 11:00 pm Eastern Time.However, the rise in mail-in ballots has led to delays in final results, particularly in swing states where margins are tight. In 2020, for instance, Joe Biden was declared the winner only after multiple days of counting in critical battleground states.Media outlets such as CNN, NBC, and ABC rely on real-time vote counts and exit polls to project winners, while the Associated Press (AP) uses a more conservative approach. The AP employs around 4,000 correspondents across the country and only declares a winner once they are certain that the remaining uncounted ballots will not change the outcome.The final step in the election process occurs in December when the Electoral College formally casts its votes. State governors or secretaries of state certify the results, and on January 6, 2025, Congress will officially count the electoral votes.The newly elected president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, marking the start of a four-year term.Swing states play an outsized role in determining the outcome of presidential elections. These states do not have a consistent pattern of voting for one party and can swing either Republican or Democrat in any given election.Key swing states in 2024 are likely to include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Winning these states is often decisive for candidates due to the significant number of electoral votes at stake.Campaigns pour millions of dollars into advertising and voter outreach in swing states. As of November 2023, Trump was leading in all but Wisconsin, highlighting how competitive these states can be.In addition to presidential votes, voters in many of these states will also be deciding on crucial local issues, including referendums on abortion rights in states like Montana and Arizona.The US presidential election is just one part of the broader voting process. On November 5, 2024, Americans will also elect 468 members of Congress, comprising 33 senators and all 435 members of the House of Representatives.Eleven states and two territories will hold gubernatorial elections, while various local offices and referendums will also be on the ballot. For example, a referendum in Montana will determine whether abortion rights should be enshrined in the state’s constitution.These elections, along with the presidential race, form a dynamic and multifaceted process that reflects the decentralized nature of the US electoral system. Voters play a direct role in shaping not only national leadership but also local and state policies that impact everyday life.","Voters elect 538 members of the Electoral College, who ultimately choose the president.

Iran halts indirect talks with US amid Middle East crisis

The White House announced on Monday that the United States has been monitoring threats from Iran against former President Donald Trump for years. It issued a stern warning to Tehran, stating that any attack on a US citizen would result in severe consequences.Calling it a security matter, the White House released a statement.""We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats.Should Iran attack any of our citizens, including those who continue to serve the United States or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences,"" said White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett.Iran announced on Monday that it has paused its indirect discussions with the US, mediated by Oman, due to ongoing tensions in the Middle East. The two countries lack direct diplomatic relations, making Oman a key intermediary.""Currently we don't see any ground for these talks, until we can get past the current crisis,"" said Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi during a press briefing in Muscat, Oman's capital.Relations in the region have become increasingly strained. On October 1, Iran launched 200 missiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders and an Iranian Revolutionary Guards general. In response, Israel has vowed to retaliate.Oman has a history of mediating between Iran and the United States, especially since the two countries severed relations following Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.The United States remains a close ally and top military supporter of Israel, while Iran supports Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah in their conflicts with Israel.","Iran halts indirect talks with US amid Middle East crisis.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Allegations of neglecting the Black community

Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on The Breakfast Club podcast with Charlamagne tha God to address key issues ahead of the 2024 election . During the interview, she touched on a wide range of topics, from marijuana policy to accusations that she has neglected the Black community. Recent poll data shows her trailing behind in key demographics, increasing the stakes of this conversation.Harris said that voters face two stark choices in the election, “By voting, you have two choices…two very different visions for our nation.” She warned that another Trump presidency would ""take us backward.""She also discussed her proposals for Black men and her ongoing commitment to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.When asked about why Harris comes off as very scripted and ""likes to stick to her talking points"" the VP talked about the importance of repetition in communicating her message across the country, particularly in such a high-stakes election. She admitted that delivering the same message consistently is key to helping people understand her positions. ""Repetition is important. Some people say until someone has heard something at least three times, it just doesn't stay with you,"" she explained. Harris added that she feels the ""weight of the moment"" and the responsibility she carries, saying, ""This is a margin of error race. It's tight.""One of the more controversial topics Harris addressed was her stance on marijuana, particularly given accusations that she targeted Black men for weed offences during her time as a prosecutor. Harris firmly denied these claims, saying, ""I was the most progressive prosecutor in California on marijuana cases and would not send people to jail for simple possession."" As Vice President, she has worked to lower marijuana’s classification and committed to decriminalising it if elected President.""As president, I will work on decriminalizing it because I know exactly how those laws have been used to disproportionately impact certain populations and specifically black men,"" she said.Harris faced tough questions on the issue of sending aid to other countries while domestic issues remain unaddressed. A caller asked why the U.S. sends money overseas when people at home struggle with housing and healthcare. Charlamagne added, ""That’s one reason why America First rhetoric resonates."" Harris responded that the U.S. must remain a world leader while also meeting the needs of its citizens. She talked about efforts such as reducing prescription drug prices and increasing investment in HBCUs as evidence of her focus on domestic issues. ""So part of my plan is that we're going to give people a $25,000 down payment assistance to get their foot in the door to buy a home for first time home buyers,"" the VP said.Charlamagne cited former President Obama’s recent remarks about the unrealistic expectations placed on Presidents to solve every problem. Harris agreed, noting that while it’s important to strive for progress, it’s impossible to fix everything. ""President Obama is absolutely correct, but it doesn’t mean we can’t do anything."" She pointed to her track record in reducing Black child poverty and increasing access to homeownership as proof of her commitment to improving the lives of everyday Americans.Kamala expressed her concerns about a potential Trump victory, saying, “If Trump wins, he’s going to use this law to put anyone that doesn’t look white, in camps.” She warned that Trump’s campaign is “about instilling fear, not about hope, not about optimism.” Citing his false claims about immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, she highlighted how Trump prefers to run on problems rather than fixing them.When Charlamagne whether the Biden administration shares some blame for border issues. Harris replied, “No, Charlamagne… the first thing we dropped was a bill to fix the broken immigration system”.""We did to try and get that border security bill passed, and then also an executive order that has actually reduced significantly the number of illegal crossings and tightened up what needs to happen in between ports of entry,"" she said.She rejected the title of ""border czar,"" stating, “If I responded to every name he called me, I wouldn’t be focused on helping the American people.” Harris also warned of Trump’s intentions to weaponise the Department of Justice against political opponents, stressing, “That’s not supposed to happen in America.”Harris was asked about a circulating clip that claimed she would ""do nothing specifically for Black people."" She dismissed the accusation as misinformation, stating, ""My work from the beginning of my career through today has been about supporting the Black community."" Harris cited her work on healthcare, Black maternal mortality, and her investments in HBCUs as examples of her dedication. She also underscored that misinformation is a key challenge she faces in this election, aimed at undermining her achievements.In this podcast appearance, Harris sought to clarify her positions on critical issues and combat widespread misinformation as she gears up for what she described as a ""tight"" race.","Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on The Breakfast Club podcast with Charlamagne tha God to address key issues ahead of the 2024 election.

Trump vs Harris: Betting market tells different story from polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-harris-betting-market-tells-different-story-from-polls/articleshow/114266912.cms,"US former president Donald Trump and vice president Kamala Harris

The United States is gearing up for the upcoming presidential election where the contestants Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are in a nail-biting election race. According to a poll, the US presidential nominees are neck and neck. However, a popular new way of tracking and betting on the race tells a different story.According to the Polymarket , as of October 15, the US former president is ahead of the vice president with a 57.7% chance of victory.PredictIt, a popular betting platform, has seen a recent shift in sentiment, with traders now backing Trump over Harris by a margin of 54% to 49%. This marks the first time since late July that Harris' support on the platform has fallen below 50%.Lindsey Singer, a spokesperson for PredictIt, told FOX Business, ""With three weeks left in the campaign, and polling showing things remain essentially tied, I don't think these are the last flips we will see in the market.""RealClearPolitics, which tracks various prediction markets, reports that Trump is projected to win according to every platform they monitor. The aggregated betting odds data from RCP gives the former president a 54.1% chance of victory, while Harris trails at 44.9%. Other betting platforms, such as Betfair, Smarkets, Betsson, Bavada, Bwin, and Points Bet, all show Trump with odds ranging from 52% to 57%, while Harris' chances are estimated between 43% and 46%.Although recent polls suggest a closer race than the betting markets currently indicate, they also point to growing momentum behind Trump's campaign. The latest NBC News poll, conducted from October 4-8, found Trump and Harris in a dead heat, each garnering 48% support from voters in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup. This represents a significant shift from the outlet's September poll, which had Harris leading Trump by a margin of 49% to 44%, Fox Business reported.The advocates of prediction markets argue that they are better than the polls, as they can quickly adapt to the latest developments, such as debates and breaking news.""Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,"" Thomas Miller, a professor of data science at Northwestern University, told Fortune, as per the New York Times. Miller's website, which calculates the electoral college results based on PredictIt contract prices, currently predicts a decisive win for Trump.However, doubters question whether someone has been attempting to influence these markets. Miller, who had predicted a Harris victory just a month prior, stated on his website that he had ""identified no single event that explains"" the abrupt change in Trump's odds.Some observers have pointed to posts by Elon Musk on October 7 promoting Trump's lead in prediction markets, suggesting that he may have encouraged other Trump supporters to participate. Election Betting Odds, a market results aggregator, indicates that Trump's lead surged around that time.","PredictIt, a popular betting platform, has seen a recent shift in sentiment, with traders now backing Trump over Harris by a margin of 54% to 49%.

Emhoff recalled, ""I got a one-minute or less conversation that started with, 'Where the f, were you? I need you right now.'""Emhoff said that the incident occurred during a weekend in Los Angeles when he was attending a spin class.He explained that due to a software glitch that grounded planes, he was stuck in LA for an extra day. Without his phone, he was unaware of the unfolding political drama until a friend's partner showed him Biden’s announcement letter. “I had to run to the car, and there was my phone—seven or eight messages saying, ‘Call Kamala,’” Emhoff said on the LeBatardShow.Biden's decision to withdraw, announced in July, followed growing concerns among Democratic leaders regarding his mental fitness and electability against former President Donald Trump . In a letter to the nation, Biden stated, ""It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your President... I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down.""With less than 3 weeks to go recent polls show a tightening race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. A forecast by Nate Silver indicated a 50/50 split between the two candidates, highlighting a slight movement in Trump’s favour in key battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. ""There’s been about 1 point of movement toward Trump... that’s enough to take things from 55/45 Harris to a pure 50/50,"" Silver noted.An NBC poll from early October revealed both candidates tied at 48% among registered voters, a notable shift from Harris’s previous 5-point lead. This shift has intensified the campaign, with only weeks remaining until the election.

'Dying to see my Cholesterol': How Trump responded to Kamala's medical report charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dying-to-see-my-cholesterol-how-trump-responded-to-kamalas-medical-report-charge/articleshow/114267069.cms,"Kamala Harris speaks as an image of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump appears on screen during a campaign rally at Erie Insurance Arena, in Erie, Pa., Monday, October 14, 2024. (AP)

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump late on Tuesday claimed that Kamala Harris is ""dying"" to see his cholesterol levels, which he says are at 180, and boasted about his supposedly ""flawless"" medical records as the presidential candidates continue to argue about their health and ability to lead the nation with only a few weeks until Election Day .The 78-year-old former president, who is now the oldest presidential candidate in US history, went on a late-night Truth Social rant, criticizing his Democratic opponent's health as ""not good"" just days after Harris released a summary of her medical records and dared Trump to follow suit.In mid-August, Trump told CBS News he would ""very gladly"" release his medical records, The Independent reported, but nine weeks later, they remain undisclosed.Democrats and healthcare experts are now urging the Republican presidential candidate to be more open about his health as concerns grow about his mental sharpness to lead the country. ""As to her completely desperate request for my Medical Statements, she is dying to see my Cholesterol (which is 180!),"" Trump wrote on his social media platform at 1:42 am ET on Tuesday. ""I have already provided them, many times, including quite recently, and they were flawless.""The former president continued by asserting that he is in much better health than Harris and the previous four presidents, once again touting his own mental acuity. ""I've put out more Medical Exams than any other President in History, and aced two Cognitive Exams (the Doctor stated that my 'cognitive exams were exceptional!'). I am far healthier than Clinton, Bush, Obama, Biden, but especially, Kamala,"" he said in another post.Trump then turned his attention to the vice president's own medical records, criticizing her seasonal allergies and urticaria, which were mentioned in her medical report on Saturday. ""I have just seen Kamala's report, and it is not good,"" Trump said in his scathing remark.Trump's comments came after Kamala Harris questioned the former president's health and fitness on Tuesday, following his latest town-hall event that turned into an impromptu musical performance. ""Hope he's okay,"" the Democratic candidate posted on X.Harris's campaign, which has started to aggressively challenge Trump on his health and mental stability, said that he seemed ""lost, confused, and frozen on stage"" during the Monday event. Former president Trump defended the event in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, calling it ""so different.""""It was amazing! The Q and A was almost finished when people began fainting from the excitement and heat,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social network. ""We started playing music while we waited, and just kept it going. So different, but it ended up being a great evening!""For approximately 30 minutes, the event in Oaks near Philadelphia was typical fare leading up to the November 5 election, with Trump taking friendly questions from supporters about the economy and cost of living. However, it concluded with a strange 39 minutes of music and dancing, with Trump swaying awkwardly on stage following interruptions due to medical emergencies in the crowd.""Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?"" he said.Trump has made a brief, jerky dance his signature move at the end of rallies for years, almost always to his exit song – the Village People's 1978 disco anthem ""YMCA."" On Monday, however, he remained on stage for nine songs, ranging from opera to Guns N' Roses and Elvis, with the ex-president alternating between his dance moves and standing still, staring into the crowd.Trump is now the oldest person ever to be nominated for a presidential bid, after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race following a disastrous debate that raised concerns about his own age.","The former president went on a late-night Truth Social rant, criticizing his Democratic opponent's health as ""not good"" Trump is now the oldest person ever to be nominated for a presidential bid, after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race following a disastrous debate that raised concerns about his own age.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114267286,imgsize-1001951,width-400,resizemode-4/114267286.jpg"
Donald Trump's economic plans would worsen inflation: Economist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-economic-plans-would-worsen-inflation-economist/articleshow/114266914.cms,"Consumers bear the cost of tariffs

Reversing immigration gains could fuel inflation

Politicising the Federal reserve could stoke inflation

Most mainstream economists argue that instead of eliminating inflation , Trump's proposed policies would likely worsen it. They caution that his plans to impose large tariffs on imports, deport millions of migrant workers, and interfere with Federal Reserve interest rate decisions could drive prices higher.However, most mainstream economists argue that Trump's proposed policies wouldn't eliminate inflation but instead exacerbate it.They warn that his plans to impose large tariffs on imports, deport millions of migrant workers, and influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions would likely cause prices to soar.In June, sixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a letter expressing concern that Trump's policies would ""reignite"" inflation. Inflation has significantly dropped from its peak of 9.1% in 2022 and is nearing the Federal Reserve's target of 2%.Last month, the Peterson Institute for International Economics predicted that Trump's proposals would sharply increase consumer prices two years into a potential second term. Their analysis suggested that, instead of falling to 1.9% by 2026, inflation could rise to between 6% and 9.3% under his policies.While many economists are critical of Vice President Kamala Harris' economic plans, including her strategy to curb price gouging, they don't see them as significantly inflationary. Moody's Analytics estimates that Harris' policies would leave inflation largely unchanged. In contrast, an unchecked Trump presidency could raise inflation by 1.1 % points in 2025 and 0.8 % points in 2026.Tariffs, or taxes on imports, are Trump's preferred economic tool. He argues that they protect American jobs and offer other benefits. During his presidency, he launched a trade war with China, imposing high tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as steel, aluminum, washing machines, and solar panels. In a second term, Trump aims to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods and a ""universal"" tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports to the USWhile Trump claims foreign countries bear the cost of these tariffs, the reality is that US importers pay them and typically pass the cost to consumers, leading to higher prices for Americans.Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely from the Peterson Institute estimate that Trump's proposed tariffs would result in an annual after-tax loss of $2,600 for the average American household.Though Trump's campaign highlights that inflation remained low during his presidency despite aggressive tariffs, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, points out that the scale of Trump's current tariff proposals is far larger, impacting over $3 trillion in imports, compared to $300 billion in his first term.Trump has promised to launch the largest deportation operation in US history. Many economists argue that recent immigration increases have helped contain inflation and avoid a recession.An influx of foreign-born workers has eased labor shortages, reducing the pressure on employers to raise wages, which helps curb inflation. In 2023, net immigration surged to 3.3 million, more than three times what was anticipated. Immigrants filled gaps in the workforce, especially as the economy rebounded after pandemic lockdowns.Research from Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson at the Brookings Institution suggests that immigration allowed the US to create jobs without overheating the economy. Without immigrants, the inflationary pressure from labor shortages would have been much worse.If Trump’s mass deportations succeed, the Peterson Institute calculates that US inflation could be 3.5 % points higher by 2026.Trump raised concerns among economists in August when he said he would seek a role in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions. The Fed plays a key role in fighting inflation by raising rates to cool down the economy. Economic research shows that central banks can best manage inflation when independent from political influence, as raising rates can cause economic pain, including potential recessions.As president, Trump frequently pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower rates to boost the economy. This was seen by many as unprecedented political interference in the Fed, exceeding even the actions of Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, whose influence on the Fed is blamed for the inflation crises of the 1960s and '70s.The Peterson Institute found that compromising the Fed's independence could raise inflation by 2 % points annually.","In June, 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a letter expressing concern that Trump's policies would ""reignite"" inflation.

Prosecutors will not file criminal charges against 2 people at center of Los Angeles racism scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prosecutors-will-not-file-criminal-charges-against-2-people-at-center-of-los-angeles-racism-scandal/articleshow/114266722.cms,"A few people use Grand Park at the foot of Los Angeles City Hall, Tuesday, March 31, 2020, in Los Angeles. (AP)

LOS ANGELES: The Los Angeles city attorney's office said Tuesday that it does not plan to file criminal charges against two people who were investigated in connection with the unlawful recording of a racist conversation that rocked City Hall and prompted the city council president to resign after the audio was leaked in 2022.The local prosecutors declined to file misdemeanors against the two people, a married couple, just months after the district attorney's office announced that it would not pursue any felony charges against them.The Associated Press is not naming the two people because they were not charged. Both previously worked at the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and lived at a home that investigators traced to social media posts highlighting the controversial recording.Prosecutors could not meet the burden of proof for a case, even though the district attorney's office, in a charge-evaluation worksheet, said ""the evidence indicates that a crime was committed by one or both of these individuals.""Under California law, all parties must consent to the recording of a private conversation or phone call, otherwise the person who made the recording could face criminal and civil penalties. The state's wiretapping statutes are among the strongest in the nation and allow the ""injured party"" - the person being recorded without their permission - to sue.""After careful review, it was determined that there was insufficient evidence to meet the constitutional standard of proof,"" city attorney spokesperson Ivor Pine wrote in an email to the AP on Tuesday. ""Because of this, our office will not be filing criminal charges.""The scandal was triggered by a leaked recording of crude, racist comments during a private meeting in 2021 in which four Latino Democrats plotted to expand their political power at the expense of Black voters during a realignment of council district boundaries. The recording was leaked the following year.Council President Nury Martinez and powerful labor leader Ron Hererra resigned in disgrace. Councilman Gil Cedillo's term ended weeks later, but Councilman Kevin de Leon resisted calls for his ouster - including from the White House - and he ran for reelection. He faces a runoff in November.The meeting occurred at the headquarters of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, known locally as the ""LA Fed."" The couple both worked at the LA Fed at the time.The couple's identities have been made public in court filings and media accounts. Their attorneys did not immediately respond to the AP's requests for comment late Tuesday.No other potential suspects or persons of interest in the recording have been named by investigators or prosecutors.Pine, in the city attorney's office, and a spokesperson for the district attorney did not immediately return requests for comment late Tuesday to say whether anyone else had come under investigation in connection with the case.Investigators said the recording was anonymously posted on Reddit in 2022 and that a Twitter account amplified the post. Both accounts were associated with an email account that was traced to an IP address - a numeric designation that identifies its location on the internet - and linked to the couple's home.Detectives recommended charging the couple with felony eavesdropping and illegal audio recording or wiretapping charges in relation to the recording of that 2021 conversation as well as another of a 2022 phone call between Herrera and a federation spokesperson, according to a charge-evaluation worksheet released by the district attorney's office.The district attorney declined to file felony charges earlier this year and referred the case to the city attorney's office for possible misdemeanors.Cedillo and de Leon have separate pending lawsuits against the couple.The district attorney's charge-evaluation worksheet notes that both people had ""similar motives to carry out the offense,"" but it does not detail the alleged motives. Prosecutors wrote that the evidence indicates either person, or both, made the recording.""However, it is unclear how the unlawful recordings took place, the device used to do so, or who uploaded the recordings online and created the anonymous accounts on Reddit, Twitter, and Gmail,"" the worksheet states.","The local prosecutors declined to file misdemeanors against the two people, a married couple, just months after the district attorney's office announced that it would not pursue any felony charges against them.

""I was always very good at Mathematics,"" Trump said as he added that he's all about growth and will bring companies to the country. He also said that tariff is his favorite word in the dictionary.“How does it help you take on China turning all of your allies against you?” Micklethwait asked.“Tremendously, because China thinks we’re a stupid country,” Trump said. “They can’t believe somebody finally got wise to them.”Ahead of the interview, Bloomberg's editor-in-chief said they reached out to Kamala Harris for an interview about her economic policies but she declined so far.","John Micklethwait pressed Trump at the Economic Club of Chicago over his plans to impose a universal tariff on imports and his threats to use tariffs on American companies that outsource their manufacturing.

Officials said the Karachi blast is likely to figure in talks between Li and his Pakistani counterpart.“We will review progress on existing initiatives, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), and also explore new avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation.

At least 28 students, including girls, from various campuses of a well-known private college in Lahore, were injured during clashes with the police as they protested against the alleged on-campus rape of a female student, police said on Monday. The protests erupted Monday morning across at least four boys' and girls' campuses of the Punjab Group of Colleges , owned by the Dunya media group , following reports that a female student at the Gulberg girls' campus in Lahore was raped allegedly by a security guard in the institution's basement.As news of the alleged rape spread on social media, students from various campuses began protesting, accusing the college administration of negligence in the matter.A large number of students, including girls, set fire to college furniture and chanted slogans against the administration. As the protests escalated, with students blocking roads, the police resorted to baton charges to disperse the demonstrators.""During the clash, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured. One student's condition is critical,"" a Rescue 1122 official said, adding that the injured students are receiving treatment at Services Hospital.Sharaz Abbas, a student at Punjab College, told PTI that they were protesting to demand justice for the victim.""The Punjab police brutally assaulted us both inside and outside the campus.

"Pakistan to repay over $30 billion debt in FY25, says central bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-repay-over-30-billion-debt-in-fy25-says-central-bank/articleshow/114208042.cms,"Representative Image

Cash-strapped Pakistan 's central bank has revealed the country is scheduled to repay a total of USD 30.35 billion in maturing foreign debt and interest payments in 12 months (August 2024 to July 2025) including those significant loans which bilateral creditors roll over every year.The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, cited by a JS Global report, showed that the payments from August 2024 to July 2025 include significant loans that bilateral creditors roll over annually.The Express Tribune reported that Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.Under the latest USD 7 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Pakistan's repayments and interest payments are fully secured for the 37-month loan period. Despite the rising repayments and interest payments, the foreign debt-to-GDP ratio has decreased from 27.6 per cent in August of the previous year to 20.2 per cent in August 2024, due to the expansion of Pakistan's economy in FY24 compared to the contraction in FY23.The data highlights the increasing foreign debt repayments and interest payments each year, emphasizing the need for economic managers, planners, and parliamentarians to explore ways to boost foreign income and reduce external expenditures. Compared to the USD 21.2 billion (including rollovers) paid by Pakistan over the past 12 months (August 2023 to July 2024), the current 12-month period's repayment and interest payment sum of USD 30 billion is significantly higher, according to JS Global.The increase in repayments and interest payments for the ongoing 12 months can be attributed to fresh loans provided by Saudi Arabia, UAE, and IMF in late June and July 2023, amounting to around USD 4 billion, as well as an additional USD 2 billion lent by IMF between August 2023 and April 2024. These loans have increased the repayment pressure (including significant rollover) in the coming years.Topline Research, citing the latest IMF documents, reported that Pakistan's gross external financing requirement has dropped to a 9-year low of USD 18.8 billion (excluding expected rollovers and contained current account deficit) for the ongoing fiscal year (July 2024 to June 2025). However, another researcher mentioned that Pakistan is also expected to add fresh foreign loans amounting to USD 3 billion to USD 4 billion in the current fiscal year (FY25).A third researcher emphasized the need for Pakistan to reduce its external expenditures through import substitution. Implementing such measures would help improve the country's ability to make external payments and increase foreign exchange reserves, as reported by The Express Tribune.","Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.

"IMF asks Pakistan to end preferential treatment to agriculture, textile sectors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-asks-pakistan-to-end-preferential-treatment-to-agriculture-textile-sectors/articleshow/114205816.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund has asked Pakistan to swiftly end preferential treatment, tax exemptions and other protections for the agriculture and textile sectors, which it says, have stifled the country's growth potential for decades, a media report said here on Monday. The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ), in its staff report on the diagnosis of the factors behind Pakistan's struggling economy, blamed these two sectors not only for failing to contribute adequately to the national revenue but also for consuming large portions of public funds while remaining inefficient and uncompetitive, The Dawn newspaper said.As part of the recently approved USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the IMF stressed that Pakistan must break from its economic practices of the past 75 years to escape its recurrent boom-bust cycles.The IMF report released on October 10 highlighted the country's significant lag behind similar nations, a stagnation that has compromised living standards and pushed over 40.5 per cent of the population below the poverty line.It said Pakistan had struggled to develop more sophisticated export goods, and the share of knowledge-intensive exports remains low as it failed to innovate. As of 2022, Pakistan ranked 85th in the Economic Complexity Index, the same rank it held in 2000.""With an export basket strongly biased towards agriculture and textiles (cotton yarn, rice, woven fabrics, beef, and leather apparel), the country has struggled to reallocate resources towards more technologically complex products,"" it said.The current focus on agriculture has limited Pakistan's ability to diversify into more technologically complex goods. While Pakistan does export some high-value products, such as medicines, medical instruments and plastic products, these sectors operate in a heavily distorted economic environment, it said.The report highlighted tariffs on intermediate and final goods as barriers to competitiveness and domestic market growth, inhibiting the country's transition towards more advanced manufacturing.""Reallocation, however, is held back by existing microeconomic distortions, including public procurement of agricultural goods, price controls on raw inputs, and fiscal and financial incentives for low productivity sectors,"" it observed.The report identified the textile sector as having the highest tax gap relative to its value added, noting that between 2007 and 2022, the sector benefited from subsidies, favourable pricing on inputs, concessional financing schemes and preferential tax treatment.Earlier, the IMF on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to certain conditions. This USD 1 billion tranche came under an agreement to receive USD 7 billion over 39 months.The latest IMF report pointed out that as of May 2024, 70 per cent of the outstanding concessional central bank loans were tied to the textile sector.The IMF recommended that the government focus on simplifying trade policies under the upcoming National Tariff Policy (2025-29) and urged Pakistan to avoid using tariffs to promote industrialisation or protect inefficient sectors, arguing that such policies weaken exports, hinder participation in global value chains, and incentivise rent-seeking.The report also warned that ""trade policies aimed at promoting specific domestic sectors, including export subsidies and local content requirements, should be discontinued as they are likely to promote resource misallocation and may violate international obligations"".Compared to other regional peers, Pakistan's export growth has been weak, with sales to the world particularly stagnant during the 2010s.It said several complex goods were within likely technological proximity to Pakistan's current export basket, including glassware, paints, chemicals, fabrics for industrial use, paper, cosmetics and rubber products.However, to facilitate the development of such new industries, the country needed a level playing field for business, avoiding targeted policies aimed at picking winners.This includes greater integration into global trade and easier access to imports, both as intermediate inputs for production and as final goods to promote domestic competition, the IMF said, adding, the removal of fiscal incentives would reduce the existing misallocation of resources and promote price discovery across firms.","The International Monetary Fund has asked Pakistan to end preferential treatment, tax exemptions and other protections for the agriculture and textile sectors. The IMF stressed that Pakistan must break from its economic practices of the past 75 years to escape its recurrent boom-bust cycles.

NEW DELHI: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting, well in time for a welcome dinner that will be hosted by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif for the delegates.While both sides have ruled out any formal bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the SCO event, the minister as of now is expected to participate in the dinner and exchange pleasantries with host Shehbaz and counterpart Ishaq Dar, before the main summit on Wednesday.Even though it won’t be a fleeting visit as was previously thought, Jaishankar will likely spend not more than 24 hours in Pakistan before flying back to India.The minister will be in Pakistan on October 15-16 for what will be the first visit by any Indian foreign minister to the country in nearly a decade. However, a day after India confirmed his visit to Pakistan, Jaishankar said he wasn’t going to Islamabad to discuss India’s ties with Pakistan but to be a ``good member’’ of the SCO, which counts India and Pakistan apart from Russia, China, Iran and 4 Central Asian countries as member-states.India hasn’t allowed its differences with Pakistan on the issue of cross-border terrorism , or even the border tensions with China, to come in the way of its participation in the Eurasian bloc that is seen as playing an important role in ensuring regional security. Russia’s presence in the group has also been a motivating factor for India.While a structured bilateral meeting is ruled out, a quick pull aside, possibly behind the scenes, on the margins could still take place but India will expect Islamabad to propose any such meeting. India has continued to maintain that the onus for any forward movement in the relationship, which has not seen any substantive engagement between the 2 countries for the past 9 years, is on Pakistan. For any rapprochement, India sees as essential verifiable and irreversible action by Pakistan against terrorism, and also a review of its decision to downgrade ties after the Indian government revoked the special status of J&K.Pakistan, however, has remained focused on the issue of Kashmir with Dar saying Sunday Islamabad under Shehbaz hasn’t lost an opportunity to raise it along with the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza.Chinese Premier Li Qiang will also be present at the event but there’s no confirmation yet of any bilateral meeting between him and Jaishankar.In his SCO address, Jaishankar is expected to underscore India’s concerns about terrorism, the need to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity while undertaking connectivity and infrastructure initiatives and also to take up concerns of the Global South. The SCO Charter doesn’t allow any member-state to raise bilateral issues and it’s unlikely he will name Pakistan. The minister will represent PM Narendra Modi who had been invited by Shehbaz to participate in the meeting. However, Modi only participates in the heads of state summit and normally deputes the foreign minister to stand in for him at the heads of government meetings.",India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: At least 11 people have been killed and eight more have sustained injuries in a clash between two tribes in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday, Al Jazeera reported.Tensions rose in the Kurram district of the province after two people were critically injured in a shooting incident between rival tribes in the northwestern part of the country.However, the reason for the clashes is not known.As the violence spread, vehicles were targeted in different areas of the district which led to many more casualties, as noted by senior official Javedullah Khan.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is known to be home to over 40 million people who come from various tribal groups and identities.Khan said the injured were taken to a hospital, and efforts were being made to secure travel routes and restore normalcy. The injured were taken to a hospital.Pir Haider Ali Shah, a former parliamentarian and member of a tribal council, said elders had arrived in Kurram to mediate a peace agreement between the tribes.""The recent firing incidents are regrettable and have hampered efforts for lasting peace,"" he said.Notably, tribal group meetings also known as 'Jirgas' are routinely held to ensure peace and stability in the region, as reported by Al Jazeera.In another incident last month, at least 25 people were killed in days of clashes between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both communities live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, according to Al Jazeera.Clashes in the area have seen an uptick as last month alone over 20 people were killed between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, Al Jazeera noted.Meanwhile, on Saturday, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for attacks at a coal mine in Balochistan which saw the death of over 20 individuals including Pakistani as well as Afghan nationals. The attack had involved the use of heavy weapons, rocket launchers and grenades.Such attacks have become common in Balochistan, the southern part of the country known to be home to key natural resources but whose benefits do not translate to uplifting the citizens' quality of life there.The outfits operating from Balochistan accuse the central government in Islamabad of exploiting the province's rich oil and mineral resources to the detriment of the local population in the country's largest and least-populated province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.These groups have also expressed their anger against foreign nationals coming in for resource extraction but deriving profits without benefiting the locals. Attacks on international convoys have thus become a key way for citizens to register protests.BLA gave a higher casualty figure of 30 dead and 18 injured in the incident. It also said that Pakistani security personnel were disguised as workers, without giving evidence.It threatened more assaults unless the military withdrew from the province.Balochistan has been a hotbed of armed movements, with the BLA most prominent among them.Last week, the BLA - designated a ""terrorist group"" by Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States - claimed responsibility for an attack targeting Chinese nationals near Pakistan's largest airport, Al Jazeera reported.The Chinese embassy in Pakistan said at least two of its citizens were killed and a third injured after their convoy was targeted with an improvised explosive device believed to have been detonated by a suicide bomber.At least 10 people were injured in total, with four cars destroyed in the explosion and 10 more vehicles damaged in the resulting fire, local media reported.",Tensions rose in the Kurram district of the province after two people were critically injured in a shooting incident.

Over 100 children die in Pakistan from diphtheria amid shortage of life-saving Antitoxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/over-100-children-die-in-pakistan-from-diphtheria-amid-shortage-of-life-saving-antitoxin/articleshow/114185488.cms,"Pakistan: Over 100 children die due to Diphtheria in Karachi amid lack of facilities

More than 100 children have died in Karachi , Pakistan , this year due to diphtheria, a preventable disease, largely because of the unavailability of Diphtheria Anti-Toxin (DAT), according to a report by Geo News. Despite the availability of vaccines, the shortage of the crucial antitoxin has led to these tragic deaths.Sindh health officials confirmed that 140 cases of diphtheria were recorded last year at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital, with 52 fatalities.Experts say that the lifesaving antitoxin needed to treat the disease is unavailable across Sindh, including Karachi, with treatment costs estimated at 250,000 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) per child.Diphtheria, caused by a bacterium that affects the respiratory tract and skin, produces a toxin that can damage the heart and nerves, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease is vaccine-preventable, but requires multiple doses and boosters to maintain immunity. Those who are unvaccinated or under-immunized are at the highest risk.Health experts in Pakistan have raised concerns about the lack of vaccine coverage and the dire need for intervention. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Director of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI), Muhammad Arif Khan, stressed the importance of timely vaccination to prevent diphtheria outbreaks, emphasizing that the disease can cause severe complications, including difficulty breathing and swallowing.WHO data shows that symptoms of diphtheria, such as sore throat, fever, and swollen neck glands, typically appear 2-5 days after exposure. Without proper treatment, the disease can be fatal in 30% of cases, with young children especially at risk.Global immunization rates have been disrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, further exacerbating the issue. In Pakistan, immunization coverage remains uneven, with some areas like Balochistan reporting rates as low as 38%, well below global standards. The World Bank notes that Pakistan’s immunization coverage ranks among the lowest compared to similarly wealthy countries in Eastern and Southern Asia.Efforts to improve vaccination rates and provide adequate medical resources remain critical to preventing more deaths from this preventable disease.","Sindh health officials confirmed that 140 cases of diphtheria were recorded last year at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital, with 52 fatalities.

Pakistan is gearing up to secure its capital, Islamabad, ahead of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The event, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, will see the attendance of key regional leaders, including India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and China's Premier Li Qiang.In preparation for the summit, Pakistan's government has implemented strict measures.These include strict enforcement against movements protesting ethnic nationalism and new laws that limit demonstrations in the capital. Authorities have also detained hundreds of supporters of opposition leader Imran Khan , who is currently jailed, following their attempt to march in Islamabad.Security concerns have been heightened by a recent attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers in Karachi, raising fears for the safety of foreign nationals amid ongoing separatist violence. The government has responded by authorizing troop deployments in the capital throughout the summit's duration.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst, emphasized the importance of the summit for Pakistan, stating, ""The government claims to have made elaborate security arrangements and understandably so because it has to make sure that the event passes off peacefully without any untoward incident.""The SCO, which includes China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and six other member states, is viewed by some as an alternative to Western alliances such as NATO. The agenda for the Islamabad summit focuses on trade, humanitarian, and cultural issues, though domestic issues in Pakistan may loom large.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, has threatened protests during the summit. Ahsan Iqbal Chaudhary, Pakistan's minister for planning, accused the PTI of trying to disrupt the event, stating, ""The PTI doesn't want to showcase the positive side of Pakistan to the world. Instead, they aim to present a picture of the country filled with tear gas and unrest.""To facilitate the summit, Islamabad and the neighboring city of Rawalpindi will observe a public holiday starting Monday, accompanied by road closures to reduce movement. The government quarter hosting the summit has been fortified and prepared for the visiting dignitaries.Pakistan, heavily reliant on Chinese investment for infrastructure projects, is keen to ensure the safety of its citizens and foreign guests, especially considering the broader uptick in militancy linked to the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan.The authorities aim for a peaceful summit to enhance the country's image amidst various internal and external challenges.","Pakistan is hosting a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.
