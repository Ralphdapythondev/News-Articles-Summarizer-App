Walz has often spoken affectionately about China’s people. “If they had the proper leadership, there are no limits on what they could accomplish,” he told a newspaper after returning from China in 1990. “They are such kind, generous, capable people.” Walz got married on the fifth anniversary of the deadly 1989 Tiananmen Square military crackdown, with his wife telling a local newspaper “he wanted to have adate he’ll always remember.”With Walz appearing prominently on the national political scene for the first time on Tuesday, many on social media began poring over a long record of comments on China, some of them decades old. “I don’t fall into the category that China necessarily needs to be an adver sarial relationship,” Walz said in a video interview posted in 2016. His positions appear largely in sync with the Biden administration , which aims to compete with Beijing in military and economic spheres, and cooperate where possible on climate or narcotics trafficking.Walz’s stance toward China —and his past meeting with the Dalai Lama — may open him to criticism from Beijing.

'Mindless killing changed everything': How Bangladesh's quota protests ended Sheikh Hasina's 15-year reign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/mindless-killing-changed-everything-how-bangladeshs-quota-protests-ended-sheikh-hasinas-15-year-reign/articleshow/112295042.cms,"Driving the news

In a broadcast to the nation on state television, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, the army chief of Bangladesh, announced that Hasina had resigned and that the military would form a caretaker government .

. Dressed in military fatigues, Waker said, ""The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence.""

This announcement came shortly after jubilant crowds stormed and looted Hasina's residence.

In Dhaka, demonstrators scaled a monument dedicated to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the current Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, and the founding father of Bangladesh. Once atop the statue, the protesters proceeded to use an axe to forcefully remove and damage the sculpted head of the revered figure.

External affairs minister S Jaishankar met PM Narendra Modi and briefed him developments in Bangladesh.

Meanwhile, Hasina reached India aboard a Bangladesh Air Force C-130J military transport aircraft, PTI reported quoting sources.

It remains uncertain whether the military transport plane will carry her onward from India or if she will switch to another aircraft for her journey to London, the PTI report said.

Why it matters

With over 32 million young people out of work or education in Bangladesh, the protests have tapped into widespread frustration over limited opportunities and economic challenges.

The absence of Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh's political landscape may exacerbate the country's already precarious situation.

Bangladesh, one of the world's most densely populated countries, faces high levels of unemployment, pervasive corruption, and the dire consequences of climate change. These crises have already placed a significant strain on the nation, and the departure of its leader could further compound these issues.

Zoom in

The unrest began in July 2024 when students initiated demonstrations demanding the abolition of a government job quota system that allocated a significant percentage of positions to the descendants of war veterans from the 1971 independence conflict.

The protests intensified after the high court reinstated a 30% job quota for the families of freedom fighters, sparking widespread outrage among students and young professionals who argue that the quotas perpetuate inequality and hinder merit-based hiring.

The government's attempt to reduce the quota to 5% failed to quell the unrest, with demonstrators demanding the complete abolition of the quota system.

The situation escalated dramatically on August 4, 2024 as violent confrontations erupted between protesters and supporters of the ruling Awami League , Chhatra League, and Jubo League activists.

, Chhatra League, and Jubo League activists. The protesters were mainly organized by the Students Against Discrimination, with the sole demand of Hasina's resignation over the job quota system.

So far, over 300 have died in these protests since July.

'Mindless killing changed everything'

What they are saying

""The country is going through a revolutionary period. ""I promise you all, we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility and I assure you to not get disheartened,"" the Bangladesh army chief said.

""I request you all to be a little patient, give us some time and together we will be able to solve all the problems,"" Zaman added. ""Please don't go back to the path of violence and please return to non-violent and peaceful ways.""

""15 consecutive years of power have been shattered by a people’s revolution. In the end, the Iron Lady had feet of clay,"" said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center.

""Bangladesh has achieved its second independence now,"" Abu Sayem told Reuters in Whitechapel, a London neighbourhood home to a large Bangladeshi community . ""We actually got our independence first in 1971 but autocrat Sheikh Hasina was ruling the country forcibly. She has snatched away our rights. She has killed thousands of children.""

What it means for India

Under Hasina, Bangladesh has emerged as one of the most trusted allies of India in South Asia.

Harsh Vardhan Shringla, the former foreign secretary of India, expressed concerns that an unstable Bangladesh could contribute to instability in certain regions of India.

""An unstable Bangladesh can add to instability in parts of our country, which we do not want to see. So, a peaceful, prosperous, stable Bangladesh is India's best. It is very important that we work with all concerned to ensure that our interests and those of Bangladesh are secured,"" Shringla told ANI.

Shringla expressed confidence that Indian representatives would engage with the relevant individuals in Bangladesh to protect India's broader interests and constructively promote peace and stability in the region.

""We have strong ties across the board in a multifaceted manner in Bangladeshi society. And, we will engage any political or any other organization that we need to in the furtherance of our larger interests and those of Bangladesh,"" he said.

What's next

The Hasina chapter seems to be over for Bangladesh. Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Hasina's son, told BBC that there would be no political come back for her. She was ""so disappointed that after all her hard work, for a minority to rise up against her,"" Joy said.

Hasina's departure ""would leave a major vacuum"" and that the country was in ""uncharted territory"". ""The coming days are critical, as it moves toward what will hopefully be a peaceful transition,"" Kugelman said.

""The key now is to move the process along, to create the interim set-up, to ease uncertainty and reduce the risk of more volatility.""

Now, all eyes will now be on the army chief.

Bangladesh was thrown into turmoil on Monday as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down from her position and left the nation. Her resignation followed a brutal suppression of protests that had escalated from demonstrations against employment quotas into a full-scale movement calling for her removal from power. The crackdown resulted in the deaths of hundreds of individuals.The violent crackdown on protesters, which resulted in hundreds of deaths, fueled anger and resentment.""The killings definitely stand as the most brutal retaliation by a government on any civic movement in the post-liberation Bangladesh history—and may be that of the subcontinent. We shudder at the thought of how a civilian government could allow its law enforcers to attack its own people with such brutality. The killing was not just an event, but one that took place over several days. Wasn't there any reflection, any afterthought and reassessment at the end of the first, second or third day that such heartless and continuous killing of one's own people must stop,"" said Mahfuz Anam in column ""Mindless killing changed everything"" published in Daily Star.(With inputs from agencies)","Bangladesh's army chief announced that Hasina had resigned and that the military would form a caretaker government.

Yahya Sinwar named Hamas leader: What does his appointment means for Gaza-Israel tensions?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/yahya-sinwar-named-hamas-leader-what-does-his-appointment-mean-for-gaza-israel-tensions/articleshow/112332579.cms,"Who is Yahya Sinwar

Rise within Hamas

Imprisonment and education

After release

Hamas announced Yahya Sinwar as its new political leader on Tuesday, following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran .In a statement, the group said, ""The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas announces the selection of Yahya Sinwar as the head of the political bureau of the movement,"" reported AFP.Notably, Israeli military officials accuse Sinwar of being one of the masterminds behind the October 7 attack on Israel, making him one of Israel's most wanted militants.Minutes after the announcement, Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, reported firing a barrage of rockets from the Gaza Strip toward Israel.Born in Gaza in 1962 during the tumultuous period surrounding the creation of the state of Israel, Sinwar’s experiences influenced his decision to join Hamas in the 1980s.Recruited by Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Sinwar became the head of an internal security unit known as Al Majd. His role involved punishing those suspected of violating Islamic laws or collaborating with Israel, which eventually led to his arrest by Israeli authorities, according to the New York Times.Imprisoned in 1988 for the murder of four Palestinians accused of apostasy or collaboration with Israel, Sinwar spent over two decades in an Israeli prison. During this time, he learned Hebrew, studied Israeli culture, and translated extensive Hebrew-language materials about Israeli security practices into Arabic.Israeli dentist Yuval Bitton, who treated Sinwar in prison, noted that Sinwar used his translated materials to educate fellow inmates about counterterrorism tactics. Sinwar, who described himself as a ""specialist in the Jewish people's history,"" focused his conversations on Hamas rather than personal matters.While imprisoned, Sinwar wrote a novel titled ""The Thorn and the Carnation,"" a coming-of-age story reflecting his own experiences. The novel depicts the life of a Gaza boy under Israeli occupation and the resistance's demands for sacrifice.Sinwar told an Italian journalist that prison is a crucible. ""Prison builds you,"" he said, adding that it gave him time to reflect on his beliefs and the price he would be willing to pay for them.Released in 2011 as part of a prisoner swap, the new Hamas political leader remarked that capturing Israeli soldiers was the most effective strategy for securing the release of Palestinians held by Israel. ""For the prisoner, capturing an Israeli soldier is the best news in the universe, because he knows that a glimmer of hope has been opened for him,"" Sinwar said at the time.Post-release, Sinwar married and started a family, though he has remained private about his personal life. He once mentioned that his son's first words included ""drone,"" highlighting his ongoing focus on conflict.Sinwar’s hard-line position suggests he is unlikely to support a cease-fire with Israel that would end the fighting in Gaza and resolve the situation of around 115 hostages still held by Hamas. According to Israeli and US intelligence sources, Sinwar aims to prolong the conflict to undermine Israel's international standing and its relationship with the United States.","Hamas announced Yahya Sinwar as its new political leader on Tuesday.

His initial reaction was confusion, as there was no apparent panic among the passengers.In a subsequent interview with the People, Judelson described the scene, noting that the woman’s rush seemed overly dramatic for the situation. He and another passenger wondered why she was so frantic, since everyone would be deplaning together.Judelson recounted, “I look around, no one’s on the ground, no one’s freaking out.

Judelson’s confusion deepened as he questioned whether they were stuck in Phoenix indefinitely.American Airlines confirmed that the flight was diverted because of a medical emergency. However, the details were initially unclear until Judelson heard through word of mouth that the actual reason was a lice outbreak.

'Rocket man'

Former US President Donald Trump on Wednesday minced no words to stoke a conspiracy theory about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's family roots. The republican nominee in an interview to a social media personality insinuated that the Canadian leader ""could be the son"" of the late communist leader Fidel Castro .After being shown the photo of the Canadian prime minister, the 45th president said, ""Trudeau turned very liberal actually.They say he’s the son of Fidel Castro and, uh, could be. I mean anything’s possible in this world, you know,” he said.Trump added that he ""got along very well"" with Trudeau, but suggested that he didn't approve of his policies.""He seems to be going very progressive and the people of Canada are not liking it,"" he said.Trump, who has taken a convenient liking to conservative leaders around the world, said that a conservative candidate in Canada could win the next election, referring to Pierre Poilievre leading Trudeau in recent opinion polls. ""If they had a good conservative person — maybe they do, maybe they don't. I don't know. But somebody that's a strong conservative would win in Canada,"" Trump said.The conspiracy had previously been shared widely on social media after Castro's death in 2016 and Trudeau calling him a “legendary revolutionary and orator”. Trudeau was born on Dec. 25, 1971, to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his wife Margaret more than four years before Margaret reportedly made a much spoken about trip to Cuba and met Castro.The Feb. 1 suicide of Castro’s oldest son in 2018 also added fuel to the fire with several reports claiming that Fidelito left a suicide note referring to Justin Trudeau as his half-brother. However, Trudeau at the time outright denied the claims and said his parents never visited Cuba until several years after he was born.In the interview with Adin Ross, Trump also went about his relationships with other world leaders and public figures, including a number of Democrats, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who he called a “genius” and “a very good person,” and Chinese president Xi Jin Ping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who he said has a “good relationship with him.""Donald Trump, who claimed he received a beautiful note from the Chinese leader Xi Jinping after he survived an assassination attempt by a whisker, reiterated that he gets along with him very well.“I will have a very good relationship with him. There’s no, there’s no going to war with him. He doesn’t want to go to war. We’re not going to war…. He loves his country and he’s very strong and powerful.”Trump also claimed that unlike the Biden administration, he shared a ""relationship like nobody else."" However, he also added that he exposed China during the Covid and vowed to not let China let take advantage, which he said is in the best interests of America.Referring to the Chinese president's visit during his tenure, Trump belittled the Biden administration for not working enough with China and against, when the situation demanded.Trump, often not backing off from showing his strange affection for the North Korean leader yet again in the interview with the controversial internet personality said, Kim Jong Un is ""very smart"" and ""a real power."" The 45th president said he played Elton John’s hit song “Rocket Man” for the dictator when they met in Singapore in 2018, after he had nicknamed Kim “Little Rocket Man” over his nuclear claims.Trump said his administration checked ""closely"" and determined that Kim had ""tremendous nuclear capability.""Trump, who to much attention of the world community paid visit to North Korea during his tenure said, ""I got to know him very well, and I got along with him great,"" he explained. ""He's very strong. He's the absolute leader. You know, a lot of people say, oh, maybe he's not the leader. He's the absolute. When he's around, his people are standing up at attention.""Trump also said the North Korean dictator had an opinion about vice president Kamala Harris. ""He doesn't know her, but he forms opinions, and he doesn't like her,"" he asserted. ""And he thought that Biden was a stupid man, a very stupid man.""""But I say the same thing. So at least we agree on something.""","Former US President Donald Trump stoke a conspiracy theory about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's family roots.

Earthquake Bakersfield: What's behind strongest tremors felt in Southern California in years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whats-behind-strongest-tremors-felt-in-southern-california-in-years/articleshow/112360434.cms,"A magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck Southern California on Tuesday (PST) night, with its epicentre located about 18 miles southwest of Bakersfield.The US Geological Survey reported that the quake occurred at 9:09 pm (PST), with its epicentre near Mettler, an unincorporated area in Kern County, approximately 85 miles from downtown Los Angeles .The tremor was widely felt across the region, including in Los Angeles, though there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, as reposted by Los Angeles Times.The initial shock was followed by a series of aftershocks , including a stronger 4.5 magnitude quake that struck less than a minute later, and another at 4.1 magnitude temblor at 9:17 pm (PST).Residents in the Los Angeles Basin, inland valleys, and even as far as Santa Maria, Bakersfield, and Fresno felt the quake.Allen Husker, a geophysics professor and the head of the Southern California Seismic Network at Caltech, explained why so many people felt the quake, especially in the Los Angeles area. Since the earthquake hit at night, when most people were at home and likely resting, they were more sensitive to the shaking than they might have been during the day when they’re busier and more active.Husker also highlighted the influence of the "" basin effect "" in the Los Angeles region. The city sits atop the Los Angeles Basin, a six-mile-deep, bathtub-shaped area filled with soft sand and gravel. This geological feature, stretching from Beverly Hills to northern Orange County, acts like a giant amplifier for seismic waves.“The basin effect ... increases the shaking that you would otherwise normally have,” Husker said.This earthquake was the strongest to hit Southern California in three years. The last time the region experienced a quake of similar magnitude was in June 2021, with a 5.3 magnitude tremor near the Salton Sea. A year earlier, in June 2020, a 5.5 magnitude quake hit the Mojave Desert.Interestingly, Tuesday’s earthquake occurred just 12 miles northwest of the epicentre of the massive 7.5 magnitude Kern County earthquake that struck in 1952. The 1952 earthquake, which occurred due to the White Wolf fault , was felt as far away as San Francisco and Las Vegas, according to the USGS.However, Tuesday's earthquake was not associated with any previously identified faults in the region.","A magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck Southern California on Tuesday (PST) night, with its epicentre located about 18 miles southwest of Bakersfield.

'Cockroaches of the factory': Boeing 737 workers describes chaos and pressure at work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cockroaches-of-the-factory-boeing-737-staff-describes-chaos-and-pressure-at-work/articleshow/112355971.cms,"'Replacing doors like replacing underwear'

'Cockroaches of the factory'

'Injuries we don’t talk about'

'Bolts and paperwork missing'

'Boeing faces

criminal charges

'

Boeing 737 Max employees that experienced a door plug detachment during a flight in January said that they felt pressure to complete their tasks too fast to avoid mistakes, during a two-day investigative hearing conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday.The hearing deals into the blowout incident on January 5, where a door plug blew out mid-flight as it approached 16,000 feet, the unexpected failure resulted in a large opening on the fuselage, exposing the interior to the outside environment, leading to sudden decompression, oxygen masks deployed from the overhead compartments, catching passengers off guard.The force of the airflow was so intense that it tore off passengers' clothing and violently pulled phones from their hands.The revelation commenced with NTSB investigators questioning Boeing staff about safety concerns within the company and the potential implications for passengers traveling on its widely used aircraft. Earlier, the NTSB had said that the door plug ripped off in mid-flight due to the absence of the four bolts required to secure the door plug in place, the CNN reported.Many of those documents were transcripts of interviews conducted by NTSB investigators during the seven months since the accident.In interviews conducted by NTSB investigators in the months following the accident, a Boeing employee, referred to as ""Assembler Installer Doors B,"" said that the excessive workload at the factory was too great to avoid mistakes from being made.“As far as the workload, I feel like we were definitely trying to put out too much product, right?” said the unidentified Boeing worker. “That’s how mistakes are made. People try to work too fast. I mean, I can’t speak for anybody else, but we were busy. We were working a lot.”Another Boeing employee, identified as a Door Master Lead, revealed to investigators that many aspects of the planes had to be reworked during the assembly process due to discovered issues, such as the door plug that was removed to repair rivets. The worker mentioned that there was no specialized training for handling door plugs compared to regular doors.The Door Master Lead described the situation to the NTSB, stating that his team was ""put in uncharted waters to where… we were replacing doors like we were replacing our underwear.""“The planes come in jacked up every day. Every day,” the second worker added.An FAA inspector at the Boeing factory told NTSB investigators that they have “heard of pressure, [but] haven’t been able to substantiate those claims.”The plane's fuselage, produced by Boeing's supplier Spirit AeroSystems , was delivered to the Boeing factory with the four bolts already installed, as revealed during the hearing testimony. However, due to issues with the rivets near the door plug that required repairs, the door plug was removed to facilitate the necessary work.Despite the presence of Spirit employees at the Boeing plant, communication between the Boeing and Spirit workers on the factory floor was inadequate, as indicated in another interview transcript released on Tuesday.“Well, basically we’re the cockroaches of the factory,” an unidentified employee told NTSB investigators.And a Boeing team captain at the 737 factory said, “We have a lot of turnover specifically because, you know, this can be a stressful job, you know,” the Boeing team captain is quoted as saying in one of the transcripts. “What the company wants and what we have the skills and capabilities to perform at the time sometimes that doesn’t coincide, and so some people get disgruntled; they feel like they’re being overworked; they feel like, you know, that we might be getting taken advantage of,” CNN reported.The flight crew successfully brought the damaged aircraft to the ground, avoiding any severe bodily harm to those on board. Upon landing, medical attention was provided to seven passengers and one crew member for their injuries. The fortunate outcome, with no fatalities, can be attributed to both the expertise of the flight crew and a stroke of good fortune.However, as highlighted by Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB, during the opening remarks of the hearing, the trauma of being on the flight likely affected many of those aboard the plane.“Injuries we can’t see, which we often don’t talk about, can have profound and lasting impacts on lives and livelihoods,” she said and also issued an apology on behalf of the agency to the passengers on the flight.The public's trust in Boeing suffered a significant blow due to the accident, triggering a wave of federal probes into the company's procedures and the overall safety and quality of its planes.According to the NTSB's preliminary findings, the plane involved in the incident was delivered from the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, just 10 weeks prior, and it was missing the four bolts required to secure the door plug in place.Boeing has since explained that this oversight was due to a simple lack of documentation. When the plane's fuselage arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug and its four bolts were correctly installed. However, there were issues with five nearby rivets, and Boeing employees removed the door plug to repair these rivets.According to CNN, the workers who fixed the rivets failed to generate the necessary paperwork indicating that they had removed the door plug and the four bolts to complete the repair work. As a result, when a different team of employees reinstalled the plug, they were unaware that the plane would be flown in that condition.Instead, they believed they were simply blocking the hole with the plug to protect the fuselage's interior from weather exposure as the plane was moved to another area of the factory compound.It is likely that these employees assumed the existence of paperwork documenting the removal of the plug and bolts, which would have alerted someone further along the assembly line to replace the missing bolts . However, without this documentation, no one on the assembly line was aware.The company may face criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has informed passengers and crew members that they could be considered crime victims.Boeing was already facing potential criminal charges prior to the flight due to issues with the 737 Max that were concealed from the Federal Aviation Administration during the initial certification process. These issues resulted in a design flaw on the plane that is believed to have caused two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019, claiming 346 lives.In the first six months of this year, Boeing's sales have dropped by 70%.The NTSB is conducting a crucial two-day investigative hearing to conclude the inquiry into the January 5 incident involving 737 MAX 9 aircraft. The NTSB has stated its intention to “use the information gathered to complete the investigation, determine probable cause, and make recommendations to improve transportation safety.”","Boeing 737 Max employees that experienced a door plug detachment during a flight in January said that they felt pressure to complete their tasks too fast.

After it snowballed into a major controversy, Trump shared Kamala's 'India heritage' photo to prove his point.Kamala Harris has Indian roots from her mother's side as Shyamala Gopalan was born and brought up in Chennai -- and Black roots from her father's side.

Uricchio was dressed in a dark blue shirt and boxer shorts at the time of his arrest, according to the police report obtained by the Hour.Uricchio, whose hands appeared to be covered in blood, was directed by the police to approach them with his arms outstretched. After checking Uricchio for any weapons, the authorities asked about his father, Marc Uricchio. Uricchio confessed, ""I murdered him,"" further stating that he had killed his father “really, really badly.”According to New York Post, upon entering the residence, investigators reportedly discovered blood drops on the stairs and walls.

This is a very safe community,” he added.Shortly after being taken into custody, Uricchio informed the officers that he was experiencing stomach issues due to consuming a significant amount of Advil earlier. Authorities said that Uricchio was then taken to Danbury Hospital, where he underwent an evaluation by medical staff while restrained to a hospital bed with handcuffs.During his time at the hospital, Uricchio told the doctors that he had been prescribed medication which he had not taken ""in a month or two,"" and that he frequently used cannabis.Uricchio was released from medical care and returned to the Ridgefield police station, where he was placed under close observation on suicide watch.During his court appearance at Danbury Superior Court on Monday, Uricchio appeared to be in a nearly unresponsive state, requiring physical assistance to enter the courtroom, according to the News-Times.He remained slumped over, with his head resting on the defense table, until instructed by the judge to stand up, at which point a nearby officer had to practically lift him to his feet.Willie Dow, Uricchio's defense attorney, informed the court of his client's ""significant mental health history."" Dow concurred with the prosecution's request for an evaluation of competency, provision of mental health treatment, and continued monitoring for potential suicide risk, all of which were granted by the presiding judge.Uricchio is scheduled to return to court on September 4th and is currently being held on a bail amount of $1.5 million.","Steven James Uricchio, 31, charged with murder in the death of his 83-year-old father in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

Asif Merchant: Who is Asif Merchant? Pakistani man with ties to Iran charged in assassination plots in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/who-is-asif-merchant-pakistani-man-with-ties-to-iran-charged-in-assassination-plots-in-us/articleshow/112328015.cms,"Who is Asif Merchant?

Asif Raza Merchant was charged in a complaint unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn with murder-for-hire as part of a scheme to assassinate a politician or US government officials on its soil. Law enforcement said they foiled the charged plot before any attack could be carried out. Merchant, who has stated that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan, is in federal custody in New York. US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said that working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of US government officials on American soil. According to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. FBI director Christopher Wray said the ""dangerous murder-for-hire"" plot allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook. In April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source. In early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a ""finger gun"" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant stated that the intended victims would be ""targeted here"", meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official. Merchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.

The plot by Asif Merchant

A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant , has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil. Prosecutors in Brooklyn announced criminal charges against Asif Merchant, accusing him of travelling to New York for the purposes of trying to hire a hitman for the assassinations. The plot was disrupted before it could be carried out.The document did not name any potential target but CNN reported that former president Donald Trump and other current and former US government officials might be the targets of the plot.Trump was shot at by Thomas Crooks at a Pennsylvania rally last month in which the shooter was killed. This attempt was unrelated to the life threat that Trump had from Iran. US officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump.Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement: ""The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.""Merchant said, as revealed by the document, that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified ""party"" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to ""finalize"" the plan and leave the United States.In mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a ""political person"".Merchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.On June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance. Merchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12 when law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country.(With agency inputs)","A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil.

Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy. For a nation largely comprising very young people, this would be an unmitigated disaster as it could have repercussions that may spill over generations. Already struggling to compete, the Pakistpeople will end up being deprived of even more chances to realise their potential and contribute positively on a global scale,"" the editorial said.According to the website DataReportal, there were 71.70 million active social media user identities in Pakistan in January 2024. YouTube is Pakistan's most-used social media platform in 2024 with a potential ad audience of 71.70 million. Data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 54.38 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Pakistan at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 38.9 per cent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.Meanwhile, according to Samaa TV, the Pakistan government has made previous attempts to regulate VPN usage by requiring registration, but these efforts have not resulted in significant action. In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions. The PTA also passed VPN regulations in 2010, but enforcement has been inconsistent.","Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others.

Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, who addressed reporters alongside the party's secretary-general Omar Ayub Khan outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail where the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician is lodged since last August, said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has decided to expand the opposition alliance in a meeting with Imran Khan on Thursday, Geo News reported.Qaiser announced that the former ruling party would gather all opposition parties to run a powerful anti-government movement. He said that the party's forthcoming power show in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swabi was aimed at raising a ""strong voice"" for the release of the PTI founder and other detained leaders.""This country will only be governed in accordance with the law and the Constitution,"" Qaiser emphasised.During his address, Qaiser also rebuked the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government over skyrocketing power bills.

Ayub blamed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for stopping the release of former first lady Bushra Bibi despite having no connections with the Toshakhana corruption case.The PTI secretary general demanded Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq to recuse themselves from hearing the PTI founder's cases, Geo News reported.The PTI believes he is being arrested in more cases at the behest of the powerful military establishment to make sure that he does not come out of jail.Khan was first arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a 190-million-pound corruption case.

However, Imran Khan's lawyer requested the IHC Chief Justice Amir Farooq to recuse himself from the case.He said that Farooq should not hear the case as Khan had registered a complaint against him in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). The lawyer called for the transfer of the case to another bench.Although Farooq rejected the request for recusal, he had to constitute a new bench as Justice Imtiaz went on summer vacation, and the previous bench was dissolved.

Yunus sees ‘many opportunities to heal rifts’ with India

DHAKA: Bangladesh , lumbering through chaos, confusion and violence for three days, will get an interim govt Thursday with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus at the helm, marking a political comeback for the self-exiled 84-year-old former “banker to the poor” after years of battling corruption and other cases slapped by the erstwhile Sheikh Hasina administration.Army chief Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman held a presser to announce a possible 8pm swearing-in, hours after Yunus’s scheduled 2.10pm (Dhaka time) arrival from Paris via Dubai. “Let us ensure that we make the best use of this new victory. Let us not lose this victory because of any mistake of ours,” he said in an appeal.This is a beautiful country, with lots of exciting possibilities. We must protect and make it a wonderful country for us and for our future generations.” The banker-economist, who won the peace Nobel in 2006 for pioneering microcredit in his native country through Grameen Bank , said he was “looking forward to going back home, see what’s happening, and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble we are in”.In Dhaka, the army chief said the interim govt, which he termed “an advisory council”, might have 15 members. “He (Yunus) is very eager to do this,” Gen Wakar said his address. “I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process, and we will benefit from this.”The decision to have an interim govt headed by Yunus was sealed at a meeting Wednesday in Bangabhaban, the official residence and workplace of the President, with the chiefs of the three forces, two Dhaka University teachers and coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement in attendance.Prez Mohammed Sahabuddin immediately agreed to the student representatives’ proposal to request Yunus to shepherd Bangladesh out of the crisis, officials said.Yunus, who is set to become the 32nd Nobel laureate to be a head of state, remains a longtime critic of ex-PM Sheikh Hasina, who resigned on Aug 5 in the face of a mass anti-reservation uprising and fled to India.
