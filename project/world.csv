The incident occurred during a joint Sino-French mission to study Gamma-ray bursts, which encountered a setback as a rocket booster fell over a populated area. The Long March 2C rocket was carrying the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) satellite.A video shared on social media by China 'N Asia Spaceflight on X captured the alarming moment when the rocket booster crashed into an area where children and adults were on the road, causing them to flee for safety.The incident raised serious concerns about the hypergolic propellant used in the Long March rocket, known for its highly toxic and corrosive nature. Comments on the video reflected these concerns.One social media user contrasted global priorities, saying, ""We're in a modern-day space race. China is dropping toxic rockets on their citizens while we are spending months determining if we can put clean water in wetlands. Hopefully, our lead and SpaceX's drive are enough.""Another comment condemned the handling of spent rocket stages, ""They need to be very ashamed of themselves. The absolute dismissal of any safety in the disposal of spent stages is disgusting!""Amidst the criticisms, a third user quipped, ""I'm no rocket engineer, but I'm pretty sure that rocket is going in the wrong direction.""",Chinese citizens were in shock and seen running for safety after toxic rocket debris crashed into a populated area.

'What are the odds': Space debris crashes into Florida home; what family did next,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-are-the-odds-space-debris-crashes-into-florida-home-heres-what-the-family-did-next/articleshow/111217922.cms,"Alejandro Otero and his family from Florida 's Naples, have filed a lawsuit against Nasa , seeking $80,000 in compensation for damages caused by a piece of space junk that crashed into their home on March 8. The incident occurred while Otero was on vacation, and his son informed him about the crashing object.The cylindrical metal object, weighing 1.6lb and measuring 4in by 1.6in, tore through the Otero family's house, causing significant damage. Otero expressed his disbelief and gratitude that no one was injured in the incident, saying, ""I was shaking. I was completely in disbelief. What are the chances of something landing on my house with such force to cause so much damage,"" and ""I'm super grateful that nobody got hurt.""Nasa later confirmed that the object was a metal support used to mount old batteries on a cargo pallet for disposal, which was jettisoned from the space station in 2021. Although the load was expected to burn up entirely upon entering Earth's atmosphere, one piece survived and landed on the Otero family's property.The family, represented by the law firm Cranfill Sumner, is seeking compensation for non-insured property, business interruption, emotional and mental anguish, and the cost of assistance from third-party agencies. Attorney Mica Nguyen Worthy emphasised the seriousness of the space debris issue, saying, ""My clients are seeking adequate compensation to account for the stress and impact that this event had on their lives,"" and ""they are grateful that no one sustained physical injuries from this incident, but a 'near miss' situation such as this could have been catastrophic. If the debris had hit a few feet in another direction, there could have been serious injury or a fatality.""Worthy also highlighted that this case aims to set a precedent for space debris claims in both private and public sectors. Nasa has been given a six-month period to respond to the claims filed by the Otero family.","Alejandro Otero and his family from Florida's Naples, have filed a lawsuit against Nasa.

Taxing the super-rich? 74% of Indians support it – Here’s why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/taxing-the-super-rich-74-of-indians-support-wealth-tax/articleshow/111216913.cms,"As G20 finance ministers prepare to meet next month, a new survey reveals overwhelming public support for a wealth tax on the super-rich. The survey, conducted by the Earth4All initiative and Global Commons Alliance , found that 68 per cent of people in G20 countries support the idea as a means to address global hunger, inequality, and the climate crisis. The support is particularly strong in India, where 74 per cent of respondents are in favor.The survey covered 22,000 citizens across the world's largest economies, highlighting a growing international consensus for progressive taxation . This proposal, under discussion since at least 2013, has garnered increasing support over the years.Brazil, currently presiding over the G20, aims to build a consensus on wealth taxation and is expected to push for a joint declaration at the upcoming meeting of G20 finance ministers in July. A key advocate behind Brazil's initiative is French economist Gabriel Zucman, who is set to release a report on Tuesday detailing how a global minimum tax on the ultra-rich could be implemented and its potential revenue.Zucman argues that the super-rich pay significantly less tax compared to ordinary citizens. His proposal seeks to establish a new international standard, requiring billionaires in every country to pay at least 2 per cent of their wealth in taxes annually.Owen Gaffney, co-lead of Earth4All, emphasized the strong support for significant reforms among Indians. ""Indians want a giant leap on climate and nature -- 68 per cent demand dramatic reforms across all economic sectors within the next decade. This is a strong mandate for planetary stewardship that cannot be ignored,"" he said.The survey reveals that 74 per cent of Indians support taxing wealth. There is also strong backing for taxing high incomes and corporations to fund climate initiatives, along with a 'polluter pays' approach and income redistribution.Additionally, 71 per cent of Indians endorse universal basic income, 74 per cent support policies that promote healthy diets to reduce emissions, and 76 per cent seek a better work-life balance. Furthermore, 68 per cent believe that dramatic action is needed across all sectors of the economy within the next decade, including electricity generation, transport, buildings, industry, and food.An impressive 81 per cent of Indian respondents support a shift to ""wellbeing economies"" that prioritize health and the environment over narrow economic growth.The upcoming G20 finance ministers' meeting will be closely watched as nations debate this transformative approach to wealth taxation, with the potential to reshape global economic policies and address critical challenges facing the planet.","A new survey reveals overwhelming public support for a wealth tax on the super- rich. 68 per cent of people in G20 countries support the idea as a means to address global hunger, inequality, and the climate crisis.

"Nasa overlooked minor leak in Boeing starliner pre-launch, leaving astronauts stranded at ISS: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/nasa-overlooked-minor-helium-leak-in-boeing-starliner-pre-launch-leaving-sunita-williams-butch-wilmore-stranded-at-iss-report/articleshow/111216994.cms,"Prior to the launch of the Starliner rocket on June 5, Nasa and Boeing officials were aware of a helium leak but deemed it too minor to pose a safety risk to the spacecraft. However, once in orbit, the Starliner developed four additional helium leaks, rendering one thruster unusable. As a result, the return trip for astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams has been postponed until at least July 2, pending further analysis and testing of the leaks and thruster failures, according to a report from CBS.Nasa plans to conduct a formal re-entry readiness review before determining a new landing target date. The delay in the Starliner's undocking and return to Earth is likely to extend beyond two planned space station spacewalks on Monday and July 2. Despite the setbacks, Nasa officials maintain that Wilmore and Williams are not stranded in orbit and are cleared to undock and return home at any time if a station malfunction or other issue necessitates a quick departure.Boeing has faced significant criticism over the Starliner's current situation, compounding the company's existing troubles following high-profile malfunctions of its planes over the past year. At least 20 whistleblowers have come forward to express concerns about safety and quality issues at the aerospace giant.Steve Stich, manager of Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said, ""We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process."" He emphasised that the decision-making process is driven by data and that an agency-level review, similar to the one conducted before the Nasa's SpaceX Demo-2 return after two months in orbit, will be completed to document the agency's formal acceptance of proceeding as planned.Despite the issues, Stich asserted that Nasa still has confidence in Starliner, claiming that the spacecraft is ""performing well in orbit while docked to the space station."" However, the ongoing tests and issues raise doubts about Starliner's ability to complete its six-hour return trip.Boeing has incurred approximately $1.5 billion in cost overruns beyond the initial $4.5 billion contract it secured with Nasa, which aims to establish Starliner as its second mode of transportation to the ISS, alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon.","Nasa and Boeing officials were aware of a helium leak but deemed it too minor to pose a safety risk to the spacecraft.

"Aerial drone launched by Yemen's Houthi rebels hits ship in the Red Sea, causing damage and injuries",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/aerial-drone-launched-by-yemens-houthi-rebels-hits-ship-in-the-red-sea-causing-damage-and-injuries/articleshow/111217003.cms,"DUBAI: An aerial drone launched by Yemen 's Houthi rebels struck and damaged a vessel in the Red Sea on Sunday, officials said, the latest attack by the group targeting shipping in the vital maritime corridor . The attack comes as the US has sent the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower back home after an eight-month deployment in which it lead the American response to the Houthi assaults. Those attacks have reduced shipping drastically through the route crucial to Asian, Middle East and European markets in a campaign the Houthis say will continue as long as the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip rages on.The drone attack happened around dawn off the coast of the rebel-held port city of Hodeida, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said. It said the vessel sustained damage but its mariners on board ""were reported safe."" It did not elaborate on the extent of the damage to the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owner bulk carrier, but said an investigation was ongoing.Hours after the attack, Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed the attack, saying the rebels targeted the Transworld Navigator. Saree claimed without offering evidence the rebels instead used a drone boat in the attack, something contradicted by every other report on the assault.The US military's Central Command also identified the vessel by the same name, saying several mariners on board suffered minor injuries from the attack.The Transworld Navigator ""most recently docked in Malaysia and was en route to Egypt,"" Central Command said. ""This marks the fourth attack by Iranian-backed Houthis on the"" vessel.The Houthis have launched more than 60 attacks targeting specific vessels and fired off other missiles and drones in their campaign that has killed a total of four sailors. They have seized one vessel and sunk two since November. A US-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say.The Houthis have maintained that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or Britain. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the Israel-Hamas war - including those bound for the Houthis' main benefactor, Iran.The Eisenhower, based in Norfolk, Virginia, is returning home after an over eight-month deployment in combat that the Navy says is its most intense since World War II. The San Diego-based USS Theodore Roosevelt will take the Eisenhower's place after a scheduled exercise in the Indo-Pacific, said Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.The Roosevelt anchored Saturday in Busan, South Korea, amid Seoul's ongoing tensions with North Korea.","Yemen's Houthi rebels launch drone attack on vessel in Red Sea.

Where is Melania Trump? Former first lady's elusive presence on US 2024 campaign trail sparks curiosity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/where-is-melania-trump-former-first-ladys-elusive-presence-on-us-2024-campaign-trail-sparks-curiosity/articleshow/111216727.cms,"Following her conspicuous absence from pivotal events in her husband's presidential bid , former First Lady Melania Trump has become the center of media speculation. Her minimal public appearances this year have fueled curiosity about her role in Donald Trump 's 2024 campaign.Earlier in the year, Melania missed key events such as the campaign kickoff in Iowa and the Super Tuesday victory party. When asked in March about her future involvement, she coyly responded, “Stay tuned.” Since then, she has kept a low profile, only attending a few fundraisers in April and her son Barron's high school graduation.Significantly, Melania was absent during Donald Trump’s hush money trial in New York. She did not accompany him on any of the trial days, was absent for the guilty verdict, his subsequent remarks at Trump Tower, his 78th birthday celebration, and several campaign rallies.Katherine Jellison, a history professor at Ohio University specializing in first ladies, remarked that Melania's behavior, while unusual, is not entirely surprising. “As First Lady, she kept a low profile and was not very active in his 2020 campaign,” Jellison noted. She highlighted that the Trumps often deviate from traditional political norms.Unlike Melania, other political spouses have been active in supporting their partners' campaigns. Casey DeSantis, wife of Florida Gov Ron DeSantis, was heavily involved in his primary bid, and Dr Apoorva Ramaswamy, wife of Vivek Ramaswamy, often appeared on the campaign trail with their children.Efforts to reach Melania Trump for comments have been unsuccessful. She has made only one recent public statement regarding her son's selection as a delegate for the Republican National Convention, citing his prior commitments as the reason he could not attend.During Donald Trump’s trial, reporters repeatedly questioned his wife’s absence. Trump’s attorney, Todd Blanche, avoided the topic, focusing instead on the challenging nature of the case. Testimony during the trial included sensitive details about Trump's alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, which reportedly concerned him more for its potential impact on his 2016 campaign than on his marriage.Despite her absence, Trump frequently mentions Melania in his speeches, portraying her as an active, albeit behind-the-scenes, supporter. Larry Snowden, president of the “Club 47” fan group, recounted his brief interaction with Melania at a February gala, describing her as “charming” and “accommodating.”Snowden expressed optimism about Melania's future involvement in the campaign, anticipating that she will make key appearances and speeches while remaining protected by the former president.As the campaign progresses, Melania Trump's enigmatic presence continues to intrigue both supporters and critics, leaving many wondering if she will step into a more public role or continue to support her husband from the shadows.","The former First Lady has kept a low profile this year, only attending a few fundraisers in April and her son Barron's high school graduation.

Donald Trump Immigration: How Apple's Tim Cook responded to Donald Trump's Green Card proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-apples-tim-cook-responded-to-donald-trumps-green-card-proposal/articleshow/111192972.cms,"1 million international students -- mostly from India, China

Donald Trump 's automatic Green Card for foreign students graduated in America was not an off the top of his head idea. Trump indicated the policy at a business roundtable meeting last week where Apple CEO Tim Cook was present, Politico reported. ""And when he talked about finding ways to keep American-educated talent at home, some top CEOs, like Apple’s Tim Cook, were seen nodding their heads,"" the report said.""When he spoke to the Business Roundtable last week, some of the titans of the tech industry seemed to breathe a sigh of relief when Trump appeared to support keeping high-skilled immigrants in the United States,"" the report said.Tim Cook has always been a staunch critic of Trump's immigration policy as he terminated DACA, the Obama-era program that shielded some immigrants without documentation from being deported. In 2019, Apple moved the court and said it employed 443 dreamers who were protected by DACA. “Every one of these talented Dreamers should have the same opportunities as Steve did to create, work hard, and help change the world for the better,” Apple said at that time.Come 2024, Donald Trump has taken a considerate view of the immigration situation and announced on ""The all-in podcast"" that foreign nationals who graduate from US colleges and universities should automatically be given a Green Card upon graduation so that the best brains are retained in the US. He mentioned India and China as he rued that fact that bright students from US universities go back to India and China without getting a Green Card in the US and then they become multibillionaires, generate huge employment.Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a statement after Trump's claim explaining that there will an aggressive vetting process to select the candidates for the Green card-- excluding all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges. Only the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America will get the automatic Green Card.The State Department estimated that the United States hosted roughly 1 million international students in the academic year that ended in 2022 -- a majority of whom came from China and India. If the automatic Green Card proposal did not have any rider, US would have to absorb 1 million students as citizens every year.",Trump indicated the policy at a business roundtable meeting last week where Apple CEO Tim Cook was present.

Who are Hindujas and why is UK's richest family in legal trouble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-hindujas-became-the-richest-family-of-uk/articleshow/111176059.cms,"What are the Hindujas accused of

'Spent more on pet dog than servant'

A Swiss court has sentenced four members of the wealthy Hinduja family to up to four years and six months in jail on Friday for exploiting their domestic workers.The Hinduja family, known for their vast business empire spanning various sectors, tops the Sunday Times list of the UK's 350 richest people with an estimated fortune of £37 billion. However, Gopi Hinduja himself was not named in the case.The Hinduja Group, controlled by the family, has diverse business interests ranging from trucks and lubricants to banking and cable television.The group was founded by Parmanand Deepchand Hinduja, who started his merchant banking and trade businesses in British India before moving to Bombay in 1914 and expanding internationally to Iran in 1919.The brothers later shifted their base to London in 1979, where it remains today, with the group claiming to employ 200,000 people worldwide.Srichand P Hinduja, the eldest son, took over the reins in 1935 and is credited with founding IndusInd Bank. Following his death in May 2023, Gopichand Hinduja assumed the role of Chairman and is recognized for the Group's ventures into the power and infrastructure sectors.The family's wealth and influence have been significant, with Forbes ranking them as the seventh richest in India and the 146th richest globally in recent years.In a recent court case in Switzerland, Indian-born businessman Prakash Hinduja and his family members were found guilty of exploiting workers and providing unauthorized employment. The court dismissed the human trafficking charges, saying that the staff understood the conditions they were agreeing to.The Hinduja family, long-time residents of Switzerland, faced accusations of confiscating workers' passports, paying them in rupees instead of Swiss francs, restricting their movement, and forcing them to work excessively long hours for low wages. This was not Prakash Hinduja's first offense, as he had been convicted on similar, though less severe, charges in 2007. Prosecutors alleged that he continued to employ people without proper documentation despite the previous conviction.It was disclosed last week that the family had reached an undisclosed settlement with the plaintiffs. Swiss authorities have already seized various assets, including precious stones and jewelry, which could be used to cover legal fees and potential penalties resulting from the case.According to Swiss prosecutor Yves Bertossa, the family spent more money on their pet dog than they paid one of their servants.The prosecutor delivered a scathing critique of the Hinduja family's actions, recommending jail sentences of up to five and a half years for those involved. Bertossa's arguments were based on testimonies provided by the staff and the Hindujas themselves, as well as evidence gathered during his investigation into the matter.""They spent more for one dog than one of their servants,"" he said. The prosecutor revealed that the woman was paid as little as 7 Swiss francs ($7.84) for a working day that lasted up to 18 hours, seven days a week. He also pointed to a budget document titled ""Pets"", which demonstrated that the family spent 8,584 Swiss francs in a year on their family dog.","Four members of the Hinduja family sentenced to up to four years and six months in jail for exploiting domestic workers.

"Illegal Immigration from India to US: New Routes, Charter Flights, and Rs 80 Lakh Smuggling Packages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/rs-80-lakh-new-routes-and-charter-flights-how-indian-are-trying-to-illegally-enter-into-us/articleshow/111193058.cms,"Here are some FAQs based on Reuters investigations:

What are the new routes for illegal migrants?

What triggered the investigation into these new routes?

What is the cost of these new smuggling routes?

How have US authorities responded to this new smuggling tactic?

What are the broader implications of these smuggling routes for US immigration policy?

How are these new routes avoiding traditional migration barriers?

What role does Nicaragua play in these smuggling operations?

What impact has this had on the passengers caught in these operations?

In a new phase of illegal immigration to the United States, migrants from India and other nations are paying smuggling networks substantial fees for travel packages that include airline tickets, bus rides, and hotel stays en route to the US-Mexico border .These routes involve charter flights to Central America, with migrants then traveling overland to the border.The Biden administration is working with regional governments and travel companies to curb this flow, revoking US visas for owners and executives of charter airlines and other companies suspected of facilitating smuggling.As per a Reuters investigation, one route starts in West Africa, with migrants paying up to $10,000 for multi-stop commercial flights to Nicaragua before continuing by land to the US. The second route, serving migrants from India, offers charter flights to Central America and overland transfers to the US border for between $72,000 and $96,000 per person, with full payment often due after arrival in the US.Nicaragua has emerged as a new entry point for many migrants, with President Daniel Ortega's government allowing individuals from anywhere in the world to fly directly in exchange for a cash payment. The US has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on Nicaraguan officials and sanctions on government-affiliated companies over irregular migration and repressive policies, the Reuters investigation found.On July 15, when a Legend Airlines Airbus A340 touched down at San Salvador airport after an 18-hour journey from the United Arab Emirates, the crew sensed something was amiss. Salvadoran officials, suspecting the nature of the flight, refused to connect the jet bridge, leaving approximately 300 passengers, all Indian nationals, stranded on the plane. According to three former crew members who spoke to Reuters anonymously, several passengers admitted their intentions to travel to Mexico and then cross into the US illegally.Salvadoran officials and their US counterparts grew suspicious after noticing an unusual pattern of charter flights arriving in El Salvador with Indian nationals who claimed to be tourists but had minimal luggage for extended stays. Nearly all passengers disembarking in San Salvador were later found to have crossed the US border illegally, the Reuters report said.According to Indian court documents and KT Kamariya, a deputy superintendent of police in Gujarat, India, migrants from India pay between 6 million ($72,000) and 8 million rupees ($96,000) for packages that include charter flights to Central America and overland transfers to the US border.The US administration has been collaborating with regional governments and travel companies to curb the flow of migrants. Measures include revoking U.S. visas for owners and executives of companies suspected of facilitating smuggling and warning commercial airlines to monitor passengers who might be intending to migrate illegally.These new routes complicate the enforcement of US immigration laws, especially as the Biden administration faces criticism and political pressure over high border crossings. The administration attributes the surge in migration to global economic and political instability, while opponents argue that current policies encourage illegal migration.The new smuggling routes bypass visa requirements for direct flights to Mexico and the dangerous Darien Gap trek between Colombia and Panama. Instead, migrants are flown to Central American countries like Nicaragua and El Salvador, from where they make overland journeys to the US border.Blas Nuñez-Neto, the US Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for Border and Immigration Policy, identified Nicaragua as a new entry point for many migrants. The Nicaraguan government, led by President Daniel Ortega, has been accused of exploiting migration flows by allowing anyone from around the world to enter the country in exchange for cash payments.Many migrants, like Gurpreet Singh from India, have faced multiple failed attempts to enter the US, often resulting in financial ruin and legal troubles.

Billionaire Hinduja family members sentenced to jail for exploiting staff at Geneva villa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/billionaire-hinduja-family-members-sentenced-to-jail-for-exploiting-staff-at-geneva-villa/articleshow/111173810.cms,"'Family spent more on pet dog than they paid a help'

NEW DELHI: A Swiss court sentenced four members of the Hinduja family to up to four and a half years in jail on Friday for exploiting domestic workers at their Geneva villa .The criminal court, however, cleared the members of a billionaire family of charges that they engaged in illegal human trafficking of their servants, who were employed at their luxurious lakeside villa in Geneva. The court said that the staff understood the conditions they were agreeing to. There was no effective detention for any members of the family.""Our clients have been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. We are appalled and disappointed by the rest of the decision made in this court of first instance, and we have of course filed an appeal to the higher court thereby making this part of the judgement not effective. Under Swiss law, the presumption of innocence is paramount till a final judgement by the highest adjudicating authority is enforced"", lawyers representing Hinduja family said in a statement.The counsels also said that the plaintiffs in this case had withdrawn their respective complaints after declaring to the court that they had never intended to be involved in such proceedings.The Switzerland court found Indian-born businessman Prakash Hinduja, his wife, son, and daughter-in-law guilty of exploiting workers and providing unauthorised employment.The Hinduja family, who have been residing in Switzerland for decades, were accused of confiscating workers' passports, paying them in rupees instead of Swiss francs, restricting their movement, and forcing them to work excessively long hours for meager wages. Prakash Hinduja had previously been convicted on similar, albeit lesser charges in 2007, but prosecutors allege that he continued to employ people without proper documentation.Last week, it was revealed that the family had reached an undisclosed settlement with the plaintiffs. Swiss authorities have already seized various assets, including diamonds, rubies, and a platinum necklace, which could be used to cover legal fees and potential penalties.According to prosecutors, employees, including cooks and house help, were sometimes forced to work up to 18 hours a day with little or no vacation time. They were paid less than one-tenth of the amount required under Swiss law. Some staff members allegedly slept in the basement of the villa in the upscale Cologny neighborhood, occasionally on a mattress on the floor. Prosecutors described a ""climate of fear"" instituted by Kamal Hinduja.Certain employees reportedly spoke only Hindi and were paid their wages in Indian rupees in banks back home that they couldn't access. A separate tax case brought by Swiss authorities is pending against Prakash Hinduja, who obtained Swiss citizenship in 2000. The Hinduja family, consisting of Prakash and his three brothers, leads an industrial conglomerate spanning various sectors, with Forbes magazine estimating their net worth at approximately $20 billion.According to Swiss prosecutor Yves Bertossa, the family allegedly spent more money on their pet dog than they paid one of their servants. Bertossa presented this information during a trial concerning the alleged trafficking and exploitation of the Indian employees.On Monday, the prosecutor had delivered a scathing critique of the Hinduja family's actions recommending jail sentences ranging up to five and a half years for those involved. Bertossa's arguments were based on testimonies provided by the staff and the Hindujas themselves, as well as evidence gathered during his investigation into the matter.""They spent more for one dog than one of their servants,"" he said. The woman, he said, was paid at one point as little as 7 Swiss francs ($7.84) for a working day that lasted as long as 18 hours, seven days a week. He pointed to a budget document headlined ""Pets"", which he said demonstrated that the family spent 8,584 Swiss francs in a year on their family dog.Staff contracts didn't specify working hours or days off, but rather that they be available as needed by their employers, Bertossa continued. Given their passports had been confiscated, they had no Swiss francs to spend as wages were paid in India and couldn't leave the house without their employer's permission, they had little to no freedom, he argued.","A Swiss court sentenced four members of the Hinduja family to up to four and a half years in jail on Friday for exploiting domestic workers at their Geneva villa.

While his spokesperson claimed that 25,000 people attended the event, numerous journalists independently disputed this figure.Trump, who became the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential candidate in March, has been holding high-profile rallies across the nation to strengthen support ahead of a likely rematch against President Joe Biden in November. Pennsylvania , a crucial swing state, was won by Biden in 2020 after it backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016.Chris Jackson, a Democratic Party activist, posted a 27-second clip on X (formerly Twitter) of Trump at the Philadelphia rally on Saturday, showing empty upper tiers of seating at the venue.

According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the extreme heat will then move to Nebraska and Kansas on Monday.Officials are cautioning residents in the Philadelphia region about hazardous conditions, with high humidity potentially driving heat indices above 105 F (41 C), making it feel even hotter than the actual temperature.""It likely means we'll be seeing periodic periods of excessive heat across a decent part of the country into July,"" said NWS meteorologist Marc Chenard. ""Not continuous at any one spot, but the overall pattern will continue to favor these above normal temperatures.""While some areas like the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and New England have seen a decrease in temperatures, the East Coast from Virginia to New York continues to experience heat in the 90s F. The extreme heat conditions are part of a broader pattern linked to climate change, which is causing dangerous heat waves across the Northern Hemisphere and predicted to cause adverse weather effects for years.These heat waves have had catastrophic impacts globally, with hundreds of deaths in Asia and Europe. In Saudi Arabia, over 1,000 people died during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca amid searing temperatures, according to a Reuters tally.In New Mexico, multiple weather events including a dust storm, flooding, and two wildfires have prompted emergency responses. The Biden administration last week declared an emergency over the wildfires, which resulted in two deaths and destroyed more than 1,400 structures.The FBI has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the fires, which have burned 25,000 acres (10,117 hectares) near the village of Ruidoso, as reported by the government wildfire tracking website Inciweb.Alongside the heat, other states are grappling with flooding. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for 21 counties affected by flooding from heavy rains in the northwest part of the state. In Rock Valley, officials ordered some residents to evacuate with assistance from the National Guard, according to local news reports.Southern Minnesota and southeastern South Dakota are also under flood advisories.","Baltimore and Philadelphia are expected to reach near-record highs of around 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) on Sunday.

More 'presidential'?

WASHINGTON: Joe Biden and Donald Trump square off for a historic US presidential debate this week, with the stage set for what could be a pivotal moment in the 2024 race as millions of potential voters tune in.The showdown fires the starting gun on what promises to be a bruising summer on the campaign trail, in a deeply polarized and tense United States still convulsed over the chaos and violence that accompanied the 2020 .With only two debates this cycle, Thursday's high-stakes clash takes on heightened significance, and both candidates have stepped up their personal attacks, with national polls showing the pair neck and neck.""The debate is important because it's an opportunity for two well-known candidates to 'reintroduce' themselves to a public that knows them well but hasn't been paying attention,"" said Donald Nieman, a political analyst and history professor at Binghamton University in New York state.""The big question is how much of the public, beyond political aficionados, will pay attention to such an early debate.""For Trump, the 90-minute clash is a chance to drive home worries about 81-year-old Biden's mental alertness, although the Republican, 78, has faced age concerns of his own.For Biden, the first ever debate between a sitting and former president will be an opportunity to underline the legal challenges engulfing Trump and to paint him as unfit for office.The president will also be desperate to avoid any major gaffes which, at this stage, could lose him the November election.The debate comes in the wake of a criminal trial that has consumed Trump's attention for months, with his sentencing on 34 convictions for falsifying business records scheduled for July 11.Both candidates shunned the bipartisan commission that has run debates since 1988, deciding instead to go with CNN for a first showdown unusually early in the year, and another on ABC on September 10.Abortion, the state of US democracy and foreign conflicts are all issues of concern to voters, although inflation and border security are likely to loom largest.The last debates between the two men in 2020 were fraught, with Biden at one point snapping ""will you shut up, man?"" as Trump repeatedly interrupted him.This time, moderators have more tools than usual to maintain decorum, with the microphones muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.""Trump is notoriously undisciplined and is likely to chafe at not being able to dominate the event by talking over his opponent and drawing out time with his long-winded, insult-laden tirades,"" said political scientist Nicholas Creel, of Georgia College and State University.""Biden is also counting on this debate reminding Americans of the chaos that was the Trump presidency, so Trump being unable to abide by the rules and performing poorly as a result is a very striking possibility.""But debates are about sound bites on social media as much as policy arguments, and both candidates will look for explosive viral moments.""I'll be looking at whether former president Trump tries to become more 'presidential' in any respect, though the campaign trail would suggest the answer to that is no,"" said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University.The Biden campaign released an ad last week hitting Trump over his criminal convictions as the president headed to his mountainside retreat at Camp David to fine-tune attack lines and rebuttals.Trump, who struggles in granular discussions of policy, huddled with aides and vice presidential hopefuls at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where the emphasis was more on tone and broad substance than detail.Trump would benefit by sticking to a script, highlighting Biden's weaknesses on inflation and immigration and dialing down the bombast, said Nieman, the Binghamton analyst.""It would disappoint his base, but it would go far to make inroads with suburban, college-educated women,"" he told AFP.","Joe Biden and Donald Trump square off for a historic US presidential debate this week.

A school with 7 students: America is witnessing a 'microschools' boom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-school-with-7-students-america-is-witnessing-a-microschools-boom/articleshow/111216220.cms,"ATLANTA: When Nathanael was in kindergarten, he told his mother, Diana Lopez, that he did not want to return to school - ever. His teacher yelled at him, he said. And when Lopez picked him up from school, he would often immediately start to cry. Nathanael has autism, and in a busy classroom of 25 children, the teacher seemed to have few strategies for working with him, Lopez recalled. This year at a new school, Nathanael, 7, was happier. He shared a teacher with only six other students - not in one classroom, but in the entire school.Nathanael attended a microschool, an increasingly popular type of super-small, largely unregulated private school, often serving fewer students than are enrolled in a single classroom at a traditional school. The programmes are benefitting from two trends: Since the Covid-19 disrupted schooling, many parents have rethought their children's education , and are open to nontraditional options. And Republican state lawmakers and donors, who have long supported private-school choice, have increasingly directed money toward microschools across the US, saying they give parents a chance to withdraw from school districts at a reasonable price - typically $5,000 to $10,000 per year.Microschool students are usually registered with their states as home-schoolers. But the new generation of microschools, like the programme Nathanael attended, Kingdom Seed Christian Academy, operates more like modern-day one-room schoolhouses, meeting in homes, church basements and storefronts. These schools are often open four or five days per week, with full-time teachers, set curricula and sometimes even standardised tests.There is little data on the schools. But the National Microschooling Centre, an advocacy group that surveys programme founders, estimates there are 95,000 microschools and home-schooling pods nationwide, serving more than 1 million students. That number is expected to grow as eight states last year joined Arizona and West Virginia in providing near-universal access to education savings accounts, a type of voucher that can be used for home-schooling costs. In April, Georgia, too, passed a law creating the accounts. An estimated 1 million children now use public funds for some form of private education, more than double the number from before the pandemic, according to new research from EdChoice, a nonprofit that supports school choice and tracks the sector.","Nathanael attended a microschool, an increasingly popular type of super-small, largely unregulated private school.

""Gaza is Ours!"" and ""Death to Israel!"" The incident occurred shortly after the graduation, which had been themed ""All you need is love.""During the attack , the Jewish woman's husband was thrown to the ground, put in a chokehold, and repeatedly kicked and punched by members of the other family. One woman struck him with the sharp heel of her stiletto shoe. The couple's 10-year-old twins witnessed the assault. The mother, Lana, believes her family was targeted because they are Jewish.The incident is considered one of the worst outbursts of antisemitism in NYC public schools since the Hamas terror attack in Israel and the war in Gaza on October 7. Tova Plaut, a city educator and advocate for Jewish peers, had previously warned that tolerating overtly antisemitic views would lead to a toxic environment and physical violence against Jewish students and families.Initially, the NYPD did not classify the incident as a hate crime, but after the couple urged them to reconsider, the Hate Crimes Task Force began investigating the incident.During the graduation ceremony, one student had walked across the stage wearing a graduate cap marked ""Free Palestine"" and waving a small Palestinian flag, which upset Lana's mother and caused her to walk out. A school administrator informed another parent that the city Department of Education's legal staff had approved the display as an expression of free speech.The attack began when relatives of the boy with the flag tried to push Lana and Johan out of the way as they were taking pictures with their children in front of a PS 682 banner and balloons. An older man shouted anti-Israel slogans, and when Johan argued with him, another man punched Johan and a scuffle ensued. Johan was put in a chokehold and held down by multiple people, while their 16-year-old son was punched in the face when he tried to help his father.Lana was also assaulted by a woman from the group who pulled her hair and knocked her to the ground, shouting, ""I will kill you."" No security was on site, but two male teachers intervened to break up the attack. Johan was taken to Maimonides Medical Center with injuries, while Lana suffered a gash on her leg and their teen son had a bloody nose.The police made one arrest: Ez-Al Dean Bazar, 26, who punched and dragged Johan. However, the criminal complaint filed by the Brooklyn District Attorney's office did not mention any motive for the attack.","A Jewish mother and her husband, who is Dominican and Catholic, were violently attacked by an Arabic-speaking family at their children's fifth-grade graduation ceremony.

New FBI video shows Saudi agent filming DC locations before 9/11 terror attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-fbi-video-shows-saudi-agent-filming-dc-locations-before-9/11-terror-attack/articleshow/111210973.cms,"Omar al-Bayoumi video unsealed in federal court | 60 Minutes

A recently released video from 1999 shows a man identified by the FBI as a Saudi intelligence agent filming various locations in Washington , DC, three months before Al-Qaida decided to carry out the 9/11 attacks .The footage, which was in the possession of the FBI, was unsealed as part of a court action by families of the 9/11 victims who claim that Saudi Arabia's government was complicit in the event, a claim the country's rulers deny. The video was obtained by CBS and aired on the 60 Minutes program.In the video the man, Omar al-Bayoumi , provides commentary about various locations in the city, including the Washington Monument and the entry points and security arrangements of the US Capitol building. He also refers to a ""plan"" at one point. The Capitol is believed to have been the target of one of the planes before its hijackers were overwhelmed by passengers, causing it to crash in the Pennsylvania countryside.The film was initially discovered by UK investigators in Bayoumi's flat in Birmingham, where he was a PhD student at Aston University, in the days following the 9/11 attacks. The flat also contained an address book that lawyers for the families say contains the contact details of officials in the Saudi government at the time. Scotland Yard provided the footage to the FBI.Bayoumi has long been a subject of speculation due to his links to two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar. Declassified FBI reports suggest that Bayoumi may have had advanced knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and provided significant assistance to the hijackers after their arrival in the US.In the video, Bayoumi greets the ""esteemed brothers"" and welcomes them from ""Washington the American capital city."" He points out the Washington Monument and mentions going there to report back in detail. The FBI claims that when Bayoumi was shooting the video, he was accompanied by two Saudi Arabian diplomats who the bureau said had ties to al-Qaida.The official 9/11 Commission report, published in 2004, concluded that intelligence failures on the part of the CIA and FBI were primarily to blame for the attack. The report stated that there was no credible evidence that Bayoumi believed in violent extremism or knowingly aided extremist groups. When Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, credited as the attack mastermind, was asked under interrogation if he knew Bayoumi, he said he did not.",Omar al-Bayoumi filmed locations in Washington three months before the 9/11 attacks.

Hadley Duvall, a 22-year-old woman from Owensboro, Kentucky , will join first lady Jill Biden in Pennsylvania this weekend to campaign for abortion rights as part of the 2024 election push.Duvall became an advocate for abortion rights after being raped by her stepfather at the age of 12, which resulted in a pregnancy and miscarriage. Her stepfather was convicted of rape and is currently serving time in prison.Last fall, Duvall shared her story in a campaign ad for the Kentucky governor's race, highlighting the consequences of abortion restrictions, especially those without exceptions for rape or incest.In the ad supporting Democratic governor Andy Beshear, Duvall called out the anti-abortion Republican candidate, stating, ""anyone who believes there should be no exceptions for rape and incest could never understand what it's like to stand in my shoes."" Beshear's reelection victory was attributed, in part, to Duvall's ad, which resonated with rural, male voters who had previously supported Republican Donald Trump for president.Duvall will appear with Jill Biden at a rally in Pittsburgh on Sunday as part of President Joe Biden's effort to motivate voters on abortion rights. The first lady will also hold an event in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on the same day.The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe vs Wade on June 24, 2022, has led to abortion bans in roughly half the states, with 10 states having no exceptions for rape or incest. These bans have far-reaching consequences beyond restricting access to those seeking to end unwanted pregnancies.The Pennsylvania events are part of a larger campaign push by the Biden administration around the anniversary of the Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. The campaign includes more than 35 events across the country, featuring women and doctors who have been deeply affected by the fall of Roe.","Hadley Duvall, a 22-year-old woman from Owensboro, Kentucky, will join first lady Jill Biden in Pennsylvania this weekend to campaign for abortion rights.

The post, shared last week, described a brief 10-minute meeting in which the employee was informed of their termination. The post has since sparked widespread outrage and criticism on social media, with many branding it as insensitive and tone-deaf.In his post, Baltzell described how the meeting was kept “short and direct” and mentioned that the employee was offered a severance package and a reference for future employment. He praised the former employee for handling the news “professionally and with grace.”After the meeting, Baltzell sent a message over communication software Slack to notify the team about the departure, emphasizing that he wanted to avoid any secrecy surrounding the layoff. He claimed that his approach was meant to show his team that if they ever had to leave, they would be treated with respect.The post received mixed reactions on LinkedIn. While some individuals commended Baltzell for his straightforwardness, others criticized the post as being out of touch.One commenter labeled it as “typical LinkedIn drivel,” while another suggested that the CEO should “grow up,” pointing out that publicizing such matters could create more problems.The backlash intensified when a screenshot of the post was shared on X, accompanied by the caption: “Imagine getting fired, heading over to LinkedIn, and seeing this.” The reactions on X were overwhelmingly negative, drawing parallels to a similar incident in 2022 where the CEO of Hypersocial posted a selfie of himself crying after laying off hundreds of employees, which also went viral.Critics on X highlighted that publicizing the firing on social media was inappropriate. One founder expressed that if they ever had to fire someone, the last thing they would want to do is post about it online. Another comment stressed that true leadership does not require boasting about how well one handled the firing of an employee, calling Baltzell’s post “horrifying.”","Matthew Baltzell, the founder and CEO of Cap X Media, detailed the firing of an employee in a LinkedIn post.

Pakistani delegation arrives in Jammu for Indus water treaty talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-delegation-arrives-in-jammu-for-indus-water-treaty-talks/articleshow/111211635.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Pakistani delegation arrived in Jammu on Sunday evening as part of ongoing discussions concerning the 1960 Indus Water Treaty (IWT). The team is scheduled to visit various dam sites in the region over the next few days. This visit marks is a step towards bilateral efforts to address and manage water resources shared by India and Pakistan under the treaty, which governs the use of the Indus River and its tributaries. The delegation's itinerary includes inspections of key dam projects to facilitate discussions on water management and treaty compliance.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed by then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and former Pakistan President Ayub Khan in 1960, establishes a framework for cooperation and information exchange on the use of the Indus River system. The treaty is overseen by the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), a bilateral body with commissioners from both countries tasked with implementing and managing treaty provisions, and resolving any questions, differences, or disputes that may arise.The PIC, which includes Indus Commissioners from India and Pakistan, has been a crucial platform for technical discussions and treaty compliance. Despite the treaty's framework, India and Pakistan have faced ongoing disagreements over hydroelectric projects. Pakistan has raised objections to India's construction of the Kishanganga (330 megawatts) and Ratle (850 megawatts) hydroelectric plants, arguing they violate treaty provisions. India, however, maintains that the projects are compliant with the treaty's guidelines and asserts its right to develop them.Efforts to resolve these disputes have been ongoing, with the World Bank encouraging both nations to explore alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. In 2015, Pakistan requested the appointment of a Neutral Expert to review its technical objections to India's projects but later sought arbitration in 2016. Despite five meetings of the PIC from 2017 to 2022, Pakistan has refrained from discussing the issue, complicating efforts to reach a consensus.The arrival of the Pakistani delegation signals a continued commitment to dialogue and cooperation under the Indus Waters Treaty, with the upcoming site visits expected to further discussions on water management and treaty implementation.",Pakistani delegation arrives in Jammu as part of ongoing discussions concerning Indus Water Treaty.

Chinese 'ultra set' telecom gear devices used by Pakistan's army seized from terrorists in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/chinese-ultra-set-telecom-gear-devices-used-by-pakistans-army-seized-from-terrorists-in-jk/articleshow/111206076.cms,"NEW DELHI: Encounters with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir led to the seizure of highly encrypted Chinese telecom equipment , known as ' Ultra Set ,' which were used by terror groups, officials said. This sophisticated gear, initially meant for the Pakistan army, has found its way into the hands of terrorists, raising serious concerns over undetected infiltrations from across the Line of Control (LoC). Authorities believe these terrorists might be residing in the outskirts of cities and villages in the region.The 'Ultra Set' devices, found during a gunfight in the Sindarah top area of Surankote in Poonch district and in Sopore's Check Mohalla Nowpora in Baramulla district, were seized after confrontations last year and earlier this year. Four foreign terrorists were killed in Surankote, while two were eliminated in Sopore. These specialized handsets, customized by Chinese companies for the Pakistan army, combine cell-phone capabilities with unique radio equipment that bypasses traditional mobile technologies like GSM or CDMA.Officials indicated that the 'Ultra Set' devices operate on radio waves for message transmission and reception, each linked to a control station across the border. The messages are compressed and transmitted via Chinese satellites to a master server in Pakistan. The discovery of such advanced communication tools has heightened fears of state-sponsored support for terrorism.“This is yet another help being extended by China to its key ally Pakistan,” officials said, noting that China has been actively enhancing Pakistan's defense capabilities along the LoC. This support includes the construction of steelhead bunkers, the provision of unmanned aerial vehicles, and the installation of encrypted communication towers, alongside laying underground fiber cables.Additionally, Chinese radar systems, such as those of the ""JY"" and ""HGR"" series, have been deployed to improve target detection along the LoC. Advanced weaponry like the SH-15 truck-mounted howitzer has also been observed in the region. These developments are seen as part of China’s strategic interests in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), particularly in connection with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).While there has been no direct sighting of senior People's Liberation Army (PLA) officials at forward posts, intercepted communications suggest that Chinese troops and engineers have been involved in infrastructure development in PoK. This includes the construction of underground bunkers and tunnels in the Leepa Valley, supporting a direct route between Gwadar Port in Pakistan and China's Xinjiang province through the Karakoram Highway.(With agency inputs)","Encounters with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir led to the seizure of highly encrypted Chinese telecom equipment.
