"Obama, Clinton and... Deja Foxx? Influencers pitch Kamala Harris at DNC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/obama-clinton-and-deja-foxx-influencers-pitch-kamala-harris-at-dnc/articleshow/112640480.cms,"Chartreuse green. Coconut trees. Venn diagrams. They’re motifs of a “brat” summer that has memed Kamala Harris into a narrow but perceptible lead against the master of social media — Donald Trump.Now, as she prepares to be coronated as her party’s nominee in a presidential campaign dominated more by vibes than policy, Harris needs to keep the momentum going.So she is turning to about 200 social-media influencers, who for the first time ever have received privileges such as access to delegates and studio space at the Democratic National Convention.It’s a reflection of the campaign’s belief that social media creators are at least as important as traditional media organizations for getting its message to voters. What’s more, some of them — not bound by journalistic doctrine against the appearance of bias — will even make speeches at the DNC in Chicago to rally support for Harris.Monday night will feature Deja Foxx , a Columbia University graduate whose website describes her as an activist “leading thought at the intersection of social justice and social media.” She is focused on reproductive rights, an issue that has given Democrats ammunition against the Republicans after a conservative majority in the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade’s federal abortion protections.“I will be the first creator to speak at the DNC tonight,” Foxx, who has almost 140,000 followers on TikTok and about 52,000 followers on Instagram, said in a video posted on Monday. “This is a dream, realized.” On Sunday, after arriving in Chicago for the convention, she posted two “outfit check” videos in which she sported a Stella McCartney dress that she said she’d bought secondhand and a “vintage 2020 primaries Kamala tee” featuring a childhood picture of Harris in pigtails.Foxx, who worked on Harris’ failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, is now based in Arizona, where polls show a tight presidential race. Republicans are pushing border security where they sense Harris could be vulnerable, but face their own challenges on reproductive rights. An amendment to enshrine abortion protections in the state’s constitution will be on the ballot in November, which could fuel Democratic turnout.Apart from Foxx, four other influencers — Olivia Julianna, Carlos Eduardo Espina, Nabela Noor and John Russell — will speak at the DNC this week, according to a person familiar with the matter. They’ll share the same stage reserved for Harris and her running mate Tim Walz, as well as the most powerful Democrats, including Barack Obama , Nancy Pelosi and Bill and Hillary Clinton.Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar celebrated the Democratic party ’s recent success on social media, particularly compared with former president Trump's past dominance. “One of the frustrations for us and our party is that these guys just captured the Internet,” she told a group of New York delegates at the DNC on Monday morning. “Not this time.”Klobuchar highlighted the surfacing of controversial comments made by Trump running mate JD Vance disparaging “childless cat ladies,'' sparking blowback not just from Democrats but also some Republicans.“When we found that video on cat ladies, the cat ladies of the country united,” she said. “When they go after Kamala for coconut trees, there’s coconut memes, there’s brat summer, there’s her laugh set to Zoom music. We have taken this back.”Though Vance clarified that he was criticizing the Democratic Party for “becoming anti-family and anti-child,” rather than targeting people who couldn’t have kids, his original remarks have contributed to a view that the GOP ticket is adversarial to women. The influencer Noor, set to speak on Tuesday at the DNC and whose social media feeds feature everything from recipes to makeup tips and travelogues, has spoken passionately on her YouTube channel, where she has over 1 million followers, about the challenges she and her husband faced in conceiving a child.While that’s likely to resonate with Democratic diehards at the DNC, a pinned video on her TikTok account also provides a window into a challenge the Democrats are contending with among the Gen Z crowd. Noor speaks about why she deleted an earlier post expressing “compassion for the innocent civilians” affected by the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, a militant group designated a terrorist organization by the US and European Union.“I just assumed that all of my followers knew of my past posts and support for the Palestinian cause in the past year,” she said in the video, while simultaneously applying makeup. “If I could do one thing differently, it would be to be even clearer about my support for the Palestinian movement for peace and freedom while still sharing my sympathy of course for Israeli civilians.”The elevation of influencers like Noor is the party’s attempt to capture the attention of young voters, a core component of the Democratic base that was unenthusiastic about Biden’s bid for reelection. Since his exit from the race, they’ve warmed to Harris, but some of them are still skeptical of the vice president's response to the Israel-Hamas war.Noor’s video clarifying her views on the conflict shows how the turmoil in Gaza continues to be the biggest and most divisive issue driving many young Democrats to turn on the party. Harris has adopted a more sympathetic tone than Biden toward the plight of Palestinians, but her refusal to disavow Israel — which has been bombarding Gaza as part of its stated goal of eliminating Hamas — has angered the activists.Chicago has been bracing for protests over the conflict after pro-Palestinian groups planned mass demonstrations urging followers to “Shut Down the DNC for Gaza!”. Through Monday afternoon, thousands of demonstrators have marched the city’s streets.Harris has also faced off against protesters during her campaign. “Kamala, Kamala you can’t hide! We won’t vote for genocide,” a group of them yelled at a rally in Detroit earlier this month. The visibly annoyed vice president responded: “You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.”Among the other influencers scheduled to speak at the convention, Espina is the most popular on TikTok, with over 10 million followers on the platform. His focus is immigration, among the top concerns for voters in this election cycle and a cudgel that Trump and the GOP frequently pick up to attack Democrats.It’s a vulnerability for Harris in particular. Republicans have seized on the vice president’s portfolio that included addressing the root causes of migration.Espina, 25, makes videos targeted toward uplifting the immigrant community. Earlier in the summer, he filmed a video with Biden after the president announced a policy that looks to expand options for certain undocumented individuals and some spouses of US citizens. In a more recent video, he filmed himself in Chicago, saying he was “in the middle of the action” to keep his audience informed.“There should be no wrong door for engaging with voters,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at an event on Monday. “We’re speaking to them about the issues that matter most, and I’ve been really impressed, starting with brat summer to the work that’s going on now online. It's been very, very impressive. I’m someone who really enjoys communicating with my fellow Pennsylvanians on Tiktok, Instagram, wherever. It is really important to meet people where they are.”","Kamala Harris is turning to about 200 social-media influencers.

Mohammed bin Salman forged king’s sign on Yemen war decree: Ex-official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/mohammed-bin-salman-forged-kings-sign-on-yemen-war-decree-ex-official/articleshow/112639688.cms,"DUBAI: A former Saudi official alleged in a report that Saudi Arabia 's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman forged the signature of his father on the royal decree that launched the kingdom's yearslong, stalemated war against Yemen's Houthi rebels.Saudi Arabia did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the allegations made without supporting evidence by Saad al-Jabri in an interview published Monday by the BBC, though the kingdom has described him as ""a discredited former government official."" Al-Jabri, a former Saudi intelligence official who lives in exile in Canada, has been a yearslong dispute with the kingdom as his two children have been imprisoned in case he describes as trying to lure him back to Saudi Arabia.The allegation comes as Prince Mohammed now serves as the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, often meeting leaders in place of his father, the 88-year-old King Salman. His assertive behavior, particularly at the start of his ascension to power around the beginning of the Yemen war in 2015, extended to a wider crackdown on any perceived dissent or power base that could challenge his rule.In al-Jabri's remarks to the BBC, he said a ""credible, reliable"" official linked to the Saudi Interior Ministry confirmed to him that Prince Mohammed signed the royal decree declaring war in place of his father.""We were surprised that there was a royal decree to allow the ground interventions,"" al-Jabri told the BBC. ""He forged the signature of his dad for that royal decree. The king's mental capacity was deteriorating.""A US-based lawyer for al-Jabri did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Yemen war against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, launched with promises by the prince it would quickly be over, has ground on for nearly a decade. The war has killed more than 150,000 people and created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. Prince Mohammed was the defense minister at the time.The Houthis also since the start the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip have launched attacks on shipping that have disrupted traffic through the Red Sea - and led to the most intense combat faced by the U.S. Navy since World War II.Al-Jabri once worked for former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, a trusted confidant of the U.S. in the battle against al-Qaida militants in the kingdom after the September 11, 2001, attacks. King Salman replaced the crown prince for his son in 2017 and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef is believed to have been held under house arrest after.Al-Jabri had sued Prince Mohammed bin Salman in US federal court, alleging the crown prince sought to have him killed after he fled abroad.Speaking to the BBC, al-Jabri again alleged Prince Mohammed considered assassinating former King Abdullah with a poison ring from Russia - something he claimed in a 2021 interview with CBS News. He also described his fears that the crown prince still wanted him killed as his children remain imprisoned in the kingdom.""He planned for my assassination,"" al-Jabri told the BBC. ""He will not rest until he sees me dead. I have no doubt about that.""","Saad al-Jabri claims Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman forged his father's signature.

British tech giant Mike Lynch among missing after yacht sinks off Sicily,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/british-tech-giant-mike-lynch-among-missing-after-yacht-sinks-off-sicily/articleshow/112639556.cms,"Divers inspect wreck

PALERMO: One man died and six people were missing, including British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his daughter, after a luxury yacht was struck by an unexpectedly violent storm and sank off Sicily early on Monday.The British-flagged ""Bayesian"", a 56-metre-long (184-ft) sailboat, was carrying 22 people and was anchored just off shore near the port of Porticello when it was hit by ferocious weather, the Italian coast guard said in a statement.Eyewitnesses said the yacht vanished quickly beneath the waves shortly before dawn. Fifteen people escaped before it went down, including Lynch's wife, Angela Bacares, who owned the boat, and a one-year-old girl.The names of the dead and missing were not immediately released, but a person familiar with the rescue operation confirmed that Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, were not accounted for.Salvatore Cocina, head of the Civil Protection in Sicily said Jonathan Bloomer, chairman of Morgan Stanley International and Chris Morvillo, a lawyer at Clifford Chance were also among the missing people.Italian media said the dead man was the yacht's onboard chef.Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a phone call and email seeking comment after hours. Clifford Chance did not return a request for comment.The Italian coast guard said the missing had British, American and Canadian nationalities. Survivors said the trip had been organised by Lynch for his work colleagues.""The wind was very strong. Bad weather was expected, but not of this magnitude,"" a coast guard official in the Sicilian capital Palermo told Reuters.The captain of a nearby boat told Reuters that when the winds surged, he had turned on the engine to keep control of his vessel and avoid a collision with the Bayesian, which had been anchored alongside him.""We managed to keep the ship in position and after the storm was over, we noticed that the ship behind us was gone,"" Karsten Borner told journalists. The other boat ""went flat on the water, and then down,"" he added.He said his crew then found some of the survivors on a life raft - including a baby girl and her mother - and took them on board before the coast guard picked them up.Lynch, aged 59, is one of Britain's best-known tech entrepreneurs. He built the country's largest software firm, Autonomy, from his ground-breaking research at Cambridge University, and became known as Britain's Bill Gates.He sold the firm to HP for $11 billion in 2011, before the deal unravelled spectacularly following the acquisition, with the US tech giant accusing him of fraud.Once lauded by academics, scientists and politicians, Lynch spent much of the last decade in court defending his name. He was acquitted by a jury in San Francisco in June, after he spent more than a year living effectively under house arrest.He said at the time that he was ""elated"" to be cleared in the criminal trial in which he denied any wrongdoing and blamed HP for botching the integration of the two companies.The coast guard said divers were inspecting the wreck of the Bayesian, which was lying at a depth of 49 metres.Prosecutors in the nearby town of Termini Imerese have opened an investigation to look into what had gone wrong.Storms and heavy rainfall have swept down Italy in recent days after weeks of scorching heat, which had lifted the temperature of the Mediterranean sea to record levels, raising the risk of extreme weather conditions, experts said.""The sea surface temperature around Sicily was around 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit), which is almost 3 degrees more than normal. This creates an enormous source of energy that contributes to these storms,"" said meteorologist Luca Mercalli.""We can't say that this is all due to global warming but we can say that it has an amplifying effect,"" he told Reuters.The Bayesian was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008 and was last refitted in 2020. Its 75-metre mast is the tallest aluminium mast in the world, Perini said on its website.The shipspotting.com website said the boat was owned by a firm called Revtom Limited. Lynch's wife Bacares is named as the sole shareholder of the firm on company documents.The yacht's name would resonate with Lynch because his PhD thesis and the software that made his fortune was based on Bayesian theory.The ship won a string of awards for its design and can accommodate up to 12 guests in six suites and a crew of 10, according to online specialist yacht sites.The boat left the Sicilian port of Milazzo on August 14 and was last tracked east of Palermo on Sunday evening, with a navigation status of ""at anchor"", according to vessel tracking app Vesselfinder.","British-flagged ""Bayesian"", a 56-metre-long (184-ft) sailboat, was carrying 22 people.

Republicans launch Biden impeachment report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/republicans-launch-biden-impeachment-report-without-proof/articleshow/112639508.cms,"WASHINGTON: Congressional Republicans lodged a formal case Monday for the impeachment of US President Joe Biden , using the opening day of the Democratic National Convention to launch a political assault unlikely to gain serious traction.The report from three powerful committees in the Republican-led House of Representatives accuses Biden of corruption linked to his son Hunter 's foreign business affairs.Jim Jordan, head of the Judiciary committee, said the probe showed ""conclusively"" that Biden had ""abused his public office for the private financial benefit of the Biden family and Biden business associates.""""President Biden's legacy is marked by abuse of public office, corruption and obstruction. The evidence produced by our impeachment inquiry is the strongest case for impeachment of a sitting president the House of Representatives has ever investigated,"" said James Comer, head of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.However, there is no proof that Biden ever used his office to benefit his son or was involved in Hunter's businesses. There was no smoking gun in a document built around inferences and innuendo about connections between father and son.Biden -- set to deliver a swan song speech at the Democratic convention and pass the political torch to his vice president Kamala Harris -- has repeatedly denied helping his son's business ventures, including in Ukraine and China.Republicans have for years used Hunter Biden's foreign links and chaotic personal life as a recovering drug addict to try and embarrass the president.However, marathon attempts to build an impeachment case against Biden -- seen by many as a bid for revenge over the two impeachments of Republican Donald Trump when he was president -- have never come close to an actual vote by the House.Republicans hold only a razor-thin majority and would likely fail to remain unanimous on impeaching Biden, risking severe embarrassment.",Congressional Republicans lodged a formal case for the impeachment of US President Joe Biden.

Blinken: Bibi has agreed to mediators’ truce proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/blinken-bibi-has-agreed-to-mediators-truce-proposal/articleshow/112639476.cms,"JERUSALEM: Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that Israel had accepted a Biden administration proposal to bridge some remaining differences with Hamas on a cease-fire deal, as he pushed what he called ""probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity"" to secure a truce and free the remaining hostages in the Gaza Strip.Blinken made the declaration after a nearly three-hour meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Jerusalem.""In a very constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu today, he confirmed to me that Israel accepts the bridging proposal -- that he supports it,"" Blinken told reporters. ""It's now incumbent on Hamas to do the same.""The statement put new pressure on Hamas, whose officials have called the proposal fundamentally slanted toward Israel, although the details have not been publicized.Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, said in a televised interview Monday with Al Jazeera that Hamas had broadly accepted a framework for a cease-fire outlined by President Joe Biden in late May. But he accused Netanyahu of introducing new conditions to that proposal and said Israeli officials had conceded nothing on key issues during a round of talks in Doha, Qatar , last week.""If the US administration was serious, we wouldn't need more negotiations -- only to implement Biden's proposal,"" Hamdan said.Netanyahu's office said in a statement that the meeting with Blinken had been ""positive"" and that the prime minister had ""reiterated Israel's commitment to the current American proposal on the release of our hostages, which takes into account Israel's security needs, which he strongly insists on.""But Netanyahu, in his own videotaped remarks, focused mostly on Iran and its allied militias.""I greatly appreciate the efforts that the US is making in regional defense against the Iranian axis,"" he said. ""This is important, of course, for the state of Israel."" He added, ""I also greatly appreciate the understanding that the US has shown for our vital security interests as part of our joint efforts to bring about the release of our hostages.""Despite the upbeat tone, some Israeli officials privately expressed skepticism that the US proposal would result in a breakthrough with Hamas.Negotiations intended to finalize a deal were expected to resume in Egypt this week, after two days of high-level talks in Qatar ended on Friday without an immediate breakthrough. During last week's talks, the United States, with the support of Egypt and Qatar, offered the bridging proposal to resolve some of the remaining differences between Hamas and Israel and avert a wider regional war.Blinken called it ""a decisive moment"" in the monthslong push for a cease-fire in Gaza.The talks have taken on added significance since an explosion on July 31 in Tehran, widely attributed to Israel, killed Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, after he attended the inauguration of Iran's new president. Hours earlier, an Israeli airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut killed Fouad Shukur, a senior commander of Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese militia that, like Hamas, is backed by Iran.Iran and Hezbollah have vowed to retaliate for the killings, and Israel has said it will respond powerfully to any attack on its territory, raising the specter of an escalating regional conflict.Blinken and other mediators have not described what is contained in the bridging proposal. But US officials have said it aligns with a cease-fire framework that Biden outlined May 31 and that was later endorsed by the UN Security Council.Under that three-phase plan, Hamas and its allies would free the remaining hostages in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The deal would eventually lead to the ""cessation of hostilities permanently"" and the rebuilding of Gaza.It remained unclear how Israel and Hamas would resolve their remaining differences. Among other points of contention, Netanyahu has sought to have Israeli troops patrol the Gaza side of the territory's border with Egypt to prevent Hamas from rearming during a cease-fire. Hamas has said it will not agree to any deal that does not involve the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.Hamas did not participate directly in last week's cease-fire talks in Qatar and has expressed deep frustration with the negotiations. On Sunday, the group said it had been briefed on the talks by mediators and ""we once again came to the conclusion that Netanyahu is still putting obstacles in the way of reaching an agreement, and is setting new conditions and demands with the aim of undermining the mediators' efforts and prolonging the war.""Blinken acknowledged Monday that the deal had not been finalized. He said, ""The next important step is for Hamas to say yes, and then in the coming days, for all of the expert negotiators to get together"" to work on ways to carry out the agreement.""These are still complex issues, and they're going to require hard decisions by the leaders,"" Blinken added. ""Ultimately, it comes down to those decisions. But there is, I think, a real sense of urgency here across the region on the need to get this over the finish line and to do it as soon as possible.""Blinken also met with Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, and its defense minister, Yoav Gallant, as well as with relatives of the hostages in Gaza. The families have been pressuring Netanyahu to agree to a deal that would free those who were kidnapped during the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel.""We continue to urge all parties involved to sign an agreement as soon as possible,"" the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said in a statement after its members met with Blinken. ""We cannot afford to waste this critical opportunity, which may be the last opportunity; time is running out for the hostages.""As diplomats hoped a cease-fire in Gaza, or even the prospect of one, might persuade Iran to hold off or blunt its anticipated attack on Israel, Blinken offered an indirect warning to Tehran and Hezbollah.""It's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process,"" he said. ""And so we're working to make sure that there is no escalation, that there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line -- or for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places and to greater intensity.""Hostilities between Israel and Hamas, meanwhile, have continued.Hamas' military wing and its ally, Islamic Jihad, took responsibility Monday for what they said was a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv on Sunday night. The Israeli police and the Shin Bet security agency said that a ""powerful explosive"" had detonated on a road in southern Tel Aviv. One passerby was injured, they said.On Sunday, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian journalist, Ibrahim Muhareb, bringing the total number of Palestinian journalists and news media workers killed since Oct. 7 to at least 123, according to the International Federation of Journalists.The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate said that Israeli tank fire had struck Muhareb and a group of his colleagues while they were wearing gear identifying them as press near Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.At least 25 people have been killed by Israeli fire in central and southern Gaza since Sunday, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense. The Israeli military said Monday that it had killed dozens of ""terrorists"" in Gaza and had struck facilities and infrastructure used by militants.","Hamas official says Hamas has broadly accepted a framework for a cease-fire.

Harris super PAC founder says public polls are too optimistic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harris-super-pac-founder-says-public-polls-are-too-optimistic/articleshow/112639146.cms,"CHICAGO: The founder of the main outside spending group backing Kamala Harris ' presidential bid says their own opinion polling is less ""rosy"" than public polls suggest and warned that Democrats face much closer races in key states.Chauncey McLean , president of Future Forward , a super political action committee, or super PAC, that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to back Harris in the November 5 election, spoke on Monday during an event hosted by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.""Our numbers are much less rosy than what you're seeing in the public,"" said McLean, who rarely talks publicly.Harris enters the Democratic National Convention in Chicago riding a wave of public polls that show she has already reshaped a race that strongly favored Republican Donald Trump in the final weeks of President Joe Biden's candidacy. Harris is leading in a compilation of national polls by FiveThirtyEight 46.6% to 43.8% for Republican Donald Trump, and has pulled ahead in several public battleground state polls.Future Forward has created a massive polling operation that created and tested some 500 digital and television ads for Biden and some 200 for Harris. They have talked to some 375,000 Americans in the weeks after Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee on July 22.McLean said the group has at least $250 million left to spend, planning a wave of advertising from digital to television between Labor Day on September 2 and Election Day on November 5.Super PACs can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend unlimited amounts to overtly advocate for or against political candidates.McLean said the majority of Harris' momentum in the immediate aftermath of Biden dropping out was from young voters of color, and that has opened up Sunbelt states such as Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, states which Democrats had largely written off in the final days of the Biden campaign.""She has multiple paths,"" with seven states in play, a complete turnaround from when Biden was on the ticket, he said. The other states include Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.McLean said Pennsylvania remains the most consequential state in the group's analysis and he called the race a ""coin flip"" based on its polls. He says Harris must win one of three states - Pennsylvania, North Carolina or Georgia - to win the White House.He warned that Harris has yet to fully rebuild the Biden coalition of Blacks, Hispanics and young voters that brought him the White House in 2020.McLean said polling shows the public wants more detailed policy positions from Harris.He says they don't want ""white papers,"" but they also don't want platitudes. He says they need more concrete examples of how she may differ from Biden and make their lives easier economically. Trump allies have called on Harris to do the same in recent days, hoping to pin her down on controversial issues.The race is as tight as ever, McLean said.""We have it tight as a tick, and pretty much across the board,"" he said.","Chauncey McLean is president of Future Forward, a super political action committee, or super PAC, that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to back Kamala Harris.

Watch: Ram Mandir carnival float steals the show at New York's India Day Parade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ram-mandir-floats-through-new-york-at-india-day-parade/articleshow/112615589.cms,"The streets of New York came alive with the colors and sounds of India as the 42nd Annual India Day Parade made its way down Madison Avenue. Amid the bustling cityscape, thousands gathered to celebrate their heritage, their pride reflected in the fluttering Indian flags and the rhythmic beats of dhols. The parade, a celebration of India's culture and history, showcased the deep connection between the Indian diaspora and their roots.At the center was a wooden float, measuring 18 feet long, nine feet wide, and eight feet high which was largely carved in India and shipped by air cargo to participate in the parade.It depicted the grand pink sandstone Ram Mandir built for Lord Ram in Ayodhya , and was adorned with flowers. The Ram Lalla idol, unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Pran Pratishtha ceremony on January 22 in Ayodhya, was also featured on the float.The parade marched down Madison Avenue from East 38th Street to East 27th Street, accompanied by a festival featuring cultural performances, booths, and food vendors.According to the Federation of Indian Associations , the parade included over 40 floats, 50 marching groups, and 30 marching bands, along with celebrities and dignitaries such as Bollywood actress Sonakshi Sinha, actor Pankaj Tripathi, and Member of Parliament Manoj Tiwari.Swami Avdheshanand Giri, who participated in the parade at the invitation of the Indian-American community , praised the enthusiasm of the participants and the tableaus showcasing India's divine culture and values. He highlighted that the Ram Mandir float demonstrates India's belief in considering the whole world as a family and seeing only one God in all human beings.However, a group representing Indian American Muslims withdrew its float from the parade, citing controversy over the inclusion of the Ram Mandir float, which they claim shows anti-Muslim bias.The Federation of Indian Associations, the organizers of the event, said that the float celebrates the inauguration of a landmark significant to Hindus and represents the country's diversity.For more than forty years, the India Day Parade has been an annual event in New York City, commemorating India's independence. This long-standing tradition continued with the 42nd Annual India Day Parade, which took place on the bustling streets of the city.The parade, which has been taking place every year for over four decades, is a vibrant celebration of Indian culture and heritage. As the event enters its fifth decade, it aims to highlight the spirit of the Indian community in New York and their commitment to honoring their nation's independence.","The 42nd Annual India Day Parade took place on Madison Avenue in New York City.

King Charles III terminates security for Prince Andrew at Royal Lodge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/king-charles-iii-terminates-security-for-prince-andrew-at-royal-lodge/articleshow/112610762.cms,"King Charles III has reportedly terminated the security team stationed at Prince Andrew 's residence, the Royal Lodge , as the Duke of York continues to resist calls to downsize from the property. The decision has fueled speculation that the disgraced royal may soon be forced to vacate his longtime home.According to The Sun, Charles informed the ten-man security detail that their contracts would not be renewed after October.“They are all working the final weeks of their contract till the end of October. It’s not thought anyone is being lined up to replace them,” a palace insider told the outlet. The source added, “Everyone is speculating this means the Duke will have to leave the Royal Lodge because what other reason could there be to take his security away?”Prince Andrew, 64, has resided at the 31-room Royal Lodge, located on the grounds of Windsor Castle , since 2004, after signing a 75-year lease agreement the previous year. The property, valued at $38 million, has been Andrew's home despite the mounting controversy surrounding his association with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein . Since 2019, Andrew has faced eviction pressures following revelations of his ties to Epstein.Further compounding his troubles, Andrew has reportedly neglected to pay for the maintenance of the property, which requires an annual upkeep of $503,000, as reported by Us Weekly in May. The financial strain on the Duke has been significant, with King Charles reportedly paying his younger brother $5.1 million annually to keep him financially afloat.Additionally, the King has been covering the cost of private security at the Royal Lodge since Andrew's $3.8 million Metropolitan Police protection was removed when he was stripped of his royal roles by Queen Elizabeth II.“It isn’t a secret that the King wants him out,” the insider told The Sun.The latest security move comes after reports that Andrew has refused to vacate the Royal Lodge for the smaller Frogmore Cottage, the former residence of his nephew Prince Harry, who was forced to leave the property in June 2023.Despite the tensions, Andrew traveled to Scotland on Friday to join his brother and the rest of the royal family at Balmoral Castle. He will be accompanied by his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, and their grandchildren, according to Express.co.uk. Notably absent from the official guest list were Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle.Andrew has been described as a “recluse,” rarely leaving the Royal Lodge since December. A source told Express.co.uk, “Andrew has hardly left Royal Lodge since Christmas so he’s very much looking forward to getting away with the rest of the family at Balmoral. The King is keen for it to be a happy family occasion which will see members of the family come together for just over a week to discuss plans for the future and to unwind.”","King Charles III has reportedly terminated the security team stationed at Prince Andrew's residence, the Royal Lodge.

Kennedy International Airport.In the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, Hamilton accuses Delta and the unidentified flight attendant of negligence. She claims that the airline failed to properly train its staff and ensure the safe operation of the beverage cart in the plane's aisle. Hamilton is seeking unspecified damages for her injuries.Neither Hamilton’s attorney nor a Delta spokesperson commented on the lawsuit.This lawsuit adds to Delta’s recent legal troubles. Last week, the airline faced another lawsuit in the US district court in Georgia for allegedly refusing to issue refunds following a major technology outage caused by a CrowdStrike snafu. The outage, which occurred last month, resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights across the United States.In a separate incident, a Delta flight was forced to make an emergency landing at JFK Airport after passengers were served contaminated food. The flight, traveling from Detroit to Amsterdam, was diverted after several passengers fell ill due to spoiled meals. Upon landing, 12 passengers were treated by medical personnel. The total number of affected passengers remains unclear.A passenger named Virginia took to social media to express her frustration, writing on X (formerly Twitter), ""Delta I need to know how you're going to get me to Amsterdam today - I'm on the plane that's emergency landing at JFK because you served passengers 'contaminated' food - I don't need hotel/food vouchers I need to arrive in Amsterdam today.""","Gail Hamilton, the passenger, alleges that she was seated in an aisle seat on Delta Flight 263 on June 21, 2022, when the flight attendant “unexpectedly” hit her multiple times with a loaded cart.

China claims Philippine ship ignored warnings and 'intentionally collided' in South China Sea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-claims-philippine-ship-ignored-warnings-and-intentionally-collided-in-south-china-sea/articleshow/112616086.cms,"Philippines says South China Sea actions not provocative

China's Coast Guard accused a Philippine vessel of "" deliberately colliding "" with a Chinese vessel in a "" dangerous and unprofessional "" manner in the disputed South China Sea . The clash occurred around 3:24 am local time on Monday, with a short video posted by the China Coast Guard on social media capturing the incident.According to China's maritime security statements, the Philippine vessel, which had previously been warned, entered waters near Second Thomas Shoal after being blocked from Sabina Shoal.Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, claimed that two Philippine Coast Guard vessels ""illegally intruded"" into the area around Sabina Shoal early Monday.Gan criticized the Philippines for ""provoking and causing trouble,"" and for violating agreements related to supply missions to a vessel grounded at Second Thomas Shoal. He warned that the Philippines should ""immediately stop infringement and provocation"" or face ""all consequences.""The Philippines' actions to assert its rights in the South China Sea are not provocative, Jonathan Malaya, spokesperson for the country's security council, said on Monday.The incident follows a provisional agreement reached in July between China and the Philippines to address repeated altercations near Second Thomas Shoal.China's aggressive stance, including blocking Philippine resupply efforts to a navy ship intentionally grounded 25 years ago, has faced sharp criticism from Western nations. Beijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, including both Sabina and Second Thomas Shoals, and rejects a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that deemed its expansive claims invalid under international law.","China's Coast Guard accused a Philippine vessel of "" deliberately colliding "" with a Chinese vessel in the disputed South China Sea.

"Iran responsible for hacks targeting Trump, Biden-Harris campaigns: US intel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/iran-responsible-for-hacks-targeting-trump-biden-harris-campaigns-us-intel/articleshow/112639220.cms,"US intelligence officials attributed the hacking of Donald Trump 's presidential campaign to Iran , describing this intrusion as part of Tehran 's broader effort to interfere in American politics.This marks the first time the US government has blamed Iran specifically for election-related hacking.The FBI and other federal agencies revealed that besides breaching the Trump campaign, Iran is believed to have attempted to hack into Kamala Harris 's presidential campaign, according to reports by Associated Press.The federal officials indicated Iran's goal was to sow discord, undermine faith in democratic institutions, and influence the outcome of the election, especially those perceived by Iran as significant to its national security interests. “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,” said the statement released by the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.Iran’s mission to the United Nations has denied the allegations, asserting that Iran had neither the motive nor intention to interfere with the election and challenged the US to provide evidence.This statement comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran, particularly regarding the US's efforts to prevent a retaliatory strike on Israel over the assassination of Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh. An Israeli operation in southern Beirut last month resulted in the death of Hezbollah's top commander. Although Tehran and Iran-backed Hezbollah have vowed retaliation, no strikes have occurred as diplomatic efforts and Gaza cease-fire talks continue in Qatar.The US did not detail its methods for concluding that Iran was responsible for the hacks or describe the specific nature of any information obtained from the Trump campaign. However, the statement indicated that the intelligence community is confident that Iran has sought access to individuals with direct involvement in both political parties' presidential campaigns through social engineering and other means.At least three staffers from the Biden-Harris campaign were targeted with phishing emails, though investigators have found no evidence of a successful breach, as reported by The Associated Press last week.“Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the US election process. It is important to note that this approach is not new. Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world,” the statement continued.The Trump campaign, on August 10, disclosed that it had been hacked, noting that Iranian operatives had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. Confidential material, including a report vetting JD Vance as a vice-presidential candidate, ended up being leaked to news outlets such as Politico, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. So far, these outlets have refused to reveal specific details of what they received. The incident allegedly encompassed the unauthorized acquisition of confidential files, which included documents pertaining to the assessment of Trump's vice presidential candidate, JD Vance which were later disseminated to members of the press.Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign disclosed last week that the FBI had informed them last month of attempted hackings ""In July, the campaign legal and security teams were notified by the FBI that we were targeted by a foreign actor influence operation,"" a Harris campaign official told AFP. However, the campaign added, ""We have robust cybersecurity measures in place and are not aware of any security breaches from these efforts.""In early October, Microsoft issued a report outlining foreign agents' attempts to meddle in this year's election. It mentioned an instance where an Iranian military intelligence unit sent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign through a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.Additionally, Google reported that an Iranian group linked to the country's Revolutionary Guard has attempted to infiltrate the personal email accounts of approximately a dozen individuals associated with President Joe Biden and Trump since May.","The FBI and other federal agencies revealed that besides breaching the Trump campaign, Iran is believed to have attempted to hack into Kamala Harris's presidential campaign.

Rolling back Biden’s EV policies

Former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump revealed on Monday that he is open to considering Tesla CEO Elon Musk for a key role in his administration if he is elected again.During a campaign stop in York, Pennsylvania, Trump mentioned Musk's intelligence and innovative mindset, suggesting that he could play a significant advisory role or even join his cabinet.As per Reuters, when asked about the possibility of Musk joining his administration, Trump seemed quite enthusiastic. He stated, ""He's a very smart guy. I certainly would, if he would do it, I certainly would. He's a brilliant guy.""Trump's consideration of Musk follows a recent two-hour interaction between the two billionaires on Musk’s social media platform.During their discussion, Musk proposed the idea of a government efficiency commission to oversee and optimise government spending. “I’d be happy to help out on such a commission,” Musk told Trump, emphasising the need for taxpayer money to be spent wisely.Trump responded positively, praising Musk’s ability to streamline operations and cut costs. “You’re the greatest cutter,” Trump said, recalling how Musk handles labour disputes by decisively managing strikes and reducing inefficiencies.This potential partnership could signal a significant collaboration between the former president and one of the most influential figures in the tech and automotive industries .Although the former president has praised Musk and may enjoy a great camaraderie with him, Trump’s stance on EV policies and manufacturing may affect the business of Tesla, owned by Musk.Trump also plans to dismantle Biden administration policies that mandate stricter emission standards and increased EV production, both of which align with Tesla's business model.Arguing that the market for EVs is limited due to cost and battery range issues, Trump’s proposed changes could pose challenges for Tesla, which has thrived under the current push for greener vehicles.",Former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump revealed on Monday that he is open to considering Tesla CEO Elon Musk for a key role in his administration.

Thousands marched to voice their opposition to the war in Gaza, with some demonstrators causing minor disturbances.As the main group of protesters marched, a few dozen broke away, tearing down pieces of the security fence near the United Center, where the convention is being held, AP reported.Several protesters, dressed in black with their faces covered, dragged portions of the fence back to a nearby park. Police detained and handcuffed several protesters who managed to get through the fence. Authorities confirmed that the inner security perimeter surrounding the convention site was not breached, assuring no threat to the attendees.Chants of “End the occupation now” and “The whole world is watching!” were heard, which notably resonated with echoes of the 1968 anti-Vietnam War protests in Chicago. During those protests, police clashed with demonstrators on live television.On Monday, officers prepared by putting on gas masks while some protesters attempted to bring down a second fence set up in front of the police.The march occurred as President Joe Biden conducted a walk-through of the largely empty United Center. Biden, who has faced intense criticism from pro-Palestinian groups, was scheduled to address the party in the evening.“Biden, you can’t hide. We charge you with genocide,” chanted the marchers amid drum beats. They also referred to him as “Genocide Joe” and directed similar chants atVice President Kamala Harris .Protesters maintained that their plans remained unchanged since Biden left the race, with the party quickly rallying behind Harris, who is set to accept the Democratic nomination this week. Activists expressed their intent to amplify their progressive message before the nation’s top Democratic leaders.“We have to play our part in the belly of the beast to stop the genocide, to end US aid to Israel and stand with Palestine,” said Hatem Abudayyeh, spokesperson for the Coalition to March on the DNC , which includes hundreds of organisations.The march saw a heavy police presence, including Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling, who walked with a group of officers ahead of the protesters. Mayor Brandon Johnson stated that authorities were well-prepared for the event.“The city of Chicago is really good at things like this,” Johnson said at a news conference. “We are ready.”Organisers had hoped for at least 20,000 participants in Monday’s rally and march but only a few thousand appeared to be present at the march’s start.

"In Its True Sense, Raksha Bandhan Is Gender-neutral",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-its-true-sense-raksha-bandhan-is-gender-neutral/articleshow/112634924.cms,"Raksha Bandhan

has gradually transformed from a traditional celebration of the bond between

brothers and sisters

into a broader symbol of unity among diverse faiths. The ritual of tying a rakhi not only acknowledges the

divine Shakti

inherent in everyone but also embodies the festival's

gender-neutral

essence. It transcends the conventional roles of women tying rakhis to men, instead celebrating the richness of

human relationships

and recognizing the divine presence in all beings.

As millions of our readers in America and Europe celebrate Raksha Bandhan,

from Speaking Tree explores the evolution of Raksha Bandhan and its powerful message of inclusivity and love.

Authored by: Sonal Srivastava

The Surprising Side of Krishna: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4, Verse 9

Raksha Bandhan is an occasion to celebrate strong bonds and to protect each other from negativity. Traditionally, the festival is marked by sisters tying rakhis to their brothers, who, in return, promise to protect them in difficult times. According to a legend, Draupadi tore a piece of cloth from her dress to tie around Krishna’s bleeding finger after he cut it while flying a kite. Moved by Draupadi’s gesture, Krishna promised to protect her from evil and fulfilled this vow when Dusshasan, one of the Kauravas, attempted to disrobe her in Hastinapur.In modern times, Rabindranath Tagore suggested that Raksha Bandhan should not only create strong bonds between brothers and sisters but also foster camaraderie between Hindus and Muslims, especially in the aftermath of the partition of Bengal in 1905. To Tagore, Raksha Bandhan symbolised not just a brother’s promise to protect his sister but also a connection between people of different faiths, embodying the spirit of unity.The act of tying a rakhi acknowledges the divine Shakti in everyone. Thus, in its true spirit, the festival is gender-neutral. It is not confined to a woman, sister, tying a rakhi to a man, brother, seeking a promise of protection. Rather, it celebrates human relationships and recognises the Divine in all beings.Both brothers and sisters should tie rakhis to each other. A sister can tie a rakhi to her sister, and a brother should also tie one to his sister, acknowledging that the sister embodies shakti and has the strength to protect her brother if necessary. In modern times, sisters care for their brothers just as much as brothers care for their sisters. There are many instances of sisters protecting their brothers from disease and harm. Most recently, a 21-year-old woman in Navi Mumbai donated a sizeable part of her liver to save her 17-year-old brother.In the Indic pantheon, many goddesses were created to protect the devas from asuras, representing evil tendencies. One of the strongest asuras, Mahishasura, could only be sublimated by a woman. To defeat him, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, and other devas combined their energies to create Durga, who embodies the shakti of the male deities and serves as a source of their strength. Durga’s victory over Mahishasura symbolises righteousness prevailing over destructive and negative tendencies.Tying the sacred thread is a reminder to maintain the purity of the Self and a promise to live by the right values. Anyone can tie a rakhi to anyone, regardless of gender. According to the Brahma Kumaris, the most significant battles we face are not external but internal—our weaknesses, racing thoughts, and inner turmoil that disturb our peace. Therefore, the key rituals of Raksha Bandhan, such as applying a tilak on the forehead and tying a rakhi, are meant to remind us that we are Atman and to pledge to recognise our true, pure nature.Thus, the act of tying a rakhi should not be confined to the patriarchal notion that a woman is weaker and seeks protection from a male sibling. Instead, the festival should be marked by strong camaraderie among individuals, regardless of gender, reflecting the spirit of Shankara's Advaita —that there is no room for duality—and protecting the right values to ensure that humanity continues to thrive.","Raksha Bandhan is an occasion to celebrate strong bonds and to protect each other from negativity.

'Monsoon brides': Extreme weather fuels Pakistan child marriages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/monsoon-brides-extreme-weather-fuels-pakistan-child-marriages/articleshow/112579850.cms,"'I thought I would get lipstick'

'I want to study'

DADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan , 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.""I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,"" Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.""But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.""Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity .The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.""This has led to a new trend of ' monsoon brides ',"" said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.""Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.""Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.""Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,"" said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.""They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done"".Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.""My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,"" she said.""I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,"" she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.""Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.""Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.""We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,"" said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.""They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,"" she added.""The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.""Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.Unicef has reported ""significant strides"" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.""We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,"" it said in a report after the 2022 floods.Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.""When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities',"" the daily wage labourer told AFP.Mehtab was just 10 years old.""The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep,"" said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.""I have told my father I want to study,"" she said. ""I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself.""","Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years. But after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise. The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112579857,imgsize-1225816,width-400,resizemode-4/112579857.jpg"

The first trial was carried out in July, which resulted in the slowing down of social media platforms.PM Shehbaz Sharif’s government had allocated more than 30 billion Pakistani rupees in the development budget for the acquisition and installation of this filtering system.However, the adverse impacts after installing the firewall drew criticism from netizens and digital rights groups, who expressed fear about the future of internet-based businesses in Pakistan.government authorities had so far feigned ignorance over the internet disruptions being linked to firewall installation, and had blamed telecom and internet service providers for connectivity issues.On Thursday, however, IT minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said her ministry was addressing complaints of slow internet speed, even though she did not link the problem with thecybersecurity firewall .“There have been complaints of slow internet and I have asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to provide data of the last two weeks to look at the data traffic to know the speed issue,” she told reporters.Asked about the installation of a firewall, the minister said it was a cybersecurity matter and that countries around the world used the technology. “Previously, government was managing the web system, but with increasing international cybersecurity attacks on the country, there is a growing need for the state to strengthen its ability to prevent these attacks,” Khawaja said.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.The association of internet service providers have blamed the slow internet speed and outages on increased security and surveillance. “It’s a very discouraging situation for our customers. Many are leaving the smaller ISPs because they cannot sustain the poor service quality any more. If this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan,” read a statement issued by service providers.","Pakistan government confirms that it is upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.

Millions of people across Pakistan have been facing trouble accessing internet services for some time now due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions.So far, official stakeholders in Pakistan have either been feigning ignorance in response to public outcry and media queries, or claiming that the problems were because of telecom and internet service providers, or even Meta.While talking to reporters after the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Tele­communi­cation meeting on Thursday, Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said the government had sought a report from Pakistan Telecommunication Authority and other institutions over the internet disruption.""The internet should never be slow. We have even been talking about bringing 5G technology to Pakistan. There is no doubt about that, and conversations about higher internet speed are underway,"" the Dawn newspaper quoted Khawaja as saying.When the minister was asked about the 'firewall' - a blanket term used by the public to describe the causes of internet disruption in the absence of any official explanation - she said the issue had been ""blown out of proportion"".""The government has been operating a web-management system. The system is now being upgraded.""She also called the process ""a routine exercise"" across the globe to enhance internet security, without giving any detail to substantiate her claims about which other countries have deployed this system.""It is the right of the government to take measures to protect its interests given the cyber security attacks that Pakistan is facing.""This was the first time an acknowledged the government's actions, which have been blamed for everything from slow browsing speeds, the arbitrary blocking of social media platforms and WhatsApp connectivity issues on mobile data, the paper said.Meanwhile, on Thursday, users continued experiencing pro­blems in accessing social media platforms, including WhatsApp.Downdetector, a website that provides real-time information about internet outages, received an unusually high number of complaints about disruptions in WhatsApp, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram between 12 noon and 1 pm.Meanwhile, a petition was filed in the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday against a ""nationwide internet shutdown"", seeking immediate restoration of internet access.",Pakistan government confirms it is upgrading its web management system to cope with cyber security threats.

Pakistani minister says more arrests expected in retired ISI chief's court-martial case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-minister-says-more-arrests-expected-in-retired-isi-chiefs-court-martial-case/articleshow/112564172.cms,"LAHORE: More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed in a housing scam, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Friday, a day after three more retired military officers were arrested in the case. Hameed, who served as director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, was arrested following action in the complaint of a private property developer over alleged misuse of official authority.""Investigations are underway in the Faiz case. More arrests are likely in the army and elsewhere,"" Dawn News quoted the minister as saying here.""It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country's security… all those will come in its grasp,"" Tarar said.The minister's remarks came hours after the ISPR, the military's public affairs division, in a statement on Thursday said: ""In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.""The ISPR said more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests.The ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested and did not indicate when the arrests had been made, but media reports claimed they were identified as Brigadier (Retd) Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; Brig (Retd) Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and Colonel (Retd) Asim.Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the case, Tarar said the institution of the army had prioritised self-accountability.""We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.""Tarar said when a no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. ""[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,"" he alleged.Taking note of the ISPR statement, Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread. Attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were security attacks.""I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,"" he said, adding that jailed former premier Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but ""won't be able to save his neck"".The ISPR announcement follows speculation that numerous retired officers had been detained about Gen Hameed's trial for his post-retirement actions that violated the Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court.Hameed was arrested on August 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday.His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of the Pakistan Army.The unprecedented arrest of the top-ranking officer, who led the premier intelligence agency, broke the myth in the country that such powerful officers were beyond the reach of law.Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that Khan was not happy with Munir.Later, the army decided to replace Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Khan. It is believed that it was the beginning of the souring of his ties with the powerful military.Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has wielded considerable power in security and foreign policy matters.","More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed.
