World-famous 'Doge' meme dog Kabosu dies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/world-famous-doge-meme-dog-kabosu-dies/articleshow/110388087.cms,"Kabosu, the dog from the Dogecoin meme (Image credits: X)

NEW DELHI: Kabosu, the beloved Shiba Inu who became an internet sensation as the Doge meme, has passed away. Kabosu’s owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the sad news, stating that Kabosu ""fell into a deep sleep"" at 7:50 am on May 24. A farewell party is scheduled for Sunday at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City, from 1 pm to 4 pm.

Kabosu's fame began in 2010 when pictures of her went viral online, leading to the creation of the Doge meme. The meme's popularity skyrocketed and even inspired the creation of Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 using Kabosu’s image as its logo. Initially conceived as a joke, Dogecoin's success spurred the creation of several other dog-themed cryptocurrencies.

In April last year, Elon Musk briefly changed Twitter's logo to an image of Kabosu, causing a surge in Dogecoin's value. Musk has been an outspoken supporter of the meme-based cryptocurrency.

Kabosu had been diagnosed with cholangiohepatitis and chronic lymphoma leukemia in 2022. Her passing marks the end of an era for meme enthusiasts and the cryptocurrency community.

Deadly turbulence: How Singapore Airlines flight's 400-foot drop happened within minutes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/air-turbulence-singapore-airlines-flights-400-foot-rise-and-drop-within-minutes-how-it-happened/articleshow/110324673.cms,"Passenger accounts and crew response

Aftermath and safety protocols

Investigations and future precautions

A Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore encountered severe turbulence, causing a rapid ascent and descent of 400 feet within a minute, resulting in the death of one passenger and injuries to at least 30 others. The Boeing 777-300ER, which departed from London’s Heathrow Airport, was diverted to Bangkok, where it made an emergency landing.The turbulence hit about 10 hours into the flight, as the plane flew over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar, a region known for severe weather conditions.The aircraft, carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members, was at an altitude of 37,000 feet when it suddenly encountered ""sudden extreme turbulence,"" causing it to drop 6,000 feet in about three minutes.Andrew Davies, a 54-year-old passenger from London, recounted his experience during the turbulence to the Wall Street Journal. He was deciding between taking a nap and watching a movie when the seatbelt sign flashed on. Just as he secured his seatbelt, the plane began to drop violently. ""Pillows, plates and cups were thrown in the air. His seat belt tugged at his waist, and he found himself covered in his neighbor’s coffee. Oxygen masks dropped down,"" Davies told the WSJ.The chaos in the cabin was immediate and severe. ""I saw a woman with a deep gash on her head, covered in blood. Flight crew members also appeared bloody and injured, hobbling around trying to help passengers,"" Davies added. An elderly passenger, identified as Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British national with a history of heart problems, likely suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by the crew to perform CPR for 20 minutes, they were unable to revive him.The plane's abrupt altitude change was documented by FlightRadar24, which reported a ""rapid change in vertical rate, consistent with a sudden turbulence event."" The turbulence was likely clear-air turbulence (CAT), which is difficult to detect and can occur without warning. ""Developing thunderstorms often have strong updrafts, a zone of upward moving air, that rises very rapidly, sometimes at more than 100 mph, and can leave pilots little time to react if it occurs directly in front of the plane,"" explained Dan DePodwin, Senior Director of Forecasting Operations at AccuWeather.Former pilot Marco Chan noted the turbulence likely occurred within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, notorious for thunderstorms. ""With turbulence of such magnitude, it is likely the [Singapore Airlines] flight was navigating through difficult thunderstorms,"" he said.Following the incident, Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong expressed condolences and assured that the airline was providing necessary support to affected passengers and their families. ""We are very sorry for the traumatic experience that everyone on board SQ321 went through,"" Goh said.Of the injured, 18 were hospitalized, with seven in critical condition. The Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok treated 71 passengers. The incident has renewed calls for strict adherence to safety protocols, emphasizing the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during a flight. ""It is a matter of life and death,"" said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.This event marked the first fatal incident involving Singapore Airlines in almost 25 years. The airline, recognized as one of the world's leading carriers, has a strong safety record, with its last major accident occurring in October 2000.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the US and Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau are investigating the incident. Preliminary findings suggest that climate change may be increasing the frequency and intensity of turbulence events. ""For clear-air turbulence, climate change is increasing the temperature difference across the jet stream between the cold poles and the warm tropics,"" explained Dr Paul Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading.As investigations continue, the aviation industry is urged to enhance real-time weather data sharing and improve safety protocols to better prepare for such unpredictable turbulence events.(With inputs from agencies)","Singapore Airlines Flight SQ321 was flying from London’s Heathrow airport to Singapore.

"Baltimore as US overdose capital: Almost 6,ooo dead in 6 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimore-as-us-overdose-capital-almost-6ooo-dead-in-6years/articleshow/110430718.cms,"BALTIMORE: Across the city, the death toll has mounted. Fatal drug overdoses have occurred on one-third of the city's blocks. Bodies have been found in motels and vacant houses, at parks and the football stadium, around the corner from City Hall and outside the health department. In one grim month alone, 114 people succumbed. People in Baltimore have been dying of overdoses at a rate never before seen in a major US city.In the past six years, nearly 6,000 lives have been lost. The death rate from 2018 to 2022 was nearly double that of any other large city in the US.A decade ago, 700 fewer people here were being killed by drugs each year. And when fatalities began to rise from the synthetic opioid fentanyl, so potent that even minuscule doses are deadly, Baltimore's initial response was hailed as a national model. The city set ambitious goals, distributed Narcan (an over-the-counter drug to treat overdose) widely, experimented with ways to steer people into treatment and ratcheted up campaigns to alert the public.But then city leaders became preoccupied with other crises, including gun violence and the pandemic, and many of those efforts to fight overdoses stalled, an examination by The New York Times and The Baltimore Banner has found.Those who lost lives include a cross-section of Baltimore: line cook, lawyer, bus driver, engineer, machinist, teacher, restaurant owner, carpenter, veteran, physician, salesperson and admissions coordinator for an addiction recovery center. There were retirees and the jobless.Some victims were heartbreakingly young: Since 2020, at least 13 children younger than 4 have died after being exposed to drugs, according to the reports. Black men in their 50s to 70s died at the highest rates. A few overdose deaths drew headlines, but most were invisible to the public.For nearly all of the past three decades, Baltimore has had one of the highest fatal overdose rates of any large US city. But for most of that period, the death rate was much closer to the national average than it is today.Beginning in 2006, pharmaceutical companies were inundating pharmacies across the country with addictive pain pills Some patients began selling their pills in Baltimore expanding the illegal drug market. The mayor wrote last week that the current fentanyl crisis had been triggered by the influx of pills from drugmakers and distributors. But the prescription pill epidemic was far less severe in Baltimore than elsewhere in the country. Oxycodone was the cause of relatively few deaths in the city, according to CDC and state data.The death rate remained relatively low until the mid-2010s, when fentanyl flooded illegal drug markets across the country. Dealers began spiking heroin with fentanyl, which is up to 50 times more potent and can be manufactured from cheap chemical compounds. They also began mixing fentanyl in cocaine, pressing it into fake prescription pills and selling it on its own. Drug-testing data shows that it is now all but impossible to buy illegal opioids in Maryland that have not been mixed with it and other dangerous additives like xylazine, which makes naloxone - the generic name for Narcan - less effective. These days, heroin is rarely found.Because fentanyl is combined with other substances, the distribution of the opioid's granules is uneven. One hit may be just enough to get high. The next could be deadly.","In the past six years, nearly 6,000 lives have been lost. The death rate from 2018 to 2022 was nearly double that of any other large city in the US.

The identity of the third person killed has not been released, as reported by Al Jazeera.The deaths are the latest in months of spiraling violence in Port-au-Prince, which remains largely under the control of powerful armed groups that have unleashed a wave of deadly attacks across the city.This incident comes after Kenyan President William Ruto visited President Joe Biden and other senior US leaders in the US to discuss a range of issues, including the long-stalled Haiti deployment .""The security situationin Haiti cannot wait,"" Al Jazeera quoted the National Security Council spokesperson as saying on Friday. He added that Biden had pledged to support the ""expedited deployment"" of the Kenya-led force in talks with Ruto on Thursday.""Our hearts go out to the families of those killed as they experience unimaginable grief,"" the spokesperson added, referring to the missionaries.The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have been calling for more support for the citizens of Haiti amid years of gang violence and political instability, which worsened after the 2021 killing of President Jovenel Moise.Haiti's unelected Prime Minister Ariel Henry had to step down after the most recent wave of unrest, which kicked off in February with gang attacks on police stations, prisons, and other state institutions, as reported by Al Jazeera.An interim presidential council has since been appointed to lead the country, but major concerns and uncertainty persist.The UN humanitarian coordinator in Haiti earlier this month warned that ""hundreds of thousands of people, including many women and children, are caught in violence, which shows little sign of abating"".According to the UN, over 3,60,000 Haitians were internally displaced across the country as of mid-March, and at least 1,500 people have been killed in gang violence since the beginning of the year.Several Haitian civil society leaders and citizens say the country's ""depleted and ill-equipped"" police force needs help to restore security, according to Al Jazeera.Kenya has committed 1,000 police officers to the UN-backed mission, which is being largely financed by the US and aims to counter the gangs. The deployment is set to eventually comprise up to 2,500 personnel.But it remains unclear when the mission will begin after officials had said it could be launched to coincide with Kenyan President Ruto's visit to the US.

"Four years after George Floyd killing, police reform slow to follow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/four-years-after-george-floyd-killing-police-reform-slow-to-follow/articleshow/110421607.cms,"George Floyd act stalled

'Not enough'

Stevante Clark felt a glimmer of hope when racial justice protests swept the globe in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd. His own brother, Stephon Clark, was killed by Sacramento police in March 2018 after they fired 20 shots at the young Black man in the backyard of his grandparents' home. Police said they feared he had a gun. But he was found to have been holding only a cellphone.The 22-year-old's death sparked protests and calls for reform. It also led to a new more stringent use-of-force law in California. Yet, no comprehensive change emerged on a national level.So, Clark thought Floyd's killing and those of several other Black Americans by police in 2020 would finally deliver the substantive criminal justice reform that he and others have sought for years.But while Floyd's death became a rally cry for racial equity and justice, four years later the journey toward comprehensive policing reform has been fraught with challenges. Momentum has waned and legislative efforts have stalled, leaving communities, advocates, and families who have lost loved ones frustrated by what they see as a shift away from police accountability.""You can't honor the life and legacy of George Floyd without passing comprehensive policy and legislative change to prevent George Floyds from happening,"" Clark told Reuters. ""I don't think the Biden administration has been aggressive enough when it comes to this crisis -- and this is not just a Black fight -- this is for everybody. People have become desensitized by police murder.""Despite the initial surge of calls for change, federal attempts at wide-ranging reform have been mostly unsuccessful.On Friday, President Joe Biden said, ""I will continue to urge Congress to send the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which ensures law enforcement accountability, to my desk.""A spokesperson for Republican Donald Trump's campaign told Reuters that Trump would take a hardline approach to immigration and violent crime, adding if he is reelected ""he will restore law and order.""The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act - which was initially introduced in 2021 to stop aggressive law enforcement tactics, misconduct and racial bias - has faced repeated roadblocks in Congress and has yet to move forward.Efforts to reach a bipartisan police reform deal failed in 2021, with Biden blaming Republicans for the failure. Among the issues lawmakers discussed were changes to ""qualified immunity"" laws that protects police officers from some excessive force lawsuits. Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee reintroduced the bill Thursday.Experts say while criminal justice reform efforts in part fueled the 2020 election cycle, policing is unlikely to be a top issue in the 2024 presidential election.""Other issues have come to the fore, especially with conflict in Israel and Palestine, with conflict in Ukraine, and the economy,"" said Jorge Camacho, policy director of the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School.But it still might be one reason Biden has weaker support among Black voters, Camacho said, adding that Black communities want to see action on policing.Recent polling data by a non-profit polling firm, African American Research Collaborative, shows that Black communities are now focusing more on economic issues, like the cost of living crisis and jobs.After Congress failed to pass the George Floyd legislation, Biden signed an executive order in May 2022 that in part created a new national police misconduct database, required federal law enforcement agencies to investigate the use of deadly force or deaths in custody and restricted federal agencies from using chokeholds and ""no knock"" entries.Still a day before the anniversary of Floyd's death, veteran civil rights advocate Rev. Al Sharpton, called on Congress to pass the bill.""The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act fulfills a promise we made four years ago to his and every family of a Black man or woman killed by law enforcement,"" he said, adding it would fulfill what ""we have spent decades marching, protesting, and advocating for.""One of the largest changes that the Biden administration has done in terms of police reform, said Rashawn Ray, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was to rescind a Trump-era policy that curtailed the use of consent decrees to address police violence. Nina Patel, Senior Policy Council at the American Civil Liberties Union, said ""there have been accomplishments on policing accountability, but they have been far less influential than what we would have liked.""She added that policies in states like Louisiana, Arizona and Georgia are making it harder to film police, even though bystander footage often brings cases of brutality to light.""Our position is that reform is not enough,"" said Cicley Gay, Board Chairwoman of Black Lives Matter , adding that incremental reform is insufficient. ""We hear firsthand from many families about not only what they experienced, but the lack of progress and in making policy change.""The Movement for Black Lives, a national network of more than 150 leaders and organizations, is now pushing The People's Response Act, which was introduced by Congresswoman Cori Bush last year.The bill focuses on state and local funding for ""inclusive, holistic, and health-centered approach"" to public safety and would create alternatives to police intervention through the Department of Health and Human Services.The bill is likely to receive significant resistance from Republicans and centrist Democrats, experts say. However, advocates said they will continue to press forward.The ""uprisings around the world were sparked by such a tragic incident that was part of a pattern of instances of police killings, police violence, that our communities have been calling attention to and trying to fight against for such a long time,"" said Amara Enyia, Director for Policy and Research at the Movement for Black Lives.""The arc of our work is not just for us, this is part of a bigger work of justice to which there isn't an end date.""","The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was initially introduced in 2021 to stop aggressive law enforcement tactics, misconduct and racial bias. The bill has faced repeated roadblocks in Congress and has yet to move forward.

Despite being stored in a freezer for a month and a half, the meat was inadvertently served rare due to its darker color. After noticing the meat was undercooked, it was recooked and served again, CBS News reported.Nine family members, mainly from Minnesota but also from South Dakota and Arizona, partook in the meal, with some only consuming the accompanying vegetables. The man was diagnosed with trichinellosis , a rare roundworm infection typically contracted through the consumption of wild game . Five other family members, including a 12-year-old girl and two who only ate the vegetables, were also diagnosed with the freeze-resistant worms. Three were hospitalized and treated with albendazole.The CDC emphasised the importance of cooking wild game meat thoroughly to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees F to kill trichinella parasites and prevent cross-contamination.

Boeing to launch starliner with crew without repairing gas leak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeing-to-launch-starliner-with-crew-despite-helium-leak/articleshow/110420564.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Boeing is planning to launch its first crewed space mission in June without repairing a minor helium gas leak on its Starliner spacecraft , officials announced on Friday.The Starliner, in development since 2010, has faced numerous technical issues and is yet to fulfill its intended role of transporting astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). In the meantime, Boeing's competitor, SpaceX, has advanced with its Crew Dragon capsule.The Starliner was scheduled to take astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the ISS on May 6. However, the mission was postponed just hours before launch due to a faulty valve on the United Launch Alliance rocket.Subsequent inspections revealed additional issues, including a helium leak in the spacecraft's service module, which contains the propulsion system. While the rocket valve has been replaced, Boeing and Nasa have decided to proceed with the ISS mission without fixing a small seal on a leaking joint.Steve Stich, manager of Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said that the leak is manageable even if the leak rate increases significantly. The issue affects one of 28 thrusters used to control the spacecraft's attitude. The team plans to monitor the leak closely in the hours leading up to the launch, set for June 1 at 12:25 pm from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.Mark Nappi, Boeing's vice president for the commercial crew program, explained that replacing the seal would be complex and require dismantling the Starliner at its factory. Stich noted that it is not unusual to fly with minor leaks, citing similar instances with space shuttles and SpaceX's Dragon.This mission is critical for Boeing as the company faces challenges within its commercial aviation division. Nasa aims to certify a second commercial vehicle for crew transport to the ISS, a goal set since the last space shuttle mission in 2011. A successful Starliner mission could help overcome the program's past setbacks.In 2019, a software defect during an uncrewed test flight prevented the capsule from reaching the ISS. A second software issue could have caused a catastrophic collision but was corrected in time. In 2021, blocked valves forced another postponement while the rocket was on the launchpad.The Starliner finally reached the ISS in May 2022 during a non-crewed launch. However, other issues, including weak parachutes and flammable tape in the cabin, have caused further delays to the crewed test flight.",Boeing is planning to launch its first crewed space mission in June without repairing a minor helium gas leak on its Starliner spacecraft.

Among the talks he is planning there is one with his Chinese counterpart Adm. Dong Jun, the defence department said. The encounter would be part of an effort to patch up ties that have deteriorated over Beijing's aggressive policies toward Taiwan and its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea.US relations with Cambodia have been frosty for years, in large part because of Phnom Penh’s close ties with China. Washington has also been vocal about what it sees as Cambodia’s poor human rights record, which has seen continuing clampdowns on political dissidents and critics.Cambodia is Beijing’s closest ally in Southeast Asia, and Washington is particularly concerned that a naval base in southern Cambodia on the Gulf of Thailand has been upgraded with Chinese assistance to serve as a strategic outpost for China’s navy.Cambodian officials deny China will have any special basing privileges and say their country maintains a neutral defence posture.The defence department statement said that Austin will meet with senior officials in Cambodia on his first visit there since attending a gathering of Asian defence ministers in November 2022.“We are now working with the US Embassy in Phnom Penh to arrange his meetings with the Cambodian leaders,” Cambodian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Chum Sounry said Saturday in response to a query from The Associated Press. “The visit will be another important step to advance the Cambodia-US relations.”It will also be Austin’s first visit to Cambodia since Hun Manet became prime minister last year, succeeding his father Hun Sen, who held office for 38 years. The handover has led to speculation of a reset in US-Cambodian relations, though so far Hun Manet has maintained his father’s policies.Hun Manet was Cambodia’s army commander before becoming prime minister last August. Both Austin and he graduated from the US Military Academy at West Point — Austin in 1975 and Hun Manet in 1999, as Cambodia's first cadet there.From Cambodia, Austin will go to France to attend events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the World War II D-Day landing, the defence department said.On Friday, Austin underwent a medical procedure at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington, resuming his duty after temporarily transferring power to his deputy, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement.Austin is continuing to deal with bladder issues that arose in December following his treatment for prostate cancer, Ryder said.","US relations with Cambodia have been frosty for years, in large part because of Phnom Penh’s close ties with China.

Pakistan's general elections on February 8 2024, showed the utter failure of their design.""With no single electoral symbol in a country where the vast majority of voters are guided by a party symbol, the people came out and voted overwhelmingly for candidates supported by my party, the PTI, despite standing as 'independents' with a host of diverse symbols,"" he wrote.Khan further said this democratic revenge by the people of Pakistan against the agenda of the military establishment not only was a national defiance by the people but also a complete rejection of the official state narrative of May 9 2023, when PTI supporters were falsely accused - as a pretext for a crackdown - of attacking military installations.""Instead of accepting the people's mandate, the military establishment went into a fit of rage and electoral results were manipulated to bring into power the losers. The constitutional functioning of state institutions must be restored, the military establishment has done all they could against me. All that is left for them is to now murder me.""I have stated publicly that if anything happens to me or my wife, Gen Asim Munir will be responsible. But I am not afraid because my faith is strong. I would prefer death over slavery,"" Khan wrote.",The Punjab government has approved the registration of more cases against Imran Khan. The 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician has been in jail since August last year. The minister said Khan is trying to become Mujeebur Rehman (of Bangladesh),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110422000,imgsize-24226,width-400,resizemode-4/110422000.jpg"

It has always helped Pakistan in difficult times for which the entire nation, including me, is grateful to the Chinese leadership and the people,"" he said.He assured the Chinese firms that the security and protection of Chinese workers and citizens was the top priority of the government.Thousands of Chinese personnel are working in Pakistan on several projects being carried out under the aegis of the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

It is very difficult to tell these stories of victims of forced disappearances,"" she said.While sharing her own experience of suffering at the hands of the Pakistani administration Baloch said, ""I myself am a victim. My own father was disappeared by agents of Pakistani state in 2009. He was killed and his bullet-ridden body was found in 2011. When I was at 10th standard that was the day when my result was announced. That day, I found the body of my father, my younger brother disappeared when I was doing my graduation in medicine in 2017.""She highlighted that she campaigned and launched rallies for him in Balochistan, adding that after three months he was released.""But my case is not exceptional.

I have been campaigning and pressing the Pakistan Supreme Court , Parliament and security forces to release those who have disappeared or at least present them before a court if they have committed any crime,"" she said.Baloch added that the Pakistani authorities instead of addressing these issues, have resorted to violence.She also mentioned the long march which failed due to the ignorance and ill-treatment of the Pakistani administration.""I marched more than 1600 km in December for over a month and arrived in Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan on a cold evening with children and women.

Scams were sent just outside the National Press Club of Islamabad. And there was no coverage of this peaceful movement. We have been sitting there for more than one month,"" she said.Baloch further expressed hope and said that they are hopeful because those who are behind this violence and those who are using violence, are less in number.""Maybe they have the power to rule us.

NEW DELHI: Coming down heavily on a Pakistani lawmaker for his comments on Lok Sabha elections , Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday responded strongly and said that India was fully capable of solving its own problems and that the Pakistani leader's tweet of support was not needed.The former Pakistan minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain shared Arvind Kejriwal's post on X on voting with his family, and said, “May peace and harmony defeat forces of hate and extremism”, with the hashtags ""MorePower"" and ""IndiaElection2024"".Minutes after Hussain's post, Kejriwal hit back at him, saying his post was unnecessary.“Chaudhary Sahib, I and the people of my country are fully capable of handling our issues. Your tweet is not needed. The situation in Pakistan is very bad right now. You take care of your country,” Kejriwal said on X.In another post, the chief minister said the elections are India's internal matter and the country will ""not tolerate interference by the biggest sponsors of terrorism"".Responding to Kejriwal's posts, Hussain said, ""CM sb! Indeed electioneering is your own issue but hope you will appreciate extremism be it in Pakistan or India is a borderless phenomenon and dangerous for everyone be it BD (Bangladesh), India or Pak so everyone with some conscience must be concerned... (sic).""""The situation in Pakistan is very far from ideal but individuals must strive for a better society wherever they are,"" he said.Earlier in the day, posting a picture of his family after exercising his franchise, the Delhi chief minister wrote, “I voted today with my father, wife and children.

You too must go and vote.”Hitting out at Kejriwal, the BJP alleged that Pakistan has also jumped in support of the AAP leader's politics of corruption.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said his party has been saying that ""Kejriwal is hand in glove with the country's enemies"".""Chaudhry Fawad Hussain is speaking now. He had also written a social media post on Kejriwal's release. Five phases of elections have already been conducted but no remarks were made, when polls are now being held in Delhi, the statement from Pakistan has come. This shows Kejriwal has the backing of Pakistan,"" Sachdeva told reporters.Notably, this is not the first time the Pakistani minister Fawad Chaudhry has come out in support of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Chaudhry had also supported Kejriwal after he received bail in the money laundering case linked to alleged liquor excise policy.On May 1, Chaudhry - infamous for boasting about Pakistan's hand in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack - had posted on X excerpts from a speech by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi with the caption ""Rahul on fire"". This drew sharp criticism from BJP leaders.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also slammed Gandhi and the Congress, saying Pakistan is desperate to make Gandhi the next prime minister.Eight states and Union territories are voting today in the penultimate phase of the Lok Sabha polls.

The IMF mission, however, stated it would decide on whether or not to give Pakistan a bailout after approval of the country’s budget by parliament.Media reports suggest the IMF visit’s purpose was to gauge Pakistan’s budget preparations and see whether its next fiscal year economic framework was in line with the overall objectives of ensuring fiscal and external sector sustainability.Official sources said the global lender gave Pakistani authorities a very hard time on energy, monetary and taxation policies. Implementation of all IMF conditions, experts believe,would put an extraordinary burden on the people, and some conditions carry implications for bilateral relations as well.“Based on the preliminary findings of this mission, staff will prepare a report that,subject to management approval, will be presented to IMF’s executive board for discussion and decision,” said Nathan Porter, the IMF mission’s chief, ahead of leaving Islamabad.Porter said Pakistan would have to continue progress towards low and stable inflation by appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies; improve public service provision through state-owned enterprise (SOE) restructuring and privatisation; and promote private sector development by securing a level-playing field for investment and stronger governance.The IMF mission had quietly landed in Pakistan on May 10 and held meetings with Pakistani authorities and other key stakeholders, including US ambassador to Pakistan Donald Blome.Pakistan’s incumbent govt is struggling to maintain economic stability amid rising political temperatures.

NEW DELHI: Hospitals across Pakistan treated hundreds of heatstroke victims as an intense heatwave pushed temperatures above normal levels. Officials attribute the rising temperatures to climate change.Temperatures reached up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mohenjo Daro on Wednesday. The city, located in southern Sindh province, was severely impacted by climate-induced monsoon rains and floods in 2022. The heatwave is expected to persist for at least a week.Authorities have advised people to stay indoors, stay hydrated, and avoid unnecessary travel. However, many laborers say they must continue working to support their families.""Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to the impact of climate change. We have witnessed above normal rains, floods,"" said Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister’s coordinator on climate, during a news conference in Islamabad.Barakullah Khan, a civil defense official, advised people not to leave cooking gas cylinders in open areas and warned those living near fields about the risk of snakes and scorpions entering homes and storage spaces in search of cooler areas.Weather forecasters predicted that temperatures may rise to 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) this month.Hospitals in the eastern city of Lahore and in the districts of Hyderabad, Larkana, and Jacobabad in Sindh province have reported treating scores of heatstroke patients.""The situation has been getting worse since yesterday, when people affected by heat started coming to hospitals in the Punjab province,"" said Ghulam Farid, a senior health official. Emergency response centers have been established at hospitals to treat heat-affected patients.The state-run ambulance service is now equipped with bottled water and ice to provide emergency treatment to heat victims.The United Nations children’s agency has called for measures to protect children from the heat. Sanjay Wijesekera, Unicef regional director for South Asia, warned that rising temperatures could put millions of children’s health at risk if they are not protected and hydrated.Heatstroke is a serious illness that occurs when body temperature rises too quickly, potentially causing unconsciousness, disability, or death.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual monthly rainfall. Last month’s heavy rains caused fatalities and extensive damage to property and farmland.Daytime temperatures have soared as much as 8 degrees Celsius (46 degrees Fahrenheit) above the average May temperatures over the past 20 years, raising concerns about flooding in the northwest due to glacial melting.The 2022 floods caused significant damage in Sindh and Baluchistan provinces, resulting in 1,739 deaths nationwide.The heatwave is also affecting Pakistan's southwest and northwest regions. Schools in Punjab have been closed for a week.On Thursday, Save the Children announced that more than half of Pakistan’s school-age children, approximately 26 million, will miss a week of school due to the heatwave. The closure of schools in Punjab means 52% of the country’s students will be out of school.In Lahore, residents have been seen swimming in roadside canals to cool off.

Pakistan: Gang 'involved' in child abuse apprehended in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-gang-involved-in-child-abuse-apprehended-in-karachi/articleshow/110359022.cms,"KARACHI: In a significant development, Police in Karachi 's Orangi Town have dismantled a gang allegedly engaged in the sexual abuse of children, rescuing three minors in the process, according to Pakistan media outlet ARY News.The Superintendent of Police (SP) for Orangi Town revealed that three members of the gang have been apprehended, with an equal number of children recovered by law enforcement.According to the SP, the modus operandi of the gang involved enticing children with sums ranging from PKR 200 to PKR 300 before subjecting them to sexual exploitation . Additionally, the suspects were purportedly engaged in filming the abuse and circulating the videos within the vicinity, as reported by ARY News.The investigation into the matter was initiated following the disappearance of a child on May 11. Subsequent interrogations led to the unraveling of the gang's illicit activities.One of the suspects, identified as Nisar, reportedly enticed children from gaming zones and transported them to the gang's hideout. There, the minors were allegedly subjected to sexual abuse and also trafficked to others.It was disclosed by the police that the gang predominantly targeted children aged between 12 to 14 years.Law enforcement authorities further elaborated that the suspects employed a strategy of wearing a helmet associated with an online motorcycle service to evade detection while transporting the children from one location to another, ARY News reported.Data collected by Sahil, an NGO dedicated to addressing child sexual abuse, reveals a disturbing trend: the majority of abusers are individuals known to the victims, such as acquaintances, neighbours, or even family members.Shockingly, religious teachers and clerics emerge as the primary perpetrators within institutional settings, surpassing even police officers, school teachers, or nuclear family members in the number of complaints filed against them, according to Dawn.Primary data remains limited and organisations rely on media reports and police complaints but the trend over the past 20 years shows the gender divide of abused girls in madrassas is slightly higher than that of boys ('Cruel Numbers').","Police in Karachi have dismantled a gang allegedly engaged in the sexual abuse of children.
