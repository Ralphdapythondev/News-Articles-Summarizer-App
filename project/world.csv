Green Party's losses at EU vote to hit climate goals?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/green-partys-losses-at-eu-vote-to-hit-climate-goals/articleshow/110978707.cms,"Loss of Green Party in European Parliament elections may be bad news for EU countries' new climate ambition at a time when Russia-Ukraine war has already dragged it down, although it is not expected to make a major dent in long-term goals. The impact of the setback to the Greens may be felt when the EU's 27 members assemble to take a call on a new global climate finance goal as a part of a larger group of developed countries at the 29th session of the UN climate summit (CO) in Baku, Azerbaijan in Nov.

Even if a tectonic shift in overall plan does not take place, the pressure is already being felt during the ongoing negotiations at the UN conference in Bonn where the countries are trying to arrive at broad contours of new global climate finance before it takes final shape in Baku. Climate finance is meant for helping developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change.

Over the last few years, the EU has cleared a package to curb emissions and taken a series of measures - seen as trade barriers by several developing nations, including India - which may be tough to undo, but their implementation may be weaker if the support for the Greens remain feeble.

It is unlikely that the results will spell an end to ""climate-progressive"" Europe. Experts insisted that EU's commitments on climate diplomacy may not be diluted. ""The EU both can - and has to - continue to act as a positive force in climate diplomacy globally. With much work remaining, Europe shall remain serious about fulfilling its climate commitments,"" said Dan Jorgensen, minister for global climate policy, Denmark. Interestingly, the Greens have either held or gained seats in Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands despite a poor performance overall. They had major setbacks in France and Germany - the two major EU economies that have been quite proactive on climate actions.

"Why Russia, China and the Big Tech use faux females to get clicks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-russia-china-and-the-big-tech-use-faux-females-to-get-clicks/articleshow/110978713.cms,"Washington: When disinformation researcher Wen-Ping Liu looked into China's efforts to influence Taiwan's recent election using fake social media accounts, something unusual stood out about the most successful profiles. They were female, or at least that's what they appeared to be. Fake profiles that claimed to be women got more engagement, more eyeballs and more influence than supposedly male accounts. ""Pretending to be a female is the easiest way to get credibility,"" said Liu, an investigator with Taiwan's ministry of justice.

Whether it's Chinese or Russian propaganda agencies, online scammers or AI chatbots , it pays to be female - proving that while technology may grow more and more sophisticated, the human brain remains surprisingly easy to hack thanks in part to age-old gender stereotypes that have migrated from the real world to the virtual. ""You want to inject some emotion and warmth and a very easy way to do that is to pick a woman's face and voice,"" said Sylvie Borau, an online researcher in Toulouse, France, whose work has found that internet users prefer ""female"" bots and see them as more human than ""male"" versions. People tend to see women as warmer, less threatening and more agreeable than men, Borau said. Men, meanwhile, are often perceived to be hostile. Because of this many people may be, consciously or unconsciously, more willing to engage with a fake account that poses as female.

When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was searching for a new voice for the ChatGPT AI programme, he approached Scarlett Johansson, who said Altman told her that users would find her voice - which served as the eponymous voice assistant in the movie ""Her"" - ""comforting"". Johansson declined Altman's request and threatened to sue when the company went with what she called an ""eerily similar"" voice. OpenAI put the new voice on hold.

Feminine profile pictures, particularly ones showing women with flawless skin, lush lips and wide eyes in revealing outfits, can be another online lure for many men. Female social media profiles receive on average more than three times the views compared to those of males, according to an analysis of over 40,000 profiles. Female profiles that claim to be younger get the most views, it found.

A report from the UN suggested there's an even more obvious reason why so many fake accounts and chatbots are female: they were created by men. It said greater diversity in programming and AI development could lead to fewer sexist stereotypes embedded in their products.

The agreement, signed on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy, is meant to be a step towards Ukraine's eventual Nato membership, according to the text of the deal. ""The parties recognise this agreement as supporting a bridge to Ukraine's eventual membership in the Nato alliance,"" the text says.

Zelenskyy has long sought Nato membership but the allies have stopped short of taking that step. The Western alliance regards any attack launched on one of its 32 members as an attack on all under its Article Five clause. In the event of an armed attack or threat of such against Ukraine, top US and Ukrainian officials will meet within 24 hours to consult on a response and determine what additional defence needs are required for Ukraine, the agreement says.

Under the agreement, the US restates its support for Ukraine's defence of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, amid a renewed push by Russia on Ukraine's eastern front.

""To ensure Ukraine's security, both sides recognise Ukraine needs a significant military force, robust capabilities, and sustained investments in its defense industrial base that are consistent with Nato standards,"" the text says. ""The US intends to provide long-term materiel, training and advising, sustainment, intelligence, security, defense industrial, institutional, and other support to develop Ukrainian security and defense forces that are capable of defending a sovereign, independent, democratic Ukraine and deterring future aggression,"" it says. reuters

Russia: Detained US reporter will stand trial over 'CIA work',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-detained-us-reporter-will-stand-trial-over-cia-work/articleshow/110978503.cms,"Russian prosecutors said Thursday they had sent the case of detained US reporter Evan Gershkovich to court after concluding he had been collecting information for the US Central Intelligence Agency about a Russian tank factory. Gershkovich, 32, was arrested on March 29, 2023, in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on charges of espionage that carry up to 20 years in prison after the FSB, the main successor agency to the KGB, said it had caught him ""red-handed"" trying to obtain military secrets.

Gershkovich and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have flatly denied the charges and the newspaper has repeatedly called for his immediate release. The White House has called the charges ""ridiculous"", with Prez Biden calling the detention ""totally illegal"".

The office of Russia 's General Prosecutor said in a statement it had approved Gershkovich's criminal indictment and that his case would be heard by a court in Yekaterinburg, where he was originally arrested. It did not say when the case would be heard or whether the trial would be closed to the public as is common in such cases.

""The investigation has established and confirmed with documentary evidence that Gershkovich, on the instructions of the CIA , collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region in March 2023 about the activities of the defence plant NPK Uralvagonzavod JSC on the production and repair of military equipment,"" the prosecutors' statement said. Prosecutors did not release any documentary evidence to back the charge.

Gershkovich, the first US journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War, is currently being held in pre-trial detention in Moscow and has been the subject of so far fruitless prisoner exchange talks between Moscow and Washington.

The Uralvagonzavod factory, which has been sanctioned by the West, is based in the city of Nizhny Tagil in Russia's Sverdlovsk region and, according to the Russian defence ministry, plays a crucial role in supplying tanks for Moscow's war in Ukraine.

Living the Indian and American Dream



A New Migrant Song

Cricket in USA



techie got the USA off to a dream start. He added the cherry on the cake by also dismissing his former Mumbai senior and current India captain Rohit Sharma.These lines from The New Colossus, the 1883 poem by Emma Lazarus, are etched in bronze on the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal and stand as a promise of the American Dream at the heart of the message for any immigrant coming to the US.One of those stories that took a roundabout route involved Santiago Munez, the fictional protagonist of Goal: The Dream Begins (2005), an illegal immigrant from Los Angeles who travels to the Premier League and becomes a big-time ball player with Newcastle United. The tale of an illegal American immigrant from Los Angeles crossing the oceans to become a big-game ball player was a little different from the one promised by the words etched on the Statue of Liberty, but 19 years later, Saurabh Netravalkar, not an illegal immigrant per se, seems to be living the same dream but with whipped cream on top.Netravalkar is living both the American dream (becoming a professionally successful migrant in the Shining City on the Top of the Hill) and the Indian dream (beating Pakistan in a crunch match) at the same time. Next up he faces off against the nation he represented as a youngster, against team members with whom he has shared the dressing room.Netravalkar’s story is remarkably amazing.As a profile in The New York Times put it: “Such is the fine balance America’s newest — and perhaps most unlikely — sporting hero has had to strike to keep his cricket dreams alive that software engineer Saurabh Netravalkar has even been known to spend the lunch interval during club matches hunched over his work laptop, either coding or in a meeting with colleagues via video call. At last, however, all those hours spent juggling the demands of a full-time job with tech giant Oracle while simultaneously playing professional sports have finally paid off.”When he’s not bowling at Pakistan with the fury of an engineer asked to do a task without a valid JIRA ticket, Netravalkar’s day job is as a Principal Engineer at Oracle. And, as if being an international-level cricketer and a coder par excellence wasn’t enough to brag about, Netravalkar is also a talented Ukulele player and married to Devi Snighda Upalla, who also happens to be a Principal Oracle Engineer and a talented Kathak dancer whose Bolly X Fitness program is quite the rage. It would appear that talent and luck are not democratically allocated when it’s being handed out either by a higher being or evolution.Netravalkar’s meteoric rise as an Indian-American migrant comes at a time when folks of Indian origin can be found on both sides of the political spectrum as well as the upper echelons of American society with the exception of sports. It’s fair to say that of all immigrant groups – turning up on American shores for a better life – none have made their mark on America much like Indian-Americans. They are the highest-earning minority group. In politics, the so-called Samosa Caucus – a term to describe a modest number of Indian-Americans in Congress – has exploded on both sides of politics. On the Republican side, you’ve Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, whilein the Democrats setup includes the vice-president Kamala Harris and several others serving in the House of Representatives. In business, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella are the headliners among 21 billion-dollar companies that are led by Indian Americans. Even among Nobel Laureates, you have the likes of Amartya Sen, Abhijit Banerjee, and Venki Ramakrishnan but none of them appear to have ticked more than one box like Netravalkar.As one Instagram user put it: “Bro casually sings, works as an engineer full time, and owns Pakistan for a hobby.”So, how did Saurabh Netravalkar become the poster child of the Indian and American dream? It all started in the greatest cricketing city on the planet: Mumbai.The abode of many cricketing legends including Sachin Tendulkar , Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri, and current India captain Rohit Sharma, many youngsters grow up in the city with the hope of playing for India.Mumbai has won the most Ranji trophies with 42 wins in 88 seasons. The wide gulf in class is evident from the fact that the number 2 spot is held by Karnataka who have won the domestic tournament 8 times. But Mumbai’s success can also be a hindrance and it’s perhaps the hardest team to break into for any player. Even Sachin Tendulkar’s son Arjun – a nifty fast bowler – had to switch allegiances to Goa to get regular game time.But the odds didn’t appear to deter Netravalkar who came into the limelight in 2009 when he rattled Yuvraj Singh’s stump at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru. Yuvraj by then had already become part of Indian cricketing folklore after his stupendous India debut in the 2000 ICC Knock Out Trophy when he scored 84 unbeaten in 80 balls against an Aussie pace attack consisting of Bret Lee, Glen McGrath, and Jason Gillespie.Fortune seemed to be smiling on Netravalkar when he was called up for the BCCI Corporate Trophy where he shared the dressing room with the likes of Yuvraj Singh, Robin Uthappa, and Suresh Raina, while the opposing camp had Messrs Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. He also had a superlative 2010 U-19 Cricket World Cup, where he was the leading wicket-taker for India. However, breaking into the senior setup proved more difficult. At that time, the Mumbai squad was teeming with pacers like Ajit Agarkar, Zaheer Khan, and others.Taking a call to give his cricket career a boost, he missed a full semester to focus on the game. Netravalkar made his Ranji debut in 2013 but being in and out of the team meant he bid adieu to the game he loved and took the more practical route of going back to his studies.Fate appeared to have shut the cricket door forever when Cornell University in New York in 2015 offered him a scholarship after being impressed with his player analysis app called CricDecode (If you search, you can still find the app’s code on the developer platform GitHub).After he graduated from Cornell, he was offered a job by Oracle in San Francisco and having left his cricket kit back home, started playing recreationally on weekends to fit in.Fate intervened when the ICC changed its rules – from four years to three years – for residents to represent their adopted nations. An H1B card holder, Netravalkar broke into the US squad in 2018 and even captained the team for three years.Like all cricket-crazy fans in India, Netrvalkar and his father Naresh watched many matches together in the 1990s and 2000s. His favorite bowlers were Wasim Akram, Chaminda Vaas, and Zaheer Khan. Perhaps those fantasies would have remained a dream had it not been for the US co-hosting the T20 Cricket World Cup as Netravalkar showed that he had what it takes to face off against the big boys. Incidentally, in 2010, in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup, Netravalkar faced heartbreak when Team India lost to the Pakistan team that had a young Babar Azam.On June 12, Netravalkar will face off against players he knows from a lifetime ago, whose exploits he might have followed on the news or social media.While Virat Kohli was in the opposing camp in the BCCI Corporate Championship, current captain Rohit Sharma was a senior in the Mumbai squad. Meanwhile, Surya Kumar Yadav, a batsman who has redefined T20 cricket with his avant-garde batting style was a contemporary in the Mumbai dressing room.Opposing coach Rahul Dravid, who watched him bowl the Super Over against Pakistan, is also someone he bowled to at the National Cricket Academy many years ago.In fact, there’s an almost epochal tinge to Netravalkar’s exponential rise in the first T20 tournament held in the land that Columbus thought he had discovered, and the one he actually discovered as Columbus as the USA faces off against the land that Columbus hoped to discover. That at the heart of the story would be a young man from Mumbai in US colours makes this an even greater tale.In the vintage video game Cricket ’97, the sagacious Richie Benaud had a line that went: “You know not much is wrong with the world when you can hear the sound of leather hitting the willow.” For a long time, the United States was one nation where the sound of willow and leather hitting was missing (unless one counts baseball) but all that looks set to change after this World Cup. Americans, not just the diaspora, appear to have fully embraced the sport and amid the heart of that has been an Oracle engineer simultaneously living the American and Indian dream. There are engineers who play cricket and cricketers who are engineers, but there's hardly anyone who is so proficient at both.In fact, there’s a video on his Instagram where Netravalkar, while watching the India vs Pakistan game says in chaste Marathi that would make even South Bombay residents stop in their tracks: “Definitely come on June 12 to support us on the ground.” Many fans – irrespective of their nationality or giving a fig about the Tebbit Test - would be forgiven if, for a small moment, they decide to back the young lad from Mumbai in US colours who dared to dream as he bowls against the likes of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.","Saurabh Netravalkar is a software engineer at tech giant Oracle.

"UK's Sunak, Starmer face televised grilling by unhappy voters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uks-sunak-starmer-face-televised-grilling-by-unhappy-voters/articleshow/110954422.cms,"Sunak booed

LONDON: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer were grilled by voters at a televised event on Wednesday, with both challenged over past decisions, pledges and how they would fund policies if they won a July 4 election.At their latest meeting in television studios before the poll, the two men took turns to face an interviewer and then an audience, whose questions and responses underscored the everyday struggles of many in Britain and the mistrust of politicians.With just over three weeks until an election opinion polls suggest Labour will easily win, Sunak was booed and heckled over doctors' strikes, migration and his policy to introduce national service for young people.Starmer was taken to task for what one audience member said was his avoidance of answering questions, and over his previous support of his predecessor, left-wing veteran Jeremy Corbyn.A poll taken after the event in the northern English town of Grimsby said 64% believed Starmer had won the event on Sky News.Starmer told the audience that he would start implementing his policies from 'day one' if he won the election but shied away from answering whether he was being honest when in 2019 he said his left-wing predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, should become prime minister.""I want to get the place when I can roll up my sleeves and work with you ... to say the government is on your side,"" Starmer said to applause. ""That will be a massive difference to the last 14 years.""Sunak was challenged over some of his policies, which audience members said had yet to solve their inability to get dentist appointments, reduce waiting lists in the National Health Service or stop the arrival of migrants in small boats.""I know we've been through a tough time, of course we have... its been tough for all of you here tonight, all of you watching, but I do believe we have turned a corner and we've got a clear plan for the future,"" he said.""I am going to keep fighting hard until the last day of this election.""The event came a day after Sunak unveiled 17 billion pounds of tax cuts in his governing party's manifesto, trying to convince voters' that he had a plan to make them better off while Labour's policies are vague and ill-thought through.He said again on Wednesday that a vote for Starmer was akin to writing him a blank cheque, repeating the contested accusation that a Labour government would increase taxes by more than 2,000 pounds. Starmer denied that was the case.On Thursday, Labour will be try to set the story straight with its own manifesto, a document which sets out the policies the party will pursue in government, an agenda Starmer said would put wealth creation and economic growth at its heart.Labour has repeatedly said it will stick to strict spending rules - a line Labour, traditionally seen as the party of tax and spend, has adopted not only to try to show it has changed since being led by Corbyn but also to challenge Conservative attacks that it will increase taxes.But it was Corbyn who came back to haunt Starmer on Wednesday, when he was asked whether he believed what he said when in 2019 he said the veteran leftist would make a good prime minister and when he made 10 left-wing pledges to become Labour leader a year later, several of which he has since dropped.""Have I changed my position on those pledges, yes I have,"" said Starmer. ""I think this party should always put the country first.""","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer grilled by voters.

US Supreme Court unanimously rejects bid to restrict abortion pill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-unanimously-rejects-bid-to-restrict-abortion-pill/articleshow/110978233.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a bid to restrict an abortion pill widely used in the United States to terminate pregnancies.The court, in a unanimous opinion, said the anti-abortion groups and physicians challenging the medication, mifepristone , lacked the legal standing to bring the case.Abortion rights are one of the key issues in the Nov polls and the administration of Democratic Prez Joe Biden had urged the court to maintain access to the drug, which was approved by FDA in 2000. His opponent Donald Trump leads a Republican Party broadly favouring blocks to abortion access.The mifepristone case was the first significant abortion case heard by the conservative-dominated Supreme Court since it overturned the previously long-held constitutional right to abortion two years ago. ""We recognise that many citizens, including the plaintiff doctors here, have sincere concerns about and objections to others using mifepristone and obtaining abortions,"" said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the 9-0 opinion. ""But citizens and doctors do not have standing to sue simply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities,"" Kavanaugh said.The conservative justice said the federal courts were ""the wrong forum for addressing the plaintiffs' concerns about FDA's actions"" and they could present their objections through regulatory procedures or through the ""political and electoral processes"". Abortion opponents have been seeking to restrict nationwide access to the pill, claiming it is unsafe and that anti-abortion doctors were being forced to violate their conscience by intervening on patients who suffered complications after using it.Medication abortion accounted for 63% of the abortions in the country last year, up from 53% in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute.Some 20 states have banned or restricted abortion since the SC in June 2022 overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion for half a century.

President Joe Biden faces first lawsuit: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/president-joe-biden-faces-first-lawsuit-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/110968028.cms,"Here's all you need to know about the lawsuit:

The lawsuit has been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES).

and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES). Filed against Biden administration's order that came into effect on June 5, it restricts the asylum processing to 2500 per day. The imposed limitations will remain in place until the daily encounter figures, averaged over seven days, reach or fall below 1,500. However, it remains uncertain when this threshold will be met; the last instance occurred in July 2020 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.

According to the advocates, the order is ""legally indistinguishable"" from an order passed by Trump administration. “By enacting an asylum ban that is legally indistinguishable from the Trump ban we successfully blocked, we were left with no choice but to file this lawsuit, attorney Lee Gelernt said.

Biden has employed the same legal provision utilized by the Trump administration for its asylum prohibition, which falls within Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This provision grants the president the authority to restrict entry for specific migrants if their arrival is judged to be ""detrimental"" to national interests.

White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández justified Biden's directive. Fernández said in a statement that it became essential after bipartisan negotiations were obstructed by congressional Republicans. These negotiations aimed to secure vital resources, statutory adjustments, and additional personnel for border management.

NEW DELHI: In a first, a lawsuit was filed against the US administration on Wednesday over an order issued by President Joe Biden last week limiting the asylum processing claims to 2,500 per day on the southern border.The advocates have argued that the order is similar to the one enacted during Trump administration . However, it was later blocked by the courts.The directive became effective on June 5, with officials from the Biden administration anticipating unprecedented deportation rates of 4,000 daily.","The lawsuit has been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. Filed against Biden administration's order that came into effect on June 5, restricts the asylum processing to 2500 per day.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110968036,imgsize-36586,width-400,resizemode-4/110968036.jpg"
"Indian-origin man shoots brother dead, injures mother",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-man-shoots-brother-dead-injures-mother/articleshow/110964002.cms,"NEW DELHI: An Indian-origin man has allegedly shot and killed his brother while also injuring his mother in New York, according to officials on Wednesday.

The incident occurred on Sunday in the Richmond Hill area of New York, where approximately 26 per cent of the population is of Indian or Caribbean origin, as stated by the official.

The suspect has been named as Karamjit Multani (33), while the deceased victim, his brother, was identified as Vipanpal (27). The injured mother (52), who was shot in the stomach, has not yet been named.

According to the police, after fatally shooting his brother, Karamjit Multani turned the gun on himself.

""Karamjit's body was found dead near a street corner with a gunshot wound to his head,"" the police said.

Bhupinder Multani, the father of the suspect, informed reporters that there were no issues within the family, and he could not find any reason that would have prompted his son to take such an extreme action.

Jaspreet Singh, the brother-in-law of both the suspect and the victim, described Karamjit as one of the ""nicest"" men who always enjoyed making jokes, according to media reports.

The New York City Police Department has stated that they have taken up the case and are currently conducting an investigation.

"Baltimore's busy port fully reopens after bridge collapse, and a return to normal is expected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimores-busy-port-fully-reopens-after-bridge-collapse-and-a-return-to-normal-is-expected/articleshow/110954296.cms,"BALTIMORE: Commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore is expected to return to normal levels next month, officials said Wednesday, after the channel fully reopened this week for the first time since the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March.""I've been waiting to say this for every day for the last 11 weeks: Maryland, the Fort McHenry Channel is fully cleared, and the Port of Baltimore is reopened for business,"" Gov. Wes Moore said at a waterside news conference to highlight the milestone.As the governor spoke, a passing ship blasted its horn.""You hear that?"" Moore said. ""That's a beautiful sound.""Behind him, giant cranes lifted shipping containers from the deck of a docked cargo ship and deposited them on land.Many shipping companies rerouted their cargo to other ports following the deadly collapse in March. The deadly disaster halted most maritime traffic through Baltimore's busy port as crews worked around the clock to clear an estimated 50,000 tons of fallen steel and concrete from the Patapsco River.The estimated cost for the entire salvage operation is $160 million, with federal, state and local agencies involved.Companies that steered clear of Baltimore during the cleanup will likely come back now that the channel has been returned to its original depth and width, officials said. The port, which processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country, is expected to be operating at normal capacity by mid-July.All that rerouted commercial traffic ""belongs in Baltimore today,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said during a news briefing earlier this week. ""We have every indication that that is what is taking place, but we will be reinforcing that expectation as we speak with players up and down the supply chains.""Crews were able to reopen portions of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks. Some cruise ships and large container ships have already passed through, officials said.But thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their jobs impacted by the collapse and its economic ripple effects, which extend well beyond the Baltimore region. State officials helped establish several relief programs to keep people employed and businesses afloat in the immediate aftermath.""We were a wounded port,"" said Scott Cowan, president of the International Longshoreman's Association Local 333, which represents Baltimore port workers. In a competitive industry, he said, other ports were looking to take Baltimore's cargo.Reopening the channel means keeping thousands of longshoremen in their jobs, Cowan said.Officials estimated that the salvage operations for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will cost up to $75 million, while the Coast Guard response has cost $24 million to date to open the main channel. Maryland used about $60 million in federal emergency funds to open three other smaller channels outside the main one.Rebuilding the bridge could cost nearly $2 billion, officials have said. They hope it's completed by 2028.President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the full cost of rebuilding, though officials said the funding is still awaiting approval from Congress.In a statement Tuesday, Biden praised the work of everyone involved in the recovery effort.""Baltimore can count on us to stick with them every step of the way, and we will continue to have your back until the bridge is rebuilt,"" he said.The cargo ship Dali lost power and crashed into a critical support column of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early hours of March 26, collapsing the span and sending six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths.A National Transportation Safety Board investigation found that the vessel experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation.The Dali remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow, before being refloated and guided back to port May 20. That allowed officials to open a channel that was 50 feet (15 meters) deep and 400 feet (122 meters) wide, big enough for most of the largest commercial vessels.The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet (213 meters) wide. Officials said two-way traffic can now resume, and additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width.",Commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore is expected to return to normal levels next month. The channel fully reopened this week for the first time since the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. Many shipping companies rerouted their cargo to other ports following the deadly collapse. The estimated cost for the entire salvage operation is $160 million.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110956519,imgsize-78480,width-400,resizemode-4/110956519.jpg"
"US, Ukraine expected to sign long-term security agreement at G7 Summit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-ukraine-expected-to-sign-long-term-security-agreement-at-g7-summit/articleshow/110956363.cms,"ROME: The US and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Italy on Thursday, in a deal that lays out a path for Washington's long-term security relationship with Kyiv.The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine's armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance, and greater intelligence sharing.However, the pledge is expected to be an ""executive agreement,"" CNN reported citing sources, making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents. So, there is the possibility of the deal being undone by future US administrations.Former resident Donald Trump, who is also the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not explicitly said whether he would continue support for Ukraine if he wins in November. But, he has repeatedly affirmed that he would negotiate a quick end to the Russia-Ukraine war without explaining how.He has also pushed European countries to contribute more to their own defence and said he'd ""encourage"" Russia ""to do whatever the hell they want"" if Europe didn't increase its defence funding.The US-Ukraine agreement does not make a specific monetary pledge to support Ukraine's defence, two of the sources familiar with the agreement said.An annexe to the agreement will lay out how the Biden administration plans to work with Congress on the implementation of the security commitments, one of the sources said, specifically the long-term funding that will be needed to support Ukraine's defence.National security council spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday that the US' commitment to Ukraine ""will continue to be right up front and clear"" at the G7 and that Washington ""will take bold steps to show Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine fight for freedom.""Kirby also said that president Biden and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet during the summit, and the US will announce steps to unlock Russia's frozen assets for use in Ukraine's reconstruction after the war ends, CNN reported.The pledge the US and Ukraine are expected to sign will be similar to the 14 other bilateral agreements Ukraine has already reached with other allies, including the UK, France and Germany.The US-Ukraine agreement will be the 15th such deal signed, one of the sources said, and 17 other countries have committed to negotiating similar bilateral security pacts with Ukraine.As part of the deal, the US will promise to hold consultations with Ukraine immediately following a future attack by Russia to determine next steps, said the people familiar with the agreement's contours.But the bilateral agreement with the US, like with Ukraine's other allies, will not include a mutual defence clause, which would commit them to defend Ukraine militarily in the event of another attack.While Zelenskyy has welcomed the bilateral commitments, he has repeatedly stressed that they are not a substitute for full Nato membership , which does have a mutual defence provision known as Article V, according to CNN.The agreement comes as the US-Ukrainian relationship has begun to recover after faltering late last year and into this year amid a congressional fight over additional US funding for Ukraine - something Biden personally apologized to Zelenskyy for during a meeting in Paris last week.Recently, the Biden administration agreed to allow Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike into Russia directly. This is a major shift that Ukraine had been asking for months amid repeated Russian missile attacks in Kharkiv.",The US and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Italy on Thursday. The deal lays out a path for Washington's long-term security relationship with Kyiv. It is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine's armed forces.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110956294,imgsize-765730,width-400,resizemode-4/110956294.jpg"

India has so far organized two sessions of the Voice of the Global South Summit, which have been aimed at bringing the interests, priorities, and concerns of the Global South on the global stage.Confirming PM Modi's participation in the summit in Italy, foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra on Wednesday, said, ""It will also afford him an opportunity to engage with other world leaders present at the G7 Summit on issues of importance to India as also to the Global South.""This will be India's 11th participation in the G7 Summit and Prime Minister Modi's fifth consecutive participation at the G7 Summit.On the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Italy, PM Modi is also expected to hold bilateral meetings and discussions with the leaders of the G7, as well as the outreach countries and the international organizations.The two leaders last met during the COP28 Summit in Abu Dhabi last year.",US president Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are expected to meet during the G7 Summit in Italy.

Why is Biden going to Europe twice in a week?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-is-biden-going-to-europe-twice-in-a-week/articleshow/110952455.cms,"Air Force One is plenty comfortable if you are its most privileged frequent flier, with a comfortable bedroom and a spacious office. Still, most US presidents will try to avoid making two back-to-back round trips to Europe, separated by about 60 hours on the ground at home. Yet that is what Prez Joe Biden is pulling off this week - for reasons few at the White House seem eager to discuss.Biden left the US for D-Day celebrations in France last Wednesday, June 5, stayed the weekend for a state dinner in Paris, and returned to his home in Delaware late Sunday. He left Washington again early Wednesday, June 12, to fly to Italy for the annual gathering of the G7 .When Biden looks back at those two round trips - roughly a day and a half of flying, all told - he may remember only what happened in between: the conviction of his only living son, Hunter Biden , on charges of lying to obtain a gun permit.But the two round trips beg the question: Why didn't he just stay in Europe for a couple days? He is, after all, 81, and some of his aides who are half his age were complaining about lost sleep cycles.The White House's explanation for four trans-Atlantic crossings in nine days was simply that Biden had commitments in Washington. But by presidential standards, his public schedule looked light: a lunch with vice-president Kamala Harris and a speech to a gun-safety group. Hunter Biden's trial also loomed over the planning, though it was impossible to know when these trips were planned that the case would go to the jury and a verdict would be rendered in the three days between the D-Day trip and the G7 meeting.But privately, some aides said there were election-year optics to be considered. There was no urgent reason to stay in Europe, and a few down days ""might not look right"", one of Biden's advisers conceded. In any case, no one wanted images of the president on what his political opponents might cast as a European holiday, at least while he is running for re-election.The presidency, of course, is the ultimate work-from-anywhere job. There are instant communications (a White House van, bristling with antennas, travels in every motorcade) and a staff of hundreds ready to cater to every contingency, whether that involves sending off a thank-you note or launching a retaliatory nuclear strike.The intolerance for seeing presidents abroad, save for work, has a long history. Franklin D Roosevelt loved to camp at Campobello Island, in Canada, though as president he kept the visits brief. When Harry S Truman went to Potsdam, Germany, to negotiate with Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill about what post-WWII Europe would look like, he stayed for more than two weeks. There were days off from the negotiations, but not for long, and the nearest big city, Berlin, was a bombed wreck. And there was a reminder of the risks of being out of town: Churchill's party lost to Labour during the conference, and he got booted out of office while it was still going on.","Biden left the US for D-Day celebrations in France last Wednesday, June 5, stayed the weekend for a state dinner in Paris, and returned to his home in Delaware late Sunday.

US inflation cooled in May in a sign that price pressures may be easing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-inflation-cooled-in-may-in-a-sign-that-price-pressures-may-be-easing/articleshow/110945323.cms,"WASHINGTON: Inflation in the United States eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that a pickup in prices that occurred early this year may have passed. The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs — the closely watched “core” index — rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, below last month’s 3.6% rise. That was the mildest such increase in three years.Fed officials are scrutinizing each month’s inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago — a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden’s re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.Wednesday's report suggested that consumers are beginning to get some relief from the price spikes of the past three years. Grocery costs were unchanged, on average, from April to May, after actually falling 0.2% the previous month. Food prices have risen just 1% over the past 12 months, though they're still up about 20% from three years ago.Average gas prices tumbled 3.6% nationally just from April to May, though they're 2.2% higher than they were a year earlier. Those declines have continued, with gas averaging $3.45 a gallon Wednesday, down 17 cents from a month ago. Americans didn't drive as much over the Memorial Day weekend as they have in previous years, reducing demand, and oil prices have fallen.Overall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May. Measured from a year earlier, prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.“It's certainly welcome news,” said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. ""It drives home that the inflation challenge in the United States is not as challenging as monetary policy makers believe.”Airfares, furniture and clothing also dropped in price last month, helping keep inflation in check. And the cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier.The Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed’s target level.Persistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates — or keeps them high — to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.The longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.Inflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a “soft landing,” whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.But inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.In early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.Some signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending. In response, several major retail and restaurant chains, including Walmart, Target, Walgreen’s, McDonald’s and Burger King, have responded by announcing price cuts or deals.","Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs rose 0.2% from April to May.

Blinken says some of Hamas' proposed changes to a cease-fire plan in Gaza are workable and some not,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-says-some-of-hamas-proposed-changes-to-a-cease-fire-plan-in-gaza-are-workable-and-some-not/articleshow/110945200.cms,"Hamas asks for amendments'

Revenge for slain commander

BEIRUT: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the war in Gaza would go on after Hamas proposed ""numerous"" changes to a US-backed cease-fire plan, some that he said were ""workable"" and some not. He did not spell out what the changes were. Speaking to reporters in Qatar, Blinken said the US and other mediators will keep trying to ""close this deal.""Blinken is in the region to push a cease-fire proposal with global support that has not been fully embraced by Israel or Hamas. The militant group submitted its first official response late Tuesday, requesting ""amendments"" to the deal.The American's comments came as Lebanon's Hezbollah fired a massive barrage of rockets into northern Israel to avenge the killing of a top commander, further escalating regional tensions.Hezbollah, an Iran-backed ally of Hamas, has traded fire with Israel nearly every day since the 8-month-long Israel-Hamas war began and says it will only stop if there is a truce in Gaza. That has raised fears of an even more devastating regional conflagration.Air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel, and the military said that about 160 projectiles were fired from southern Lebanon, making it one of the largest attacks since the fighting began. There were no immediate reports of casualties as some were intercepted while others ignited brush fires.Hamas has expressed support for the broad outline of the deal but wariness over whether Israel would implement its terms.Hamas spokesman Jihad Taha told the Lebanese news outlet ElNashra that the ""amendments"" requested by the group include guarantees of a permanent cease-fire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.Hamas's official reply to the proposal, which it conveyed to mediators on Tuesday, appeared to be short of outright acceptance but kept negotiations alive.Qatar and Egypt, which have been key mediators alongside the United States, said they were studying it.Blinken is on his eighth visit to the region since the start of the war.The proposal has raised hopes of ending a conflict in which Israel's bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza have killed over 37,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and driven some 80 per cent of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Israeli restrictions and ongoing fighting have hindered efforts to bring humanitarian aid to the isolated coastal enclave, fueling widespread hunger.Israel launched its campaign after Hamas and other militants stormed into Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Over 100 hostages were released during a weeklong cease-fire last year in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.Hamas is still holding around 120 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead.The proposal announced by Biden calls for a three-phase plan that would begin with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes.Phase one also requires the safe distribution of humanitarian assistance ""at scale throughout the Gaza Strip,"" which Biden said would lead to 600 trucks of aid entering Gaza every day.At the same time, negotiations would be launched over the second phase, which is to bring ""a permanent end to hostilities, in exchange for the release of all other hostages still in Gaza, and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.""Phase three would launch ""a major multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of the remains of any deceased hostages still in Gaza to their families.""The militant group accepted a similar proposal last month that was rejected by Israel.Netanyahu's far-right coalition allies have rejected the latest proposal and have threatened to bring down his government if he ends the war leaving Hamas intact. But Netanyahu is also under mounting pressure to accept a deal to bring the hostages back.Thousands of Israelis, including families of the hostages, have demonstrated in favor of the US-backed plan.Hezbollah said it fired missiles and rockets at two military bases in retaliation for the killing of Taleb Sami Abdullah, 55. Known within Hezbollah as Hajj Abu Taleb, he is the most senior commander killed since the fighting began eight months ago. The Israeli strike destroyed a house where Abdullah and three other officials were meeting, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border, late Tuesday.A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press that Abdullah was in charge of a large part of the Lebanon-Israel front, including the area facing the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, which Hezbollah has repeatedly attacked in recent days, causing fires in the area.The official, who was not authorized to speak to media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Abdullah had joined Hezbollah decades ago and took part in attacks against Israeli forces during their 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon that ended in May 2000.Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 400 people, most of them Hezbollah members, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began.Other groups allied with Iran, including powerful militias in Iraq and Syria, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, have also attacked Israeli, US and other targets since the start of the war, often drawing Western retaliation.In April, Israel and Iran traded fire directly for the first time.US President Joe Biden 's administration has said the best way to calm regional tensions is for Hamas to accept a proposal for a phased cease-fire that it says would end of the war in Gaza and bring about the release of the remaining hostages abducted in Hamas' October 7 attack that ignited the war. The UN Security Council voted overwhelmingly in favor of the plan on Monday.Biden says it is an Israeli proposal, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sent conflicting signals, saying Israel remains committed to destroying Hamas.It's unclear how it would do that if the US-backed proposal, which includes an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, is fully implemented.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the war in Gaza would go on after Hamas proposed ""numerous"" changes to a US-backed cease-fire plan.

Muhammad Abbas made the allegation in a letter to Lahore high court chief justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan.

The judge has been hearing the cases against opposition leader in parliament Omar Ayub and other workers of Imran's PTI party in connection with the May 9, 2023 violence related to attacks on military installations in May last year. Ayub had alleged last week at a hearing that the judge was ""hostage"" of the intelligence agencies.

CJ Ahmad Khan summoned Punjab IGP Usman Anwar on Thursday and asked him why the roads leading to anti-terrorism court (Sargodha), some 200 km from Lahore, were closed by police when the judge refused to meet an ISI officer. The IGP replied: ""The roads were closed as the judge was facing serious threats"". The chief justice reserved his verdict on the alleged harassment of the ATC judge by the ISI.

In March, six judges of the Islamabad high court reached out to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) informing alleged intrusion of intelligence operatives in judicial matters.

Pakistan plans to borrow $23 billion in next fiscal year: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-plans-to-borrow-23-billion-in-next-fiscal-year-report/articleshow/110964344.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan plans to borrow at least $23 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, including a $12 billion bilateral debt rollover, to support its development initiatives and meet external financing needs, according to a media report on Thursday.This reliance on global financial institutions like the IMF will continue to shape the country's foreign and economic policies. The budget documents for fiscal year 2024-25 revealed that Pakistan would borrow a minimum of $23.2 billion, or Rs 5.9 trillion, excluding any loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as reported by The Express Tribune newspaper. The IMF loan will be used for balance of payments support.The government has incorporated $20 billion of the total $23 billion in budget documents. The rollover of $3 billion by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has not been included in the federal books as it is intended for balance of payments support. The details indicate that Pakistan will take $19 billion in loans to finance its budget and build foreign exchange reserves. This substantial amount will maintain the country's dependence on the IMF, World Bank, Saudi Arabia, China, the UAE, and the Islamic Development Bank, which are now imposing their terms due to Pakistan's ongoing reliance on them.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has announced receiving investment pledges of $15 billion from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, but these promises have not yet materialized into formal agreements. The government has once again budgeted $3.9 billion for foreign commercial loans in the new fiscal year, despite being unable to secure new debt from foreign commercial banks. In the current year, China rolled over $1 billion of commercial debt.There were expectations that international credit rating agencies would upgrade Pakistan's junk rating under the $3 billion IMF standby arrangement. However, political and economic vulnerabilities hindered any improvement in Pakistan's standing. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated on Tuesday that the rating agencies were awaiting approval of the new Extended Fund Facility from the IMF. If the ratings do not improve soon, the government's plan to raise $4.9 billion through Eurobond and foreign commercial loans may not materialize.The government has again included the rollover of $5 billion in cash deposits from Saudi Arabia, indicating that the country will be unable to return the money, of which $3 billion was taken in 2019 for just one year. However, Saudi Arabia has not agreed to extend the $1 billion oil facility to the next fiscal year, leading the government to exclude it from the projection of external loan receipts. Similarly, no new loan from Saudi Arabia for petrol imports has been included.China's $4 billion cash deposit has been added to the rollover queue once more, with $2 billion maturing next month. The UAE's financing has not been included in the federal borrowing plan as the funds are provided for balance of payments support and will be serviced by the central bank from its profits. Out of the $3 billion, $1 billion is maturing next month.The government has also estimated a new loan of $500 million from the Islamic Development Bank and $465 million from Naya Pakistan Certificates. Approximately $1.1 billion will be borrowed to finance the federal Public Sector Development Programme, according to the report.","Pakistan plans to borrow at least $23 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, including a $12 billion bilateral debt rollover.

Then why nobody speaking about other livestock

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has recently released its Economic Survey but all everyone cares about is the population of donkeys in the country -- the increase in the number, to be specific. The population has increased by 1.72%to reach 5.9 million during the fiscal year 2023-24. The data reveals that the number has been on a steady rise: 5.5 million in 2019-2020, 5.6 million in 2020-21, 5.7 million in 2021-22, and 5.8 million in 2022-23, while it jumped to 5.9 million in 2023-24.Livestock plays a crucial role in Pakistan's economy and hence the economic survey reveals the figures of all livestock populations including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, horses, donkeys and mules. In fact, the population of cattle has also increased by 2 million.""The focus of the present government is on breed improvement for enhanced productivity, establishing a nucleus herd, identifying breeds well adapted to various agro-ecological zones of Pakistan, and importing high-yielding exotic dairy, beef, mutton breeds, and genetic materials (semen, ova, embryos). By implementing these measures, the government aims to stimulate growth in the livestock sector, generate employment opportunities, and contribute to the country's overall economic growth and foodsecurity,"" the Economic Survey document said.Pakistan has the world's third-highest population of donkeys. Ethiopia and China rank first and second. Pakistan's donkey population is an international issue as China wants to import donkeys from Pakistan. China needs more donkeys to obtain gelatin from their skin for Chinese medicine manufacture. A report said China in 2022 expressed its interest in importing donkeys and dogs from Pakistan.Eying at an impetus to the donkey export, the Pakistan government set up a farm of over 3,000 acres in Okara district in its Punjab province which is used to rear donkeys of ""great breeds"", including American. China earlier used to import its stock of donkeys from Niger and Burkina Faso but then turned to Pakistan after the two West African countries banned their export.(Image AI generated)","Pakistan has the world's third-highest population of donkeys.

Pakistan has been in talks with the IMF for a loan estimated to range from $6 billion to $8 billion as it seeks to avert a default in the face of its economy growing the slowest among all countries of the region.Islamabad entered into a $6.5 billion three-year agreement with IMF in 2019. It received a final $3 billion under a standby arrangement last year, just before the agreement was to expire.The finance ministry and IMF were reportedly locked in last-minute talks as the global lender presented some more tough conditions last week to include in the budget.A ministry official said the IMF's key demands include a higher tax revenue target, withdrawal of subsidies, taxes on the agriculture sector, increased taxes and levies on the power, gas, and oil sectors, privatisation of sick govt organisations and units, and improved administration.Despite Pakistan's aggressive pursuit of economic diplomacy to improve trade and investment ties with other nations, finance ministerMuhammad Aurangzeb , who presented the budget in parliament, explicitly said there were no alternatives to IMF under the current circumstances.""As you all know, I have been in this role for about three to three and a half months,"" he said at a presser. ""But even when I was in the private sector, I was very loud and clear that we should go into the IMF programme because there is no plan B. If there were a plan B, the IMF would not be called the lender of last resort. There's a reason for that.""Even with depleted foreign reserves and an economic crisis, the govt allocated 2,100 billion rupees to defence in the federal budget, a 19% increase over the previous year. IMF hasn't demanded cuts in defence spending so far.A day earlier, the govt unveiled the Pakistan Economic Survey 2023-24, which showed that the economy failed to meet most of its targets set in the previous budget.The finance minister also addressed IMF's insistence on ending tax exemptions for a fresh loan.""There are no sacred cows.

This allowed elected local representatives to continue the provision of services to their electorate. The local elections were subsequently held in August 2023 for 72 key positions in 21 districts.Commenting on the law and order situation in the province, the rights body alleged that over 160 policemen, 70 military personnel, 60 civilians, and more than 170 alleged militants were killed in dozens of targeted militant attacks and security operations in 2023.Attempting to address the situation, Pakistan forcibly deported over 1.5 million documented and 0.7 million undocumented Afghan refugees and migrants from the province following an announcement by the federal caretaker government.Shedding light on the financial issues faced by people, the rights body stated that hundreds of teachers, doctors, health workers, and sanitation workers protested against delays in payment of salaries and other dues in separate demonstrations across the province in 2023.The report also addressed the status of Public health and environmental crises which has been a major issue of concern to the citizens. The HRCP report stated, that at least 11 per cent of the population suffers from drug abuse, and around 40 fatalities from rains, flash floods, and dust storms occur in several districts.Persons with disabilities also remained deprived of essential accessibility measures in most buildings despite court orders, and 4.7 million children, 66 per cent of which included girls, remained out of school in 2023, the report added.According to HRCP's media monitoring for 2023, there were at least 20 cases of domestic violence, 72 cases of sexual violence, 49 'honour' killings, and 246 femicide-related murders that reportedly took place in the province.HRCP cited a report from the Digital Rights Foundation, which stated that 112 complaints related to cyber harassment and gender-based violence were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In January, women councilors from the Khyber district elected in the 2021 local government polls protested the denial of functional authority and development funds to help female constituents of their areas.While over 100 women contested in the polls and several were elected, they had neither been provided offices nor resources, unlike their male counterparts, thereby lowering their status in people's perceptions, the report added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in its annual report, highlighted the precarious situation of human rights, law and order.

""We told the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) founder that dialogue is necessary, as the distance is widening. He agreed with us (on this),"" Gohar told the media outside the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi.According to Gohar, Khan, 71, wants the avenues of dialogue to be opened. He told journalists that Khan is ""ready to forgive what has happened to him for reconciliation.""""The PTI founder has said many times that 'I am ready to forgive what happened to me',"" Gohar was quoted as saying by Geo TV.The cricketer-turned-politician has been lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail at Rawalpindi since his arrest 10 months ago for his involvement in multiple cases, some of which have resulted in conviction.When asked if the negotiations will take place at the behest of the Supreme Court's advice, Gohar said: ""The option given by the apex court is also under consideration.""However, he emphasised that it is PTI's ""own decision"" to negotiate.""PTI founder did not write any letter to the SC for negotiation. PTI will also respond to its negotiation option.""Gohar said that the party will begin its negotiations after talking to Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai.He said there is an alliance with Achakzai and other parties, and that his party will take them into confidence.""Negotiations can also be held at the alliance level.

They (parties in the government) do not have power,"" he said.When pointed out by a journalist that the Supreme Court has also now asked him to talk to other political parties, Khan said he did not even negotiate with (Prime Minister) Shaukat Aziz during the Musharraf era. ""I only spoke to Musharraf's representative,"" he said.Khan said that at the request of former Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, his party negotiated with other political parties on the issue of elections. He said the elections were to be held in 90 days, and alleged that Bandial came under pressure and could not enforce the polls on time.","Imran Khan is ""ready to forgive"" what has happened to him, his party's chairman Gohar Khan says.

Pak PM says his China trip was successful,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-pm-says-his-china-trip-was-successful/articleshow/110919451.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that his trip to China last week was successful, while the opposition parties took him head-on, describing the tour as one that focused mainly on the security of Chinese people in Pakistan.Sharif’s visit came as Islamabad is seeking more foreign investment and looking to boost exports in a time of economic crisis and security concerns .Accompanied by the powerful army chief, General Asim Munir, Sharif took more than 100 Pakistani businessmen with him.Apprising cabinet members of his visit, PM Sharif said that despite the security issue highlighted during engagements with the Chinese leadership and business community, his five-day visit concluded on a “positive note”.“During the conversation with the Chinese ambassador at the banquet hosted by the Communist Party secretary during my visit to Shanxi province, I got a deep feeling that the visit remained very successful,” Sharif remarked, adding that a high-powered Chinese delegation would visit Pakistan soon.A joint statement issued at the end of the visit had stated that China and Pakistan had signed 23 agreements and MoUs in different fields. The joint declaration, however, noted that Beijing would not push businesses to take unwarranted risks or make concessions to Pakistani companies. Instead, the statement said, Beijing would support businesses to invest in Pakistan in line with market and commercial principles.Observers, however, pointed out that obstacles still stand in the way of strengthening Beijing-Islamabad economic collaboration, primarily as a result of Pakistan’s misguided policies.Pakistan is currently experiencing a debt crisis and looking for new loans to pay off previous debt.The total debt that Pakistan owes just to power (electricity) plants established under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) stands at around $7.5 billion. Islamabad also owes nearly $2 billion in circular debt, or unpaid bills, to Chinese electricity producers.During Sharif’s visit, no public statement was issued on restructuring debt but experts believe the issue is crucial and cannot be ignored.Pakistan’s current foreign debt, media reports suggest, is close to $130 billion, and Chinese officials say around 13% of it is owed to China.During the visit, Sharif, along with Gen Munir, also held talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping for more than three hours, indicating that the security of its nationals in Pakistan is a key concern for Beijing. Five Chinese workers were killed in a suicide attack in Pakistan’s northwestern Bisham region in March. Pakistan had blamed Afghanistan-based terrorists for the attack. The ruling Afghan Taliban had rejected Pakistan’s claim, saying Islamabad was trying to sour Kabul’s relations with Beijing.In the joint statement, both sides urged Afghanistan to “firmly combat terrorism, including not allowing its territory to be used for terrorist acts”.","Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that his trip to China last week was successful.

"Nawaz reaches out for peace, PM Modi says security remains India’s priority",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/nawaz-reaches-out-for-peace-pm-modi-says-security-remains-indias-priority/articleshow/110883535.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time but more significant was a felicitation message from the elder Sharif - former PM Nawaz Sharif - who spoke about replacing hate with hope and seizing this “opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia”. Modi expressed appreciation for the message, saying the people of India have always stood for peace, security and progressive ideas.“Advancing the well-being and security of our people shall always remain our priority,” said Modi, who did not invite Pakistan for the inauguration of his third term. Modi’s emphasis on security is in line with his government’s long held position that Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism is not conducive for dialogue.Nawaz had just before the election outcome too reached out to India’s incoming government by reiterating his position that it was Pakistan which had violated his 1999 peace agreement with India in the form of the Lahore Declaration through its Kargil offensive. However, his remarks now constitute the first direct peace outreach to India since the coalition government in Pakistan took power earlier this year.Nawaz said Modi’s success in elections reflects the confidence of the people in his leadership. “Let us replace hate with hope and seize the opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia,” said Nawaz, who was recently re-elected president of his party, in a post on X.Coming from the most powerful civilian leader in Pakistan, and one who is known to share a close rapport with Modi himself, the remarks are particularly significant. Modi thanked Shehbaz for his message.It was under Modi and Nawaz - in 2015 when then foreign minister Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad - that the 2 sides had their last substantive bilateral engagement. That dialogue saw India and Pakistan relaunching the dialogue process under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. This was followed by Modi’s famous drop by, and only visit to Pakistan as PM, in Lahore on Nawaz’s birthday but that initiative also quickly fizzled out because of the Pathankot terror attack and later the Uri attack.India has refused to have any diplomatic engagement ever since, except for the Indus Waters Treaty talks, and Pakistan itself decided to downgrade ties by recalling its high commissioner in 2019 after India revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K.The 2 countries will have an opportunity to attempt a reset in ties next month when both PMs travel to Kazakhstan for the SCO summit. However, it’s unlikely India will propose any meeting, given the understanding in the government that Pakistan is yet to act decisively against cross-border terrorism. Official sources also maintain Pakistan has to review its decision to downgrade ties before nursing any thought of forward movement in the relationship.Nawaz’s call for working together also doesn’t sit well with Pakistan’s official position that India must reverse its “unilateral and illegal” measures in J&K for talks to take place. With the Supreme Court upholding the revocation of the special status, the Indian government believes Pakistan cannot have any say in how the internal affairs of J&K are run.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time.

Myanmar rebels face new threat as junta deploys armed drones in civil war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/myanmar-rebels-face-new-threat-as-junta-deploys-armed-drones-in-civil-war/articleshow/110968211.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a significant development in Myanmar's ongoing civil war , resistance fighters who had previously relied on a scattered fleet of modified Chinese-made commercial drones to battle against the country's feared military are now finding their familiar weapons in the hands of the ruling junta .According to seven people with knowledge of the matter, the rebels have encountered the junta's use of armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in recent months, marking a shift in the conflict's dynamics.""The battle is changing now as drones are being used by both sides,"" said a 31-year-old rebel fighter in the country's southeast, identifying himself by the nom de guerre of Ta Yoke Gyi.He and other rebel fighters described instances where the junta had deployed modified Chinese-manufactured drones to carry explosives and attack rebel positions. Some resistance fighters have been injured in these attacks, highlighting the junta's improved proficiency in utilizing UAVs.According to Min Zaw Oo, executive director of the Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security think-tank, the junta began procuring thousands of Chinese commercial UAVs at the start of the year, modifying them to carry locally-manufactured munitions. While the junta has not publicly addressed its recent use of UAVs, regime leader Min Aung Hlaing acknowledged last year that rebels had dropped over 25,000 bombs using drones during a major October offensive on military posts.Despite the junta's acquisition of armed CH-3 UAVs from China around 2013, resistance members report that the military is currently deploying multi-rotor commercial drones, including those designed for agriculture, in their latest sorties. The limited number of junta drones observed on the frontline suggests that the military has not yet deployed all of its newly procured aircraft.As the civil war continues, the resistance appears to have lost its early advantage of being the main fighting force using drones, according to analysts and rebel fighters. The junta's expanding UAV attack fleet is a welcome development for demoralized military forces relying on conscription to replenish shrinking frontline battalions. As the military retrains and refits, it is expected to maintain a defensive posture while harassing opposition positions with drones.(With inputs from agencies)","Rebels had previously relied on a scattered fleet of modified Chinese-made commercial drones to battle against the country's feared military.

"No competitive politics left in Bangladesh, says nobel laureate Yunus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/no-competitive-politics-left-in-bangladesh-says-nobel-laureate-yunus/articleshow/110901366.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh has turned into a ""one-party"" state as the ruling party stamps out political competition, Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, a pioneer of the global microcredit movement, said in an interview.An election in January won prime minister Sheikh Hasina a fourth straight term, but it was boycotted by the main opposition party, whose top leaders were either jailed or in exile ahead of the poll.Yunus, who helped to lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans of sums less than $100 to the rural poor, angered Hasina with a 2007 plan to set up a political party.The 2006 Nobel laureate accused Hasina's ruling Awami League party of being involved in rampant corruption, saying Bangladesh lacked a genuine political opposition.""Bangladesh doesn't have any politics left,"" Yunus, 83, said last week in his office in Dhaka, the capital. ""There's only one party which is active and occupies everything, does everything, gets to the elections in their way.""He added, ""They get their people elected in many different forms- proper candidates, dummy candidates, independent candidates - but all from the same party.""Law minister Anisul Huq said he completely disagreed with Yunus' comments, however.""It's not only I who disagree, but the people of the country will also disagree,"" Huq told Reuters by telephone, calling the remarks an ""insult"" to the people of the country.""Democracy is fully functional in this country,"" he added.Yunus, an economist who won the Nobel for his work on microcredit, was forced out of Grameen Bank in 2011 by Hasina's government, which said he had stayed on past the legal retirement age of 60.Hasina, 76, is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of the South Asian nation killed in an army coup in 1975, along with most of his family. She first became prime minister in 1996.As Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister, Hasina has been credited with turning around the economy, though critics have also accused her of human rights violations and suppression of dissent.The US state department said January's elections were not free and fair while the British government's foreign office also condemned acts of ""intimidation and violence"".At the time, the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) denounced the exercise as a ""sham"" election, calling for its cancellation, Hasina's resignation and the formation of a non-party neutral government to hold a fresh one.Just before the election, a court in Bangladesh had sentenced Yunus to six months in prison for violations of labour law, which he denied.Although he is not in prison after securing bail in that case, Yunus faces more than 100 cases regarding the violations and graft accusations, which he dismissed as ""very flimsy, made-up stories"".Huq denied the accusations against Yunus were false, however, adding, ""He has gone to the highest court of the country, which found there was a case against him.""As an example, Huq cited taxes paid by Yunus after the supreme court ruled against him in a tax-evasion case, but declined comment on others as being sub-judice.Yunus' supporters say Hasina's government has sought to discredit him because he once considered setting up the political party, called ""Citizens' Power"".Hasina, who denies the contention, called Yunus a ""bloodsucker"" of the poor in 2011.""Is it a crime for a citizen to try to make a political party?"" Yunus asked, saying he dropped the idea of such a party after just 10 weeks, on realising that he was not suited to politics.Reviving a competitive political landscape in Bangladesh will be difficult, however, Yunus said.""Restarting will be very painful because we have brought it to a point where it has completely disappeared.""","Bangladesh has turned into a ""one-party"" state, Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus says. Yunus helped lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans of sums less than $100 to the rural poor. He angered prime minister Sheikh Hasina with a 2007 plan to set up a political party.
