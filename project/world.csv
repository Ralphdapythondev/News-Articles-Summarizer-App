Significance of the Balmoral meeting

Potential outcomes for titles

The Royal Family ’s summer retreat at Balmoral Castle has taken on a new significance as key discussions about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ’s future unfold.As the Sussexes remain distant from royal duties and make critical comments about the monarchy, their roles and titles are now in question. The annual retreat, usually a time for relaxation, is now a strategic summit aimed at charting the future of the monarchy.According to the Daily Express, a source revealed that the Royal Family’s agenda includes ""discussions about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex."" Despite their continued absence from major royal gatherings, the Sussexes are reportedly not surprised by the snub.The retreat is expected to cover not only upcoming tours and engagements but also potential changes to their royal titles.The Balmoral meeting goes beyond a traditional summer gathering. It’s a critical moment for the monarchy to address its position and future direction. “Last year focused on honoring the Queen; this year’s agenda is about how the family moves forward without the Sussexes,” the insider said. With Prince William assuming more responsibilities, including the role of Prince of Wales, any decision to alter the Sussexes' titles could complicate royal dynamics.If King Charles III decides to remove the Sussexes' Prince and Princess titles, this would be simpler than revoking their Dukedoms, which would require an Act of Parliament. The future of their children’s titles—Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet—may also be affected by these discussions.",The Royal Family is meeting at Balmoral Castle to discuss the future of the monarchy. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have not been seen at major royal gatherings. The Sussexes' roles and titles are now in question as Prince William takes on more responsibilities.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112538720,imgsize-84234,width-400,resizemode-4/112538720.jpg"
Doha Talks: High-stakes talks in Doha: Can US and Middle Eastern allies secure Gaza Hostage release and ceasefire?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/high-stakes-talks-in-doha-can-us-and-middle-eastern-allies-secure-gaza-hostage-release-and-ceasefire/articleshow/112538414.cms,"Senior officials from the US, Qatar, Egypt, and Israel are set to gather in Doha on Thursday for crucial talks aimed at finalizing a hostage release and ceasefire agreement for Gaza. This summit is pivotal in efforts to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East and avert a potential regional conflict , especially given recent threats from Iran and Hezbollah following the assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders in Tehran and Beirut.According to Axios, President Biden views the agreement as essential to reducing the risk of a broader regional war. CIA Director Bill Burns and President Biden's top Middle East adviser Brett McGurk will join the meeting, alongside Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed Bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani, Mossad Director David Barnea, and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu participated in extensive discussions on Wednesday with key officials and heads of Israel's security and intelligence services. These discussions lasted over five hours and focused on strategies for the Doha talks .Two senior Israeli officials revealed that Netanyahu agreed to slightly expand the mandate given to Israeli negotiators, a move aimed at facilitating more meaningful discussions. While this new flexibility is intended to enhance negotiation prospects, it remains uncertain if it will be sufficient to achieve a final agreement.Despite Qatar's assurances to the White House and State Department that Hamas will be included in the discussions, Hamas officials have stated they will not directly participate. However, they are open to meeting with mediators afterward to review Israel's proposals.A source close to the negotiations mentioned that Hamas representatives in Doha would not attend the talks but are willing to evaluate Israel's proposals through mediators. ""The mediators will update Hamas representatives and assess whether Israel presents a serious and practical proposal,"" the source noted.During the Wednesday meeting, Israeli security and intelligence heads warned Netanyahu that delays could jeopardize hostage lives, stressing the urgency of reaching an agreement. They also reported Hamas's claim that one male hostage had been killed and two female hostages critically wounded, though Israeli intelligence has yet to confirm these claims.One key discussion point was the potential connection between a hostage deal and a ceasefire in Gaza, alongside the risk of retaliation from Iran and Hezbollah. The White House has been actively involved in monitoring the situation, with President Biden and Vice President Harris receiving briefings on ongoing diplomatic efforts.Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized to his Egyptian and Qatari counterparts the importance of regional cooperation. ""No party in the region should take actions that would undermine efforts to reach a deal,"" Blinken stated.","Senior officials from the US, Qatar, Egypt, and Israel are set to gather in Doha on Thursday for crucial talks aimed at finalizing a hostage release and ceasefire agreement for Gaza.

Ukraine: Ukraine says advance into Russia 'going well': New evacuation hotline and military strikes highlight escalation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-advance-into-russia-going-well-new-evacuation-hotline-and-military-strikes-highlight-escalation/articleshow/112537321.cms,"Ukraine 's forces have made notable advances into Russia 's Kursk region , with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying that these gains create a strategic buffer zone to protect Ukraine's borders from Russian attacks. This move follows Kyiv's recent surprise incursion into Russian territory, leaving Moscow scrambling to respond.According to Reuters, Zelenskyy discussed establishing military commandant offices in newly occupied areas and noted the growing number of Russian prisoners of war , which could facilitate exchanges for Ukrainian fighters.Interior minister Ihor Klymenko emphasized that the buffer zone aims to protect Ukrainian border communities from Russian strikes.Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced a 24-hour hotline for Kursk region residents wishing to evacuate to Ukraine. ""Due to the possible deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the adjacent territories of the Kursk region of the Russian Federation, Ukraine must be ready to receive Russian refugees. Therefore, the Ministry of Reintegration has opened a 24-hour hotline for residents of the Kursk region who need humanitarian aid or wish to evacuate to Ukraine,"" Vereshchuk posted on Telegram on Wednesday. She assured that ""Ukraine complies with all norms of international humanitarian law"" and would provide civilians in the Kursk region with necessary protection and humanitarian support.Russian authorities have announced a mandatory evacuation for the border village of Glushkovo in the Kursk region. Kursk Governor Alexei Smirnov stated that the evacuation, prompted by the Ukrainian incursion, would be coordinated by law enforcement, the Russian military, and local government officials.It is unclear how many people will be affected, but the Russian emergency ministry released footage of evacuations in the Lgov and Rylsk districts of the Kursk region, showing workers assisting elderly residents onto buses. One resident, Galina, described the fear of Ukrainian forces hitting homes ""point blank"" and how she narrowly escaped to a basement for shelter.Ukraine has accused Russia of neglecting its civilians in Kursk, with Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko claiming residents ""were abandoned by Russia without the most necessary things."" Klymenko said the military was now coordinating with his office to organize humanitarian aid, including drinking water, food, medicines, and hygiene kits.Despite intense battles, Russian forces have been unable to expel Ukrainian troops from Kursk. Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to drive out the Ukrainian forces, claiming their incursion is intended to strengthen Kyiv's position in future ceasefire talks.Ukrainian President Zelenskyy lauded Ukraine’s military for executing what he called “precise, timely, and effective” strikes on Russian airfields. Ukraine conducted its ""biggest attack"" on Russian airfields since the war began, with drones targeting four Russian airfields overnight, a source at the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told CNN.Zelenskyy praised the efficiency of Ukrainian drones but noted that some operations require more than just drones. ""We need other weapons — missile weapons. And we continue to work with our partners on long-range solutions for Ukraine,"" he said.The incursion has raised significant risks for Ukraine, Russia, and the West, with concerns about a potential confrontation between Russia and NATO. US President Joe Biden confirmed ongoing contact with Kyiv but denied prior knowledge or involvement in the attack.Ukraine's push into Kursk continues, with Zelenskyy emphasizing that the operation aims to create a security zone within Russia to protect Ukraine's border regions.","Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced a 24-hour hotline for Kursk region residents wishing to evacuate to Ukraine.

US Navy: US Navy unveils longest-range missile: Will AIM-174B be a game-changer in Indo-Pacific tensions?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-navy-unveils-longest-range-missile-will-aim-174b-be-a-game-changer-in-indo-pacific-tensions/articleshow/112537942.cms,"The US Navy has introduced the AIM-174B , an extremely long-range air-to-air missile , in the Indo-Pacific, aiming to counter China’s aerial dominance. This deployment is part of a broader strategy to enhance US power projection as tensions in the region escalate.Operational since July, the AIM-174B, derived from Raytheon’s SM-6 air defence missile, is now the longest-range missile ever fielded by the US.Capable of striking targets up to 400 km (250 miles) away, it surpasses the range of China’s PL-15 missile , providing US jets a critical edge in aerial engagements, Reuters reported.One of the significant advantages of the AIM-174B is its ability to fly several times farther than the AIM-120 AMRAAM, the previous long-range US missile. This capability allows the AIM-174B to keep Chinese threats at bay, protecting key US assets such as aircraft carriers and enabling strikes on high-value Chinese targets, including command-and-control planes.""The United States can ensure the safety of their important assets, such as carrier groups, and launch long-range strikes on PLA targets,"" said Chieh Chung, a researcher at the Taipei-based think tank Association of Strategic Foresight.The West has long struggled to match this level of capability. The AIM-120, the standard long-range missile for US aircraft, has a maximum range of about 150 km (93 miles), forcing US jets to fly deeper into contested territories and exposing them to significant risks. In a potential conflict in the South China Sea or a scenario involving Taiwan, the US Navy would have to operate within a few hundred kilometres of Chinese forces, increasing the danger to US aircraft carriers due to anti-ship attacks.The AIM-174B changes this dynamic, allowing the US to keep PLA carrier-hunting aircraft out of firing range and even threaten Chinese planes attacking Taiwan, according to Cheih Chung.""The big thing is that it lets the United States push in a little bit further into the South China Sea during a conflict,"" said a senior US defence technical analyst. ""And it's going to potentially change Chinese behaviour because it's going to hold large, slow, unmanoeuvrable aircraft at greater risk.""For decades, the United States relied on the advantage of stealth fighters like the F-117, F-22, and F-35, making missiles like the AIM-120 sufficient. However, the advent of Chinese stealth aircraft , such as the J-20, and the longer-range PL-15 missile it can carry, has eroded the US edge. Kelly Grieco, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, noted that a stealthy Chinese aircraft could theoretically spot non-stealthy US aircraft and shoot them down well outside the range where they could even fight back.""If a Chinese fighter can outrange an American fighter, it means they can get the first shot. It's hard to outrun something that's travelling at Mach 4,"" she said.The AIM-174B was developed to quickly address this need. In parallel, the US Air Force is working on a separate program, the secretive Lockheed Martin AIM-260, which aims to develop an extremely long-range air-to-air missile small enough for stealth aircraft to carry internally.China is also developing missiles with longer ranges than the PL-15. However, Justin Bronk, an airpower expert at London's Royal United Services Institute, pointed out that the radar on these launching aircraft might not be able to spot targets at such extended distances.""If you go too big and too heavy with the missiles, you end up trading off fuel for the aircraft,"" he added.The use of the Raytheon SM-6, initially designed for a ship-launched air defense role, means that production lines are already available, and funding exists for more than 100 SM-6 missiles a year. Although Raytheon declined to comment on how many AIM-174Bs would be produced, its versatility opens up possibilities beyond the AIM-174B, such as fitting the missile with an anti-radar seeker to disrupt surface-to-air missile batteries from long range.Even with limited numbers, the AIM-174B's deployment alters the strategic calculus in a potential regional conflict . As a senior technical analyst noted, ""If this is enough to push China’s high-value aircraft way back, then you don’t need many. The threat has caused the adversary to change their behaviour... It makes a South China Sea scenario easier.""","The US Navy has introduced the AIM-174B, an extremely long-range air-to-air missile. The missile is now the longest-range missile ever fielded by the US. It surpasses the range of China’s PL-15 missile, providing US jets a critical edge in aerial engagements.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112538302,imgsize-380618,width-400,resizemode-4/112538302.jpg"

Her resignation comes in the wake of intense national scrutiny following pro-Palestinian protests at the university and other campuses across the United States.The protests, which erupted in response to US support for Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza, became a flashpoint in debates about Israel and Palestine.At Columbia, critics accused the protests of veering into anti-Semitism and intimidation, leading to Shafik being questioned before Congress alongside other university presidents. They were accused of failing to ensure the safety of Jewish students on campus.Protesters, including some Jewish individuals, contended that the criticisms were conflating anti-Israel sentiment with anti-Semitism and that allegations of hate incidents were being used to deflect from calls for a ceasefire amidst the escalating civilian casualties in Gaza.In an email to the Columbia community, Shafik said, “Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead.” She emphasized her desire for new leadership to be in place before the academic term begins, according to the Columbia Spectator.The nationwide protests saw buildings occupied and occasional clashes with police. Pro-Israel counter-protesters also clashed with demonstrators at times. US House Speaker Mike Johnson, who had earlier condemned the protests as ""terrorism,"" welcomed Shafik’s resignation in a statement on Wednesday.The ongoing conflict in Gaza has resulted in significant casualties, with Hamas's attack on October 7 killing 1,198 people in Israel, according to AFP. Israel’s retaliatory actions have led to the deaths of at least 39,965 people in Gaza, as reported by the territory's health ministry, without distinguishing between civilians and militants.","Minouche Shafik has resigned as President of Columbia University, US media reported on Wednesday.

However, the quota system was reinstated this year, triggering further protests that ultimately led to the toppling of the government and the prime minister's exile.The former presidential candidate also highlighted the concerning trend of radicals targeting Hindu minorities amidst the chaos. He emphasized that ""bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood"" and suggested that the United States should learn from the lessons unfolding in Bangladesh.""Here's what happened: Bangladesh fought a bloody war for its independence in 1971. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi civilians were raped and murdered. It was a tragedy, and it was rightly mourned. But in its aftermath, Bangladesh implemented a quota system for jobs in their civil service: 80% of the jobs were allocated to specific social groups (war veterans, rape victims, underrepresented residents, etc.), and only 20% were allocated based on merit,"" he said in a post on X.""The quota system proved to be a disaster. In 2018, protests led Bangladesh to scrap most of the quotas, but the victim-patrons fought back…and the quota system was reinstated this year. That triggered more protests which toppled the government, and the prime minister fled. Once chaos begins, it can't easily be reined in. Radicals are now targeting Hindu minorities.

Why the controversy?

Israeli minister Itamar Ben Gvir drew criticism from various quarters after he, along with hundreds of Israelies, entered Jerusalem 's Al-Aqsa mosque compound and performed prayers -- this comes as the Middle East remains on edge amid fear of anticipated large-scale Iran and Lebanon attacks in the wake of Hamas chief's assassination Ben Gvir and some 2,250 other Israelis on Tuesday entered the compound in groups, singing Jewish hymns under the protection of Israeli police, an official from the Waqf, the Jordanian body that is the custodian of the site, told news agency AFP.""Minister Ben Gvir, instead of maintaining the status quo at the mosque is supervising the Judaisation operation and trying to change the situation inside Al-Aqsa mosque,"" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the issue.Israeli police also ""imposed restrictions"" on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, he said.Ben Gvir posted a video statement on social media platform X, which he filmed inside the compound himself, vowing to win the war in Gaza.""We must win this war. We must win and not go to the talks in Doha or Cairo,"" he said, in an apparent reference to US-backed negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal for Gaza scheduled to resume on August 15.""We can defeat Hamas .. we must bring them down to their knees,"" Ben Gvir said.Ben Gvir garnered global condemnation after the mosque visit as he also vowed to ""defeat Hamas"" in Gaza in a video he filmed during the visit.The European Union (EU) condemned ""provocations"" by Gvirm and called it ""violation of status quo"".""The EU strongly condemns the provocations by Israeli Min. Ben Gvir who, during his visit to the Holy Sites, advocated for the violation of the status quo,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell wrote on X.France's foreign ministry also stepped in to condemn Gvir for defying the ban on Jewish prayer at the Al-Aqsa mosque, calling it an unacceptable ""provocation"".The United Nations also slammed the minister, calling his visit ""unduly provocative "".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent further ""provocative actions"" after Gvir's Al-Aqsa visit.Strongly criticising the Israeli minister's visit, Blinken said that Gvir showed ""blatant disregard"" for the status quo.""Prime Minister Netanyahu's office has made clear that the actions of Minister Ben Gvir are inconsistent with Israeli policy.

""The Queen tends to like a martini before her guests arrive,"" Evans wrote.Comfort was paramount for the Queen during her travels. She would bring her pillows aboard the plane to ensure a good night’s sleep.

Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan 's life was shattered just three days after the birth of his twins, Asser and Aysel.What should have been a time of celebration turned into unimaginable grief when an Israeli airstrike in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, claimed the lives of the newborns, their mother, and their grandmother.On the day of the tragedy, Mohammed had left home to obtain birth certificates for his son and daughter, who were just four days old.While at a local government office, he received the news that his home had been bombed. The strike that killed his entire family occurred while he was away, robbing him of the chance to hold and cherish his newborns in what should have been their first days of life.“I don’t know what happened,” Mohammed tearfully recounted, still in shock from the sudden loss.“I am told it was a shell that hit the house. I didn’t even have the time to celebrate them,” Mohammed told APAccording to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, 115 infants have been born and killed during the ongoing conflict, which began on October 7th following a deadly attack on Israel by Hamas-led gunmen. The attack left 1,200 Israelis dead and sparked a massive military offensive on Gaza that has since claimed over 39,790 Palestinian lives, as reported by the health ministry.The family had sought refuge in the central Gaza Strip after following Israeli army instructions to evacuate Gaza City in the war’s early weeks. Despite their efforts to find safety, they became casualties of the relentless bombing campaign.The Israeli military has stated that it aims to avoid civilian casualties and places the blame on Hamas for operating in densely populated areas. However, the devastation continues, with numerous shelters and civilian homes destroyed in the crossfire.The airstrike on Mohammed's home is one of many that have turned family homes into graves. On Saturday, another strike on a school building sheltering displaced Palestinians in Gaza City killed more than 70 people, adding to the mounting civilian death toll.As Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan prays for his lost family, the world witnesses the tragic cost of war—a cost that has left countless families grieving in its wake, their lives forever changed by the violence that shows no sign of abating.",Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan's twins Asser and Aysel were just four days old when they were killed in an Israeli airstrike.

US said to consider a breakup of Google to address search monopoly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-said-to-consider-a-breakup-of-google-to-address-search-monopoly/articleshow/112537816.cms,"WASHINGTON: Google was found last week to have violated antitrust law by illegally maintaining a monopoly in internet search . Now discussions over how to fix those violations have begun.Justice Department officials are considering what remedies to ask a federal judge to order against the search giant, said three people with knowledge of the deliberations involving the agency and state attorneys general who helped to bring the case.They are discussing various proposals, including breaking off parts of Google, such as its Chrome browser or Android smartphone operating system, two of the people said.Other scenarios under consideration include forcing Google to make its data available to rivals, or mandating that it abandon deals that made its search engine the default option on devices like the iPhone, said the people, who declined to be identified because the process is confidential. The government is meeting with other companies and experts to discuss their proposals for limiting Google's power, the people said.The deliberations are in their early stages. Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who is overseeing the case, has asked the Justice Department and Google to come up with a process for determining a fix by Sept. 4. He has scheduled a hearing on Sept. 6 to discuss next steps.Last week's ruling that Google was a monopolist was a landmark antitrust decision, raising serious questions about the power of tech giants in the modern internet era. Apple, Amazon and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, also face antitrust cases. Google is scheduled to go to trial in another antitrust case -- this one over ad technology -- next month. Any remedies in Google's search case are likely to reverberate and influence that broader landscape.The stakes are acutely high for Google, which became a $2 trillion internet juggernaut by building an online advertising business and others on top of its search engine. Mehta could reshape the core of the company's business or order it to abandon longtime practices that have helped to cement its dominance. Google generated $175 billion in revenue from its search engine and related businesses last year.""The Justice Department is evaluating the court's decision,"" a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement. ""No decisions have been made at this time.""A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The company has pledged to appeal the ruling. Bloomberg News earlier reported the details of the discussions.Remedies in antitrust cases can have profound effects. In 2000, a federal judge ruled against Microsoft in an antitrust case and ordered the company be split up. A breakup was reversed on appeal, but key legal findings were upheld. Afterward, Microsoft did not exert its dominance over the emerging internet industry, creating room for young companies -- like Google -- to thrive.The Justice Department and a group of states brought the search lawsuit against Google in 2020. It went to trial last year alongside a second similar lawsuit brought by a different group of state attorneys general.On Aug. 5., Mehta ruled that Google had illegally maintained a monopoly over general online search services and some of the ads that run in search results. He broadly agreed with the government that the company had built a cycle of dominance that stopped rivals from building new innovations and allowed it to raise ad prices beyond what would be possible in a free market.At the center of that cycle were billions of dollars in payments that Google made to companies like Apple and Mozilla to be the default search engine on devices like the iPhone and browsers like Firefox, Mehta said.Since then, the Justice Department and state attorneys general have started weighing their desire to check Google's influence with what they can reasonably ask Mehta to do given the substance of his ruling, two people with knowledge of the discussions said.Google's competitors and other critics have proposed -- either publicly or in discussions with the government -- several options for how Mehta should rein in the company.The most extreme is for Google to split off a substantial part of its business. That could mean the company would have to spin off Chrome, its web browser, or Android, its software for smartphones. Both of those products use Google as the automatic search engine, which helps fuel the company's dominance, Mehta said.The government is also considering asking for Google to have to divest a tool that runs text ads in search, the two people with knowledge of the deliberations said.Last week, DuckDuckGo, a small search engine company that has said it was harmed by Google's online search dominance, publicly proposed several remedies to even the playing field.The company said that the government should ban the agreements that made Google's search engine the default option on devices, give others access to Google's search and ads knowledge, present screens that allow people to change search engines easily and educate the public about the process of picking a new search engine.DuckDuckGo, which pitches itself as being more respectful of user privacy than Google, said the changes should be made under the supervision of an independent body with technical experts, to ensure compliance.""There is no silver bullet,"" DuckDuckGo said in a statement. ""Truly fixing the entrenched competitive imbalance that Google's default advantage has afforded them will require a mixture of interventions.""",Google was found last week to have violated antitrust law by illegally maintaining a monopoly in internet search. Now discussions over how to fix those violations have begun. Justice Department officials are considering what remedies to ask a federal judge to order against the search giant.

US elections: Google confirms Iranian hackers targeting Harris and Trump presidential campaigns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-google-confirms-iranian-hackers-targeting-harris-and-trump-presidential-campaigns/articleshow/112537263.cms,"Google confirmed that Iranian-backed hackers are targeting the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump . The hacker group, known as ""APT42"" and linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has been targeting high-profile individuals and organizations in both Israel and the United States, including political campaigns.According to Google's threat report, APT42 has been attempting to compromise personal accounts associated with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Trump.The Harris campaign acknowledged being targeted by foreign hackers, following Trump's campaign’s earlier suggestion of Iranian involvement. “In July, the campaign legal and security teams were notified by the FBI that we were targeted by a foreign actor influence operation,” a Harris campaign official said reported AFP. However, they reported no security breaches.APT42 uses sophisticated phishing techniques to gather information and deceive victims into revealing login credentials for accounts like Gmail. These techniques often involve posing as reputable organizations or creating fake video meeting pages to lure targets.Google's report highlighted that APT42 had attempted to hack into personal email accounts of about a dozen individuals linked to Biden and Trump this year. The company also disrupted several of the group’s phishing campaigns and blocked numerous login attempts. Additionally, the group accessed the personal Gmail account of a prominent political consultant.“APT42 is a sophisticated, persistent threat actor with a demonstrated ability to run simultaneous phishing campaigns, particularly targeting Israel and the United States,” Google noted.The US State Department issued a warning to Iran on Monday about potential consequences for interfering in the election following the Trump campaign’s breach announcement. The Trump campaign claimed that Iran was behind the breach, which involved the leak of private documents, and cautioned media outlets against publishing the documents, accusing them of aiding “America’s enemies.”This stance contrasts with Trump’s 2016 remarks, when he infamously encouraged Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s emails, amid US intelligence findings that Russia had intervened to support his election.","Google confirms that Iranian-backed hackers are targeting the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.

Iran escalates cyber efforts against US election amid growing tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/iran-escalates-cyber-efforts-against-us-election-amid-growing-tensions/articleshow/112537266.cms,"With less than three months until the US election , Iran's cyber activities are intensifying, US officials and cybersecurity experts report. The suspected hack of Donald Trump’s campaign is the latest in a series of aggressive actions attributed to Tehran.Iran, often labeled a “chaos agent” in cyber conflicts, has ramped up efforts to influence US politics. Recent activities include encouraging protests over Israel’s Gaza conflict, impersonating American activists, and creating fake news networks.Despite Russia and China being significant cyber threats, Iran’s heightened aggression signals a new level of interference aimed at disrupting the election.Sean Minor, a former US Army information warfare expert, notes the increase in cyber operations as the election approaches. ""As we get closer, we suspect these networks will get more aggressive,"" he said, as quoted by AP.The FBI is probing the Trump campaign hack and similar efforts targeting President Joe Biden’s campaign. Trump’s team reported unauthorized access to internal documents, later leaked to the media. While Trump dismissed the leaked material’s importance, the campaign has pointed to Iran, citing a Microsoft report on attempted hacks by Iranian military intelligence.Iran has denied involvement, but US intelligence and cybersecurity firms link Tehran to recent cyber operations. Google recently exposed an Iranian Revolutionary Guard group targeting personal emails of individuals associated with Biden and Trump. The connection between this group and the reported hack remains unclear.Iran’s motives include spreading discord, increasing US polarization, and undermining support for Israel. The Iranian government also seeks to impact candidates perceived as hostile to Tehran, such as Trump, who took a hardline stance against Iran during his presidency.Senate intelligence committee leaders issued a warning to Tehran and other adversaries, emphasizing consequences for election interference . ""There will be consequences to interfering in the American democratic process,"" wrote Democratic Sen. Mark Warner and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.Past Iranian attempts include the 2021 charges against two nationals who posed as Proud Boys to intimidate Democratic voters and recent covert support for anti-Israel protests.Experts warn that the final weeks before an election are particularly vulnerable to foreign interference. ""The spectacle and marketing this gives foreign adversaries can be more of a threat than the actual hack,"" said Gavin Wilde, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.As AI technology advances, disinformation campaigns are becoming more sophisticated. Nevertheless, the Trump campaign hack reportedly involved basic techniques, highlighting ongoing vulnerabilities in digital security.“The tax we pay for being a digital society is that these hacks and leaks are unavoidable,” Wilde concluded. “Whether you’re a business, a campaign, or a government.”","Iran's cyber activities are intensifying, US officials and cybersecurity experts report.

But his feelings for the three of them are different, Politico reported citing Biden's close aides. Biden is angry with Nancy Pelosi, frustrated with Barack Obama and miffed at Schumer.The tension is again at the forefront as the party is preparing for the national convention. Biden told his close aides that he respects Pelosi for she did what she had to do and that Pelosi cares for the party and not feelings but she was ruthless to set aside their long-term relationships. Pelosi and Biden have not spoken after Biden's exit and Pelosi also acknowledged in a recent interview that she loses sleep thinking about her friendship with Biden.Pelosi has repeatedly denied any role in Biden's exit and said she didn’t call anyone but the president in the three weeks prior to Biden’s departure from the race. But Pelosi took calls from rank-and-file Democrats who sought her advice in the days following Biden’s debate performance and before he dropped out of the race, Politico reported.Pelosi said she, her husband and children have only love for the Bidens. “In our family, we have three generations of love for Joe Biden. My husband and I — of course, we’ve known him for a very long time — respect him, love him and Jill. He and Jill are so remarkable, and their family. Our kids have always loved them. I had pictures with him from our children growing up and now our grandchildren growing up,” she said.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday said that Biden “respects” Pelosi and insisted that he has “no hard feelings.”Biden's resentment for Obama stemmed from the fact that Obama tweeted in support of Biden after the debate and then went quiet.

The way Donald Trump is attacking Kamala Harris on 'frivolous' issues, he actually is looking for a theory to explain his defeat to Kamala Harris in November election, if he loses, Trump's former aide said expressing apprehension. “We know one thing for sure: Trump never loses. And so if he’s not declared the winner of 2024, as in 2020, it must be because he was treated unfairly yet again; it was stolen yet again,” John Bolton, who was Trump’s national security adviser and has since become a vocal critic of the former president, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins last week.Bolton said Trump does not exactly know what his theory is going to be and he is trotting out a number of things.“And I think this is why people need to start thinking more now about how to deny Trump the ability, the day after the election, if he loses, to try and throw the process into chaos again.”In his interview with Elon Musk, Trump said he would go to Venezuela if he loses the election. “If something happens with this election, which would be a horror show, we’ll meet the next time in Venezuela,” Trump said. It was a swipe at Kamala Harris as Trump said Venezuela with is in the middle of a political crisis over the re-election of Nicholas Maduro will be a far safer place than the US if Kamala Harris becomes the president.“We’ll have a meeting and dinner in Venezuela,” Trump said, “Because that’s what’s happening—their crime rate’s coming down and our crime rate’s going through the roof.”According to the latest survey, Kamala Harris is ahead of tied with Donald Trump in six of seven battleground states. The Cook Political Report survey, conducted by the Democratic polling firm BSG and Republican polling firm GS Strategy Group, found Harris leading Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arizona, and tied with Trump in Georgia.

The former President's constant efforts to delegitimize his opponent Kamala Harris by alleging she and her associates staged a ""coup"" against President Biden, exaggerated charges of voter fraud and illegal voting, spurious accusations of ""election interference"" by his rival using artificial intelligence, and his own lack of enthusiasm and discipline in campaigning are among reasons political analysts both on the Democratic and Republican side are fearing a catastrophic meltdown on November 5 if the results are not in his favor.With polls showing Kamala Harris surging ahead in battleground states, inching forward in the so-called sun belt, and even catching up in Republican-leaning states such as Florida, there's palpable panic in the GOP where frustration is mounting that Trump is losing it -- and losing his way. Amid talk that Trump should replace his running mate J.D.Vance -- which some Republicans are now saying was a choice made in haste -- or even retire himself to save the party, there is now public remonstration that the campaign in going off the rails.“I want this campaign to win, but the campaign is not gonna win talking about crowd sizes, it's not gonna win talking about what race Kamala Harris is, and it's not gonna win talking about whether she's dumb. It’s not. You can't win on those things. The American people are smart. Treat them like they're smart,” Nikki Haley, a Trump associate who challenged him for the party nomination and endorsed him after failing to win it, said on Fox News, even berating the network for echoing Trump falsehoods.Some political stalwarts are going so far as to say Trump is simply firebombing the campaign because he's setting the stage for claiming a stolen election if he loses on November 5. ""People need to start thinking more now about how to deny Trump the ability, the day after the election, if he loses, to try and throw the process into chaos again,” Trump former National Security Advisor John Bolton, one of more than 40 Trump White House aides who think he is a vapid, clueless candidate who should not be anywhere near the presidency, said.While many critics are now starting to question Trump's own mental acuity because of his erratic behavior, calling him ""deranged"" and ""delusional,"" some are warning it is a set-up to steal the election. ""Donald Trump may be crazy, but he’s not stupid... there is a method to his madness,” the liberal senator Bernie Sanders warned on Tuesday. “If you can convince your supporters that thousands of people who attended a televised rally do not exist, it will not be hard to convince them that the election returns in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and elsewhere are ‘fake’ and ‘fraudulent.’”Political mavens and pollsters are already zeroing in on Georgia, a closely fought state, as the most likely battleground where both the stolen election scenario will play out. Trump Republicans are reported to have put in place MAGA operatives in county election boards who will refuse to certify the elections if Trump loses, throwing the matter to courts.Similar ground level political skirmishes are already taking place in other battleground states such as Pennsylvania, where Republicans claim they are winning after running up huge leads from the hinterland, before it the lead is erased by Democratic votes from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the two major cities, at which point they erupt with charges of voter fraud -- as it happened in 2020.In fact, Trump himself has indicated that he will not accept any result that does not declare him the winner, maintaining that he cannot lose any ""honest election."" Political analysts are already predicting complete chaos on November 5 unless Kamala Harris wins decisively by a margin large enough to forestall any doubts.Republican operatives are now urging Trump to get back on message to run a disciplined, issue-based campaign against an opponent who has the disadvantage of incumbency. The former President is expected to trial a new line of attack focusing on policy at an event in Asheville, North Carolina, another battleground state which he won by only one per cent in 2020.","Concern is growing in US political circles that Donald Trump is laying the groundwork for rejecting election results if he loses in November.

Nikki Haley Slams Trump: Nikki Haley says Trump must stop whining about Kamala Harris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nikki-haley-says-trump-must-stop-whining-about-kamala-harris-talking-about-her-race-dumbness-/articleshow/112529057.cms,"Why Nikki Haley is upset over Trump's campaign

Former GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley said Donald Trump and the Republicans should stop whining about Kamala Harris succeeding Joe Biden's contest as they anticipated it pretty well. In an interview with the Fox News, Nikki launched an attack on Kamala Harris and said there's no need for an interview of her; as she can be taken at her word when she says illegal immigrants should be able to vote and be given driver's licenses.“I take her at her word that she wants to raise taxes for households over $100,000, that she wants to add a pharmaceutical tax and a healthcare tax,"" Nikki said. “I take her at her word that she thinks that illegal immigrants should be able to vote and be given driver’s licenses. I take her at her word that she wants to ban fracking and kill a bunch of US jobs. Take her at her word.”“You don’t need an interview from Kamala Harris. I take her at her word"".Nikki Haley said she wants the Trump's campaign to win but it won't be possible if the campaign goes on whining about Kamala Harris -- her crowd size, her race. “I think the campaign needs to focus. That’s the main thing. Look, this is a winnable election, but you need to focus. Who is your target market? Your target market is suburban women, college-educated, independents and conservative Democrats. That’s your target market.”“But the campaign is not going to win talking about crowd sizes. It’s not going to win talking about what race Kamala Harris is. It’s not going to win talking about whether she is dumb. You can’t win on those things. The American people are smart. Treat them like they are smart.”In the last few days, Donald Trump based his campaign on how media is overreporting Kamala Harris rally crown, how Kamala Harris has not given an interview and how she has been copying him. Former House speaker Kevin McCarthy made a similar argument advising Trump to drop the crowd size charge. “Stop questioning the size of her crowds and start questioning her position when it comes to... What did she do as [California] attorney general on crime?” he said. “What did she do when she was supposed to take care of the border as a czar?”","Former GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley said Donald Trump and the Republicans should stop whining about Kamala Harris succeeding Joe Biden's contest. “I take her at her word that she thinks that illegal immigrants should be able to vote and be given driver’s licenses,"" she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112529037,imgsize-900719,width-400,resizemode-4/112529037.jpg"

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.

Hameed has also been accused of multiple violations of the Pakistan Army Act after retirement.“Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City (housing society) case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” the military said in a statement.The management of Top City had accused the former ISI chief of orchestrating a raid on its offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan. As per the petition, filed in May 2017, Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials had taken away valuables, including gold and diamond ornaments and money, in connection with a purported terrorism case.Consequently, according to ISPR, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Hameed under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act.“In addition, multiple instances of violation of Pakistan Army Act post-retirement have also been established,” the statement said.Hameed came into the global spotlight when he was filmed drinking tea in the lobby of a Kabul hotel shortly after the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, forcing the former ruler, Ashraf Ghani, to flee.His transfer out of his ISI post had become a bone of contention between the former PM and the then army chief, Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, which ultimately ended in Imran’s ouster from office in April 2022. Hameed had sought early retirement from the army in Nov 2022.Hameed was among the six senior-most army generals who were nominated by General HQ as a potential candidate for the two top military offices, chief of army staff (COAS) and chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC).

How case unfolded

Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal and the process for his court martial was initiated, the army said on Monday.It is for the first time in the country's history that court martial has been initiated against a former intelligence chief, according to Dawn .“Complying with the orders of Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry, was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” a press statement by Pakistan army said further adding that ""the process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody.”“Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), under provisions of Pakistan Army Act,” the release further said.Hameed was regarded as close aide to Imran Khan, who appointed him to lead the ISI during his tenure as prime minister. Khan was removed from office in 2022 through a vote of no-confidence, which he claims was orchestrated by the military, though the military denies this allegation.In 2022, Hameed was one of the six senior-most generals whose names were forwarded by general headquarters to Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif for consideration for the two top military positions. He, however, chose to seek early retirement and submitted his resignation to the high command, as per sources.The Supreme Court, in its order dated November 14 last year, had said that the allegations against Hameed were of ""extremely serious nature"" and ""would undermine the reputation of the federal government, the armed forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.”This came after the management of Top City, a private housing scheme, made allegations against the former spy-master, accusing him of orchestrating a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.The petition was filed on May 12, 2017, and it said that Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials conducted a raid on Top City's office and Moeez’s residence, seizing valuables such as gold and diamond jewelry and money in connection with an alleged terrorism case, Dawn reported.It also alleged the involvement of former ISI officials Irtaza Haroon, Sardar Najaf, Wasim Tabish, Zahid Mehmood Malik, and Mohammad Munir ""in the illegal takeover of the housing society”.In March, a court placed retired naib tehsildar Najaf Hameed, Hameed's brother, under a 14-day judicial remand.Najaf and other co-accused had sought pre-arrest bail in an FIR filed with the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) in Rawalpindi.The FIR alleged that former minister for mineral resources Hafiz Ammar Yasir had acquired properties worth billions of rupees through intermediaries.In April, the military had reportedly established an inquiry committee to investigate allegations of authority misuse involving the former ISI head.","Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal.

Polio is transmitted through contaminated water or food, or contact with an infected person. Treatment includes bed rest, pain relievers, rehabilitation and portable ventilators.Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO 's regional director of polio eradication was cited by Al-Jazeera as saying that the challenge exists in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. ""This is where there's a lot of militancy, insecurity and community hostility and frustration towards the government because of conflict and a lack of services,"" Jafari said.Over 50 districts across Pakistan are detecting the virus, he said.Compounding to the challenges is the fact, says the WHO official that not only is the polio programme being targeted but also security personnel that are guarding the teams ""because they become soft targets when they are in the community.""At least 102 polio field workers, officials and security personnel have been killed, including at least six in campaigns carried out this year, the Al Jazeera report cited.Meanwhile, the latest victim is an 11-month-old infant from Qila, in Balochistan who has succumbed to paralysis caused by the wild poliovirus.The child from Qila who displayed symptoms of paralysis on July 17, is among the five cases detected in the district. Other cases in Balochistan have been reported in Chaman, Quetta, Zhob, Dera Bugti, and Jhal Magsi as per a report in the Balochistan Post.In Balochistan, the situation is compounded by a recent history of inadequate vaccination coverage and persistent misconceptions about the vaccine.

Asif Merchant: Who is Asif Merchant? Pakistani man with ties to Iran charged in assassination plots in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/who-is-asif-merchant-pakistani-man-with-ties-to-iran-charged-in-assassination-plots-in-us/articleshow/112328015.cms,"Who is Asif Merchant?

Asif Raza Merchant was charged in a complaint unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn with murder-for-hire as part of a scheme to assassinate a politician or US government officials on its soil. Law enforcement said they foiled the charged plot before any attack could be carried out. Merchant, who has stated that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan, is in federal custody in New York. US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said that working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of US government officials on American soil. According to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. FBI director Christopher Wray said the ""dangerous murder-for-hire"" plot allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook. In April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source. In early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a ""finger gun"" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant stated that the intended victims would be ""targeted here"", meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official. Merchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.

The plot by Asif Merchant

A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant , has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil. Prosecutors in Brooklyn announced criminal charges against Asif Merchant, accusing him of travelling to New York for the purposes of trying to hire a hitman for the assassinations. The plot was disrupted before it could be carried out.The document did not name any potential target but CNN reported that former president Donald Trump and other current and former US government officials might be the targets of the plot.Trump was shot at by Thomas Crooks at a Pennsylvania rally last month in which the shooter was killed. This attempt was unrelated to the life threat that Trump had from Iran. US officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump.Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement: ""The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.""Merchant said, as revealed by the document, that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified ""party"" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to ""finalize"" the plan and leave the United States.In mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a ""political person"".Merchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.On June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance. Merchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12 when law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country.(With agency inputs)","A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil.
