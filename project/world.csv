"54-year-old woman, who received pig kidney transplant plus a heart pump, dies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/54-year-old-woman-who-received-pig-kidney-transplant-plus-a-heart-pump-dies/articleshow/111621018.cms,"Lisa Pisano , a 54-year-old woman from New Jersey, passed away on Sunday after living for 47 days with a kidney transplanted from a genetically modified pig . She was the second person to receive such a transplant and was critically ill, suffering from both kidney and heart failure.Pisano underwent the transplant on April 12, just eight days after receiving a mechanical heart pump.Due to inadequate blood flow related to the heart pump, the pig kidney was damaged, and surgeons had to remove it on May 29. Following the explantation, Pisano resumed kidney dialysis but was eventually transitioned to hospice care. Her case was unique, as she was the first person with a heart pump known to have also received an organ transplant , as patients with kidney failure are usually ineligible for heart pumps due to the high risk of mortality.Dr Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, praised Pisano's contributions to the field of xenotransplantation, saying, ""Lisa's contributions to medicine, surgery and xenotransplantation cannot be overstated. Her bravery gave hope to thousands of people living with end-stage kidney or heart failure who could soon benefit from an alternative supply of organs.""Pisano's case follows that of Richard Slayman, 62, who was the first patient to receive a kidney from a genetically engineered pig in March at Mass General Brigham in Boston. Although Slayman was well enough to be discharged two weeks after the surgery, he, like Pisano, had complex medical problems and died within two months.Xenotransplantation has made significant progress in recent years, but the procedures remain experimental. Only patients who are too sick to receive a human organ and are at risk of dying without treatment have been approved to receive animal organs.Biotech companies are striving to address the dire shortage of transplantable organs in the United States, where over 100,000 individuals, primarily in need of a kidney, are on the waiting list. Tragically, many die before receiving a transplant. These companies are focusing on genetic modifications to pigs, aiming to create organs that more closely resemble human ones and reduce the likelihood of rejection by the recipient's immune system.","Lisa Pisano, 54, from New Jersey, passed away on Sunday.

‘Trump will win by a landslide’: Michael Bennet becomes first Democrat Senator to break ties with Biden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-will-win-by-a-landslide-michael-bennet-becomes-first-democrat-senator-to-break-ties-with-biden/articleshow/111620852.cms,"Democratic Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado on Tuesday said that President Joe Biden may struggle to secure victory against former President Donald Trump in the upcoming November 2024 elections in a recent CNN interview. However, he refrained from directly calling for Biden to withdraw from the presidential race, suggesting instead that it is a matter for the president to contemplate.""Donald Trump is on track to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,"" Bennet said.The Democratic Party finds itself deeply divided on the issue of whether to rally behind Biden's reelection campaign, which has been marred by persistent concerns about his health and mental acuity, or to encourage him to step aside.Seven Democratic members of the House of Representatives have openly called for Biden to end his reelection bid, while no Democratic senators had before this made such a request. Biden, for his part, has consistently affirmed his intention to remain in the race.Biden's lackluster performance in the June 27 debate against Trump, coupled with his low public approval ratings, has intensified doubts among some Democrats about his prospects for winning the November 5 election and his ability to handle the demanding responsibilities of the presidency for another four and a half years. Many within the party are concerned that Biden has not adequately reassured voters that his debate performance was an anomaly rather than an accurate reflection of his capabilities.Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer dismissed questions about Biden's fitness, simply saying, ""I'm with Joe,"" during an exchange with reporters following a meeting of Senate Democrats to discuss the president's campaign.Some Democrats have expressed frustration that the party's focus has shifted to Biden's shortcomings rather than uniting against his Republican opponent.An increasing number of Democrats in Congress have voiced concerns about President Biden's ability to defeat Donald Trump in the November 5 election, although closed-door meetings on Tuesday concluded without any plans for collective action. If Trump secures the White House and Republicans gain majorities in both chambers of Congress, he will encounter few obstacles in pursuing significant policy changes.Democrats already face a challenging battle to maintain their slim 51-49 Senate majority, as they must defend multiple seats in states that lean Republican. Republicans currently hold a 220-213 majority in the House.The Democratic Party's leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, provided little information about the hours-long closed-door discussions among Democratic lawmakers, who, in any case, lack the authority to force Biden to withdraw from the race even if they were to reach a consensus on a course of action.","Democratic Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado said that President Joe Biden may struggle to secure victory against former President Donald Trump in the upcoming November 2024 elections.

He is active on social media but not on the field for campaigning. His advisers said Trump is sitting back watching the Democratic chaos unravel -- amid row over his Project 2025 -- from which Trump carefully distanced himself.Monday's fundraiser was Melania's second of the year for Log Cabin Republicans. She opened up the Trump's private penthouse for the event. Guests including former Trump White House official Kellyanne Conway, former Senator Kelly Loeffler and her husband Jeff Sprecher, businessman Bryan Eure and his husband Bill White, former acting director of U.S. National Intelligence Richard Grenell, and philanthropists Nazee and Joseph Moinian, Daily Mail reported. The event raised $1.4 million.Melania wants to dedicate her time to Barron Trump who will be going to the college this year. Reports said Melania was concerned about Barron as Barron never lived on his own and hence Melania does not want to shift to Washington full time if Trump wins.Melania was last seen with Trump when they attended Barron's high school graduation in May. She was there when Trump announced his 2024 presidential bid last year. On being asked about whether she would campaign for Trump, she had said, ""Stay tuned"". But she has mostly remained passive in a stark contrast with Jill Biden who is actively campaigning for President Joe Biden.","Melania hosted an intimate group at Trump Tower to raise money for the Log Cabin Republicans, the largest conservation LGBTQ+ organization.

She said that Holmberg “struck her in the head with the back of his knuckles” aboard the plane, adding that Holmberg “knew [she] had epilepsy and that contact to [her] head could cause a seizure,” the complaint said.The pastor said he was upset about his wife's upgrade to first class because he wanted her to sit next to him.

There are theories

US President Joe Biden's doctor on Monday released a statement addressing concerns about the President's health following the June 27 presidential debate.In the statement, Dr O'Connor confirmed that Biden has not consulted a neurologist outside of his routine annual physical examination. He explained, ""I wanted to share with you background on why Dr Kevin Cannard visited the White House.To protect patient privacy for the thousands of patients of the White House Medical Unit and the physicians who treat them, normally we do not disclose the names of the specialists we work with. However, in the interests of accuracy, I have obtained permission from the President and Dr Cannard to confirm the details I am sharing.""Dr O'Connor also disclosed that as part of Biden's annual physical, the President sees a team of specialists covering various areas, including Optometry, Dentistry, Orthopedics (Foot and Ankle), Orthopedics (Spine), Physical Therapy, Neurology, Sleep Medicine, Cardiology, Radiology, and Dermatology.Connor also released the findings of Biden's health exam conducted in February.Furthermore, Dr O'Connor shared the findings of Biden's health exam conducted in February. The report stated, ""An extremely detailed neurologic exam was again reassuring in that there were no findings which would be consistent with any cerebellar or other central neurological disorder, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's or ascending lateral sclerosis, nor are there any signs of cervical myelopathy. This exam did again support a finding of peripheral neuropathy in both feet. No motor weakness was detected.""The report also noted, ""He exhibits no tremor, either at rest or with activity. He demonstrates excellent fine motor dexterity. But a subtle difference in heat/cold sensation could be elicited as it was last year. This heat/cold sensation deficit was detected a couple of inches higher on his ankle/calf this year, which is not unexpected. There may, in fact, be day to day subjective variation of these findings, as during last year's exam, this area of sensation deficit was actually found to be smaller than the year before.""Administration officials have attributed his perplexed and sometimes incomprehensible responses during the debate with Republican Donald Trump to a head cold, jet lag, and inadequate preparation at Camp David. However, at 81 years old, Biden's health has emerged as a significant concern for many voters as the November election approaches.","US President Joe Biden's doctor released a statement addressing concerns about the President's health following the June 27 presidential debate.

Biden, alongside leaders from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Romania, announced the delivery of strategic airdefense systems to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities.Meanwhile, concerns over Biden's political durability lingered among NATO leaders, who face uncertainties over future U.S. leadership. As discussions on Ukraine's NATO membership and Russia's aggression dominated the summit, Biden's ability to rally allies remained a focal point.In addressing these concerns, Biden is set to hold a rare solo press conference on Thursday, seeking to alleviate doubts and reinforce his administration's foreign policy priorities.

""I encourage my delegates to support Donald Trump next week in Milwaukee.""Haley won't be in attendance in Milwaukee next week, according to spokesperson Chaney Denton.""She was not invited, and she's fine with that,"" Denton said. ""Trump deserves the convention he wants.

US disrupts Russian govt-backed disinformation campaign that relied on AI technology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-disrupts-russian-govt-backed-disinformation-campaign-that-relied-on-ai-technology/articleshow/111614362.cms,"WASINGTON: A Russian internet propaganda campaign backed by the Kremlin that spread disinformation in the United States and relied on artificial intelligence has been disrupted, the Justice Department said Tuesday in announcing the seizure of nearly 1,000 bogus social media accounts . Officials described the operation as part of an ongoing effort to sow discord in the US through the creation of fictitious social media profiles that purported to belong to legitimate users but were actually designed to advance the aims of the Russian government, including by spreading disinformation about its war with Ukraine.US officials said the scheme was organized in 2022 by a senior editor at RT , a Russian-state funded media organization that has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent.It received the support and financial approval of the Kremlin, with an officer of Russia's Federal Security Service - or FSB - leading a private intelligence organization that promoted disinformation through social media.An email to RT was not immediately returned Tuesday.The disruption of the so-called social media bot farm comes as US officials have raised alarms about the potential for AI technology to impact American elections and amid ongoing concerns that foreign influence campaigns by adversaries could shape the opinions of unsuspecting voters, like an elaborate plot by Russians to disrupt the 2016 presidential election through a huge but hidden social media trolling campaign aimed in part at helping Republican Donald Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.""Today's actions represent a first in disrupting a Russian-sponsored Generative AI-enhanced social media bot farm,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. ""Russia intended to use this bot farm to disseminate AI-generated foreign disinformation, scaling their work with the assistance of AI to undermine our partners in Ukraine and influence geopolitical narratives favorable to the Russian government.""Among the fake posts, according to the Justice Department, was a video that was posted by a purported Minneapolis, Minnesota resident that showed Russian President Vladimir Putin saying that areas of Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania were ""gifts"" to those countries from liberating Russian forces during World War II.As part of the disruption, the Justice Department seized two domain names and 968 accounts on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.The FBI and the Cyber National Mission Force also worked with with the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security and law enforcement in the Netherlands on a joint cybersecurity advisory about the social media bot farm.","The Justice Department seized nearly 1,000 bogus social media accounts.

on Biden as Nato summit opens in Washington,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-eyes-and-few-ayes-on-biden-as-nato-summit-opens-in-washington/articleshow/111612893.cms,"WASHINGTON: The world's most formidable military alliance began a three-day meeting in Washington DC on Tuesday, ostensibly to strengthen partnership on its 75th anniversary and pledge greater support to Ukraine in its war with Russia . At the same time, all eyes are on the host, US President Joe Biden , whose re-election bid is in jeopardy on the growing perception that he is infirm and aging rapidly, and the looming shadow behind him of his Republican rival Donald Trump , who has often threatened to dismantle NATO and is seen in many quarters as unhinged.The global geo-strategic gathering against the backdrop of domestic US political drama came even as India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow attracted adverse notice. A state department spokesman said Washington has ""made quite clear directly with India our concerns about their relationship with Russia.” But a sharper reaction came from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who posted photos of a children’s hospital in Kyiv that was struck by a Russian missile on Monday, while tweeting, “It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.""For the moment though, NATO leaders are more concerned with outcome of the struggle the US President is waging to salvage his re-election bid against critics in his own party and liberal elites beyond. That ongoing tussle witnessed further drama on Monday when it was disclosed that a neurologist specializing in Parkinson's disease had visited the White House eight times in the last eight months, a log-book disclosure that rattled the US political cage.The White House eventually explained that the neurological specialist, Dr Kevin Cannard, had indeed examined Biden during each of his annual physicals, but not beyond that. Many of his visits related to regular neurology clinics at the White House Medical Clinic in support of other White House personnel, the President's physician Dr Kevin O'Connor said in a statement.“Many military personnel experience neurological issues related to their service, and Dr Cannard regularly visits the WHMU as part of this General Neurology Practice,” he added.O’Connor stressed that Biden's last physical found no signs of Parkinson's, which he detailed in a February 28 letter, and that the President ""has not seen a neurologist outside of his annual physical.""The clarification did little to assuage concerns of the growing band of Biden critics in the Democratic eco-system who are convinced that the 81-year President will cede White House, and possibly the Senate and House too, to a more physically vigorous Donald Trump. One critic noted that ""July is not February,"" suggesting that the President is slowing down rapidly and will not be able to lead the country effectively for four years even if he were to win the November 2024 election.TV networks on Tuesday wheeled out doctors specializing in Parkinson's, with one physician who said he was a Democrat telling NBC News that Biden is definitely showing symptoms indicating onset of Parkinson's, and that he should drop out of the race in the interest of the party and the country.The physician, Dr Tom Pitts, said Biden is showing ""classic features of neurological degeneration"" including word-finding difficulties; rigidity, including loss of arm swing; standing up robotically; shuffling gait; and low, hypotonic monotone voice, among others.There will be minute scrutiny for any manifestation of those symptoms over the next three days during which Biden -- older than the NATO alliance itself -- will appear in public several times, including at a concluding press conference on Thursday. Even Biden supporters are wishing for a more forceful and energetic leader to lead them, but it is not certain the 81-year old President can pull it off even if he wants to.Any verbal and physical misstep will be amplified and magnified by tv cameras and talking heads, potentially leading to the end of Biden's bid for a second term -- and possibly of NATO too if his rival wins in November.","US President Joe Biden's re-election bid is in jeopardy on the growing perception that he is infirm and aging rapidly.

The storm caused near-record flooding in the Houston area, with bayous like White Oak Bayou and Buffalo Bayou rising nearly 24 feet within nine hours. City officials reported dangerous driving conditions, road delays, closures, and numerous rescues.A heat advisory has been issued for Tuesday across most of southeast Texas , with heat index values expected to reach around 106 degrees, according to the National Weather Service .Hurricane Beryl, which made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, brought heavy rainfall to several parts of the state. Acting Governor Dan Patrick declared a disaster for 121 counties, nearly half of Texas. The storm left approximately two million customers along the mid-to-upper coast and in East Texas without power.CenterPoint Energy expects to restore power to nearly one million customers by Wednesday night. Entergy Texas is still assessing the damage and has not provided an exact date for full restoration, indicating it could take several days.Restoring power to millions of Texans affected by the deadly and destructive storm could take days or even weeks, posing a dangerous scenario for residents without air conditioning as sweltering heat settles over the state. Beryl, which struck southern Texas as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday, knocked out power to more than 2.5 million homes and resulted in at least eight deaths in Texas and Louisiana.As of Tuesday morning, more than 2.3 million people throughout Texas were still without power. The storm, now a tropical depression, unleashed flooding rains and winds that turned roads into rushing rivers, damaged power lines, and uprooted trees. As it moves toward the Midwest, it threatens to trigger more flooding and tornadoes.Extreme heat will bear down on southeast Texas, including the Houston area, on Tuesday and Wednesday, creating hazardous conditions for those working outdoors or without adequate cooling. The National Weather Service in Houston warned that the combination of heat and outdoor cleanup efforts could produce dangerous conditions. Heat is the deadliest form of extreme weather in the U.S., killing more people annually than hurricanes and tornadoes combined.Thomas Gleeson, chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, indicated that restoring power to hard-hit communities will be a multi-day effort. In Galveston, city officials estimate it could take up to two weeks to restore electricity.CenterPoint Energy reported that nearly two million customers were without power Monday night. The utility company stated that the storm's impact was more severe than anticipated, resulting in outages for more than 2.26 million customers at its peak. The company aims to restore power to one million customers by Wednesday night.Houston Mayor John Whitmire, whose home also lost power, assured residents that efforts are underway to restore electricity as quickly as possible. ""We’re going to take care of every community. No community is favored over another community. Every Houstonian is important to us,"" he said.","As of Tuesday morning, more than 2.3 million people throughout Texas were still without power.

A nature influencer, Barron shares her passions for hunting, fishing, noodling, and bowfishing with her 2 million (now) Instagram followers. Her fans frequently praise her content, although she recently went viral due to a controversy over her southern accent .She had come to the limelight after being criticised by foreign policy analyst and news correspondent Sameera Khan on X (formerly Twitter), mocking her accent and questioning her femininity. Khan declared that American women lack femininity, adding, ""This accent needs to be illegal and women should be banned from doing manual labor like this."" She further contrasted American women with Lebanese women, whom she described as ""perfect"" and ""feminine,"" and called Melania Trump ""the ideal.""Barron responded to Khan's criticism in an Instagram video, stating, ""These folks talking about me thinking they're going to offend me, that ship sailed a long time ago. I've been getting picked on my whole life. I grew up around men."" She encouraged her followers to be true to themselves, saying, ""Don't be scared to build your own box and don't try to fit in anybody else's.

Reports claimed Biden's personal physician met Parkinson's expert indicating that Biden is probably under Parkinson's treatment -- a claim that the White House vehemently opposed.Several narratives have been put forward in defense of the 81-year-old president's mental fragility that he is prone to gaffes during the night time and functions perfectly during the day etc. He reportedly told the Democrat governors that he needs more sleep.The WSJ report claims the German officials were aware of Biden's sleep schedule and intentionally kept the meeting early evening so that it could accommodate Biden. but Biden never showed up and Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended the meeting instead and announced that Biden had to go to bed.The report noted that this has been the situation in Biden's inner circle for around two years now with senior White House advisers ""aggressively"" stage-managing Biden's movement and personal interactions.""The White House has limited Biden’s daily itinerary and shielded him from impromptu exchanges.

Subsequently, the party challenged it in the Supreme Court.A 13-member bench headed by Chief Justice Faez Isa and comprising justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Munib Akhtar, Yahya Afridi, Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Athar Minallah, Syed Hasan Rizvi, Shahid Waheed, Irfan Saadat Khan and Naeem Akhtar Afghan heard the case.Chief Justice Isa announced at the conclusion of the proceedings that the panel decided to reserve the verdict for mutual consultation.He did not give any date for the announcement of the judgment, which is expected this week.""We will see if a short judgment can be announced,"" the chief justice remarked while reserving the judgment.Earlier, the Supreme Court on May 6 in a major relief to the PTI, suspended the Peshawar High Court's decision about rejecting the SIC plea.Following the ruling, the ECP on May 14 suspended the victory notifications of 77 candidates who belonged to other parties and were declared successful on the reserved seats.The final ruling by the top court in the case would decide the fate of those 77 reserved seats. Though it may not change the current power structure, the changes in the overall number game in the assemblies may impact the law-making process in the country.The problem of the PTI began when just before the general election, it was deprived of its symbol of cricket bat by the ECP for failure to hold the intra-party election according to its Constitution. It forced PTI to field its candidates as independents.PTI candidates joined the SIC to secure a due share in the reserved seats, but the ECP rejected the SIC plea for reserved seats by saying that it had not contested elections and also did not provide a list of candidates for the reserved seats within the stipulated time, which was mandatory.",Pakistan's Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its judgment in a key petition by the opposition Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party.

Pakistan will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue: Finance minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-will-continue-to-seek-imf-bailouts-if-it-fails-to-boost-tax-revenue-finance-minister/articleshow/111580232.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has warned that the cash-strapped country will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue , according to a media report on Monday. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader in an interview with the the UK-based Financial Times newspaper said that he was ""relatively confident"" of reaching a staff-level agreement with the Washington-based global lender this month for an estimated loan of $6-8 billion.Aurangzeb, however, said, ""It will not be our last fund programme if we don't bring our tax revenues up.""Last month, the federal government passed the tax-laden Rs 18,877 billion budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, amidst protests from the Opposition which labelled it as an International Monetary Fund-driven document that was harmful to the public.Weeks after slashing the fuel prices ahead of the Eid ul Adha festival, the cash-strapped Pakistan government on July 1 sharply hiked their prices for the next fortnight as it began the new fiscal year.The tax rises will mostly fall on salaried workers, who comprise a relatively small part of Pakistan's mostly informal economy , as well as some retail and export businesses, Geo News reported.The budget also threatened punitive measures for tax avoiders, including restrictions on mobile phones, gas and electricity access and the ability to fly abroad.""We do not have five years for our programme,"" Aurangzeb warned in the wake of a budget that seeks to reset the country's ailing economy. ""We have to start showing, start delivering, in the next two to three months,"" he said.The finance minister said the direction of travel is positive, and investors are showing confidence in the stock market , referring to the KSE-100 index.Still, the government faces a considerable challenge in putting Pakistan on the path for longer-term growth and debt sustainability , he said.The country's debt has soared since the mid-2000s, as authorities failed to invest the money from loans into productive and export-oriented sectors, Geo News reported.Instead, the country remains reliant on imports, forcing Islamabad to borrow to pay off existing and accumulating debts, Aurangzeb said.""We need to create the capacity to repay loans,"" the finance minister said. ""As long as this economy stays import-based, what happens is the moment it heats up, ""we run out of dollars [and] we have to go back to the lender of last resort on our knees.""Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has travelled recently to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China to solicit investments on top of the IMF programme, which would be Pakistan's 24th with the multilateral lender.","Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb says Pakistan will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue.

The allocation for PSEs in the 2024-25 budget saw a dramatic increase, reaching PKR 1.267 trillion, largely earmarked for subsidies and grants, marking a 104 per cent surge from the previous fiscal year.The State Bank of Pakistan 's latest report reveals a notable decrease in PSE borrowing during FY23, contrasting sharply with the PKR 43.5 billion borrowed in FY24 alone, adding to the existing debt burden. Despite receiving substantial funding from the ADB, which initiated the USD 300 million Public Sector Enterprises Reform Programme (PSERP) in 2016, aimed at enhancing corporate governance and operational efficiency, meaningful reforms have been elusive.Former finance minister Ishaq Dar, during his tenure, committed to improving PSE performance, particularly in sectors like railways, Pakistan Steel, and Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). However, the political sensitivity surrounding the privatisation of major PSEs, significant employers in a job-scarce economy, has hindered progress on critical economic reforms.""The ADB's support began with a USD 300 million loan for sub-programme one in June 2016, followed by an additional USD 300 million for sub-programme two in 2017, aimed at sustaining and expanding initial reform efforts,"" noted an ADB report. Despite these efforts, the transformation of loss-making entities such as PIA and Pakistan Steel remains a contentious issue, highlighting the challenges of balancing economic imperatives with political realities, according to Dawn.Many PSEs continue to rely heavily on government subsidies and credit guarantees to maintain operations, underscoring persistent governance and accountability deficiencies. The ADB's objectives included enhancing transparency, performance management, and revenue generation in PSEs, aligning their operations with commercial principles to improve service delivery and financial sustainability.The failure to implement comprehensive reforms has perpetuated the financial woes of PSEs, jeopardising fiscal stability and inhibiting broader economic development, Dawn reported.

If investigations proceed, the chief election commissioner will face Article 6 (guilty of high treason).”“I will never succumb to the tyranny of time; I am prepared to die in jail. As long as I live, I will wage this battle,” Imran remarked.About national security, he highlighted the necessity of a strong relationship with Afghanistan. “Why did Bilawal Bhutto and our foreign minister not visit Afghanistan? Without support from the Afghan govt, we cannot win this war (against TTP) across a 2,500-km-long border,” he added.","Imran cites ongoing concerns over Justice Isa’s involvement in benches handling PTI cases and his personal cases. Imran also expressed disappointment over a cancelled meeting with his legal and political teams. “I will never succumb to the tyranny of time; I am prepared to die in jail,” Imran remarked.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111522849,imgsize-1671561,width-400,resizemode-4/111522849.jpg"

Edicts and some of the methods used to enforce them constituted a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the report said.The Taliban set up a ministry for the ""propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice"" after seizing power in 2021.Since then, the ministry has enforced decrees issued by the Taliban leadership that have a disproportionate impact on women and girls, like dress codes, segregated education and employment, and having a male guardian when they travel.""The punishments attached to non-compliance with instructions and decrees are often arbitrary, severe and disproportionate,"" said the report from the UN Mission in Afghanistan. ""Sweeping bans with a discriminatory effect on women have been introduced. Human rights violations, as well as the unpredictability of enforcement measures, contribute to a climate of fear and intimidation among segments of the population.""The mission said it documented at least 1,033 instances between August 2021 and March 2024 where ministry employees applied force during the implementation of orders, resulting in the violation of a person's liberty, and physical and mental integrity.""This includes the use of threats, arbitrary arrests and detentions, excessive use of force by de facto law enforcement officials and ill-treatment.""

Taliban reduces government salaries of Afghan women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-reduces-government-salaries-of-afghan-women/articleshow/111582765.cms,"The Taliban government in Afghanistan has significantly reduced the salaries of women employed in the public sector , reported news agency AFP on Monday citing the finance ministry .""Women who are at home and do not go to the office... their salaries are 5,000 Afghanis ($70) a month,"" Ahmad Wali Haqmal, the finance ministry spokesman, told AFP.Women working in segregated areas, such as government hospitals or schools, will still receive their full salaries based on their positions.Previously, women in the public sector, including university professors who are now banned from campus, could earn up to around 35,000 Afghanis. Administrative roles in ministries typically paid around 20,000 Afghanis, but many saw their salaries reduced to approximately 15,000 after the Taliban takeover.While these women continue to receive payment, their salaries have been slashed. The measure comes even as Afghan women have been forced to avoid work since the ultra-Islamist group seized power in 2021.One 25-year-old woman, who requested anonymity for security reasons and has been working for the Information and Culture department outside Kabul since early 2021, reported that her salary has dropped from 10,000 Afghanis. She uses her income to support her family of seven, including her ill mother, but the reduced salary barely lasts her two weeks.""Making women stay at home is already a very big problem for us -- we are in a very bad mental and psychological condition -- and now that our salaries have decreased, this has only worsened,"" she told AFP.The salary change, which took effect in July, is expected to impact tens of thousands of women employed in the public sector, according to the finance ministry spokesman.Since regaining power in 2021, the Taliban authorities have severely restricted women's freedoms based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law , which the United Nations has described as "" gender apartheid .""Women have been excluded from public life, with bans on education and access to public parks, gyms, and baths.Afghanistan has been devastated by decades of war and has long relied on international aid , which has significantly decreased since the Taliban's return to power.
