Yahya Sinwar named Hamas leader: What does his appointment means for Gaza-Israel tensions?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/yahya-sinwar-named-hamas-leader-what-does-his-appointment-mean-for-gaza-israel-tensions/articleshow/112332579.cms,"Who is Yahya Sinwar

Rise within Hamas

Imprisonment and education

After release

Hamas announced Yahya Sinwar as its new political leader on Tuesday, following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran .In a statement, the group said, ""The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas announces the selection of Yahya Sinwar as the head of the political bureau of the movement,"" reported AFP.Notably, Israeli military officials accuse Sinwar of being one of the masterminds behind the October 7 attack on Israel, making him one of Israel's most wanted militants.Minutes after the announcement, Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, reported firing a barrage of rockets from the Gaza Strip toward Israel.Born in Gaza in 1962 during the tumultuous period surrounding the creation of the state of Israel, Sinwar’s experiences influenced his decision to join Hamas in the 1980s.Recruited by Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Sinwar became the head of an internal security unit known as Al Majd. His role involved punishing those suspected of violating Islamic laws or collaborating with Israel, which eventually led to his arrest by Israeli authorities, according to the New York Times.Imprisoned in 1988 for the murder of four Palestinians accused of apostasy or collaboration with Israel, Sinwar spent over two decades in an Israeli prison. During this time, he learned Hebrew, studied Israeli culture, and translated extensive Hebrew-language materials about Israeli security practices into Arabic.Israeli dentist Yuval Bitton, who treated Sinwar in prison, noted that Sinwar used his translated materials to educate fellow inmates about counterterrorism tactics. Sinwar, who described himself as a ""specialist in the Jewish people's history,"" focused his conversations on Hamas rather than personal matters.While imprisoned, Sinwar wrote a novel titled ""The Thorn and the Carnation,"" a coming-of-age story reflecting his own experiences. The novel depicts the life of a Gaza boy under Israeli occupation and the resistance's demands for sacrifice.Sinwar told an Italian journalist that prison is a crucible. ""Prison builds you,"" he said, adding that it gave him time to reflect on his beliefs and the price he would be willing to pay for them.Released in 2011 as part of a prisoner swap, the new Hamas political leader remarked that capturing Israeli soldiers was the most effective strategy for securing the release of Palestinians held by Israel. ""For the prisoner, capturing an Israeli soldier is the best news in the universe, because he knows that a glimmer of hope has been opened for him,"" Sinwar said at the time.Post-release, Sinwar married and started a family, though he has remained private about his personal life. He once mentioned that his son's first words included ""drone,"" highlighting his ongoing focus on conflict.Sinwar’s hard-line position suggests he is unlikely to support a cease-fire with Israel that would end the fighting in Gaza and resolve the situation of around 115 hostages still held by Hamas. According to Israeli and US intelligence sources, Sinwar aims to prolong the conflict to undermine Israel's international standing and its relationship with the United States.","Hamas announced Yahya Sinwar as its new political leader on Tuesday.

Black Lives Matter: Black man dies in Milwaukee hotel incident: 4 employees charged in case resonates with George Floyd's tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/black-man-dies-in-milwaukee-hotel-incident-4-employees-charged-in-case-resonates-with-george-floyds-tragedy/articleshow/112332138.cms,"Four employees of a Milwaukee hotel have been charged with being parties to felony murder in connection with the death of D’Vontaye Mitchell on Tuesday.According to a criminal complaint, the incident occurred on June 30 at the Hyatt Hotel when Mitchell was forcibly removed after entering a women’s restroom. The employees allegedly held him face down for eight to nine minutes.During this time, one employee noted that Mitchell struggled to breathe and repeatedly pleaded for help, as reported by AP.The autopsy report revealed that Mitchell suffered from morbid obesity and had cocaine and methamphetamine in his system.The Milwaukee County District Attorney’s office announced that arrest warrants had been issued for all four employees. However, neither the District Attorney’s office nor the Milwaukee Police Department immediately responded to inquiries about whether the employees had been arrested or had obtained legal counsel.Surveillance footage from the Hyatt Hotel captures D’Vontaye Mitchell running frantically into the hotel lobby, then into the gift shop before entering a women’s restroom. Moments later, a woman exits the bathroom, and an off-duty security guard visiting the staff at the time pulls Mitchell out of the bathroom by his shirt and into the lobby.At this point, a bellhop, a front desk worker, and Todd Erickson, an on-duty security guard, join in restraining Mitchell by holding him face down for eight to nine minutes until police and emergency personnel arrive.The video footage shows Mitchell attempting multiple times to break free, with Erickson striking him with a baton until Mitchell eventually becomes unresponsive, according to the complaint.A video taken by a witness includes audio of Mitchell moaning and apologizing. The autopsy found that Mitchell was morbidly obese and had cocaine and methamphetamine in his system.The medical examiner determined that Mitchell's cause of death was “restraint asphyxia.” The examiner noted that Mitchell might have survived if the employees had allowed him to turn onto his side, according to the complaint.Erickson told investigators that Mitchell was strong, resisted, and attempted to bite him. However, Erickson stated that he did not intend to harm Mitchell.The off-duty guard reported hearing women screaming in the bathroom after Mitchell entered and suspected he was under the influence of drugs. At one point, the guard said he adjusted Mitchell’s clothing to uncover his face.The front desk worker told investigators that Mitchell was not in a “stable sort of mind” and was speaking “gibberish,” the complaint said. He recalled Mitchell mentioning difficulty breathing while being held down but couldn’t remember exactly what was said. He instructed the bellhop to stop applying pressure, which the bellhop did. The front desk worker noted that Mitchell displayed “clear signs of extreme distress, including gagging, labored breathing, and repeated pleas for help,” according to the complaint.The complaint concludes that the employees must have known Mitchell was in distress. “All of these factors—the gasping, the actions and words of DM, and his visible distress—indicate that all four defendants were aware that holding DM face down was ‘practically certain’ to impair his physical condition,” it states.Mitchell’s family and their attorneys had previously reviewed the hotel surveillance video provided by the District Attorney’s office. They described seeing security guards chasing Mitchell inside the hotel, dragging him outside, and beating him.Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Mitchell’s family, stated that a bystander’s video circulating on social media shows security guards kneeling on Mitchell’s back and neck.Aimbridge Hospitality, the company managing the hotel, previously announced that several employees involved in the incident had been terminated. The company’s media representatives did not immediately respond to phone calls or emails on Tuesday evening.The incident has drawn comparisons to the murder of George Floyd , a Black man who died in 2020 after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for approximately nine minutes. Floyd’s death ignited nationwide protests and sparked a national conversation on race relations.","D’Vontaye Mitchell was forcibly removed from the Hyatt Hotel in Milwaukee after entering a women’s restroom.

This experience of displacement had a profound impact on his decision to join Hamas in the 1980s.Sinwar was recruited by Hamas' founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who appointed him as the head of an internal security unit called Al Majd. His responsibility was to identify and punish individuals suspected of violating Islamic morality laws or collaborating with the Israeli occupiers.

US visa status unknown

DHAKA: A day after the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , Bangladesh ’s parliament in capital Dhaka was busy with protesters coming to celebrate.“It’s the freedom of the young generation,” said student Parvez Hossain, 30, among the crowds in front of the building, which was empty of lawmakers after parliament was dissolved on Tuesday. Protesters had stormed the building on Monday, jumping on tables and setting off what appeared to be smoke bombs.Hossain spoke of his hope for a new start and idealism for abetter future.“Now we have regained the freedom of Bangladesh. We want to build the country in a new way again.” The unrest began last month with student-led protests against govt job quotas and escalated into mass demonstrations calling for Hasina, who had been in office since 2009, to quit.But while busy streets and open shops in Dhaka gave the initial appearance that daily life was nearly back to business as usual, at least 10 people were killed on Tuesday, and security remained a concern. The charred ruins of offices of the former governing party Awami League and looted houses of those seen loyal to Hasina showed the scale of bitter violence in the chaos at the end of her rule.The death toll in the violence climbed to 440, with 100 more deaths reported after Hasina fled the country, according to local media. At least 24 people were burnt alive on Monday night in a hotel owned by a leader of Awami League of in western Joshor district, hospital sources told PTI. The victims, mostly boarders, included an Indonesian national.Hundreds of Hindu houses, businesses and temples have been vandalised since Hasi na’s ouster, a community association said. The EU heads of mission in Dhaka appealed to all parties to exercise restraint and reject communal violence.In the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday. The Bangladesh Police Association said it was launching a strike across the country because of a lack of security after numerous police stations were attacked and “many” officers were killed, though it didn’t give any number of the dead. It said officers would not return to work unless their safety is assured. The association also apologised for violent police attacks on student protesters, saying officers had be en “forced to open fire” and had been cast as the “villain”.On the first day after the fall of Hasina’s govt, a tense atmosphere prevailed at the Secretariat, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported. Attendance in the ministry offices was significantly low, and ministers and MPs were notably absent.The military reshuffled several generals, demoting some seen as close to Hasina, and sacking Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared and USsanctioned Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.The streets of Dhaka appeared calmer, with no reports of new violence as jubilant protesters thronged Hasina’s resi dence. Some posed for selfies with soldiers guarding the building, where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings, flowerpots and chickens. The capital’s main airport resumed operations after an 8-hour suspension.Garment factories, which supply apparel to some of the world’s top brands and are a mainstay of the economy, will reopen on Wednesday after being shut due to the disruptions.Meanwhile, there has been speculation that the US has revoked the visas of Hasina, her sister Sheikh Rehana, and her ministers and officials. When asked by journalists, a spokesperson at the US embassy in Dhaka said: “Visa records are confidential under US law.”","At least 10 people were killed on Tuesday, and security remained a concern.

Did Netflix donate $7 million to Kamala Harris's campaign?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-netflix-donate-7-million-to-kamala-harriss-campaign-the-truth-behind-the-boycott-claims/articleshow/112331969.cms,"Clarification from Netflix

The source of the donation

Fact-checking the claims

Social media has erupted with calls for a boycott of Netflix after unfounded rumors spread that the streaming giant donated $7 million to Vice President Kamala Harris 's presidential campaign.While Reed Hastings , co-founder and executive chairman of Netflix, did make a substantial donation, the company has clarified that it did not contribute any funds to Harris's election efforts.The misinformation began circulating online on August 2, 2024, with a viral Facebook post claiming, ""Netflix just donated $7 million to Kamala, BYE BYE Netflix! Cancel your subscription today.""Similar messages quickly spread across platforms like X, TikTok, Instagram, and even in Spanish-language posts following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race and his endorsement of Harris.In response to the claims, a Netflix said, as quoted by AFP on August 1, 2024, ""This is a personal donation from Reed [Hastings] and has no connection to Netflix."" The company emphasized that it has not made any financial contributions to Harris’s campaign. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) confirms that corporate donations to federal campaigns are illegal, although corporations may create political action committees (PACs) to support candidates indirectly.Hastings, known as a significant donor to the Democratic Party, personally gave $7 million to a PAC supporting Harris’s presidential bid. According to a July 2024 report from The Information, Hastings stated that this was his largest donation ever to a single candidate. This money was channeled to a super PAC, which can accept unlimited contributions, rather than directly to Harris’s campaign.Andrew Mayersohn, a researcher at OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that monitors political spending, explained that direct contributions to presidential candidates are capped at $3,300 per election, or $6,600 for both primary and general elections. Larger donations are typically directed to PACs, which have different regulations.Despite the viral posts, other fact-checking organizations have confirmed that Hastings' donation was directed to a super PAC named Republican Accountability PAC and not directly to Harris’s campaign.Anne Zald, an expert in government regulation, stated that the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1972 strictly prohibits corporations and unions from making direct campaign contributions, a rule implemented amid concerns from the Watergate scandal and has been amended over the years.","The misinformation began circulating online on August 2, 2024, with a viral Facebook post claiming, ""Netflix just donated $7 million to Kamala, BYE BYE Netflix!""

'Mindless killing changed everything': How Bangladesh's quota protests ended Sheikh Hasina's 15-year reign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/mindless-killing-changed-everything-how-bangladeshs-quota-protests-ended-sheikh-hasinas-15-year-reign/articleshow/112295042.cms,"Driving the news

In a broadcast to the nation on state television, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, the army chief of Bangladesh, announced that Hasina had resigned and that the military would form a caretaker government .

. Dressed in military fatigues, Waker said, ""The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence.""

This announcement came shortly after jubilant crowds stormed and looted Hasina's residence.

In Dhaka, demonstrators scaled a monument dedicated to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the current Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, and the founding father of Bangladesh. Once atop the statue, the protesters proceeded to use an axe to forcefully remove and damage the sculpted head of the revered figure.

External affairs minister S Jaishankar met PM Narendra Modi and briefed him developments in Bangladesh.

Meanwhile, Hasina reached India aboard a Bangladesh Air Force C-130J military transport aircraft, PTI reported quoting sources.

It remains uncertain whether the military transport plane will carry her onward from India or if she will switch to another aircraft for her journey to London, the PTI report said.

Why it matters

With over 32 million young people out of work or education in Bangladesh, the protests have tapped into widespread frustration over limited opportunities and economic challenges.

The absence of Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh's political landscape may exacerbate the country's already precarious situation.

Bangladesh, one of the world's most densely populated countries, faces high levels of unemployment, pervasive corruption, and the dire consequences of climate change. These crises have already placed a significant strain on the nation, and the departure of its leader could further compound these issues.

Zoom in

The unrest began in July 2024 when students initiated demonstrations demanding the abolition of a government job quota system that allocated a significant percentage of positions to the descendants of war veterans from the 1971 independence conflict.

The protests intensified after the high court reinstated a 30% job quota for the families of freedom fighters, sparking widespread outrage among students and young professionals who argue that the quotas perpetuate inequality and hinder merit-based hiring.

The government's attempt to reduce the quota to 5% failed to quell the unrest, with demonstrators demanding the complete abolition of the quota system.

The situation escalated dramatically on August 4, 2024 as violent confrontations erupted between protesters and supporters of the ruling Awami League , Chhatra League, and Jubo League activists.

, Chhatra League, and Jubo League activists. The protesters were mainly organized by the Students Against Discrimination, with the sole demand of Hasina's resignation over the job quota system.

So far, over 300 have died in these protests since July.

'Mindless killing changed everything'

What they are saying

""The country is going through a revolutionary period. ""I promise you all, we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility and I assure you to not get disheartened,"" the Bangladesh army chief said.

""I request you all to be a little patient, give us some time and together we will be able to solve all the problems,"" Zaman added. ""Please don't go back to the path of violence and please return to non-violent and peaceful ways.""

""15 consecutive years of power have been shattered by a people’s revolution. In the end, the Iron Lady had feet of clay,"" said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center.

""Bangladesh has achieved its second independence now,"" Abu Sayem told Reuters in Whitechapel, a London neighbourhood home to a large Bangladeshi community . ""We actually got our independence first in 1971 but autocrat Sheikh Hasina was ruling the country forcibly. She has snatched away our rights. She has killed thousands of children.""

What it means for India

Under Hasina, Bangladesh has emerged as one of the most trusted allies of India in South Asia.

Harsh Vardhan Shringla, the former foreign secretary of India, expressed concerns that an unstable Bangladesh could contribute to instability in certain regions of India.

""An unstable Bangladesh can add to instability in parts of our country, which we do not want to see. So, a peaceful, prosperous, stable Bangladesh is India's best. It is very important that we work with all concerned to ensure that our interests and those of Bangladesh are secured,"" Shringla told ANI.

Shringla expressed confidence that Indian representatives would engage with the relevant individuals in Bangladesh to protect India's broader interests and constructively promote peace and stability in the region.

""We have strong ties across the board in a multifaceted manner in Bangladeshi society. And, we will engage any political or any other organization that we need to in the furtherance of our larger interests and those of Bangladesh,"" he said.

What's next

The Hasina chapter seems to be over for Bangladesh. Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Hasina's son, told BBC that there would be no political come back for her. She was ""so disappointed that after all her hard work, for a minority to rise up against her,"" Joy said.

Hasina's departure ""would leave a major vacuum"" and that the country was in ""uncharted territory"". ""The coming days are critical, as it moves toward what will hopefully be a peaceful transition,"" Kugelman said.

""The key now is to move the process along, to create the interim set-up, to ease uncertainty and reduce the risk of more volatility.""

Now, all eyes will now be on the army chief.

Bangladesh was thrown into turmoil on Monday as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down from her position and left the nation. Her resignation followed a brutal suppression of protests that had escalated from demonstrations against employment quotas into a full-scale movement calling for her removal from power. The crackdown resulted in the deaths of hundreds of individuals.The violent crackdown on protesters, which resulted in hundreds of deaths, fueled anger and resentment.""The killings definitely stand as the most brutal retaliation by a government on any civic movement in the post-liberation Bangladesh history—and may be that of the subcontinent. We shudder at the thought of how a civilian government could allow its law enforcers to attack its own people with such brutality. The killing was not just an event, but one that took place over several days. Wasn't there any reflection, any afterthought and reassessment at the end of the first, second or third day that such heartless and continuous killing of one's own people must stop,"" said Mahfuz Anam in column ""Mindless killing changed everything"" published in Daily Star.(With inputs from agencies)","Bangladesh's army chief announced that Hasina had resigned and that the military would form a caretaker government.

Background and early political career

Vice Presidency and transition to presidential candidate

Facing Republican criticism

Kamala Harris has made history by securing the Democratic presidential nomination, becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party's ticket in US history . This landmark achievement reflects a significant milestone in American politics as Harris prepares to campaign for the presidency.The Democratic National Committee confirmed Harris’s nomination following a decisive victory in the primaries.Her success marks a groundbreaking moment, as she becomes the first African American and South Asian American woman to top a major party's presidential ticket.Harris’s rise to the top of the Democratic ticket follows a notable career as a US Senator from California and Vice President under President Joe Biden. Her journey from a prosecutor to the second-highest office in the land and now to the top of the Democratic ticket underscores her significant impact on the national stage.Harris and her team moved swiftly to secure the necessary support from the 1,976 party delegates, reaching this milestone just 32 hours after Biden’s exit. The Democratic National Convention delegates confirmed Harris's nomination through a five-day online balloting process, with 99 percent of delegates casting their votes in her favor. The formal certification of the vote is scheduled for later this month, followed by a celebratory roll call at the convention in Chicago.An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll revealed that 46 per cent of Americans view Harris favorably, while a similar percentage holds an unfavorable view. Despite this, Harris’s candidacy has energized the Democratic base, offering a stark contrast to former President Donald Trump. Her campaign plans to continue the themes of democracy, gun violence prevention, and abortion rights, while leveraging her prosecutorial background to address Trump’s legal challenges.Born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, Harris is the daughter of Shyamala Gopalan, an Indian breast cancer researcher, and Donald Harris, a Jamaican economics professor. Her parents' advocacy for civil rights shaped her early political outlook. Harris’s career began as a prosecutor before becoming California’s Attorney General in 2010 and a U.S. Senator in 2016.Harris's initial presidential campaign in 2020 ended before the Iowa caucuses due to internal issues and shifting campaign strategies. However, her selection as Biden's vice presidential running mate in 2020 marked a turning point, leading to her prominent role in the administration.As Vice President, Harris faced challenges, including leading diplomatic efforts on Central American migration and navigating public scrutiny. Her visibility increased following the Supreme Court’s 2022 Roe v. Wade ruling, where she became a key spokesperson for abortion rights.Following Biden’s exit from the race, Harris’s campaign has gained momentum, particularly in battleground states. Her renewed candidacy has sparked significant enthusiasm among Democrats, with donations and volunteer support surging.Harris is expected to face intense scrutiny from the Trump campaign, which has already begun defining her candidacy with attacks on her immigration record and questioning her diversity. Harris has responded by emphasizing her commitment to unifying the country and addressing divisive rhetoric.","The Democratic National Committee confirmed Harris’s nomination following a decisive victory in the primaries.

His initial reaction was confusion, as there was no apparent panic among the passengers.In a subsequent interview with the People, Judelson described the scene, noting that the woman’s rush seemed overly dramatic for the situation. He and another passenger wondered why she was so frantic, since everyone would be deplaning together.Judelson recounted, “I look around, no one’s on the ground, no one’s freaking out. I’m like, ‘it can’t be that dire.'” Upon landing, the situation became more peculiar. “As soon as we land, this woman across the aisle from me shoots up and rushes to the front of the plane,” he ewas quoted as explaing, noting that it seemed like an exaggerated urgency to be the first off the aircraft.The situation grew even stranger when passengers were told they would face a 12-hour delay and were given hotel vouchers. Judelson’s confusion deepened as he questioned whether they were stuck in Phoenix indefinitely.American Airlines confirmed that the flight was diverted because of a medical emergency. However, the details were initially unclear until Judelson heard through word of mouth that the actual reason was a lice outbreak. Passengers were discussing how bugs had been seen in a woman's hair, which led to the emergency landing.Despite the unexpected disruption, the passengers were able to continue their trip to New York, though with an unplanned detour.","TikTok creator Ethan Judelson was on an American Airlines flight that was forced to make an emergency landing in Phoenix.

Why Kamala Harris picked Tim Walz for Vice President,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-kamala-harris-picked-tim-walz-for-vice-president/articleshow/112333164.cms,"Labor-Friendly

Ticket Balance

GOP Attacks

Vice President Kamala Harris’ choice for her running mate came down to two governors — one who offered to deliver the most populous 2024 battleground but threatened to alienate important party factions, and a little-known contender with progressive credentials from a reliably blue state.In the end, Harris bypassed the pick from a more politically valuable state — Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro — for Minnesota’s Tim Walz , opting for a folksy governor whose mocking of Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance as “weird” became a rallying cry for Democrats.Walz’s selection completes a two-week makeover of the Democratic ticket after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, and it focuses the party’s hopes of defeating Trump on turning out the very progressive voters and rank-and-file labor members whose support for the sitting president had eroded.Walz’s task is clear: Bring back Democratic blocs who drifted from Biden, while sharpening the party’s message on the economy — a defining issue — to expand the party’s appeal in states including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.The potential for Walz to unite the party’s base and expand its appeal was immediately evident by the support he received from independent Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia — a onetime centrist Democrat — and Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a liberal firebrand.Manchin said Walz could “bring normality back to the most chaotic political environment” many have seen. Ocasio-Cortez said Harris and Walz would “govern effectively, inclusively, and boldly,” calling his addition to the ticket “an excellent decision” in a post on X.The pick is in some ways symbolic of the way in which Harris’ candidacy has upended an electoral map that just last month had Republicans eying Minnesota as a potential pickup.Walz, 60, demonstrated his plain-spoken approach, which helped him win six terms in the House from a rural, conservative-leaning district and two terms as governor, ahead of his selection.“These guys are just weird,” Walz said, an insult casting Trump as out-of-the-norm and energizing Democrats who often struggled to find the right counter to the former president. Trump, a convicted felon who espouses policies that offer to test the boundaries of US law, was the frontrunner against Biden for much of the summer.Walz was hailed by progressives and leaders of organized labor, who had pushed for his selection. AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler praised him Tuesday as a “labor champion who will stand up for working people.”As governor, Walz signed legislation providing free breakfast and lunch to students, and expanded child care and paid family and medical leave — achievements Democrats hope resonate with voters hard-hit by high prices and anxiety over jobs and wages. Pocketbook issues will be central to Democratic messaging as Harris looks to counter one of her biggest liabilities — voter dismay with Biden’s handling of the economy.Trump has made inroads with blue-collar workers, an effort Republicans sought to bolster with Vance’s starkly populist economic approach. Vance’s message is one Walz will be tasked with countering. While Harris can boast endorsements from union leaders, support has been less solid among labor’s rank-and-file who are wary of the Biden administration’s clean energy push.Walz emerged from a shortlist of mostly White, male elected officials, including Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, seen as bringing balance to an already historic ticket. Harris is seeking to become the first Black woman and first Asian-American US president.Before entering politics, Walz served in the Army National Guard and worked as a high-school teacher. In the House, he focused largely on the military and veterans as well as agricultural issues — areas where he can bolster Harris’ standing.He’s often displayed an independent streak — earning an endorsement from the National Rifle Association before going on to back gun restrictions, and as one of a handful of Democrats who once voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt. Holder would go on to lead Harris’ vetting of running mates.Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised Walz Tuesday. “Growing up as a child working on the farm, Governor Tim Walz knows the heartland of America,” she said in a statement.Carrying Walz’s own state offers to be an afterthought for Democrats. Minnesota last voted for a Republican for president in 1972, when Richard Nixon carried the state in a national landslide. Neighboring Wisconsin, though, is a swing state and Walz’s birthplace of Nebraska does not award its five electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, leaving room for a pick-up.Shapiro offered to deliver the party Pennsylvania, which has the most Electoral College votes of the seven battleground states, but his support for Israel in its war against Hamas threatened to spur a revolt from the Democratic left.Vance criticized Harris for not picking Shapiro, blaming “antisemitism in their own caucus” in an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt.One challenge Walz must overcome is the lack of a national profile. An ABC News/Ipsos poll of American adults from July 26-27 found 57% said they didn’t know what impression they had of Walz, and almost one-third had no opinion of him.Republicans delighted in the pick, attacking Walz as too liberal for voters and resurfacing images of civil unrest in his state after the murder of George Floyd — signaling that crime and race will be persistent themes in the election.Trump at a July rally in Minnesota cast Walz as failing to control the protests in 2020. “When the violent mobs of anarchists and looters and Marxists came to burn down Minneapolis four years ago, remember me, I couldn’t get your governor to act,” Trump said.In a bid to define Walz, Trump’s campaign labeled him a “dangerously liberal extremist” in a statement Tuesday and a video assailed him as “a rubber stamp” for Harris’ agenda.Walz, the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, was also criticized by their counterparts — the Republican Governors Association.“His record shows that he consistently backs the most liberal policies that national Democrats have to offer,” RGA Executive Director Sara Craig said in a memo.He’ll get his first test Tuesday evening at a Philadelphia rally, as he looks to introduce himself to voters.Republican former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty said Walz could deliver Harris’ liberal philosophy with a different style.“He’s like Bernie Sanders in hunting gear,” Pawlenty said.","Tim Walz, a Minnesota governor, was selected as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate.

Kamala waltzes to the left by choosing progressive Tim Walz as running mate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-waltzes-to-the-left-by-choosing-progressive-tim-walz-as-running-mate/articleshow/112332503.cms,"WASHINGTON: Kamala Harris on Tuesday chose Tim Walz , the progressive Democrat governor of Minnesota, as her running mate for the 2024 prez election, doubling down on the left-liberal orientation of the ticket. Walz, a 60-year-old former military veteran, teacher and father of two, was Harris’ eventual pick over Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, who was an odds-on favourite for his more centrist stand , but whose pro-Israel leanings appear to have gone against him.“I am proud to announce that I’ve asked @Tim_Walz to be my running mate. As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he’s delivered for working families like his. It’s great to have him on the team,”Harris wrote on social media. “It is the honor of a lifetime to join @kamalaharris in this campaign. I’m all in. Vice President Harris is showing us the politics of what’s possible. It reminds me a bit of first day of school,” Walz responded.A balding avuncular man with bushy white eyebrows, Walz is little known nationally, but has become a social media celebrity in recent days for his scorching, rapid-fire and caustic attack on Trump Republicans, including caricaturing them as “weird”. He has generated more punchlines in a few weeks than most politicians do in a lifetime, including predicting that Trump will “have his ass handed to him” by a black woman in 2024. He is also avowedly progressive, having codified into law in Minnesota the right to abortion, universal free school meals regardless of income, legalised recreational marijuana and giving voting rights to former prisoners.He has also won several elections in Minnesota, which is often said to be the reddest blue state (or bluest red state) in the country because it has elected Republican governors and senators as well given the GOP majorities in both state legislative chambers — except when it comes to presidential elections, where it last voted Republican (Richard Nixon) in 1972. Walz also has Washington DC experience, having been a fiveterm congressman before resigning from the House of Re presentatives in 2019 after being elected Minnesota governor .Expectedly, Trump Republicans immediately jumped on Walz record, of which he is unapologetic, calling him “radical” and “dangerously liberal”, as they have done with Kamala Harris. They reminded voters that Walz was the governor during the Minneapolis riots, and accused him of adopting a state flag similar to Somalia’s and providing drivers license for illegal aliens in Minnesota.Indeed, the shadow of the West Asia conflict hung over Kamala’s decision, given that Shapiro, an observant Jew, was seen as strongly pro-Israel, with a stand that was seen as putting off young American voters agitated by Israel’s actions. On the flip side, some commentators see her choosing Walz over Shapiro as endangering her winning Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state with 19 electoral votes that are crucial to reaching the 270 needed to winning the presidency.Shapiro, however, took the rejection like a sport, at least publicly. “My work here in Pennsylvania is far from finished — there is a lot more stuff I want to get done. Over the next 90 days, I look forward to travelling all across the state to unite Pennsylvanians behind my friends Kamala Harris and Tim Walz and defeat Donald Trump,” he said. Prez Biden Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi among other party veterans also welcomed the choice of Walz, noting his progressive credentials.Harris, meanwhile, formally secured Democratic presidential nomination on Monday.","Tim Walz, a former military veteran, teacher and father of two, was Harris’ eventual pick over Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro.

National and demographic trends

Impact of independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

What once appeared to be former President Donald Trump 's race to lose has transformed into a closely contested battle as Vice President Kamala Harris gains traction, buoyed by a surge in polling and the addition of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.Since President Joe Biden's surprising decision to end his reelection bid and endorse Harris late last month, the Vice President has seen her support swell, narrowing the gap with Trump.According to the latest national polling average tracked by The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Trump holds a razor-thin lead with 47.1% support to Harris's 47%. This represents a significant tightening from the more than 6-point advantage Trump held when Harris first announced her candidacy.The Hill/Decision Desk HQ model isn't alone in showing a shift. Nate Silver’s electoral forecast now places Harris ahead of Trump for the first time. This reversal comes after Trump consistently led against Biden and initially Harris, with Silver now labeling the race a “toss-up.”Democrats have found renewed hope in several battleground states . Decision Desk HQ reports that nine out of ten key states have shown a trend favoring Harris. North Carolina, a state where Democrats have not won since Barack Obama’s narrow 2008 victory, has seen Trump’s lead diminish from 10 points to just 3. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper (D) expressed confidence on Sunday that Harris could finally turn the state blue.Other battlegrounds are also in play. Nevada polls, though few, show Trump's lead shrinking from 9 to 3 points since Biden's exit. In Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Michigan, Harris has closed the gap, gaining 2, 4, and 3 points respectively.Harris’s national standing has also improved. A CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday shows her with a 1-point lead over Trump and tied at 50% in critical battleground states. The poll reflects increased enthusiasm among Democratic voters, with 85% planning to vote this fall, up from 81% last month.In a Morning Consult poll released Monday, Harris holds a 4-point lead over Trump, the largest margin for any Democratic candidate in nearly a year. Her appeal extends to independents, where she leads Trump by 5 points, and among younger voters aged 18 to 35, where she has a 9-point advantage—a demographic where Biden struggled.Polling also suggests Harris is better positioned than Biden in a three-way race that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. While Trump had a slight edge over Biden in such matchups, Harris holds a narrow 1.5-point lead according to the averages from DDHQ and The Hill, with FiveThirtyEight showing similar results.Despite the favorable shift for Harris, the race remains tight, indicating that both candidates will need to energize their bases as the general election approaches. Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio previously suggested that Harris might enjoy a temporary boost in the wake of her announcement. Whether this so-called honeymoon period will last remains an open question, as both candidates gear up for a fiercely contested fall campaign.",Kamala Harris has seen her support swell since Vice President Joe Biden announced his endorsement of her for the presidency late last month.

In a political landscape often dominated by well-known figures, Guv Tim Walz of Minnesota has emerged as a fresh face on the national stage. Once relatively unknown outside the Midwest, Walz has quickly risen to prominence following President Biden's withdrawal from the race, paving the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the ticket with Walz as her running mate.Tim Walz has recently become a social media darling, with users across platforms commenting on his Midwestern “dad vibes” and relatable, down-to-earth persona.This online buzz has amplified his profile, turning him into an unexpectedly popular figure among Democrats, reported the NYT.Walz made headlines when he described former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, as ""weird"" during a recent television appearance. This label quickly caught on, becoming a key talking point for Democrats and setting the tone for the campaign.A memorable moment of Walz’s governorship came when he signed a bill naming a highway after the iconic musician Prince. Not only did he name the highway in Prince’s honor, but he also signed the bill in purple ink, paying tribute to the artist's legacy in Minnesota, reported NYT.Before his political career, Walz was a high school social studies and geography teacher. His teaching career began in Alliance, Nebraska, and later moved to Mankato, Minnesota. His background in education remains a core part of his identity, often reminding people of their own high school history teacher.In 1989, Walz spent a year teaching English in China through a program affiliated with Harvard University. This experience not only broadened his worldview but also left him with a working knowledge of Mandarin.Walz’s military background is another cornerstone of his public persona. He served in the Army National Guard for 24 years, including a deployment to Italy during Operation Enduring Freedom. As reported by NYT, his military service has shaped his views and leadership style, earning him respect across party lines.Representing Minnesota's First District, a predominantly rural area, Walz served in Congress for over a decade. He was one of the few Democrats from the rural Midwest, advocating for veterans' affairs, healthcare, and other key issues. His ability to win in a conservative-leaning district showcases his appeal across different voter bases.Walz was an early advocate for gay rights, sponsoring a gay-straight alliance at Mankato West High School in the 1990s. This stance was particularly bold given his conservative district, and he continued to champion LGBTQ+ rights throughout his political career.Over the years, Walz has shifted from a moderate to a more progressive stance, especially after running for governor in 2018. His evolving positions on issues like gun control reflect a broader trend in his political journey as he adapts to the changing dynamics within the Democratic Party.Walz is a Lutheran, often referencing his “Minnesota Lutheran” roots with humor. He and his wife, Gwen, have two children, both conceived through in vitro fertilization, a process they have spoken about openly to highlight the challenges and stigma surrounding fertility treatments.If elected, Walz would be the third vice president from Minnesota, following in the footsteps of Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale. His selection underscores the Midwest's growing influence in national politics and reflects the Democrats' strategy of broadening their appeal.Tim Walz brings a unique blend of experience, relatability, and regional appeal to the Democratic ticket, positioning himself as a compelling choice in the upcoming election.","Tim Walz has emerged as a fresh face on the national stage.

JD Vance (Ohio) at a rally in Philadelphia.In a spirited speech, Walz took aim at Trump and Vance, echoing a viral new characterization of the Trump campaign. “I just have to say it.You know it. You feel it. These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell. That’s what you see,” Walz told the energized crowd, drawing loud applause.Walz warned that a second Trump presidency would be even more damaging than the first, predicting a rollback of key social programs and a nationwide abortion ban. “If Trump gets a chance to return, he’s going to pick up exactly where he left off four years ago. Only this time, it will be much, much worse,” Walz said, highlighting the stakes of the upcoming election.The Minnesota governor contrasted his working-class background with Trump’s wealth and privilege. “He never sat at that kitchen table, like the one I grew up at, wondering how we were going to pay the bills. He sat at his country club in Mar-a-Lago, wondering how he can cut taxes for his rich friends,” Walz said.Turning his attention to Vance, Walz accused his vice-presidential rival of sharing Trump’s “dangerous and backward agenda.” Walz sarcastically noted Vance’s privileged path to prominence, “Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on! That’s not what middle America is,” Walz said, expressing eagerness for the upcoming debate.Walz’s selection as Harris’s running mate came after a competitive “veepstakes” following President Biden’s unexpected decision to exit the 2024 race. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly were also considered top contenders for the vice-presidential slot.The Harris-Walz ticket is set to challenge the Trump-Vance ticket this fall, with Walz’s rise fueled by his recent viral branding of Republicans as “weird,” a term now being embraced by other leading Democrats.","Tim Walz made a strong debut as Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, launching sharp attacks against former President Donald Trump and Republican vice-presidential nominee Sen.

But Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, despite being the frontrunner, could not make it to the ticket and many blame it on his ethnicity -- he is a Jewish.“I genuinely feel bad that for days, maybe weeks, (Shapiro) actually had to run away from his Jewish heritage because of what the Democrats are saying about (him),” Vance said. “I think that’s scandalous, disgraceful — (regardless of) whatever you believe or whatever disagreements on policy you have about somebody.”“The fact that that race — the vice presidential race on the Democratic side — became so focused on his ethnicity, I think it’s absolutely disgraceful, and it’s insulting to Americans, whatever background you’re from,” Vance added.",JD Vance said Kamala Harris had to bend to the far left of the Democrats to choose Tim Walz over Josh Shapiro as Walz is one of the most far-left radicals in the entire United States.

Asif Raza Merchant was charged in a complaint unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn with murder-for-hire as part of a scheme to assassinate a politician or US government officials on its soil. Law enforcement said they foiled the charged plot before any attack could be carried out. Merchant, who has stated that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan, is in federal custody in New York. US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said that working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of US government officials on American soil. According to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. FBI director Christopher Wray said the ""dangerous murder-for-hire"" plot allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook. In April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source. In early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a ""finger gun"" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant stated that the intended victims would be ""targeted here"", meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official. Merchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.

The plot by Asif Merchant

A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant , has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil. Prosecutors in Brooklyn announced criminal charges against Asif Merchant, accusing him of travelling to New York for the purposes of trying to hire a hitman for the assassinations. The plot was disrupted before it could be carried out.The document did not name any potential target but CNN reported that former president Donald Trump and other current and former US government officials might be the targets of the plot.Trump was shot at by Thomas Crooks at a Pennsylvania rally last month in which the shooter was killed. This attempt was unrelated to the life threat that Trump had from Iran. US officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump.Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement: ""The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.""Merchant said, as revealed by the document, that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified ""party"" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to ""finalize"" the plan and leave the United States.In mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a ""political person"".Merchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.On June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance. Merchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12 when law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country.(With agency inputs)","A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil.

Trump's 'Thank You'

CNN commentator Van Jones said Tuesday that Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro was sidestepped by Kamala Harris because he is Jewish. Kamala Harris picking Minnesota governor Tim Walz ""was her caving in to some of these darker parts in the party"" in terms of appeasing ""anti-Jewish bigots"" that have ""gotten marbled into this party"", Van Jones said.“You can be for the Palestinians without being an anti-Jewish bigot, but there are some anti-Jewish bigots out there,” Jones said.“And there has to be conversations about how much of what just happened is caving into some of these darker parts in the party. So that’s going to have to get worked out. It’s going to have to get talked through.”“So here’s the challenge you’ve got in this party, and people don’t want to talk about it,” Jones continued. “We got to talk about it. On the one hand, you have a lot of young people concerned about Gaza. You have a lot of Muslims and Arabs and others. They have not felt seen by the Biden administration.”Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz and Mark Kelly were the top contenders for the job to reach the last round with Shapiro being viewed as the top candidate. Shapiro is extremely popular in Pennsylvania -- a must win state for Kamala Harris.But Shapiro's stance on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, as a Jewish, stood out as problematic for the party as Shapiro has been nicknamed as 'Genocide Josh'“This VP pick tells you more about who she didn’t pick,” Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) wrote on the social platform X. The path to victory was so obvious to anyone with a political brain. The fact that she didn’t pick Josh Shapiro is another red flag in the disturbing anti-semitic trend of the Progressive Democrats.”“The Left did it to Joe Lieberman. Now, they did it to Josh Shapiro,” former Republican White House press secretary Ari Fleischer wrote in a social media post. “The D party is not home for strong supporters of Israel. It’s time for the Jewish community to recognize the power in the D party rests with its anti-Israel progressive base.”A source close to the Trump campaign said that Kamala caved to the 'Hamas caucus' and instead of picking the candidate with charisma and a moderate record, she picked a charisma black hole with a long record of supporting extreme liberal policies and a history of being close to China.Tim Walz taught in China and is fluent in Mandarin.After Kamala Harris named Tim Walz, Donald Trump without alluding to it posted 'Thank You' on Truth Social.A top Trump adviser told NBC: ""Hamas Harris bent the knee to antisemitic, anti-Israel radicals on the left by leapfrogging Shapiro.

Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy. For a nation largely comprising very young people, this would be an unmitigated disaster as it could have repercussions that may spill over generations. Already struggling to compete, the Pakistpeople will end up being deprived of even more chances to realise their potential and contribute positively on a global scale,"" the editorial said.According to the website DataReportal, there were 71.70 million active social media user identities in Pakistan in January 2024. YouTube is Pakistan's most-used social media platform in 2024 with a potential ad audience of 71.70 million. Data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 54.38 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Pakistan at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 38.9 per cent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.Meanwhile, according to Samaa TV, the Pakistan government has made previous attempts to regulate VPN usage by requiring registration, but these efforts have not resulted in significant action. In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions. The PTA also passed VPN regulations in 2010, but enforcement has been inconsistent.","Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others.

Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, who addressed reporters alongside the party's secretary-general Omar Ayub Khan outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail where the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician is lodged since last August, said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has decided to expand the opposition alliance in a meeting with Imran Khan on Thursday, Geo News reported.Qaiser announced that the former ruling party would gather all opposition parties to run a powerful anti-government movement. He said that the party's forthcoming power show in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swabi was aimed at raising a ""strong voice"" for the release of the PTI founder and other detained leaders.""This country will only be governed in accordance with the law and the Constitution,"" Qaiser emphasised.During his address, Qaiser also rebuked the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government over skyrocketing power bills. He said the bloated electricity bills were ""unacceptable"" for the inflation-hit masses.The PTI leader also said that they support Jamaat-e-Islami's (JI) sit-in - underway on Rawalpindi's Murree Road since July 26 - against the massive hike in power bills.However, JI Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman has said that his party would not become part of the PTI proposed grand alliance as history suggests that the opposition parties use such platforms for self-interest.""We will have the same stance as the opposition parties on some issues and hold meetings with them, but we will not become part of any alliance,"" Naeem said on Thursday.Ayub, while addressing the same press conference, appealed to the masses to attend the public gathering in Swabi on August 5 in large numbers from across the country to show solidarity with the former premier.Responding to criticism against the PTI founder for demanding negotiations with the Pakistan Army, Ayub said that they did not hold any discussion regarding the dialogue, however, he added that Khan made it clear that the military belongs to the nation and vice versa.He further said that the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were trying to drive a wedge between the military and the nation.Commenting on the cases against the jailed ex-prime minister, the opposition leader said that they were fighting a legal battle for Khan's release. Ayub blamed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for stopping the release of former first lady Bushra Bibi despite having no connections with the Toshakhana corruption case.The PTI secretary general demanded Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq to recuse themselves from hearing the PTI founder's cases, Geo News reported.The PTI believes he is being arrested in more cases at the behest of the powerful military establishment to make sure that he does not come out of jail.Khan was first arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a 190-million-pound corruption case.

However, Imran Khan's lawyer requested the IHC Chief Justice Amir Farooq to recuse himself from the case.He said that Farooq should not hear the case as Khan had registered a complaint against him in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). The lawyer called for the transfer of the case to another bench.Although Farooq rejected the request for recusal, he had to constitute a new bench as Justice Imtiaz went on summer vacation, and the previous bench was dissolved.
