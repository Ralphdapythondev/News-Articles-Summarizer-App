ICC Arrest Warrant Against Bibi?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/icc-arrest-warrant-against-bibi/articleshow/109704128.cms,"Israeli officials increasingly believe that the International Criminal Court is preparing to issue arrest warrants for senior govt officials on charges related to the conflict with Hamas , according to five Israeli and foreign officials. The Israeli and foreign officials also believe the court is weighing arrest warrants for members of Hamas.If the court proceeds, the Israeli officials could potentially be accused of preventing the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and pursuing an excessively harsh response to the Hamas-led Oct 7 attacks on Israel , according to two of the five officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.Israeli officials said they believe that PM Benjamin Netanyahu is among those who might be named in a warrant. It is not clear who might be charged from Hamas or what crimes would be cited. The officials did not disclose the nature of the information that led them to be concerned about potential ICC action.Arrest warrants from the court would probably be seen in much of the world as a humbling moral rebuke, particularly to Israel, which for months has faced international backlash over its conduct in Gaza. It could also affect Israel’s policies as the country presses its military campaign against Hamas.The Israeli and foreign officials said they didn’t know what stage the process was in. Any warrants would require approval from a panel of judges and would not necessarily result in a trial or even the targets’ immediate arrest. Karim Khan , the court’s chief prosecutor, has previously confirmed that his team is investigating incidents during the war, but his office declined to comment for this article, saying that it does not “respond to speculation in media.”Netanyahu’s office also would not comment, but Friday the PM said on social media that any intervention by the ICC “would set a dangerous precedent that threatens the soldiers and officials of all democracies fighting savage terrorism and wanton aggression.” Netanyahu did not explain what prompted his statement.Based in The Hague, the ICC is the world’s only permanent international court with the power to prosecute individuals accused of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. The court has no police force of its own. Instead, it relies on its 124 members, which include most European countries but not Israel or the US, to arrest those named in warrants. It cannot try defendants in absentia. But warrants from the court can pose obstacles to travel for officials named in them.If the ICC does issue arrest warrants, they would come with deep stigmatisation, placing those named in them in the same category as foreign leaders such as Omar al-Bashir, the deposed prez of Sudan, and Russia Prez Putin, who was the subject of a warrant last year tied to his war against Ukraine.",Israeli officials believe that PM Benjamin Netanyahu is among those who might be named in a warrant.

US says five Israeli units committed abuse before Hamas attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/us-says-five-israeli-units-committed-abuse-before-hamas-attack/articleshow/109703991.cms,"WASHINGTON: The United States has concluded that five Israeli military units committed serious human rights violations against Palestinians in the West Bank before the Hamas attack in October, the State Department said Monday.Four of these units have taken remedial measures, State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters, with consultations under way with the Israeli government over the fifth unit.""After a careful process, we found five Israeli units responsible for individual incidents of gross violations of human rights,"" Patel said.All of this behavior took place before the October 7 Hamas attack and it was not in Gaza, he added.Patel declined to identify the units or say what measures the Israeli government had taken against them.Press reports have identified a battalion called the Netzah Yehuda, composed mainly of ultra-Orthodox Jews, as being accused of abuses.US law bars the government from funding or arming foreign security forces against which there are credible allegations of human rights abuses.The United States provides military aid to its allies around the world, including Israel.The Israeli army has been fighting the militant Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip for almost seven months and is trading fire almost every day with Hezbollah along the border with Lebanon. Both groups are backed by Iran .Hamas' October attack in Israel resulted in the deaths of about 1,170 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,488 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.","U.S. finds five Israeli military units committed serious human rights violations.

Ukraine retreats from eastern front; Nato chief blames military aid delay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-retreats-from-eastern-front-nato-chief-blames-military-aid-delay/articleshow/109704203.cms,"KYIV: Russian troops have captured or entered around a half-dozen villages on Ukraine’s eastern front over the past week, highlighting the deteriorating situation in the region for outgunned and outnumbered Ukrainian forces as they wait for long-needed US military aid .“The situation at the front has worsened,” Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky , Ukraine’s top commander, said in a statement Sunday in which he announced that his troops had retreated from two villages west of Avdiivka , a Ukrainian stronghold in the east that Russia seized earlier this year, and another village farther south.Military experts say Moscow’s recent advances reflect its desire to exploit a window of opportunity to press ahead with attacks before the first batch of a new US military aid package arrives in Ukraine to help relieve its troops. Congress recently approved $60 billion in military aid for Ukraine, and Prez Biden signed it last week.During a visit to Kyiv on Monday, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said the many months it took Congress to approve new military aid to Ukraine and Europe’s failure to deliver ammunition on time had led to “serious consequences on the battlefield”. “When we are not delivering as we should, then Ukrainians are paying the price,” he said.","Russian troops have captured or entered around a half-dozen villages on Ukraine's eastern front over the past week.

Anti-war stir: US colleges raise questions on outsiders’ role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/anti-war-stir-us-colleges-raise-questions-on-outsiders-role/articleshow/109704230.cms,"LOS ANGELES: Colleges around the US implored pro-Palestinian student protesters to clear out tent encampments with rising levels of urgency Monday as classes wrap up for the semester and campuses prepare for graduation ceremonies .Protests were still active at a number of campuses. Near George Washington University, protesters at an encampment breached and dismantled the barriers Monday used to secure University Yard.Protesters at Yale University set up a new encampment with dozens of tents Sunday afternoon, nearly a week after police arrested nearly 50 demonstrators and cleared a similar camp.At least one school, the University of Southern California, cancelled its main graduation ceremony this spring. Others are asking the protests to resolve peacefully so they can hold their ceremonies. Protesters on both sides of the rancorous debate shouted and shoved each other during duelling demonstrations Sunday at the University of California, Los Angeles.About 275 people were arrested Saturday at various campuses, including Indiana University at Bloomington, Arizona State University and Washington University in St. Louis. The number of arrests nationwide has surpassed 900 since New York police removed a pro-Palestinian protest encampment at Columbia University and arrested more than 100 demonstrators on April 18.Colleges have cited property damage, outside provocateurs, antisemitic expressions or just failures to heed warnings as reasons to arrest students. Many school leaders have insisted that people outside their colleges are stoking the confrontations, despite limited evidence backing their claims. In many cases, the groups of protesters have mostly involved students and university employees, but a notable exception was at Washington University on Saturday. Of the 100 arrests made, only 23 were students and four were employees, the university said Sunday.","Protesters on both sides of the rancorous debate shouted and shoved each other during duelling demonstrations Sunday at the University of California, Los Angeles.

'Harvard protesters replace US flag with Palestinian one amid anti-Israel stir',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-protesters-replace-us-flag-with-palestinian-one-amid-anti-israel-stir/articleshow/109677443.cms,"In a provocative display at Harvard University, anti-Israel protesters replaced the American flag with a Palestinian one at a prominent location traditionally reserved for the Stars and Stripes. The incident, which occurred on Saturday, saw three students hoisting the Palestinian flag over the iconic John Harvard statue, escalating tensions amid ongoing campus demonstrations.The action coincided with a series of protests across the US in response to Israel's military actions against Hamas, sparked by the deadly October 7 attacks which resulted in over a thousand Israeli casualties.Similar protests have been reported at other Ivy League schools and campuses nationwide, including Columbia University, a New York Post report said.A Harvard spokesperson condemned the flag replacement, saying, “The flags raised by protesters over University Hall were removed by Harvard facilities staff. The actions are a violation of University policy and the individuals involved will be subject to disciplinary action.”The incident has stirred significant online debate. X user Mor Hogeg criticized the protesters' motives, stating, “These pro-Hamas protesters’ sole agenda is to eradicate every western value and every basic human right while establishing an Islamic Sharia law regime. They are starting with the Jews in Israel as their main objective and will continue with the entire west. It is not a fight of Israel against Hamas – the fight is between a culture of life and a culture of death. WAKE UP!”Another commenter, Mark Isaacson, suggested a more severe response: “This is where the National Guard needs to be called in,” highlighting a perceived lack of adequate role models among political leaders for young people.The Harvard Crimson reported that no US flag was flying at the time of the incident, noting that the American flag is typically displayed from Monday to Friday and stored properly at other times. The university has a history of displaying flags of visiting dignitaries at the site but the Palestinian flag incident has marked a significant deviation spurred by the current geopolitical tensions.","Three students hoisted the Palestinian flag over the iconic John Harvard statue, escalating tensions amid ongoing campus demonstrations.

Mutual Fund KYC issues: What problems are MF investors facing with new rules and how they can check their KYC status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/mutual-fund-kyc-issues-what-problems-are-mf-investors-facing-with-new-rules-and-how-they-can-check-their-kyc-status/articleshow/109691202.cms,"How To Check Mutual Fund KYC Status

1) KYC Validated:

2) KYC Registered:

3) KYC On Hold:

Mutual Fund KYC issues : Since April, several mutual fund investors have had their folios frozen due to non-compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) norms. The Securities and Exchange Board of India instructed KYC registration agencies ( KRAs ) to verify mutual fund unitholders' KYC information based on PAN, name, address, mobile number, and email IDs.The goal was to match and validate investors' records with official databases such as the Income Tax (IT) database and Aadhaar card.However, it was discovered that the records of many investors, particularly old-timers who completed KYC using documents other than PAN or Aadhaar, could not be validated. As a result, these investors have been requested to redo their KYC.Although redoing the KYC process appears to be straightforward, investors, distributors, and investment advisors have reported delays in updating the required documents at the KRAs' end, even after submitting them. According to an ET report by Prashant Mahesh, the AMC may reject your application for fresh investments unless the KYC is approved. This situation has caused inconvenience and frustration for affected mutual fund unitholders who are trying to comply with the renewed KYC requirements.To check your Mutual Fund (MF) Know Your Customer (KYC) status, visit www.cvlkra.com and select the KYC inquiry option. The website will provide you with one of three possible results:If you receive this status, you are fully compliant and can proceed with your investments. According to data from KRA agencies, approximately 73% of investors belong to this category.This status indicates that the KYC documents submitted by the investor cannot be directly verified based on the provided documentation. However, aspects such as email and mobile number have been validated, allowing you to continue investing in MFs where you already have investments. If you wish to open a new folio with a different fund house, you will need to submit a fresh set of KYC documents. Around 15% of investors fall into this category.There is a benefit for those holding mutual fund units in demat form here. They can continue to transact with any AMC. However, they cannot open an account with another intermediary.This status applies to cases where PAN-Aadhaar seeding has not been completed, email and mobile validation has failed, or the KYC was done without an officially valid document like a bank statement or utility bill. In this situation, the investor must complete 'PAN-Aadhaar Seeding' in their Income Tax records to make the PAN operational and redo the KYC process. After completing this step, the investor should share their updated email and mobile number with the fund house and submit a modification request to the KRA, who will then update the status. Currently, 12% of investors fall under this category.While KYC can be completed using officially valid documents such as a passport, driving license, or voter ID, but distributors believe that Aadhaar should be the primary document for KYC. The challenge arises when KRAs are unable to cross-verify data in a passport, preventing the KYC status from moving to validated. Other details like PAN can be verified through the Income Tax portal, while mobile numbers and emails can be authenticated through OTPs.NRIs face the maximum problem as they are not mandated to have an Aadhaar card, while many do not have an Indian mobile number where OTP comes for authentication. This situation leads to NRI investors without Aadhaar having their KYC status in the 'Registered' category, which is unlikely to change. Distributors have advised NRIs to complete their KYC every time they invest in a new fund house. However, there is uncertainty regarding whether AMCs will accept investments in new folios without a ""KYC Validated"" status.","Since April, several mutual fund investors have had their folios frozen due to non-compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) norms.

NEW DELHI: Ruling out any agreement, former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that he is ready to endure additional nine years behind bars rather than engage in any negotiations with what he termed as the forces that have ""enslaved"" the nation.In his message, Khan highlighted what he described as the imposition of the ""worst dictatorship"" on the country, warning of its detrimental effects on the economy, governance, democracy and the judiciary.Having spent the past nine months in prison due to what he claimed are ""fake and concocted cases,"" Khan affirmed his readiness to continue serving time if necessary. ""I will remain in jail if I have to for nine more years, or more, but I will never strike a deal with those who have enslaved my nation”, Khan said in a statement.Since his ouster from power through a no-confidence motion in April 2022, the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician has faced convictions in multiple cases, leading to his imprisonment at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi. Khan's political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has encountered challenges following his fall-out with the influential military, including arrests and defections, particularly after the unrest sparked by his arrest last year.Khan's statement follows remarks by PTI leader Shehryar Afridi, who asserted the party's willingness to engage in dialogue excluding certain political factions. He dismissed the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz as a ""rejected lot"" and reiterated the PTI's commitment to engaging with the army chief for Pakistan's future.Addressing speculation regarding alleged negotiations, PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan reaffirmed the party's disinterest in and denial of any talks with external entities.Independent candidates supported by the PTI secured over 90 seats in the National Assembly during the February 8 general elections. However, a post-election alliance formed by the PMN-L and the PPP sidelined the PTI, preventing it from forming a federal government.","Imran Khan says he is ready to endure additional nine years behind bars.

Columbia suspends pro-Palestinian protesters after stalemate in talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columbia-suspends-pro-palestinian-protesters-after-encampment-talks-stall/articleshow/109708467.cms,"(With Reuters input)

NEW YORK: After days of stalemate in talks seeking end of pro-Palestinian protest on campus, Columbia University on Monday began suspending protestors who refused to dismantle a tent encampment on its New York City campus.University President Nemat Minouche Shafik said in a statement that days of negotiations between student organizers and academic leaders had failed to persuade demonstrators to remove the dozens of tents set up to express opposition to Israel 's war in Gaza .The crackdown at Columbia, which is at the center of Gaza-related protests causing turmoil on university campuses across the US in recent weeks, occurred when police at the University of Texas at Austin apprehended numerous students who were sprayed with pepper spray at a pro-Palestinian rally.Columbia sent a letter on Monday morning to alert students that failure to leave the encampment by 2 pm (Eastern Time) and sign a form agreeing to follow university policies would result in suspension and make them unable to finish the semester successfully.""We have begun suspending students as part of this next phase of our efforts to ensure safety on our campus,"" said Ben Chang, a university spokesperson, at a briefing on Monday evening.""The encampment has created an unwelcoming environment for many of our Jewish students and faculty and a noisy distraction that interferes with the teaching, learning and preparing for final exams,"" Chang said.Earlier, Shafik said Columbia would not divest from finances in Israel, a key demand of the protesters. Instead, she offered to invest in health and education in Gaza and make Columbia's direct investment holdings more transparent.Protesters have vowed to keep their encampment on the Manhattan campus until Columbia meets three demands: divestment , transparency in university finances, and amnesty for students and faculty disciplined for their part in the protests.""These repulsive scare tactics mean nothing compared to the deaths of over 34,000 Palestinians. We will not move until Columbia meets our demands or we are moved by force,"" leaders of the Columbia Student Apartheid Divest coalition said in a statement read at a news conference following the deadline.Numerous students, faculty, and outside observers vehemently criticised Shafik for calling the New York City police two weeks ago to disband the encampment.After more than 100 arrests were made, the students rebuilt the encampment on a lawn lined with hedges on the university grounds shortly after the police action on April 18.Since that time, students at many campuses across the United States, from California to New England, have established similar encampments to express their frustration with the Israeli military action in Gaza and the perceived involvement of their schools in supporting it.The rallies supporting Palestine have caused a heated discussion on campus about the boundary school authorities should set between freedom of speech and hateful language.Students who are protesting against Israel's military offensive in Gaza, including Jewish peace activists, have mentioned that they are facing accusations of antisemitism simply for criticizing the Israeli government or showing support for Palestinian rights.""The movement itself is not antisemitic,"" said Nicholas Fink, a freshman history major at Columbia who has not participated in the protests.",University President Nemat Minouche Shafik said in a statement that days of negotiations between student organizers and academic leaders had failed to persuade demonstrators to remove the tents.

Gunfire persisted for a few minutes following the initial shooting.WSOC-TV reported that their helicopter recorded an armored vehicle driving through yards and knocking over recycling bins. Subsequently, officers removed a person with blood on their shirt, who was then taken to an ambulance .After the home was cleared, the helicopter pilot mentioned that he was unable to display the front lawn of the home due to the disturbing nature of the scene.

Stowaway cat gets from Utah to California in Amazon package,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stowaway-cat-gets-from-utah-to-california-in-amazon-package/articleshow/109704317.cms,"Galena, a 6-year-old cat , was found in an Amazon warehouse a week after she climbed into a 3-by-3-foot cardboard box at her owner ’s home.When Carrie Clark got a phone call on April 17 from a veterinarian in California informing her that her pet, which had vanished from her Utah home a week earlier, had been found some 500 miles (804km) away, her first reaction was disbelief.“I could not believe that it was true,” Clark said in an interview on Sunday night. “I told her: I think this is a prank.”It wasn’t. Galena, her 6-year-old American shorthair, had sneaked inside a 3-by-3-foot cardboard Amazon returns package alongside five pairs of steel-toed boots. Then the cat was transported two states away to one of the company’s warehouses, where it was discovered by Amazon employees.Galena survived the unexpected journey without any food or water, Clark said. Despite her ordeal, Galena was in relatively good health with no issues apart from mild dehydration, Clark said. Two factors had helped: One seam on the box had come unglued, allowing oxygen to circulate, and mild weather kept Galena from overheating or freezing. Clark said she thought that Galena got into the box while her husband was packing it, by jumping inside when he left to fetch some tape to seal it up. “She doesn’t meow a lot and she loves boxes, so for her, she was really happy in that moment. Although I’m sure that wasn’t the case later on.”Since the box already weighed over 30 pounds, Clark and her husband did not notice the added weight of a stowaway when they mailed it on April 10, she said. But they did quickly notice that their shy, indoor cat was missing that same day. After days of searching the house and the neighbourhood turned up nothing, worst-case scenarios started running through her mind, Clark said. Had Galena darted outside? Had she been snatched up by a predator?“We had absolutely no idea what had happened,” Clark said. Then she received the call from a veterinarian in Riverside, Calif. An Amazon employee, Brandy Hunter, had brought Galena in, and the veterinarian identified her through her microchip and contacted Clark. Hunter wrote on Facebook. “We have gotten some pretty crazy things in my time but never anything like this!” Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.When Clark got the call, she and her husband quickly booked a flight to California to be reunited with Galena. “It was such a miraculous moment.”","Galena, a 6-year-old American shorthair, had sneaked inside a 3-by-3-foot cardboard Amazon returns package alongside five pairs of steel-toed boots.

How Columbia University's complex history with the student protest movement echoes into today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-columbia-universitys-complex-history-with-the-student-protest-movement-echoes-into-today/articleshow/109703051.cms,"Columbia University

, 2024 and Columbia University, 1968

Students are aware of the history

Not everyone supports the protests

NEW YORK: College students taking up space and making demands for change. University administrators facing pressure to get things back under control. Police brought in to make arrests. At other schools: students taking note, and sometimes taking action.The pro-Palestinian demonstration and subsequent arrests at Columbia that have set off similar protests at campuses nationwide these days and even internationally aren't new ground for students at the Ivy League school .They're the latest in a Columbia tradition that dates back more than five decades - one that also helped provide inspiration for the anti-apartheid protest of the 1980s, the Iraq war protests, and more.""When you're going to Columbia, you know you're going to an institution which has an honored place in the history of American protest,"" said Mark Naison, professor of history and African & African American Studies at Fordham University and himself a participant in the 1968 demonstrations. ""Whenever there is a movement, you know Columbia is going to be right there.""It's part of Columbia's lore, students taking part in this month's demonstrations point out - recognized by the school itself in commemorative anniversary programming and taught about in classes.""A lot of students here are aware of what happened in 1968,"" said Sofia Ongele, 23, among those who joined the encampment in response to this month's arrests.The end of an academic year was also approaching in April of that year when students took over five campus buildings. There were multiple reasons. Some were protesting the university's connection to an institute doing weapon research for the Vietnam War; others opposed how the elite school treated Black and brown residents in the community around the school as well as the atmosphere for minority students.After several days, Columbia's president allowed a thousand New York Police Department officers to be brought in to clear most demonstrators out. The arrests, 700 of them, were not gentle. Fists were flying, clubs swinging. Dozens of students and more than a dozen officers were injured.It's never been forgotten history. That includes now, when pro-Palestinian students calling on the university to divest from any economic ties to Israel over the war in Gaza set up a tent encampment earlier this month and more than 100 were arrested. It helped spark similar demonstrations at campuses around the country and world.The storied protest past is one of the reasons Ongele chose Columbia for college and came here from her native Santa Clarita, California. ""I wanted to be in an environment where people were indeed socially conscious,"" she said.When it comes to protest, ""We have not only the privilege but the responsibility to continue in the shoes of those who came before us,"" Ongele said. The goal, she said: to ensure ""that we're able to maintain the integrity of this university as one that is indeed socially aware, one that does have students that do care deeply about what goes on in the world, what goes on in our communities, and what goes on in the lives of the students that make up our community.""Columbia University officials did not respond to an email asking about the school's position on the legacy of the 1968 events. Those events, like the current protest, ""sparked a huge increase in student activism around the country,"" Mark Rudd, a leader of that protest, said in an email to The Associated Press. ""Myself and others spent the entire year after April 1968 traveling the country, spreading to campuses the spirit of Columbia.""But the echoes of the past aren't only in inspiration. Then, as now, the protest had its detractors. Naison said the disruption to campus life, and to law and order, angered many at Columbia and outside of it.""Student protesters are not popular people in the United States of America,"" he said. ""We weren't popular in the '60s. We accomplished a tremendous amount. But we also helped drive the country to the right.""That has a corollary these days with those critical of the protests, who have condemned what they say is a descent into antisemitism. Some Jewish students have said they have felt targeted for their identity and afraid to be on campus and university presidents have come under political pressure to clamp down and use methods like police intervention.Columbia University President Minouche Shafik had just testified in front of a congressional panel investigating concerns about antisemitism at elite schools when the camp initially went up. Despite her requesting police action the next day for what she called a ""harassing and intimidating environment,"" Republicans in Congress have called for her resignation.""Freedom of speech is so important, but not beyond the right to security,"" said Itai Dreifuss, 25, a third-year student who grew up in the United States and Israel. He was near the encampment this past week, standing in front of posters taped to a wall of the people who were taken hostage by Hamas in the Oct 7 attack that set off the current conflagration.That feeling among some students that personal animosity is being directed against them is a difference between 1968 and now, Naison said. That conflict between demonstrators and their decriers ""is far more visceral,"" Naison asserts, which he says makes this time even more fraught.""It's history repeating itself, but it's also uncharted territory,"" he said. ""What we have here is a whole group of people who see these protests as a natural extension of fighting for justice, and a whole other group of people who see this as a deadly attack on them and their history and tradition. And that makes it very difficult for university officials to manage.""","Protesters at Columbia are aware of the history of protests at the Ivy League school. In 1968, students took over five campus buildings and more than 700 people were arrested. The protests helped inspire the anti-apartheid protest of the 1980s and the Iraq war protests.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109703104,imgsize-1805244,width-400,resizemode-4/109703104.jpg"

He was in custody on bail amounting to $50,000, as New York Post reported.The parking valet was discovered with Mint inside his white van on Eddy Street in the city’s notoriously dangerous Tenderloin District neighborhood according to booking records.Mint — who was deemed “at-risk” due to previous threats of suicide — was uninjured.They informed the detectives that they had chosen to leave their Bolinas home on their own accord and have now been reunited with their family.The Standard reported that Dizefalo is suspected of coaxing the teen to run away.Mint’s parents, Stewart Butterfield — who co-founded the instant messaging app Slack before selling it to Salesforce in 2020 — and Caterina Fake — who co-founded the photo-sharing app Flickr, thanked investigators for bringing their child home.“A heartfelt thanks to all the family, friends, volunteers and strangers who called in tips and made this recovery possible,” their parents and stepfather, fellow tech founder Jyri Engeström, stated in an email to the Standard and other local outlets. “We especially want to thank the seasoned law enforcement officers who understand the very real threat of predators who use the allure of drugs to groom teenagers.”Mint was last seen in Bolinas on the night of April 21 and was reported missing by their mother the following morning.The teenager supposedly left a note to inform their parents that they had planned to run away before being discovered with Dizefalo this week.Authorities believed that Mint had been in the Tenderloin neighborhood because Mint was known to frequent the area before running away from home, as confirmed by the police.","Christopher ""Kio"" Dizefalo, 26, is suspected of coaxing Mint Butterfield, 16, to run away.

Why US is buying 81 Soviet-era combat aircraft from Russia's ally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-us-is-buying-81-soviet-era-combat-aircraft-from-russias-ally/articleshow/109696911.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United States has purchased 81 Soviet-era fighter and bomber aircraft from Kazakhstan , which recently auctioned off 117 military planes, including MiG-31 interceptors, MiG-27 fighter bombers, MiG-29 fighters, and Su-24 bombers. These aircraft, stemming from the 1970s and 1980s, were sold for a total of one billion Kazakhstani tenge, approximately $2.26 million, averaging about $19,300 per plane.Kazakhstan, historically a close ally of Russia but increasingly aligning with Western interests, is upgrading its air fleet, leading to the disposal of these aged aircraft, described as unusable for modern warfare.The sale, conducted through offshore companies, has sparked speculation about the US's motives, including potential use of the aircraft in Ukraine where similar models are still operational, a report in Insider said.According to a report by the Ukrainian Telegram channel Insider UA, the aircraft could either be used for spare parts or strategically as decoys at airfields to confuse enemy targeting. This comes at a time when Ukraine continues to rely on Soviet-era weapons, integrating them with Western technology to bolster its defenses against Russian aggression.The MiG-31, a supersonic interceptor, was crucial during the Cold War for defending Soviet airspace. The MiG-27, a derivative of the MiG-23, served primarily in ground-attack roles and saw extensive use during the Soviet-Afghan War. The MiG-29 remains active in several air forces due to its prowess in air-to-air combat, and the Su-24, an all-weather tactical bomber, is still operational in various countries, including the Russian and Ukrainian air forces.This acquisition underscores the ongoing geopolitical shifts in Central Asia and the delicate balance Kazakhstan maintains between its historical ties to Russia and its burgeoning relationships with Western nations.","Kazakhstan recently auctioned off 117 military planes, including MiG-31 interceptors.

Campus chaos: 'Sharp rise in fear among US students over pro-Palestine protests',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/campus-chaos-sharp-rise-in-fear-among-us-students-over-pro-palestine-protests/articleshow/109695795.cms,"NEW DELHI: Following the arrest of over 100 demonstrators at Columbia University last week, student protests concerning the Israel-Hamas war have surged on numerous college campuses. These protests are part of a broader movement where students are demanding that their universities cut ties with companies that support Israel’s military actions in Gaza, and in some cases, with Israel altogether.The protests have been driven by various student groups, which generally operate independently.However, many students involved express that their actions are influenced by solidarity with peers from other universities.Recent events highlight the intensity of these protests: At an Ivy League university in New York, pro-Palestinian student protesters established a tent encampment. The initial police attempt to dismantle this encampment on April 18 led to the arrest of more than 100 protesters. Rather than deterring the students, this police action galvanized them, prompting a nationwide wave of support and motivating Columbia protesters to reassemble and continue their demonstrations.Meanwhile, a research led by a University of Chicago professor, Robert Pape, has unveiled a concerning trend of escalating fear among students across numerous college campuses. This study, which was discussed on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” highlights the growing anxiety felt by students, particularly among Jewish and Muslim populations.According to a Politico report, professor Pape’s research involved a substantial survey of 5,000 students at hundreds of colleges, revealing that 56% of Jewish students and 52% of Muslim students reported feeling in personal danger. A significant portion of non-Jewish and non-Muslim students, 16%, also expressed feelings of being threatened. The study attributes these fears to direct observations of acts of violence and intimidation on campus, including attacks on Jewish buildings and counterattacks against Muslims.The timing of the research, conducted between December and January, coincides with heightened tensions following the October 7 Hamas attacks in Israel and the subsequent Israeli invasion of Gaza. This period also precedes a surge of campus protests related to the Israel-Hamas conflict , which has seen a rise in complaints about intimidating and hateful rhetoric.Professor Pape, a political science expert with a focus on terrorism, emphasized the need for a balanced approach to reducing campus tensions. He critiqued the prevailing methods of crowd control and political grandstanding, advocating for more thoughtful strategies that consider all sides of the conflicts.The findings suggest a shift from the historical context of campus protests, such as those in the 1960s associated with civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements. Pape noted the unique challenges of today's campus climate, which differ significantly from past decades, underscoring the need for contemporary solutions to address these evolving issues.",Student protests concerning the Israel-Hamas war have surged on numerous college campuses.

'Donald Trump holds steady lead over Joe Biden as race for White House heats up',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-holds-steady-lead-over-joe-biden-as-race-for-white-house-heats-up/articleshow/109691966.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the latest CNN poll conducted by SSRS, Donald Trump maintains a consistent advantage over President Joe Biden as both the presidential campaign and Trump's criminal trial progress. The poll reveals that Trump retains the support of 49% of registered voters in a direct matchup, unchanged from January, while Biden’s support has slightly dipped to 43% from 45%.Reflecting on their first terms, 55% of Americans now view Trump’s presidency as successful, a significant shift from January 2021, when the same percentage labeled it a failure shortly after the January 6 Capitol attack. In contrast, 61% of respondents consider Biden’s current term a failure, worsening from 57% in January 2022, the CNN report said.The poll underscores a strong partisan divide: 92% of Republicans view Trump's presidency favorably, compared to only 73% of Democrats who feel the same about Biden’s term. Among independents, 51% favor Trump’s term over 37% who approve of Biden’s efforts.Economic concerns dominate voter priorities, with 65% of registered voters citing the economy as extremely important in their decision-making—significantly higher than in the past two presidential elections. These economically concerned voters overwhelmingly favor Trump over Biden, 62% to 30%.A broad majority, 70%, view US economic conditions negatively. Interestingly, 41% of those who rate the economy poorly believe a change in political leadership would be more influential than economic policies like inflation control.On individual issues, Biden struggles with low approval ratings across the board, especially regarding his handling of the economy (34% approval) and inflation (29% approval). His policies on healthcare and student loans fare slightly better but still fall short of majority approval.The poll also highlights a national frustration with the available presidential candidates, with 53% of voters dissatisfied with their choices. Negative views of both Biden and Trump persist, with 58% holding an unfavorable opinion of Biden and 55% of Trump.Adding complexity to the electoral landscape, when independent candidates like Robert F Kennedy Jr, Cornel West, and Jill Stein are considered, Trump’s lead adjusts to 42%, followed by Biden at 33% and Kennedy capturing 16%.The survey, conducted from April 18-23 among 1,212 adults, includes 967 registered voters and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points for the registered voter sample.","In latest CNN poll conducted by SSRS, Donald Trump maintains a consistent advantage over President Joe Biden as both the presidential campaign and Trump's criminal trial progress.

Biden or Trump: Who will win as per '13 Keys' predictions?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-vs-joe-biden-historian-allan-lichtman-13-keys-model-us-presidential-election/articleshow/109691102.cms,"NEW DELHI: Allan Lichtman , a historian known for accurately predicting presidential election outcomes since 1984, has recently said that significant mishaps would need to occur for Joe Biden to lose the upcoming election to Donald Trump. Lichtman, who teaches history at American University in Washington, DC, has developed a forecasting system called ""Historian Who Predicted Every Presidential Winner Since 1984,"" which relies on historical factors rather than opinion polls .Despite national polls suggesting Biden is struggling and trailing in several key swing states, Lichtman remains confident in Biden's chances, citing that the president has already secured two of his ""13 Keys"": no serious primary challenges and the advantage of incumbency. ""That's two keys off the top,"" Lichtman explained, ""That means six more keys would have to fall to predict his defeat. A lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose.""Lichtman, who accurately foresaw Trump’s victory in 2016 and Biden’s in 2020, expressed skepticism about current polling, emphasizing that ""polls six, seven months before an election have zero predictive value ."" He also warned that while Biden's campaign shouldn't be overly confident, unforeseeable major events could still impact the election. “It’s always possible there could be a cataclysmic enough event outside the scope of the keys that could affect the election,” he noted.As per a Daily Mail report, the historian also pointed to the Covid-19 pandemic as a decisive factor in his correct prediction of Biden's 2020 victory, saying, ""The pandemic is what did him in. He congratulated me for predicting him but he didn't understand the keys. The message of the keys is it's governance not campaigning that counts and instead of dealing substantively with the pandemic, as we know, he thought he could talk his way out of it and that sank him.""While some of Lichtman's keys could potentially favor Trump, including the presence of a significant third-party challenger and aspects of social unrest, Lichtman still sees the 2024 election trending towards Biden. He candidly acknowledges the limits of his system, expressing the personal pressure he faces: ""It’s nerve-racking because there are a lot of people who’d love to see me fail."" He added, ""I’m human. It doesn’t mean my system’s wrong.

Blinken says Israel must still do more to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-says-israel-must-still-do-more-to-boost-humanitarian-aid-to-gaza/articleshow/109689320.cms,"RIYADH: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that Israel must still do more to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the besieged Gaza Strip and that he would use his current Middle East trip - his seventh to the region since the Israel-Hamas war started in October - to press that case with Israeli leaders.Speaking to Gulf Cooperation Council foreign ministers in Riyadh, Blinken said best way to ease the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza would be to conclude an elusive cease-fire agreement that would release hostages held by Hamas.But, in the meantime, he said it was critical to improve conditions now.""The most effective way to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, to alleviate the suffering of children, women and men, and to create space for a more just and durable solution is to get a cease-fire and the hostages out,"" he said.""But we're also not waiting on a cease-fire to take the necessary steps to meet the needs of civilians in Gaza,"" Blinken said. He said that because President Joe Biden has been insisting that Israel do more, including in his phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, there had been improvements, although not nearly enough.""We have seen measurable progress in the last few weeks, including the opening of new crossings and increased volume of aid delivery to Gaza and within Gaza, and the building of the US maritime corridor, which will open in the coming weeks. But it is not enough. We still need to get more aid in and around Gaza,"" he said.""We need to improve deconfliction with humanitarian assistance workers. And we have to find greater efficiency and greater safety and deconfliction is at the heart of that. And, finally we have to make sure that we're focusing not just on inputs, but on impact.""Scores of relief workers have been killed since the conflict began, and a deadly Israeli attack on a World Central Kitchen aid convoy in Gaza this month only highlighted the dangers and difficulties of protecting them. Israel has said the strike was a mistake and has disciplined officials involved.World Central Kitchen says it would resume operations in Gaza on Monday after a four-week suspension.The war has ground on since Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 attacks on Israel with little end in sight: more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed, hundreds of thousands more are displaced and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza is worsening.The conflict has fueled mass protests around the world that have spread to American college campuses. US support for Israel, particularly arms transfers, has come under particular criticism, something the administration is keenly aware poses potential problems for Biden in an election year.Blinken's trip comes amid renewed concerns about the conflict spreading in the Middle East and with once-promising prospects for Israeli-Saudi rapprochement effectively on hold as Israel refuses to consider one of the Saudis' main conditions for normalized relations: the creation of a Palestinian state.Meanwhile, the Biden administration has been warning Israel against a major military operation on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled to escape fighting further north. Israel has not yet launched such an offensive, but Netanyahu has repeatedly said that one will take place, asserting that it is the only way to wipe out Hamas.Both topics were discussed during the Biden-Netanyahu phone call on Sunday, according to the White House and US officials.During his trip, Blinken said he would also underscore the absolute importance of not allowing the Israel-Hamas conflict to engulf the region.The danger of conflagration was underscored this month when a suspected Israeli attack on an Iranian consular building in Syria prompted an unprecedented direct missile and drone response by Iran against Israel. An apparent retaliatory Israeli strike on Iran followed.Although the tit-for-tat cycle appears to have ended for now, deep concerns remain that Iran or its proxies in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria or Yemen could act in such a way as to provoke a greater response from Israel or that Israel might take action that Iran feels it must retaliate for.",US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israel must still do more to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the besieged Gaza Strip. He said best way to ease the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza would be to conclude an elusive cease- fire agreement that would release hostages held by Hamas.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109689466,imgsize-517485,width-400,resizemode-4/109689466.jpg"

At the age of 73, Dar, a chartered accountant and experienced politician from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, was named deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday, with the appointment taking immediate effect and until further notice.Shehbaz Sharif and Dar are currently in Saudi Arabia for the World Economic Forum's (WEF) special meeting.According to the Dawn newspaper, Dar's new appointment ""took many by surprise, but drew hardly any criticism from its allies'.Dar being ""awarded' the ""rarely filled' slot of deputy prime minister has raised many questions, the report said.The main talking point is that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif wants to have his ""confidant' in a key position in the federal cabinet to ""compensate him for the loss of the finance portfolio', it said.The report mentioned that the action was also viewed in connection with Nawaz Sharif assuming leadership of the ruling PML-N party as its president, a position he had been deprived of after being convicted in the Panama Papers case.Dar is seen as having a close relationship with Nawaz Sharif because of the family connection through marriage, as his son is married to the elder Sharif's daughter.An insider claimed that the move to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister was ""pre-planned', the report said. During the formation of the coalition government, it was agreed that Dar would serve as the Deputy Prime Minister.However, based on a report from Geo News, the decision to appoint a four-time finance minister as the foreign minister indicates an increased focus on economics in the country's diplomacy as the financially struggling nation aims to obtain another deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and strengthen external financing from foreign capitals.Dar was the finance minister from 1998 to 1999 and then again from March to May 2008. He once more headed the finance ministry from 2013 to 2017 and later from 2022 to 2023. He additionally worked as the minister for industry and investment from February 1997 to July 1997, and also in commerce from December 1997 to October 1999.According to the report from Dawn, during Nawaz Sharif's tenure as the prime minister, Dar served as the de facto deputy prime minister, leading numerous government and parliamentary committees in the capacity of chairperson. Even though the Constitution does not include a provision for a deputy prime minister, Dar is the second legislator to assume this role.Chaudhry Parvez Elahi served as Deputy Prime Minister when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was in power from June 25, 2012, to June 29, 2013. During that period, his responsibilities were largely symbolic, and he was given recognition by then-President Asif Ali Zardari for his support of the government led by the PPP.Elahi is currently serving as the president of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party led by the jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, and he is in prison due to corruption allegations.Interestingly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the main ally of the PML-N-led government, did not raise any objection to Dar's new appointment. The PPP Information Secretary, Faisal Karim Kundi, stated that his party had no objections to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister. ""It is the PM's prerogative to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister,"" he said, adding that the move was not meant as a ""message' to anyone.Meanwhile, Khan's PTI on Monday reacted strongly to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister, saying ""Sharifs are distributing key national posts within the family'.""The Sharif family is distributing important national posts among themselves,"" Special Assistant to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister For Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said.The PTI leader criticized the federal government for appointing individuals to high-ranking positions instead of addressing the problems faced by the people as the Constitution does not provide for the position of deputy PM.Reacting to Dar's appointment, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob termed the PM Shehbaz Sharif-led government's move ""an extra-constitutional step that carries no substantial value'.""This just indicates intra-party tensions and competition for influence.

Foreign talent to make up for unskilled bureaucrats in Pakistan: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/foreign-talent-to-make-up-for-unskilled-bureaucrats-in-pakistan-report/articleshow/109661493.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan 's Cabinet has relaxed rules to hire foreign consultancy firms to make up for 'unskilled' bureaucrats and speed up official efforts to bring investment for various projects in the cash-strapped country from the Gulf and other nations, according to a media report. The decision was taken to support the Special Investment Facilitation Council ( SIFC ), the top civil-military body created last year to bring investment into the country.According to The Express Tribune, the Cabinet relaxed the public procurement legal framework to hire foreign consultancy firms to strengthen the SIFC to prepare various projects before offering them to foreign investors.""The foreign consultancy firms will be hired for five years as a replacement for Pakistani bureaucrats who are found lacking in project planning and execution, according to government sources,"" the paper reported.However, the decision will reflect poorly on the working of the bureaucracy, which could not provide quality assistance to the SIFC.The Cabinet has approved a summary through circulation on the advice of the SIFC, which recommended granting exemption due to the poor capacity of Pakistan's federal bureaucracy, confirmed a senior government official on Saturday.In case of circulation, the summary is approved without discussion in the regular cabinet meeting.The sources said that due to an incapacitated bureaucracy, Pakistan was struggling to prepare projects for investment by Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Kuwait.The development came a week after Pakistan offered highly lucrative returns to Saudi Arabia for getting a USD 5 billion investment.The government was jubilant over its presentation to the Saudi delegation, which appreciated Islamabad's preparedness compared to the past.However, the bureaucracy is not trained in certain skills and compared to the Pakistani delegation the Saudi Arabian delegation was far better prepared.One of the reasons for the lack of effective and efficient bureaucracy is that generalists are appointed as the secretaries of the economic ministries.These bureaucrats, mostly Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) officers, get expertise on the job and then they are moved to any other ministry.A federal secretary can at any time be appointed as secretary of finance, secretary of power, secretary of planning, secretary of the board of investment and secretary of petroleum without a requisite set of expertise.","The decision was taken to support the Special Investment Facilitation Council ( SIFC ), the top civil-military body created last year to bring investment into the country.
