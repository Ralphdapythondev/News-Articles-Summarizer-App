'I'm not sitting back anymore': Trump's ex-wife Marla Maples is 'open' to serve him as his vice president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-not-sitting-back-anymore-trumps-ex-wife-marla-maples-is-open-to-serve-him-as-his-vice-president/articleshow/111648513.cms,"Marla Maples , ex-US President Donald Trump 's former wife, expressed her willingness to assist the ex-president's 2024 campaign and even entertained the idea of being his running mate. Speaking to The Evening Standard, Maples, who recently celebrated her 60th birthday, said that the entire Trump family is backing his second presidential run.""I'm ready.I am available if needed and I'm not sitting back anymore,"" Maples said in her first interview in nearly a decade. She emphasised her desire to be more vocal and share her thoughts without fear of the consequences.Despite the legal challenges faced by her ex-husband, Maples remains steadfast in her support. When questioned about the lawsuit filed by writer Jean E Carroll, which resulted in Trump being found liable for sex abuse and defamation, Maples maintained her belief in his innocence. ""I do know my daughter's father well enough to know that he's never had to push himself on another person. He's always had women throw themselves on him instead,"" she asserted. ""I don't believe there was a crime done.""Maples also downplayed the significance of Trump's guilty verdict in the Manhattan hush money trial, where he was convicted of concealing a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. She criticised the focus on ""little sexy stories"" and instead emphasised the need to address the country's pressing issues, such as public safety.Sources indicated to The Evening Standard that Maples could envision herself as Trump's vice president , a position he is expected to announce in the coming week. When asked about this possibility, Maples laughed and said, ""Someone would have to ask my ex-husband about that."" She added, ""I'm open. I'm open to whatever way that I can serve. Right now everyone [in the Trump family] is just seeing how we can help.""The couple's relationship began controversially when they met at a charity event in 1985 while Trump was still married to his first wife, Ivana. They eventually wed in 1993 but separated by May 1997, with Maples receiving a $2 million settlement in 1999. Despite their past disagreements, which Maples attributed to the challenges of marriage, especially when played out in the media, she has forgiven Trump.In a 2018 appearance on NBC, Maples disclosed that she had advised Trump against running for president in the 1990s, citing the potential impact on their children, who were much younger at the time. However, the former couple appeared amicable and posed for photographs together at their daughter Tiffany's wedding in 2022.","Marla Maples, ex-US President Donald Trump's former wife, expressed her willingness to assist the ex-president's 2024 campaign and even entertained the idea of being his running mate.

South Korea to deploy 'StarWars' laser weapons to counter North Korean drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/first-in-world-south-korea-to-deploy-starwars-laser-weapons-to-counter-north-korean-drones/articleshow/111648259.cms,"South Korea is set to become the first nation globally to deploy and utilize laser weapons within its military this year, specifically designed to counter North Korean drones , as announced by the country's arms procurement agency on Thursday. South Korea has called its laser programme the ""StarWars project"".The South Korean military, in collaboration with Hanwha Aerospace , has developed these drone-zapping laser weapons, which are not only effective but also cost-efficient, with each shot costing a mere 2,000 won ($1.45).These weapons operate silently and invisibly, making them a formidable addition to the military's arsenal.The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) said, ""Our country is becoming the first country in the world to deploy and operate laser weapons, and our military's response capabilities on North Korea's drone provocation will be further strengthened,"" highlighting the significance of these weapons in future battlefields.The laser weapons function by targeting and burning down the engines or other electrical components of flying drones using focused light beams for a duration of 10 to 20 seconds, as explained by a DAPA spokesperson during a briefing.In December, five North Korean drones breached South Korean airspace, prompting Seoul to deploy fighter jets and attack helicopters in an attempt to shoot them down. This incident marked the first such intrusion since 2017, highlighting the ongoing tensions between the two Koreas, which are technically still at war, with the Korean War having ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty in 1953.The United States has acknowledged that both North and South Korea have violated the armistice governing their shared border by sending drones into each other's airspace.According to the US nonprofit think tank RAND Corporation, several countries, including South Korea, China, and the United Kingdom, are actively developing and deploying laser weapons, also known as directed energy weapons.These weapons are garnering significant interest due to their potential to counter the growing threat of unmanned systems, as well as their ability to target missiles in flight or satellites in orbit.","South Korea is set to become the first nation globally to deploy and utilize laser weapons within its military this year.

'Terror must fail': Nato sends F-16 jets to bolster Ukraine in new support effort,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/terror-must-fail-nato-sends-f-16-jets-to-bolster-ukraine-in-new-support-effort/articleshow/111647995.cms,"Nato allies on Wednesday at the 75th-anniversary summit in the US capital said that they have started transferring F-16 jets to Ukraine and stepped up promises of eventual membership for Kyiv. President Joe Biden welcomed 31 alliance leaders, urging them to match Russia 's military production, focusing on the defense of Nato territory. Biden said that Denmark and the Netherlands have begun sending US-made F-16 jets to Ukraine, fulfilling a key promise to Kyiv.He also mentioned new air defense systems and the periodic placement of long-range missiles in Germany.US secretary of state Antony Blinken said the F-16 transfer would ensure Putin realizes he ""will not outlast Ukraine"" and that continued aggression would only harm Russia further. This comes amid political uncertainty in the US, with Donald Trump leading Biden in polls and suggesting a peace settlement by forcing Ukraine to cede territory to Russia.Nato leaders, in a joint declaration, pledged 40 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine, aiming to increase predictability and counteract delays in US assistance . Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg stressed the need for a Ukrainian victory to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the F-16s, asserting they would bring peace closer and ensure that ""terror must fail.""Zelenskyy in his X post said that, ""The new aircraft will bring just and lasting peace closer, demonstrating that terror must fail.""The summit aimed to ""Trump-proof"" Nato by enhancing the alliance's role in coordinating arms delivery to Ukraine rather than the United States. It also targeted China, expressing concern over its support to Russia, and highlighted Nato's increasing role in Asia by inviting Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.The summit's language indicated Ukraine's ""irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including Nato membership."" However, concerns persist, led by Biden and German chancellor Olaf Scholz, about the risks of war with nuclear-armed Russia.Finnish President Alexander Stubb and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer affirmed their support for Ukraine, with Starmer stating Nato's unity against Russian aggression. The recent missile barrage by Russia on Ukraine, killing dozens and hitting a children's hospital, underscored the ongoing conflict.""We can -- and will -- defend every inch of Nato territory and we'll do it together,"" Biden told the North Atlantic Council.","Nato leaders pledge 40 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine.

'It's only going to get better': Elon Musk moving on to second person to test brain tech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/its-only-going-to-get-better-musk-moving-on-to-second-person-to-test-brain-tech/articleshow/111647525.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday said that his company, Neuralink, is ""moving on"" to its second test patient as the technology connecting brains and computers advances. During a live stream on X, Musk and the Neuralink team addressed questions about the company's progress in making brain implants widely available.""We're only just moving now to our second Neuralink patient ,"" Musk said.""But we hope to have, if things go well, high single digits this year,"" he added.In January, Neuralink successfully implanted a brain device in Noland Arbaugh, who was paralysed from the shoulders down after a diving accident eight years ago. Since the implantation, Arbaugh has reported playing chess, the video game ""Civilisation,"" and taking Japanese and French lessons by controlling a computer screen cursor with his brain.The Neuralink team identified and resolved an issue that significantly reduced Arbaugh's ability to control a computer cursor with his mind. The problem was caused by the threads connecting the implant to Arbaugh's brain retracting, reducing their effectiveness in detecting signals. To maximise effectiveness, the threads will be implanted deeper and at varying depths in the brain, with increased precision.Musk asserted ""it's only going to get better from here.""The company is now implementing risk mitigation strategies, such as skull sculpting and maintaining normal blood carbon dioxide levels in patients, as explained by Neuralink executives during the live stream on X.""In upcoming implants, our plan is to sculpt the surface of the skull very intentionally to minimize the gap under the implant... that will put it closer to the brain and eliminate some of the tension on the threads,"" Matthew MacDougall, Neuralink's head of neurosurgery, said.Musk envisions Neuralink implants going beyond restoring functionality, such as giving people infrared or ultraviolet vision or enabling telepathic concept sharing.""We want to give people superpowers,"" Musk said. ""Not just that we're restoring your prior functionality, but that you actually have functionality far greater than a normal human,"" he added.He also discussed developing an automated process for Neuralink's surgery robot to quickly install custom implants in people seeking ""upgrades,"" comparing it to the games ""Cyberpunk"" and ""Deus Ex.""""An exciting possibility long term also is to take parts of the Optimus humanoid robot and combine that with a Neuralink - you could have basically cybernetic superpowers,"" he said.Musk cofounded Neuralink in 2016 with the goal of enhancing human capabilities, treating neurological disorders, and potentially achieving a symbiotic relationship between humans and AI.While Musk is not the only one working on advances in brain-machine or brain-computer interface research, his company's progress continues to generate significant interest and discussion.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his company, Neuralink, is ""moving on"" to its second test patient.

US eyes new defensive strategies to tackle China's industrial policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-eyes-new-defensive-strategies-to-tackle-chinas-industrial-policies/articleshow/111647532.cms,"(With agency inputs)

The US administration led by President Joe Biden expressed growing concerns on Wednesday about the significant global spillovers caused by China's industrial manufacturing overcapacity.Under Secretary for International Affairs Jay Shambaugh noted that these challenges may require defensive action to safeguard firms and workers, and that the traditional toolkit of trade actions may not be adequate.""Addressing these challenges may warrant our taking defensive action to protect our firms and workers -- and the traditional toolkit of trade actions may not be sufficient. More creative approaches may be necessary to mitigate the impacts of China's overcapacity. We should be clear -- defence against overcapacity or dumping is not protectionist or anti-trade, it is an attempt to safeguard firms and workers from distortions in another economy,"" he said.Shambaugh highlighted that the United States, along with its allies and partners in both developing and advanced economies, share common goals in addressing China's policies that have negative economic spillovers on their firms, workers, and economic resilience.He, however, also expressed hope that China would acknowledge the growing concerns among its major trading partners and work with them to address these issues.He suggested that China could take steps such as boosting consumption, better supporting services, and reducing harmful and wasteful subsidies, which would be in China's own interest and help reduce tensions.Shambaugh added that while each country has its own concerns and needs, the underlying reason for these actions is undeniable. ""As the G7 leaders and finance ministers have stated -- China's overcapacity undermines our workers, industries and economic resilience and security. The United States will act and we will not be alone,"" he asserted.The United States is not alone in seeking to address the negative spillovers from China's non-market practices, with the EU, Turkey, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, and India recently taking actions.Back in April, US and China reached an agreement to engage in ""intensive exchanges on balanced growth"" after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and her Chinese counterpart He Lifeng concluded two days of talks in Guangzhou.The United States has taken steps, both through legislation and executive orders, to decrease dependence on specific Chinese technologies and strengthen domestic manufacturing abilities. Many in the White House and Congress consider these measures essential for safeguarding national security.","The US administration expressed growing concerns on Wednesday about the significant global spillovers caused by China's industrial manufacturing overcapacity.

China's New Radar Tracks Hypersonic Missiles at Mach 20 with Unprecedented Precision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-new-radar-can-track-10-hypersonic-missiles-at-mach-20/articleshow/111584937.cms,"Chinese scientists have announced a significant advancement in radar technology that could escalate the global race for hypersonic weapons. A team led by Professor Zheng Xiaoping from Tsinghua University’s department of electronic engineering has developed a radar system capable of tracking 10 incoming hypersonic missiles traveling at Mach 20 with remarkable precision.This technology also has the capability to identify false targets.During ground-based simulations, the radar demonstrated an error margin of just 28 centimeters (11 inches) when estimating the distance of a missile traveling at nearly 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) per second. Additionally, the system was 99.7 percent accurate in estimating the missile's speed, a feat previously deemed impossible, a South China Morning Post report said.Generating and analyzing radar signals with such precision requires electrons to move at extremely high speeds, which can potentially damage circuit boards. Zheng’s team overcame this challenge by incorporating lasers into the radar system, allowing information to be transmitted between key nodes at the speed of light. This innovation enables the generation and processing of much more complex microwave signals , allowing for the precise measurement of ultra-high-speed objects for the first time.The new microwave photonic radar boasts a detection range of over 600 kilometers. It is small and light, making it suitable for mounting on air-defense missiles or aircraft. Military experts consider this technology to be crucial for the next generation of fire-control radars .The United States, striving to close the gap with China in hypersonic weapons, tested an air-launched hypersonic missile on Guam in March. This test was seen by some Western military observers as a direct response to China, demonstrating the US military’s capability to strike Chinese coastal cities with high-penetration weapons.Hypersonic weapons present a significant challenge for interception compared to traditional ballistic missiles due to their higher speed and unpredictable maneuvers, which allow them to penetrate air-defense networks. While new interceptor missiles and laser weapons have the potential to neutralize incoming hypersonic threats, they require precise target position and velocity data to be effective.A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) highlighted the difficulty the Pentagon faces in obtaining a fire-control radar capable of tracking hypersonic targets with high precision for interceptor missile systems. ""If you have more precise data, you could use an interceptor that maybe wouldn’t need to maneuver as much, and could be cheaper,"" said Masao Dahlgren, the report’s author with the CSIS Missile Defense Project.One of the challenges with high-speed moving targets is the appearance of phantom images on radar screens, where false targets often outnumber real ones. Zheng’s team addressed this by using laser technology to send three different bands of microwaves simultaneously, improving detection accuracy. They also developed an algorithm that eliminates false target interference by comparing signals of different frequencies, the SCMP report said.Zheng and his team have built a complete radar system, including chips and transmitters, and verified its performance in a laboratory using instruments that simulate the movement of hypersonic targets in the atmosphere.","A team led by Professor Zheng Xiaoping from Tsinghua University’s department of electronic engineering has developed a radar system capable of tracking 10 incoming hypersonic missiles traveling at Mach 20. The system was 99.7 percent accurate in estimating the missile's speed, a feat previously deemed impossible.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111584909,imgsize-714372,width-400,resizemode-4/111584909.jpg"
"Listeria Contamination: Canadian agencies recall several Silk, Great Value products for potential Listeria contamination",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadian-agencies-recall-several-silk-great-value-products-for-potential-listeria-contamination/articleshow/111631896.cms,"Canadian agencies recall several Silk , Great Value products for potential Listeria contaminationThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued a nationwide recall for 18 beverages sold by the brands Silk and Great Value due to a potential risk of Listeria contamination, which can cause serious illness among the public.The agency had informed people about almond, oat, coconut and cashew milk that were part of the recall, which was triggered by an investigation into a foodborne illness outbreak.These products may contain Listeria monoctyogenes contamination.Although, there is no official data available related to how many people got sick due to this illness. However, Globalnews reported that according to one of Ontario’s top doctors, nine people have contracted this contamination and 5 have been hospitalised, in the province.According to the CFIA , it is hard to determine a contaminated food item with Listeria as it doesn’t cause any foul smell or change in appearance. Still, it can cause serious illness in the body.Some common symptoms of Listeria illness mostly include gut-related symptoms like cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In some cases, it can also cause fever, neck stiffness, headache and muscle aches. However, in exceptional cases, it may prove fatal.CFIA further informed people that a food safety investigation was still going on which could cause additional products to be withdrawn. The agency has urged people not to drink these recalled products which have expiry dates up to and including the 4th of October.Ontario’s chief medical officer, Dr Kieran Moore, has instructed people to check for these products in their fridges. If found, they should either return them to the shops or throw them away, but not consume them in any case.Listeria monocytogenes usually thrives in soil and causes foodborne illnesses in people. According to experts, one should practice good sanitation practices and maintain personal hygiene to prevent contracting this infection.Elderly people, pregnant women and people who have weak immune systems are more vulnerable to this illness. Especially in the cases of pregnant women, infection may cause mild symptoms but can result in premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth, according to the CFIA.","The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued a nationwide recall for 18 beverages sold by the brands Silk and Great Value.

Williams added, ""I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem.""The astronauts have been keeping themselves busy on the ISS, carrying out various tasks and experiments, such as changing the pump on a machine that recycles urine into drinking water and conducting gene sequencing in microgravity.Before Wilmore and Williams can return to Earth, engineering teams need to conduct more simulations on the ground to better understand the root causes of the technical issues Starliner experienced and modify the spacecraft's flight plan if necessary.The spacecraft had a known helium leak before launch, but additional leaks emerged during the flight. Additionally, some of Starliner's thrusters, which provide fine maneuvering, initially failed to engage during its approach to the station, delaying docking. Engineers are still investigating the reasons behind these issues.Despite the challenges, Nasa and Boeing maintain that Starliner could safely return to Earth in case of an emergency, particularly since the problems affected only certain orientation-controlling thrusters. They have no concerns about the more powerful thrusters responsible for the ""deorbit burn"" that will bring the spaceship back.However, much remains uncertain, including whether the malfunctioning thrusters have become degraded, which would necessitate relying on other thrusters during descent.","Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams are currently waiting to depart from the International Space Station.

"Ammo vending machines: Milk, eggs and now bullets for sale at US grocery stores",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ammo-vending-machines-milk-eggs-and-now-bullets-for-sale-at-us-grocery-stores/articleshow/111649033.cms,"This undated photo provided by American Rounds shows a vending machine that sell ammunition in several locations across the United States.

What is the concept behind American Rounds' vending machines?

American Rounds aims to modernize ammunition sales by introducing vending machines and kiosks in grocery stores. The vending machines use secure technology, requiring a government-issued ID and a fingerprint scan for verification. John Doe, the founder, said, “We live in a world where you can buy almost anything from a vending machine. Why should ammunition be any different?”

What safety measures are in place?

The vending machines require multiple forms of verification, including a government-issued ID and a fingerprint scan, to ensure only eligible buyers can purchase ammunition. Jane Smith, head of security, noted, “Safety is our top priority. We’ve implemented multiple layers of security to prevent unauthorized access.” Additionally, the machines use identification scanners and facial recognition software to verify the purchaser’s age.

Federal law requires a person to be 18 to buy shotgun and rifle ammunition and 21 to buy handgun ammunition. CEO Grant Magers said their machines require a purchaser to be at least 21.

Where are these vending machines currently available?

American Rounds has installed vending machines in grocery stores in Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas. They plan to expand their network nationwide and are exploring partnerships with major retail chains to enhance accessibility.

How do the vending machines operate?

The vending machines require customers to scan their driver’s license to validate their age, followed by a facial recognition scan to verify their identity. Once verified, the transaction can be completed. Magers explained, “The whole experience takes a minute and a half once you are familiar with the machine.”

What has been the public reaction to this initiative?

Public reaction has been mixed. Supporters argue it’s a logical step in a digital age, with Michael Johnson, a gun owner from Texas, saying, “It’s about time we had more options.” Critics, however, express concern over potential misuse. Mary Williams, an advocate for gun control, cautioned, “We need to be very careful with how accessible we make ammunition.”

What are the future plans for American Rounds?

American Rounds plans to expand its vending machines and kiosks nationwide and explore partnerships with major retail chains. They are optimistic about the future and aim to make purchasing ammunition as straightforward and secure as possible.

What concerns have been raised by gun control advocates?

Gun control advocates worry that selling bullets through vending machines could lead to increased shootings. Nick Suplina from Everytown for Gun Safety remarked, “Innovations that make ammunition sales more secure via facial recognition, age verification, and the tracking of serial sales are promising safety measures that belong in gun stores, not in the place where you buy your kids milk.”

How does American Rounds address these concerns?

American Rounds emphasizes that their age-verification technology makes transactions as secure, or more secure, than online sales. Magers stated, “I’m very thankful for those who are taking the time to get to know us and not just making assumptions about what we’re about. We are very pro-Second Amendment, but we are for responsible gun ownership, and we hope we’re improving the environment for the community.”

Now, you can buy bullets along with milk and eggs in the US. American Rounds , a startup focused on revolutionizing ammunition sales, has introduced a new approach to purchasing bullets: vending machines and kiosks in grocery stores. The aim is to simplify the buying process and make ammunition more accessible for responsible gun owners. This innovative method combines modern technology with stringent security measures to ensure that only eligible buyers can make purchases.The concept was spearheaded by John Doe , the company's founder, who believes in modernizing ammunition sales.“We live in a world where you can buy almost anything from a vending machine. Why should ammunition be any different?” Doe's vision includes secure technology that verifies buyers' identities through government-issued IDs and fingerprint scans.

Forget grocery! US vending machines now selling bullets for guns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/forget-grocery-us-vending-machines-now-selling-ammunition-for-guns/articleshow/111648060.cms,"Mixed reactions and future plans

A Texas-based company , American Rounds , has introduced automated vending machines that sell ammunition in grocery stores across Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas. These machines, which utilize identification scanners and facial recognition technology to verify the purchaser's age, allow customers to purchase bullets alongside their regular grocery items.According to the company's CEO, Grant Magers, the age-verification technology ensures that the transactions are as secure, if not more secure, than online sales or retail store purchases.“I’m very thankful for those who are taking the time to get to know us and not just making assumptions about what we’re about,"" said Magers adding, “We are very pro-Second Amendment, but we are for responsible gun ownership, and we hope we’re improving the environment for the community.”Despite these assurances, gun safety advocates express concern about the potential risks associated with the easy accessibility of ammunition. Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety, argued that while innovative safety measures like facial recognition and age verification are promising, they should be implemented in dedicated gun stores rather than grocery stores.Since its inception in 2023, Texas-based American Rounds has installed one machine in Alabama, four in Oklahoma, and one in Texas, with additional machines planned for Texas and Colorado. According to Magers, the idea of selling ammunition through automated technology originated from grocery store inquiries, seeking to offer a convenient service to their customers.Federal law mandates that purchasers be at least 18 to buy shotgun and rifle ammunition and 21 for handgun ammunition. American Rounds' vending machines strictly adhere to these regulations, requiring customers to scan a valid driver’s license and undergo a facial recognition scan to verify their identity and age. The device operates by having users scan their driver's licenses to confirm they meet the minimum age requirement of 21 years old. Additionally, the scan verifies the authenticity of the license. After this step, the machine performs a facial recognition scan to ensure ""you are who you are saying you are as a consumer,"" Magers said.Once the identity verification process is complete, ""At that point you can complete your transaction of your product and you're off and going,"" he explained. For those accustomed to using the machine, the entire process takes only around 90 seconds.","A Texas-based company has introduced automated vending machines that sell ammunition in grocery stores across Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas.

""As long as this economy stays import-based, what happens is the moment it heats up, ""we run out of dollars [and] we have to go back to the lender of last resort on our knees.""Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has travelled recently to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China to solicit investments on top of the IMF programme, which would be Pakistan's 24th with the multilateral lender.","Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb says Pakistan will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue.

The allocation for PSEs in the 2024-25 budget saw a dramatic increase, reaching PKR 1.267 trillion, largely earmarked for subsidies and grants, marking a 104 per cent surge from the previous fiscal year.The State Bank of Pakistan 's latest report reveals a notable decrease in PSE borrowing during FY23, contrasting sharply with the PKR 43.5 billion borrowed in FY24 alone, adding to the existing debt burden. Despite receiving substantial funding from the ADB, which initiated the USD 300 million Public Sector Enterprises Reform Programme (PSERP) in 2016, aimed at enhancing corporate governance and operational efficiency, meaningful reforms have been elusive.Former finance minister Ishaq Dar, during his tenure, committed to improving PSE performance, particularly in sectors like railways, Pakistan Steel, and Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). However, the political sensitivity surrounding the privatisation of major PSEs, significant employers in a job-scarce economy, has hindered progress on critical economic reforms.""The ADB's support began with a USD 300 million loan for sub-programme one in June 2016, followed by an additional USD 300 million for sub-programme two in 2017, aimed at sustaining and expanding initial reform efforts,"" noted an ADB report. Despite these efforts, the transformation of loss-making entities such as PIA and Pakistan Steel remains a contentious issue, highlighting the challenges of balancing economic imperatives with political realities, according to Dawn.Many PSEs continue to rely heavily on government subsidies and credit guarantees to maintain operations, underscoring persistent governance and accountability deficiencies. The ADB's objectives included enhancing transparency, performance management, and revenue generation in PSEs, aligning their operations with commercial principles to improve service delivery and financial sustainability.The failure to implement comprehensive reforms has perpetuated the financial woes of PSEs, jeopardising fiscal stability and inhibiting broader economic development, Dawn reported.

Speaking on Geo News' 'Naya Pakistan' program, Sanaullah asserted that Imran Khan had been prohibited by the court from holding political meetings within the jail premises.""The PTI founder is not authorised to orchestrate plans for chaos while incarcerated,"" Sanaullah emphasised, pointing to unspecified evidence in possession of authorities that supposedly substantiates these claims.""We don't have audio or video evidence ourselves, but those responsible for security inside the jail do,"" Sanaullah clarified when asked about the proof of Imran Khan's alleged activities.Sanaullah's remarks followed complaints from leaders of the former ruling party, who asserted they were denied access to Imran Khan at Adiala Jail despite waiting for several hours. The adviser to the Prime Minister also criticised PTI's decision to stage a rally in Islamabad during the holy month of Muharram, suggesting it was aimed at sowing political turmoil, as reported by Geo News.""The PTI's desire to hold a public rally in Muharram is inappropriate and can lead to political chaos,"" Sanaullah remarked, while distancing the government from the decision to deny PTI permission for the Islamabad rally, according to Geo News.Earlier today, PTI cancelled its Islamabad rally after the federal capital's chief commissioner withdrew the No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the event in Tarnol. PTI leaders subsequently approached the Islamabad High Court seeking contempt of court proceedings against the administration for revoking the rally's permission.Expanding on his allegations, Sanaullah suggested that foreign elements supported PTI during the riots on May 9, 2023, following Imran Khan's arrest, with the intent to destabilise Pakistan.""Enemy countries aim to sow anarchy in Pakistan through PTI,"" he added, referencing the protests that targeted both civilian and military installations including Jinnah House and the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, dubbed as the ""Black Day"" by the military, leading to arrests under the Army Act.Regarding foreign aid allegedly received by PTI, Sanaullah indicated a willingness to disclose evidence if the federal cabinet decided to make such information public, Geo News reported.","Rana Sanaullah, Prime Minister's Adviser on Political and Public Affairs, made the claims on Geo News' 'Naya Pakistan' program.

Sensitive cities like Karachi have made extensive preparations for Muharram.Muharram holds profound significance forShia Muslims . However, Pakistan has faced recurrent sectarian violence during this period between Sunni and Shia communities.On January 19, 2007, a suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Quetta during Muharram prayers, resulted in 15 deaths and numerous injuries.
