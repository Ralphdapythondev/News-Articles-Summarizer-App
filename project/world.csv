"Pakistan: In blow to Imran Khan, SC restores changes in anti-corruption law",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-in-blow-to-imran-khan-sc-restores-changes-in-anti-corruption-law/articleshow/113142030.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a victory for the ruling coalition government and a blow to former Prime Minister Imran Khan , the Pakistan Supreme Court reinstated amendments made to the country's National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), overturning its own decision from last year, Geo News reported.A five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faiz Isa and comprising Justice Aminuddin, Justice Jamal Khan Mandukhel, Justice Athar Minallah, and Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi announced the unanimous verdict.Approving the intra-court appeals filed by the federal and provincial governments, Pakistan's apex court remarked that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan could not prove that NAB (National Accountability Bureau) amendments were unconstitutional.Notably, the top anti-graft body and the PTI founder were made respondents in the intra-party appeals.The majority judgement had struck down some amendments made to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999.The amendments -- National Accountability (Second Amendment) Act 2022 -- were passed in a joint sitting of the parliament in April 2022 during the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led government, which came into power after ousting ex-premier Khan via a no-trust move in 2022, as reported by Geo News.It modified sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 25 and 26 of the NAB laws, however, 9 out of 10 amendments were declared ""null and void"" by the CJP Bandial-led bench on the PTI founder's petition filed in June 2022.Referring to the September 15 ruling, the court today pointed out that the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 -- which required that a plea must be heard by ""not less than five judges of the SC"" -- was enacted while Khan's petition was pending adjudication.The top court also noted that the petition challenging the amendments made to the Ordinance was not heard and decided in accordance with the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act -- hereinafter referred to as the ""Act"".In a 2-1 majority verdict announced in September last year, a three-member bench had approved Imran Khan's petition, challenging the NAB law amendments made during the tenure of the previous PDM-led government.Subsequently, the federal government, filed an intra-court appeal against the Pakistan SC judgement in October, stating that the majority judgement suffers from ""procedural impropriety"" and is, therefore, ""liable to be set aside.""Following the amendments, the NAB was restricted to investigating any graft case worth less than Pakistrupees (PKR) 500 million. The accountability body's powers were also curtailed to probe into a fraud case unless its victims are more than 100.The amendments also modified the NAB law to keep an accused in its custody for a maximum of 14 days which was later exceeded to 30 days, Geo News reported.","Pakistan Supreme Court reinstated amendments made to the country's National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), overturning its own decision from last year.

'Intent of slaughtering as many Jews as possible': Pakistani arrested for plotting terrorist attack in New York,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pakistani-man-arrested-in-canada-for-plotting-terrorist-attack-in-new-york/articleshow/113141406.cms,"(With input from agencies)

A 20-year-old Pakistani national , named Muhammad Shahzeb Khan , living in Canada was taken into custody after being charged with attempting to orchestrate an attack in New York City and providing material support and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham ( ISIS ), according to a statement released by the US Department of Justice on Friday.As per the statement, Attorney general Merrick B Garland said that Khan who also goes by the name Shahzeb Jadoon allegedly planned a terrorist attack in New York City around October 7 ""with the intent of slaughtering in the name of ISIS, as many Jewish people as possible.""Khan attempted to travel from Canada to New York City and intended to carry out a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn, New York.He was arrested in Canada, just 12 miles (19 km) from the US border.""We are deeply grateful to our Canadian partners for their critical law enforcement actions in this matter. Jewish communities like all communities in this country should not have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist attack,"" Garland said in the statement.Around November 2023, Khan began expressing his support for ISIS on social media platforms and through encrypted messaging applications. During this time, he shared ISIS propaganda videos and literature with others. Later, Khan started engaging in communication with two undercover law enforcement officers, according to the statement.Khan told two undercover law enforcement officers to obtain AR-style assault rifles, ammunition, and other materials to carry out the attacks, and identified locations where the attacks would take place and shared information about his plans to cross the border from Canada into the United States to execute the attacks.The planned attack was set for around Oct. 7, 2024, nearly a year after Hamas launched an assault in Israel, resulting in over 1,000 deaths. Khan said that ""Oct 7th and Oct 11th are the best days for targeting the Jews"" citing October 7 as the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel and October 11 as Yom Kippur , a Jewish religious holiday.The Pakistani national faces a single count of attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organisation. If found guilty, he could receive a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The final sentence will be determined by a federal district court judge, who will consider the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.FBI Director Christopher Wray said, ""The defendant was allegedly determined to kill Jewish people here in the United States, nearly one year after Hamas' horrific attack on Israel. This investigation was led by the FBI, and I am proud of the terrific work by the FBI team and our partners to disrupt Khan's plan.""“The FBI will continue to work closely with our partners to investigate and hold accountable those who seek to commit violence in the name of ISIS or other terrorist organizations. Fighting terrorism remains the FBI's top priority,"" Wray added.","Pakistani national Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, 20, charged with attempting to orchestrate an attack in New York City and providing material support and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham.

North Carolina court orders RFK Jr's name to be removed just before ballots are sent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/north-carolina-court-orders-rfk-jr-s-name-to-be-removed-just-before-ballots-are-sent/articleshow/113140938.cms,"RALEIGH: A North Carolina appeals court on Friday ruled that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name must be taken off state ballots for president , upending plans in the battleground state just as officials were about to begin mailing out the nation's first absentee ballots for the Nov. 5 presidential .The intermediate-level Court of Appeals issued an order granting Kennedy's request to halt the mailing of ballots that included his name.The court also told a trial judge to order the State Board of Elections to distribute ballots without Kennedy's name on them. No legal explanation was given.State law otherwise required the first absentee ballots to be mailed or transmitted no later than 60 days before the general election, making Friday the deadline. The process of reprinting and assembling ballot packages likely would take more than two weeks, state attorneys have said. The ruling could be appealed.Kennedy, the nominee of the We The People party in North Carolina, had sued last week to get off the state's ballots after he suspended his campaign and endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump. But the Democratic majority on the State Board of Elections rejected the request, saying it was too late in the process of printing ballots and coding tabulation machines. Kennedy then sued.Wake County Superior Court Judge Rebecca Holt on Thursday denied Kennedy's effort to keep his name off ballots, prompting his appeal. In the meantime, Holt told election officials to hold back sending absentee ballots until noon Friday.A favorable outcome for Kennedy could assist Trump's efforts to win the presidential battleground of North Carolina. Trump won the state's electoral votes by just 1.3 percentage points over Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.More than 132,500 people - military and overseas workers and in-state civilian residents - have requested North Carolina absentee ballots so far, the State Board of Elections said.In an email, state board attorney Paul Cox told election directors in all 100 counties after Friday's ruling to hold on to the current ballots but not send them. More than 2.9 million absentee and in-person ballots have been printed so far.No decision has been made on appealing Friday's decision, Cox wrote, and removing Kennedy and running mate Nicole Shanahan from the ballot would be ""a major undertaking for everyone,"" Cox wrote.Since Kennedy suspended his campaign, the environmentalist and author has tried to get his name removed from ballots in several states where the race between Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris are expected to be close.Kennedy on Wednesday sued in Wisconsin to get his name removed from the presidential ballot there after the state elections commission voted to keep him on it. Kennedy also filed a lawsuit in Michigan but a judge ruled Tuesday that he must remain on the ballot there.","Kennedy, the nominee of the We The People party in North Carolina, had sued last week to get off the state's ballots after he suspended his campaign and endorsed Donald Trump.

The grassroots organization Hindus for America First has announced its endorsement of Republican candidate Donald Trump . In a bold move that could shift dynamics in the upcoming presidential race, the group also revealed plans to launch a campaign against Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in pivotal battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina.At a press conference on Thursday, Utsav Sanduja, chairman and founder of Hindus for America First, voiced strong concerns about Harris's potential presidency. Sanduja warned that Harris could destabilize Indo-US relations. ""If Kamala becomes the president, she might appoint liberal judges who could overturn critical Supreme Court decisions affecting Asian-American voters,"" he said.Sanduja also criticized the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of border security. ""Under their watch, we've seen a surge in illegal immigration, leading to unprecedented crime rates and drug smuggling, which particularly impacts minority communities, including many Asian-American business owners,"" he asserted.In contrast, Sanduja praised Trump for his pro-India stance. He highlighted Trump’s efforts to foster a merit-based immigration system and strengthen defense and technology ties with India. ""Trump has been very supportive of India. His strong relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his commitment to defense projects have been beneficial for India’s strategic position against China,"" Sanduja noted.He further criticized Harris for her ""disparaging remarks"" about India, claiming that Trump avoided interfering in India’s internal affairs, which he believes is crucial for maintaining strong Indo-US relations.Hindus for America First is mobilizing support in key states like Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada. Sanduja emphasized the global Hindu community’s concerns about attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh, urging political leaders to address the issue.Sanduja also credited Trump for his administration’s acknowledgment of Hindu persecution in various countries. ""Under President Trump, the State Department recognized the persecution of Hindus in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. His leadership in acknowledging Hindu genocide was significant,"" Sanduja said.As the election campaign heats up, Hindus for America First aims to leverage their influence in these crucial states, shaping the narrative and potentially impacting the election’s outcome.","Hindus for America First is mobilizing support in key states like Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada.

Aysenur Ezgi Eygi , a 26-year-old Turkish-American activist, was shot and killed on Friday while participating in an anti-settlement protest in Beita, a town in the occupied West Bank . Eygi, a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), was reportedly struck in the head by Israeli gunfire. This incident has sparked international condemnation and calls for an investigation.Turkey swiftly condemned the killing, attributing it to ""Israeli occupation soldiers"" and calling the act ""barbaric."" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed outrage over the death, emphasizing the need for accountability.The United States, while describing the event as ""tragic,"" has called on Israel to conduct a thorough investigation. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated, ""We are deeply disturbed by the tragic death of an American citizen,"" urging transparency and action from Israeli authorities.The United Nations Human Rights Office has directly accused Israeli forces of killing Eygi, asserting that she was ""shot in the head and killed."" The UN has emphasized that Eygi was part of a ""peaceful anti-settlement protest,"" highlighting the broader context of ongoing tensions in the region. Hospital director Fouad Nafaa confirmed Eygi's arrival at Rafidia hospital with a fatal gunshot wound.Eygi's death occurred amid heightened tensions following a 10-day Israeli military raid in Jenin, another flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The raid, part of broader Israeli military operations, has been widely criticized internationally. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has warned against escalating military actions in the West Bank, underscoring the need for a diplomatic solution.The violence in the West Bank has been exacerbated by the ongoing Gaza war, with significant casualties reported on both sides. Since October 7, when Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 662 Palestinians, while 23 Israelis have died in Palestinian attacks.Hamas condemned Eygi's killing as a ""crime committed by the Zionist occupation army,"" while Hussein al-Sheikh of the Palestine Liberation Organization called for international accountability. Al-Sheikh remarked on X, ""Another crime added to the series of crimes committed daily by the occupation forces,"" pressing for justice through international courts.As Israeli forces reportedly withdraw from Jenin, the situation remains tense. The UN reported 36 Palestinians killed during the raid, including eight children. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts continue, with the US and key allies like Qatar and Egypt working to negotiate a truce in the Gaza war. Despite these efforts, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has disputed the progress of negotiations, highlighting ongoing disagreements over military and diplomatic terms.As the international community grapples with the fallout from Eygi's death and the broader conflict, the urgent need for a sustainable resolution becomes increasingly clear. The focus now shifts to the response from Israeli authorities and the potential impact on the fragile peace process in the region.","Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26-year-old Turkish-American activist, was shot and killed on Friday.

"Pope urges end to Papua New Guinea tribal conflicts and fair, sustainable extraction of resources",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/pope-urges-end-to-papua-new-guinea-tribal-conflicts-and-fair-sustainable-extraction-of-resources/articleshow/113141237.cms,"PORT MORESBY: Pope Francis called Saturday for an end to tribal violence that has wracked Papua New Guinea for decades and appealed for sustainable, equitable development of its natural resources during a visit to the South Pacific nation.Dancers in swishing grass skirts performed for Francis as he opened his first full day in the country with a mix of political and church business.He met with the governor general and then addressed government authorities before visiting with the country's priests, nuns and street children.Francis is on an 11-day, four-nation tour through Southeast Asia and Oceania, the longest and most challenging of his pontificate. He landed on Friday evening in Port Moresby, the capital of the Commonwealth nation, from Jakarta, Indonesia to open the second leg of his journey.During his speech to government authorities and diplomats, Francis marveled at the diversity of the Papua New Guinea's people - there are some 800 languages spoken here - saying their variety must be ""a challenge to the Holy Spirit, who creates harmony amid differences!""But he also noted that such diversity has long created conflict here, a reference to the tribal violence over land and other disputes that have long characterized the country's culture but have grown lethal in recent years. Francis appealed for a sense of civic responsibility and cooperation to prevail, to benefit everyone.""It is my particular hope that tribal violence will come to an end, for it causes many victims, prevents people from living in peace and hinders development,"" he said.If people agree to sacrifice their personal interests for the common good, ""the necessary forces can be used to improve infrastructure, address the health and educational needs of the population and increase opportunities for dignified work,"" he said.The poor, strategically important Commonwealth nation is home to more than 10 million people, most of whom are subsistence farmers.In a related appeal, Francis also called for a ""definitive solution"" to the question of Bougainville, an island region whose people voted overwhelmingly to become independent from Papua New Guinea in 2019. The outcome of the nonbinding referendum has not been implemented.Francis also appealed for fair and environmentally sustainable extraction of country's vast natural resources, which include gold, nickel and natural gas. Disputes over how wealth should be distributed and who is entitled to mining royalties which have often led to conflicts.Francis has long insisted that development of natural resources must benefit local people, not just the multinational companies that extract them, and be pursued in an environmentally responsible way to preserve them for future generations.He made that argument again Saturday, saying Papua New Guinea's resources ""are destined by God for the entire community.""""Even if outside experts and large international companies must be involved in the harnessing of these resources, it is only right that the needs of local people are given due consideration when distributing the proceeds and employing workers,"" he said.""These environmental and cultural treasures represent at the same time a great responsibility, because they require everyone, civil authorities and all citizens, to promote initiatives that develop natural and human resources in a sustainable and equitable manner,"" he said.Later Saturday, Francis was visiting with charity workers who care for street children and then meeting with Papua New Guinea's clergy and religious sisters at a Marian sanctuary. On Sunday, he travels deep into the jungle to meet with Argentine missionaries.Francis is the second pope to visit Papua New Guinea, after St. John Paul II visited first in 1984, then in 1995 to beatify Peter To Rot, a Catholic layman who was declared a martyr for the faith after he died in prison during World War II.","Francis is on an 11-day, four-nation tour through Southeast Asia and Oceania, the longest and most challenging of his pontificate.

In the latest development, Georgia officials arrested Colin Gray , father of 14-year-old Colt Gray , who is accused of carrying out the deadly shooting at Apalachee High School . The shooting left four dead and nine injured.Investigators revealed Colt used an AR-15-style rifle in the attack, a firearm purchased by his father as a Christmas gift. As per the report by the Post, the rifle was given from father to son as a gift just seven months after authorities paid the pair a visit in May when the FBI received tips about online school shooting threats.The teen was interviewed after the sheriff received a tip from the FBI that Gray, then 13, “had possibly threatened to shoot up a middle school tomorrow.” The threat was made on Discord, a social media platform popular with video gamers, according to the sheriff's office incident report.Despite past investigations into threats made by Colt online, law enforcement had found no substantial evidence to act at the time.Sheriff Janis Mangum explained the earlier investigation: “The case was worked thoroughly last year, but at the time, the evidence wasn’t strong enough to confiscate their weapons.”Colin had assured authorities that his son had no unsupervised access to the family’s hunting guns, but that assurance has since proven tragically insufficient.The FBI's tip pointed to a Discord account associated with an email address linked to Colt Gray, the report said. But the boy said “he would never say such a thing, even in a joking manner,” according to the investigator's report.The interview transcript quotes the teen as saying: “I promise I would never say something where ...” with the rest of that denial listed as inaudible.“He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them,” the father, Colin Gray, said according to a transcript obtained from the sheriff's office.Authorities are now focusing on how Colt accessed the weapon and whether earlier warning signs could have prevented the attack.Authorities have now charged Colt as an adult with murder, accusing him of using a semiautomatic rifle to kill four and injure nine others. He had a history of struggling with his parent's separation and was often bullied, his father told investigators last year. Despite those issues, the teen frequently went hunting with his father, who described the ""greatest day ever"" when Colt shot his first deer.Colt and his father had been interviewed after the FBI tipped authorities about the teen possibly threatening to shoot up a school. The investigator's report noted inconsistencies, including the fact that the Discord account had been accessed in multiple locations, including Buffalo, New York, and featured profile details written in Russian. Despite the concerning behavior, no arrests were made due to a lack of evidence.Colin Gray, Colt’s father, admitted that guns were accessible in their home, but claimed they were unloaded. Colt had been photographed with blood smeared on his cheeks from hunting trips, further emphasizing the family's exposure to firearms.The shooting began when Colt left his Algebra class and tried to re-enter, but a student saw the gun and refused to let him in. He then turned to a nearby classroom and opened fire, firing 10 to 15 rounds.""I think he wanted to come to us first,"" His classmate, Lyela Sayarath, said, reported CNN.The first reports of an active shooter came in at around 10:20 am (local time) School resource officers and law enforcement quickly responded, and Colt was taken into custody after a brief confrontation.""I heard gunshots outside my classroom and people screaming, people begging not to get shot,"" said 14-year-old Macey Right. ""And then people sitting beside me (were) just shaking and crying.""The mass shooting at Apalachee High School marks the 30th such incident in the US this year.The shooting claimed the lives of two 14-year-old students, Christian Angulo and Mason Schermerhorn, as well as two beloved teachers, math teacher Christina Irimie and assistant football coach Richard Aspinwall.“We are truly heartbroken,” Christian’s older sister, Lisette Angulo, shared on a GoFundMe page to support the family.Apalachee Football also expressed their grief for Aspinwall: “To our beloved defensive coordinator Ricky Aspinwall, we will carry you heavy in our hearts.”Colt Gray, the 14-year-old accused of carrying out the deadly shooting at Apalachee High School, had denied ever threatening a school attack when interviewed by authorities in 2023. Jackson County Sheriff Janis Mangum defended the investigation from last year, saying, ""We did not drop the ball at all on this. We did all we could do with what we had at the time."" The interview followed an FBI tip about a threat made on Discord, but conflicting evidence prevented an arrest.The faculty’s quick actions, paired with newly implemented safety protocols like the Centegix alert system, likely prevented the tragedy from being even worse. “The protocols in this school and this system activated today prevented this from being a much larger tragedy than what we had,” said Georgia Bureau of Investigations Director Chris Hosey.The mass shooting at Apalachee High School marks the 30th such incident in the US this year.Colt had previously been investigated for threats made online in 2023, including an ominous reference to Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza. While both Colt and his father denied any intent to commit violence, the case was closed due to insufficient evidence.“The 13-year-old denied making the threats online,” Sheriff Mangum said in a Facebook post. However, the recent tragedy has reopened scrutiny into whether enough was done at the time.Colt Gray, currently in custody, is being held without bond and will be tried as an adult on charges of felony murder. His first court appearance is set for Friday, and investigators are piecing together how the gun was brought to school and if anyone else was involved in planning the attack.As the Apalachee High School community grapples with the shock of the incident, students like Macey express their fears about returning to school. “I really don’t want to go back. I feel like I shouldn’t have to go back to school worrying about dying.”","Colt Gray, 14, is accused of carrying out the deadly shooting at Apalachee High School.

Isolated in luxury: What we know about Russian President Putin's 'secret sons',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/isolated-in-luxury-what-we-know-about-russian-president-putins-secret-sons/articleshow/113111549.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly kept his two sons hidden from the public eye for years, treating their existence as a closely guarded state secret.Recent revelations by a Russian investigative journalism website have shed light on Putin's long-rumored relationship with former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva.The Dossier Center reported that the couple has two sons, Ivan, 9, and Vladimir Jr., 5, who reside in a heavily guarded mansion near Lake Valdai, north-west of Moscow.The boys live an isolated life of luxury, surrounded by nannies, governesses, and personal trainers, and are protected by the Kremlin's Federal Protective Service. They have never attended school and are instead educated by a team of private tutors.The young Putins' lives are shrouded in secrecy, with their identities hidden from official databases and their birth dates known only to close relatives.Kabaeva gave birth to Ivan in a private Swiss clinic in 2015, while Vladimir Jr. was born in Moscow in 2019. The Russian-born gynaecologist who delivered both boys passed away last year under mysterious circumstances.Despite their privileged upbringing, the boys lead a sheltered existence, with limited opportunities for social interaction. They have an extensive collection of toys and pets but can only play with each other or the adults in their household, the Daily Mail reported.Putin occasionally plays ice hockey with Ivan but always on the same team. The boys follow a strict daily routine, with meals prepared by personal chefs and served by dedicated waiters. They have access to private gym facilities and swimming pools, with personal coaches for each activity.The young Putins spend their summers on luxury yachts in the Gulf of Finland and the Black Sea coast, accompanied by their teachers and staff. They travel exclusively by private jet or armored train. Their parents have sought English teachers from countries sympathetic to Russia , with staff required to live in isolation and undergo a two-week quarantine before starting work.Putin has at least three other children, including two adult daughters from his previous marriage and a love-child from an affair with a cleaner. The intense secrecy surrounding his sons with Kabaeva may stem from his background as a former KGB officer, his sensitivity about his relationship with Kabaeva, and heightened security concerns following the Ukraine invasion.The revelations about Putin's sons have been met with mixed reactions from the Russian public, particularly as the country grapples with the loss of tens of thousands of its own sons in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.","Vladimir Putin has two sons, Ivan, 9, and Vladimir Jr., 5, with former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva.

MUMBAI: Canada’s Express Entry draws that offer permanent residency to those selected are back with a bang after a considerable hiatus. In May 2024, there were just two draws and only one in the following month. Since then, the periodicity of the draws has picked up, as was the earlier norm. However, there is a marked shift with ‘General’ category rounds conspicuous by their absence.The writing was on the wall – way back in March, Canada’s immigration minister, Marc Miller had said, “…As part of our efforts for temporary residents to transition to permanent residency, we will have more domestic draws for us and ask provinces and territories taking part in the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) to do the same with their allocations.”In other words, it was clear that going forward the focus would be on PNP draws and Canadian Experience Class (CEC) draws which are for skilled workers who have Canadian work experience and want to become permanent residents - typically such individuals are already residing in Canada.An analysis of the draws in July and August clearly reflects this. The main reason was to reduce an additional inflow of new immigrants and thus mitigate the pressure on health care and housing.Express Entry is a system used by the Canadian government to manage applications from skilled and qualified workers for permanent residence (PR) through three economic immigration programs. These are the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Canadian Experience Class (CEC) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program.Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the country’s immigration agency, on its website explains the different types of draws that are held throughout the year.In each draw, aspiring candidates are ranked relative to each other based on a score under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). Those who meet the cut-off score are sent an invitation to apply and become permanent residents. A permanent residency is akin to a green card in the USA and offers a future path to Canadian citizenship.The CRS score is divided into two sections. The core score can reach a maximum of 600 points and is based on the candidate’s age, education, official language proficiency, work experience etc. Second, a maximum of 600 points are awarded to the candidates if they meet policy or other objectives such as: having a provincial nomination, a qualifying offer of arranged employment, Canadian educational credentials, French-language proficiency or a sibling in Canada.Candidates that receive an invitation to apply have 60 days to either decline the invitation or submit an online application for permanent residence to IRCC. After a due process, applicants and their accompanying family members become permanent residents.Here is an analysis of the draws held during the past two months.Immigration experts point out that the cut off scores, except for category based draws be it - French proficiency draws or occupation-related draws, continue to remain high (above 500 points). Recently, IRCC also announced a pilot that offers a direct pathway to permanent residency to Francophone (French speaking) students.Those already in Canada now appear to have a better chance to become permanent residents under the Express Entry mechanism.","Canada’s Express Entry draws that offer permanent residency to those selected are back with a bang after a considerable hiatus.

Nile crocodiles: A fearsome species

Cassius: The largest crocodile

A massive 16-foot, 700 kg Nile crocodile named Henry , has been officially recognised as the world's oldest crocodile at 123 years old. The crocodile has fathered over 10,000 offspring with his six mates, according to the zoo where he inhabits.Henry, known for his big size and fearsome fangs, is nearly equivalent to that of a minibus. He was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana , a Unesco World Heritage Site .In the early 1900s, Henry was believed to have preyed on children from a local Botswana tribe. Frustrated with his deadly behavior, the tribe sought the help of renowned hunter Sir Henry Neumann in 1903. Instead of killing Henry, Neumann opted to capture him, sentencing the crocodile to a lifetime in captivity.Henry has spent the last thirty years at the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh, South Africa. He is admired from a safe distance at the conservation centre, far removed from his violent past.Nile crocodiles, found across 26 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, are known for their aggressive nature. These apex predators inhabit various aquatic environments, including lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshes. Known for their brutality, Nile crocodiles often prey on animals such as zebras and porcupines. Tragically, hundreds of people fall victim to these formidable predators each year.Although Henry holds the title of the oldest crocodile, Cassius, a 16-foot saltwater crocodile from Australia, is known as the largest. Captured in 1984, Cassius is a prominent feature at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island, off the coast of Queensland. In 2011, he was officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the world’s largest living saltwater crocodile.","Henry was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.

The world of billionaires offers a sharp contrast. Many of the youngest billionaires inherited their wealth from their parents, whereas older generations frequently established their fortunes through their own efforts. Nonetheless, a few young billionaires have conquered the obstacles of entrepreneurship and innovation. Their success tales are characterised by perseverance, resilience, and the ability to seize opportunities.Regardless of how they become wealthy, today's young billionaires are not only constructing empires, but also shaping the future. Their tales show that with passion and determination, dreams can become reality.Let's examine the world's top 10 youngest billionaires and how they earned their incredible fortunes.Clemente Del Vecchio is the second youngest billionaire on the list. He inherited a 12.5% stake in the Luxembourg-based holding company Delfin from his late father, Leonardo Del Vecchio, who was the chairman of EssilorLuxottica until his death in 2022. Delfin's assets include shares in EssilorLuxottica, insurer Generali, and banks like Mediobanca and UniCredit. Despite inheriting this fortune, Clemente is passionate about science and technology and aims to pursue higher education in these fields.Kim Jung-youn and her sister, Jung-min, hold around 18% of NXC, the largest shareholder in the online gaming company Nexon. Their shares were inherited from their late father, Kim Jung-ju, who founded Nexon in 1994 and passed away in February 2022. Both sisters are not involved in Nexon's daily operations and prefer to maintain a low profile.Livia Voigt is a major shareholder in WEG, the leading electrical motor manufacturer in Latin America. Her grandfather, Werner Ricardo Voigt, co-founded WEG along with other prominent figures. Despite being the largest individual shareholder, Livia remains a university student and does not hold an executive role at the company.Kevin David Lehmann owns a 50% stake in Germany's drugstore chain, dm (Drogerie Markt), which generates about $14 billion in annual revenue. The chain was founded in 1973, and Lehmann's father, Guenther, invested in dm in 1974, later transferring his 50% stake to Kevin David in 2017. Kevin David and his father have kept a low profile and are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the company.Luca Del Vecchio is one of the six children of the late Leonardo Del Vecchio. He inherited a 12.5% stake in Delfin from his father, alongside his brother Clemente. Delfin's portfolio includes shares in EssilorLuxottica, Generali, Mediobanca, UniCredit, and Covivio. Unlike Clemente, Luca is actively involved as the Chief Strategy Officer at Delfin.Kim Jung-min, the sister of Jung-youn, ranks fourth among the youngest billionaires. Both sisters together hold about 31% of NXC, which is the largest shareholder in Nexon. Like her sister, Kim Jung-min maintains a private life and does not participate in Nexon’s daily operations.Remi Dassault is part of the Dassault family, known for founding Dassault Aviation, an aerospace company with origins in World War I. His father, Olivier Dassault, was a notable French politician who passed away in 2021. The Dassault family also owns vineyards, a private aviation company, and the newspaper Le Figaro.Zahan Mistry inherited an 18.4% stake in Tata Sons following the death of his father, Cyrus Mistry, in 2022. He is actively involved in the family’s construction empire and holds a 25% stake in Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which is planning to list Afcons Infrastructure for $850 million as part of its debt reduction strategy.Dora Voigt de Assis, Livia Voigt's older sister, is also a significant shareholder in WEG, the leading electrical motor manufacturer in Latin America. Dora graduated from architecture college in 2020 and, like her sister, does not hold any executive position at WEG.Firoz Mistry, Zahan Mistry's elder brother, inherited a portion of the family's 18.4% stake in Tata Sons following their father’s death. He pursued his education at the University of Warwick and is known for his business acumen and strategic insight. Firoz holds a 25% stake in Shapoorji Pallonji Group.","Clemente Del Vecchio is the second youngest billionaire on the list.

Survey details

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are virtually tied in key battleground states , according to a YouGov poll conducted for The Times and SAY24. The survey, covering August 23 to September 3, highlighted a close race with Harris leading in four swing states while Trump edged ahead in three, all within the margin of error, reported The Hill.Harris held a slight edge in Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.The poll showed her leading by five points in Michigan (48% to 43%), three points in both Nevada (49% to 46%) and Wisconsin (47% to 44%). In Pennsylvania, she led by just one point (46% to 45%) among registered voters.Trump, on the other hand, led in Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina. His leads were narrow, with a two-point advantage in both Arizona (47% to 45%) and Georgia (47% to 45%). In North Carolina, he was slightly ahead with 47% support compared to Harris’s 46%.Carl Bialik, Vice President of Data Science at YouGov, commented, “Even compared to March, Harris was running ahead or even in each state. She was performing on par with or better than Biden’s 2020 results in these battlegrounds.” He added, “If these leads held and the rest of the states voted similarly to 2020, Harris would have won the electoral college.”CNN’s recent polling showed no decisive lead in Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, with Harris ahead by 50% to 44% in Wisconsin and 48% to 43% in Michigan. Conversely, Trump has a five-point lead in Arizona (49% to 44%).According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Harris led Trump by 4 percentage points (49.7% to 45.7%) in aggregate polls. A USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll from August 25-28 also showed Harris ahead by 48% to 43%, within the margin of error.Despite these fluctuations, betting markets—which are not legally regulated in the U.S.—reflected ongoing uncertainty, with Harris slightly ahead post-Democratic National Convention.The YouGov poll surveyed 900 respondents in Arizona and Wisconsin, 800 in Nevada, and 1,000 in the remaining states, with a margin of error between 3 and 5 percent.As the election landscape continued to shift, these battleground states remained pivotal, with both candidates fighting hard for every vote.","Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are virtually tied in key battleground states, according to a YouGov poll conducted for The Times and SAY24.

Boeing Starliner heads back home without any astronauts onboard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeings-starliner-heads-back-home-without-any-astronauts-onboard/articleshow/113141292.cms,"Boeing 's Starliner capsule, after a period of uncertainty about its safety, left the International Space Station on Friday to Earth without its crew. The two NASA test pilots, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will remain at the space station until next year.The Starliner capsule undocked 260 miles (420 kilometers) over China, with springs gently pushing it away from the orbiting laboratory.The return flight was expected to take six hours, with a nighttime landing in the New Mexico desert.""She's on her way home,"" astronaut Suni Williams radioed after Starliner exited.Williams and Wilmore were supposed to fly Starliner back to Earth in June, a week after launching in it. However, thruster failures and helium leaks compromised their ride to the space station.Nasa then decided it was too risky for them to return on Starliner, which led to the fully automated capsule departing with empty seats and blue spacesuits, along with some old station equipment. SpaceX will bring the duo back in late February, extending their original eight-day mission to more than eight months.""A minute after separating from the space station, Starliner's thrusters could be seen firing as the white, blue-trimmed capsule slowly backed away. Nasa Mission Control called it a 'perfect' departure.""Following the undocking, flight controllers planned additional test firings of the capsule's thrusters.Engineers believe that the more the thrusters are fired, the hotter they become, causing the protective seals to swell and obstruct the flow of propellant. Unfortunately, they won't be able to examine any of the parts, as the section containing the thrusters will be discarded just before reentry.Following the June 5 launch, Starliner's propulsion system experienced a small helium leak, which was initially thought to be isolated. However, four additional leaks emerged after liftoff, and five thrusters failed. Although four of the thrusters were recovered, Nasa expressed concern about potential malfunctions that could hinder the capsule's descent from orbit.Over the summer, Boeing conducted extensive thruster tests both in space and on the ground, and was confident that Starliner could safely return Wilmore and Williams to Earth. However, NASA had a different opinion and decided to go with SpaceX instead.As experienced astronauts and retired Navy captains, Wilmore and Williams anticipated challenges on the test flight. They have kept busy in space, assisting with repairs and experiments. The two are now full-time station crew members, joining the seven others on board.Boeing's first astronaut flight marks the end of a journey filled with delays and setbacks. After the space shuttles retired more than a decade ago, Nasa contracted Boeing and SpaceX for orbital taxi service. Boeing encountered numerous problems on its first uncrewed test flight in 2019, requiring a repeat mission. The 2022 do-over revealed even more flaws, with the repair bill exceeding $1 billion.Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew program manager, stated earlier this week that teams have been so focused on Starliner's return that they haven't had time to consider what's next for Boeing. He emphasized that NASA remains committed to having two competing U.S. companies transporting astronauts.","Boeing's Starliner capsule left the International Space Station on Friday to return to Earth without its crew.

3 die amid outbreak of legionnaires' disease at an assisted living home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/3-die-amid-outbreak-of-legionnaires-disease-at-an-assisted-living-home/articleshow/113141528.cms,"Three people who tested positive for Legionnaires' disease have died amid an outbreak at an assisted living home in Albany , New York, that sickened at least seven others, officials said on Friday.The deaths came amid what Maribeth Miller, the interim Albany County health commissioner, described in an email as a ""cluster"" of Legionnaires' cases at the Peregrine Senior Living at Shaker home that officials had learned of Aug.30.Water samples from the home showed the presence of Legionella bacteria , which causes the disease, Miller wrote. She said the county Health Department had placed certain restrictions on water use at the home while more tests were conducted. Water filters have been installed on some showers and sinks so residents can still use bathrooms, she added.""There is no threat to the community at large,"" Miller wrote.Kristyn Ganim, the home's executive director, said employees had been working with health officials to address the outbreak. In addition to installing filters across the water treatment system, she said, staff members were providing residents with bottled water.""I want to reassure all of our residents, staff and visitors that our community is completely safe,"" she said in a statement.Legionella bacteria occurs naturally in water, and people typically contract Legionnaires' disease by inhaling mists or water vapor containing the bacteria, according to the state Health Department. The bacteria can grow in poorly maintained industrial water systems; cooling towers; or heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.People 50 and older and those who have compromised immune systems are at particular risk of contracting the disease, according to the state Health Department. Symptoms, which usually begin two to 10 days after exposure to the bacteria, include fever, headaches, muscle aches, coughing and shortness of breath.Most cases can be successfully treated with antibiotics, but about 1 in 10 people who contract the disease die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 1 in 4 of those who contract it at a health care facility die.Mary Rozak, a spokesperson for the Albany County executive, Daniel McCoy, said that 25 people linked to the 171-bed home had been hospitalized in connection with the outbreak. Ten tested positive, including the three who died, she said. About nine others tested negative; the rest reported symptoms but were not tested.Of the three people who died, Rozak said, two had been hospitalized for treatment of other ailments, and it was unclear whether Legionnaires' disease had killed them.The Legionella bacteria was first discovered through an outbreak connected to an American Legion convention in Philadelphia in 1976. There are about 6,000 documented cases of the disease a year in the United States, according to the safety and health administration, and 200 to 800 in New York, according to the state Health Department. The figures may understate the true number of cases because many infections go undiagnosed or unreported, officials say.The number of reported cases of Legionnaires' disease has been on the rise since the early 2000s and peaked in 2018, CDC data shows. The number of cases dropped when the COVID-19 pandemic began but started to creep up again in 2021, according to the data.There have been several outbreaks in New York City over the past decade, including one that killed five people at a Manhattan nursing home in 2022 and another in 2015 that caused 16 deaths and was linked to a cooling tower in the Bronx.","The deaths came amid a ""cluster"" of Legionnaires' cases at a New York assisted living home.

He was being held without bond at a detention center. Mingledorff told Gray that he was charged with four counts of felony murder and that he could face life in prison if convicted by a jury. Gray was shackled as he sat next to his attorney.His father, Colin Gray, came before Mingledorff about 40 minutes after his son left the court. He has been charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder and eight counts of cruelty to children. The 54-year-old was shackled and wearing a jail striped shirt and pants. The judge said the elder Gray faces up to 180 years in prison.It's the latest example of prosecutors holding parents responsible for their children's actions in shootings. In April, Michigan parents Jennifer and James Crumbley were the first convicted in a US mass school shooting. They were sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for not securing a firearm at home and acting indifferently to their son's deteriorating mental health before he killed four students in 2021.","Colt Gray, 14, is charged as an adult with killing four people at his high school.

"US reports first bird flu case without animal exposure, sparks public health alert",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-reports-first-bird-flu-case-without-animal-exposure-sparks-public-health-alert/articleshow/113141201.cms,"A Missouri resident has become the first person in the United States to contract avian influenza without any known exposure to infected animals, authorities confirmed on Friday. This rare case marks a significant shift in the patterns of infection, as all previous US cases have involved contact with farm animals or contaminated environments.The patient, an adult with pre-existing health conditions, was hospitalized on August 22 after testing positive for a suspicious strain of the flu.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, the individual was treated with antiviral medication, made a full recovery, and was discharged from the hospital shortly after.Initial tests indicated an unusual flu strain, prompting further investigation at both state and federal laboratories. These tests confirmed the presence of the H5 virus, commonly known as avian or bird flu. This case brings the total number of bird flu cases in the US to 14 this year, but it stands out as the first instance of a human infection without direct animal contact.Missouri health officials have stressed that no H5 infections have been detected in dairy cattle within the state, although some cases have been reported among wild birds and in commercial or backyard poultry flocks. Historically, bird flu has primarily affected farmworkers or those in close proximity to livestock. The first US case of bird flu in a human was reported in 2022, also involving a farmworker.While avian flu is usually confined to wild birds and poultry, recent outbreaks have been reported in mammals, including cattle. This year has seen a significant number of cattle infections across the country.The CDC maintains that the risk to the general public remains low, but they warn that this could change quickly as more information becomes available. ""Although human infections are rare, circumstances may evolve as we learn more about this case,"" the agency said in a statement.In the past, sporadic human infections have been recorded without a clear link to animals. However, the CDC emphasizes that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission—a critical factor that could dramatically raise the threat level of the virus.Although most previous cases in the US have been mild and involved healthy farmworkers, the broader population, especially those with pre-existing health conditions, could be at greater risk for severe illness. Globally, the mortality rate for confirmed bird flu cases hovers around 50%, though experts believe many mild cases likely go undetected.","A Missouri resident has become the first person in the United States to contract avian influenza without any known exposure to infected animals.

Merchan, who is also weighing a defence request to overturn the verdict on immunity grounds, delayed Trump 's sentencing until Nov 26, three weeks after the final votes are cast in the presidential election.It had been scheduled for Sept. 18, about seven weeks before Election Day. The new date is the Tuesday before Thanksgiving.Merchan said he was postponing the sentencing ""to avoid any appearance that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching prez election in which the defendant is a candidate."" ""The court is a fair, impartial, and apolitical institution,"" he said.The ex-prez's lawyers had pushed for the delay arguing that punishing the Republican nominee in the thick of his campaign to retake the White House would amount to election interference. His lawyers argued that delaying his sentencing until after the election would also allow him time to weigh next steps after Merchan rules on the defence's request to reverse his conviction and dismiss the case because of the US Supreme Court's July presidential immunity ruling . In his order Friday, Merchan delayed a decision on that until Nov. 12.Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 polls.

Brazilian plane crash report: Ice buildup and de-icing failures under scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brazilian-plane-crash-report-ice-buildup-and-de-icing-failures-under-scrutiny/articleshow/113140940.cms,"A preliminary report on last month's tragic plane crash in Brazil , which claimed the lives of all 62 passengers and crew, reveals a troubling issue with the aircraft’s de-icing system. Published on Friday, the report suggests that ice formation on the plane’s wings and a malfunctioning de-icing system could have significantly contributed to the disaster.Investigators have been cautious not to definitively link ice buildup to the crash, emphasizing that their work is ongoing. However, the report adds weight to the prevailing theory among aviation experts that ice formation and the de-icing system’s failure played a crucial role, reported AP.On August 9, the Voepass flight, an ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop, took off from Cascavel, Paraná, heading to São Paulo’s Guarulhos International Airport. The plane crashed into a residential area in Vinhedo, about 80 kilometers northwest of São Paulo, just minutes after reporting issues with ice accumulation.Cockpit voice recorder data reveals that pilots were concerned about ice buildup, with the copilot noting, ""A lot of ice,"" just two minutes before the crash. The plane’s data recorder showed that the de-icing system, which is manually controlled by the pilots, repeatedly cycled on and off, suggesting it was activated but may not have functioned properly.Carlos Henrique Baldin, head of the investigation division at Brazil’s Air Force Center for the Investigation and Prevention of Air Accidents (Cenipa), stressed that while ice formation seems to be a significant factor, ""there are still many doubts."" The report also highlights that the aircraft was equipped with protection equipment that should have prevented such an incident.Henrique Hacklaender, president of the national aviators' union, noted that while the de-icing system was engaged, it remains unclear whether it was effectively utilized. ""Based on the preliminary report, it isn’t possible to conclusively affirm that ice on the wings caused the accident, but there are indications it was a significant contributing factor,"" Hacklaender told The Associated Press.The investigation, which is also being reviewed by the Federal Police, is ongoing with no set deadline for completion. The ATR 72, produced by the French-Italian company ATR, has been involved in several fatal accidents over the years, including a similar crash in Nepal in January 2023.As the probe continues, the aviation community and the victims' families await further clarity on the cause of this devastating crash.","A preliminary report on last month's tragic plane crash in Brazil reveals a troubling issue with the aircraft's de-icing system.

How Elon Musk is influencing Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-elon-musk-is-influencing-donald-trump/articleshow/113140885.cms,"In a livestreamed conversation on his social platform X with former President Donald Trump last month, Elon Musk raised the idea of a "" government efficiency commission ."" Such a council could ensure that taxpayers' money was ""spent in a good way,"" Musk said during their more-than-two-hour talk.""I'd love it,"" Trump said.On Thursday, Trump followed up on Musk's suggestion.In a speech at the Economic Club of New York, Trump said he planned to appoint Musk, who leads Tesla , SpaceX and X, as the head of a new government efficiency commission if he was elected president in November.The commission would audit the ""entire federal government"" and ""make recommendations for drastic reforms,"" Trump said.The announcement capped weeks of discussions between Trump and Musk, who have bonded over a mutual hobbyhorse of eliminating wasteful spending, three people close to the men said. Trump has told Musk that he wants the tech entrepreneur to slash the federal government's costs, just as he did at X, one of the people said.Musk, the world's richest man, has started to influence Trump as the Republican presidential nominee heads into November's election. That the tech mogul has the ear of the candidate throws open what each can get out of an alliance -- and creates a potential minefield. Their political friendship is particularly tricky because Musk has a sprawling set of businesses, which may present conflicts of interest if Trump is elected.Notably, Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, and his electric automaker, Tesla, have received billions of dollars in federal contracts and subsidies. Musk and some of his companies are also under scrutiny for various infractions from federal agencies including the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.""The conflict-of-interest issue is one of the more obvious concerns in this appointment, with SpaceX having government contracts and Tesla benefiting from federal tax credits,"" said Ann Skeet, a senior director at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. ""That's just what happens if Musk is in a position of power in a government agency.""Musk, 53, has wooed right-wing world leaders before to benefit himself and his companies. In Brazil, he became close with then-President Jair Bolsonaro as he sought advantages for SpaceX. Musk also ardently supports President Javier Milei of Argentina, a country with abundant deposits of lithium, a mineral used in Tesla's car batteries. Milei has promised to cut government spending and encourage mining operations.Musk, who endorsed Trump for the presidency in July, did not respond to a request for comment. Before Trump's speech Thursday, Musk posted on X: ""I look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises. No pay, no title, no recognition is needed.""Brian Hughes, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement, ""Elon Musk has dedicated himself to America's future by offering to serve with President Trump to ensure our government works more efficiently and uses America's taxpayer dollars effectively."" He added that Trump, 78, was ""committed to having Mr. Musk lead this commission to analyze the functionality of our government.""Musk has long used his account on X, where he has nearly 197 million followers, to push his political views. In recent weeks, he has posted messages excoriating the Biden administration's policies on government spending and criticizing the campaign promises of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.Some of his posts have become more erratic. On Sunday, Musk endorsed a post that suggested that women did not have the ability for critical thought and should not participate in government or democracy. On Monday, he shared an artificial intelligence-generated image of Harris dressed as a communist.Musk has also posted about spending cuts. He has expressed concerns over what he views as wasteful costs at his businesses, including at X, where he slashed more than 75% of the workforce in 2022 and 2023. X's market valuation has dropped more than 55% since Musk bought the company in 2022, as advertisers have shied from the platform.""Government spending is driving America to bankruptcy,"" Musk posted on X on Thursday.Musk and Trump were not always fans of each other. Musk previously said Trump should ""sail into the sunset"" and instead supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Trump once used an expletive to describe Musk as a phony.But their political relationship was kindled with a meeting in March in Palm Beach, Florida, as Trump sought cash infusions for his campaign. Around then, Musk also told a friend that he wanted to keep his support for Trump quiet while backing him financially, the friend recalled.Musk has since abandoned that caution. Over the spring, he seeded a pro-Trump super political action committee and planned to put as much as $180 million into the group. He also recruited some of his friends, such as tech investor Joe Lonsdale, to front some of the early money for the PAC, which planned to do field organizing for Trump.But the foray has not been smooth. Musk hired a team for the PAC that he met through Texas politics, but fired them after about two months, replacing them with national political operatives who had worked for DeSantis. Thousands of field organizers were affected by the switch.Musk has since hired a top Republican political operative, Chris Young, to personally advise him on how to grow more sophisticated in his political work.In June, at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting, Musk said he and Trump had been speaking. ""I have had some conversations with him, and he does call me out of the blue for no reason,"" Musk said.After an assassination attempt against Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July, Musk decided to publicly speak up about his support for the Republican candidate.""I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,"" Musk wrote on X. He later posted a photograph of Trump moments after the assassination attempt and added: ""Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt.""During their conversation on X last month, Trump called Musk ""the greatest cutter"" and praised him for firing employees who wanted to strike. In a podcast appearance a few weeks later, Trump called Musk a ""brilliant guy"" who could be a consultant to his administration ""involved in cutting some of the fat.""On Thursday, Trump provided few details of what an efficiency commission would do, but he said ""fraud and improper payments"" had cost taxpayers ""hundreds of billions of dollars."" He did not say if Musk planned to divest from or take time off from his companies for the role, should it come to pass.""As the first order of business, this commission will develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months, saving trillions of dollars,"" Trump said, without providing any evidence.","Trump says he will appoint Musk to head a government efficiency commission. The commission would audit the ""entire federal government"" and ""make recommendations for drastic reforms"" The tech mogul has a sprawling set of businesses, which may present conflicts of interest if Trump is elected.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113140935,imgsize-1406078,width-400,resizemode-4/113140935.jpg"

Colt, then 13, had recently shot his first deer, and his father kept a photo on his phone of the animal's blood smeared on the boy's cheeks -- a common tradition among hunters.Gray said that he and his son had often discussed ""all the school shootings, things that happen."" He told the investigator with the Jackson County sheriff's office: ""He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them.""Gray said his son had been picked on during the last three months of the school year, which had just ended at the time of the interview. The problems had escalated to the point at which Colt had trouble concentrating on his final exams, his father said.Gray said he had been to his son's middle school frequently, talking to the principal and asking for support. ""He gets flustered and under pressure,"" he said of Colt. ""He doesn't really think straight.""The investigator was looking into tips about a post made in a chat group on Discord, a social media site, about a potential school shooting. The post, which had been reported to the FBI, was linked by investigators to the account associated with Gray's son.Gray said in a follow-up phone call with an investigator that he didn't know much about Discord and that he had asked his son to ""dumb this down for me."" His son had told him about people called ""raiders"" who could break into other people's Discord accounts, he said. ""They can make it basically say whatever they want to about you,"" Gray said his son had explained.Colt told the investigator that he had not used Discord in months and was only on TikTok to watch videos. The investigator ended one interview by telling the teenager, who had just finished seventh grade, to focus on getting good grades.""It'll set you up for the rest of your life,"" he said.In a follow-up phone call with Gray, an investigator told him he wasn't sure they would be able to get to the bottom of who had made the post on Discord. He assured Gray he didn't think Colt was being dishonest and encouraged Gray to make sure his son's identity had not been stolen.Gray said his son was eager for the situation to be resolved. ""He wants to know what happened,"" he told the investigator.","Colin Gray said he wanted to get his son, Colt, interested in the outdoors and away from video games.

It was awful. And he needs to pay a price for it,” Polhamus was quoted as saying. “He was driven to do what he did by the environment that he lived in.”The 16-year-old Colt Gray faces four counts of felony murder following the shooting that claimed the lives of four people and injured nine others.

While Colt Gray, as a minor, is exempt from the death penalty, he could face life imprisonment. Colin Gray’s potential sentence could reach 180 years if convicted.District Attorney Brad Smith addressed the media after the hearings, underscoring the rarity of a parent being charged in connection with a school shooting. “This may be the first case in Georgia, and the second in the country, where a parent faces charges like this,” Smith said.Polhamus, struggling with the weight of the situation, added, “He deserves what he gets. The one thing I’m telling you is he wasn’t born to do that. He’s a victim of his environment.

Justice Asim Hafiz, who delivered the verdict, noted that the process was illegal.""Lest anyone misunderstand this, we make it clear that the appointment to any post under the government can only be made after a proper advertisement has been made, inviting applications from eligible candidates. Without holding a proper selection where all eligible candidates get a fair chance to compete would violate the guarantee enshrined under Articles 18 and 27 of the Constitution,"" Hafiz said.""I am afraid that illegality committed by way of an unauthorized appointment, one cannot hide the elephant in a mouse-hole,"" the judge added.The ruling is considered unusual given the powerful role the Pakistan army has traditionally played in the country, including periods of military rule in its more than 75 years of existence.Experts say the high court's decision might be seen as a setback for those who support the current regime, as the military often seeks to place its personnel in major civil positions.",Afsar became the first serving military officer to head Nadra in October 2023.

His arrest, however, has been seen by the opposition as a ploy to implicate Imran in cases linked to May 9 riots. This apprehension had prompted Khan to approach the Islamabad high court on Tuesday, pleading to stop civilian authorities from handing him over to the military. “A few weeks ago, a retired senior army officer (Faiz Hameed) was taken into military custody. It has been widely speculated and reported in the media that he will be made an approver against the petitioner (Imran Khan) in cases pertaining to May 9 and 10, 2023 and the petitioner will be transferred to military custody on this basis,” the petition read.Govt officials have repeatedly said Hameed worked with Khan to plan the riots.Addressing a press conference in Rawalpindi, army’s spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the law takes its own course if a person from the Pakistani army works for personal gain or promotes a specific agenda.“The case of Gen Hameed is a clear example that the army takes violations of its rules very seriously. He (Hameed) had overstepped his legal and constitutional boundaries at the behest of certain political elements,” Chaudhary said.He said Gen Hameed’s case was referred to the Pakistani army through the defence ministry in light of a “full belief in the army’s accountability process”, following which the army ordered a “high-level court of inquiry” into the matter.“There is a clear consensus within the army that it is a national, state-owned institution, which must be prevented from being used against the completion of goals related to specific political agendas.”Khan is being currently tried in a civil court for allegedly abetting the violence on May 9, 2023, a charge he has denied.",Court martial proceedings against former ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (retd) were initiated.

It mentioned that no documentation or order has been attached to the petition. The registrar's office asked how the petitions can be filed in the Islamabad high court when cases have been filed in Punjab.Furthermore, the IHC registrar's office questioned how the petition can be filed in a high court while the matter of military trials is subjudice in the supreme court , according to a Geo News report.Speaking to reporters, Imran Khan's lawyer, Intezar Panjutha said that they talked to the PTI founder regarding his plea in the IHC.

Asif made the remarks in response to former Pakistan PM Imran Khan's demand for an ""open trial"" of former inter-services intelligence chief (retd) Faiz Hamid.Violent protests erupted in Pakistan after Imran Khan was arrested from the premises of Islamabad High Court in a graft case on May 9, 2023. During the protests, the alleged PTI supporters vandalised military installations, including General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, and were involved in arson at the Lahore Corps commander house.In December 2021, the supreme court in a 5:1 majority verdict suspended its October 23, 2023 order wherein it declared civilians' trials in military courts null and void in connection with the May 9 riots, Geo News reported.The court's verdict came after intra-court appeals were filed by the federal and provincial governments and the defence ministry against the top court's decision announced by Justice Ijazul Ahsan-led bench earlier that year.According to the order issued on December 13, the military court trials would be conditioned on the Supreme Court's final verdict on the intra-court pleas.","The Islamabad high court registrar's office has raised objections on a petition filed by former Pakistan PM Imran Khan.

They were protesting against alleged immoral activities in the area, which they claimed were being facilitated by local police and officials. The protesters also forcibly shut down businesses and threatened traders with severe consequences.When police intervened and invoked Section 144 of the CrPC, which bans gatherings, the demonstrators responded with hostility, Dawn state in its report. They attacked police officers with batons and sticks, damaged official vehicles, and used weapons to enforce the closure of business centers.Jamia Hafsa is a conservative madrassa adjacent to the controversial Lal Masjid mosque in Islamabad.The Lal Masjid controversy in Pakistan is a complex and contentious episode that unfolded primarily in 2007, involving a prominent mosque in Islamabad known for its association with Islamist radicalism. The mosque had increasingly become a centre of militant activity and anti-government sentiment, Dawn stated.Per Dawn's report, in response to the mosque's growing defiance and the enforcement of its version of Sharia law in the surrounding areas, the Pakistani government, under President Pervez Musharraf , launched Operation Silence . This military operation aimed to reclaim control from the militants who had fortified themselves within the mosque.The operation, marked by intense fighting and heavy casualties, drew significant criticism from Islamic groups, who condemned the military's tactics and the resultant civilian suffering. The aftermath of the operation exacerbated anti-government sentiment and contributed to the rise of extremist militancy in Pakistan, highlighting the deep-seated tensions between religious extremism, state authority, and public sentiment, Dawn reported.","The charges were filed at the Lohi Bher police station under Section 11-X of the Anti-Terrorism Act and various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Furthermore, 150 people were injured in various incidents, with 88 of them being civilians.The majority of fatalities in Pakistan were attributed to 83 militant attacks , which resulted in the deaths of 175 individuals, including 92 civilians, 47 security personnel, and 36 militants. Additionally, 123 people were injured, with 88 civilians and 35 security personnel among them.

Anti-terror op turns sinister: Pakistani netizens being 'walled off' as army raises spectre of 'digital terrorism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terror-op-turns-sinister-pakistani-netizens-being-walled-off-as-army-raises-spectre-of-digital-terrorism/articleshow/112898501.cms,"Munir's repeated attacks on social media

Imran's ouster & rise of digital activism

National internet firewall

NEW DELHI: Pakistan 's ""whole-of-system approach"" to countering militancy is evolving and may be taking a turn to the sinister as its army's new anti-terror operation ' Azm-e-Istehkam ' (Resolve for Stability) is increasingly focusing on what it calls "" digital terrorism "".Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has over the past few months repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.He described the activities of ""inimical"" forces as a form of ""digital terrorism"" aimed at creating discord between the military and the public by spreading ""lies and fake news"".Launched in June, Azm-e-Istehkam is tackling not only traditional militancy, particularly in light of increasing attacks attributed to groups like the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but the evolving nature of threats in the digital landscape.The shift has sparked widespread concern with some analysts suggesting that the military is carrying out ""prejudiced online surveillance"" and curbing internet speeds across the country to battle the new ""digital threat"".The characterisation of digital terrorism in Munir's speeches have been notably vague, with rights activists noting that the term lacks a clear legal definition and could be weaponised against individuals who express criticism of the military or government policies online.In recent months, Munir has repeatedly voiced ""concerns"" regarding the impact of social media on national security and public discourse.In May -- just months before launching Azm-e-Istehkam -- Munir highlighted the issue of ""negative propaganda"" on social media, asserting that it poses threats to the integrity and security of Pakistan. He emphasised the military's readiness to counter any conspiracies and condemned the spread of disinformation, urging adherence to constitutional limits on freedom of expression, particularly as outlined in Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which restricts incitement to violence and undermining national security.In August, Munir reiterated these concerns, stating that social media is being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"" and warned against campaigns targeting the military. His remarks came in the context of rising tensions and comparisons being drawn to political instability in neighboring countries.On August 14, he again criticised the misuse of social media for spreading chaos and false information, attributing ""digital terrorism"" to foreign elements. He stressed the state's responsibility to protect citizens from the adverse effects of social media-driven hysteria and urged the public to remain vigilant against misinformation.He also warned that social media was being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"". His remarks that ""anarchy is spread through social media"" followed a condemnation by the army of social media campaigns to target the Pakistan Armed Forces.""Just as terrorists use weapons to get their demands met, digital terrorists use negative propaganda and fake news on social media platforms, mobiles and computers to create despondency to get their demands met,"" Pakistani military spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said.Chaudhry said the military had become the sole target of digital terrorists, and blamed a ""certain"" political party without naming ousted PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, which has a formidable social media presence.Imran Khan has repeatedly accused the military for orchestrating his removal from power in April 2022, and specifically named Munir as being responsible for his subsequent arrest in May 2023, claiming the Army chief harboured a ""personal grudge"" against him.Khan also alleged that Munir was behind the crackdown on his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), stating: ""It is personal. It's got nothing to do with national interest"". He also accused Munir of ""dismantling the future of this country [Pakistan] to protect himself"".Khan's arrest led to riots in May where protesters for the first time in the nation's history vented their anger on the military attacking several army installations.Digital activism in Pakistan spiked following Imran's ouster, whose party has relied heavily on social media to coordinate its activities. After TV channels were banned from covering PTI events, Khan gave several speeches online challenging the military's role in politics.These online events were often marred by internet blackouts or slowdown. Though authorities have said the drop in internet speed was due to technical issues, activists have claimed that the army is strategically using a national firewall and manipulating the country's internet infrastructure to curb any dissenting voices on the web.Pakistan has experienced a notable slowdown in internet speeds over the past few months, with reports indicating that up to 40% slower speeds have affected nearly half of the country's 241 million internet users.Users have reported difficulties in sending and receiving messages on platforms like WhatsApp and accessing social media sites, which are crucial for communication and information dissemination, especially among the youth and political activists.Information Technology minister Shiza Fatima Khawaja has confirmed that it was upgrading its ""web management system"" to cope with cybersecurity threats but did not link the development to slower internet speeds.TOI has reported that the Pakistan government tested its firewall on two occasions, once in July and a second time in mid-August. Pakistan has allocated more than $70 million for a Digital Infrastructure Development Initiative in the latest budget.The timing of these frequent slowdowns also coincides with the launch of operation Azm-e-Istehkam, raising questions about whether the internet disruptions are also linked to efforts to control information amid rising political tensions and protests against the military's actions.Technology experts have suggested that the newly implemented internet firewall could provide the government with enhanced capabilities to censor online content, drawing comparisons to China's stringent internet regulations.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.","Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.

Attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh

With inputs from agencies

On Wednesday, a young Hindu man named Utsav Mondal was attacked by an angry mob inside a police station after allegedly making a comment about the Prophet.While several social media users claimed that Mondal had been beaten to death, a report in theconfirmed that he was alive and undergoing treatment. Another report bystated that the young man was being treated under the supervision of the Bangladesh Army and was no longer in critical condition.A press release issued by the Directorate of Inter-Services Public Relations on Thursday stated that Utsav, 22, had posted derogatory comments about a religious figure. On Wednesday, 4th September, he was apprehended by locals and taken to the office of the Deputy Police Commissioner of Khulna (South) to face legal action. As news spread, a crowd of 3,000 to 3,500 people gathered, demanding public punishment. The situation quickly escalated, prompting the deployment of armed forces to manage the unrest.Despite the presence of military personnel, some members of the crowd forced their way into the Deputy Commissioner’s office and attacked Utsav. Thanks to the intervention of the armed forces, he was rescued alive and is now receiving medical treatment under military supervision.The press release also stated that a case has been filed against Utsav for violating religious sentiments, and once he recovers, he will be handed over to the authorities for legal proceedings. It emphasised that the Bangladesh Army is committed to preventing extrajudicial killings and upholding the rule of law. The public was urged not to be misled by rumours circulating on social media regarding Utsav’s death.The incident took place late on Wednesday night, around 11:45 pm, when false announcements were made via mosque loudspeakers claiming Utsav Mondal had died.According to local reports, Utsav had posted offensive comments about a religious figure on social media. By around 8 pm, several students had tracked him down and taken him to the office of Deputy Police Commissioner (South), Mohammad Tazul Islam, in Sonadanga. As word of his detention spread, a large crowd gathered outside, demanding that Utsav be handed over to them.The situation intensified as the angry mob, calling for immediate justice, surrounded the building. The army and navy were deployed to contain the growing unrest. However, despite their presence, the mob managed to break into the office and brutally attack Utsav.Deputy Police Commissioner Tazul later explained that authorities had assured the crowd that legal actions would be taken, including the filing of a case and due legal process. However, the mob ignored these assurances, assaulting the student and leaving him critically injured.In an attempt to disperse the crowd and restore order, police used mosque loudspeakers to falsely announce Utsav’s death.Earlier, Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh's interim government, firmly dismissed claims that Bangladesh would devolve into another Afghanistan without Sheikh Hasina 's leadership. He urged India to abandon this narrative, calling for a focus on improving bilateral ties instead.Yunus argued that the attacks on minority Hindus in Bangladesh were ""more political than communal”. He told PTI in an interview, ""These attacks are political in nature and not communal. And India is propagating these incidents in a big way. We have not said that we can't do anything; we have said that we are doing everything.""The incidents involved vandalism of Hindu-owned businesses and temples, which took place during student-led violence after Hasina fled the country on August 5. Yunus, appointed as Chief Adviser after Hasina's ouster, reiterated that the issue of minority attacks was ""exaggerated"" and linked to political unrest, not communal strife.He urged India to shift its perspective on Bangladesh's leadership, stating, ""The way forward is for India to come out of the narrative. The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, BNP is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan.
