Iran: Raisi is dead but oppression lives on,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-raisi-is-dead-but-oppression-lives-on/articleshow/110348304.cms,"Mandatory grief in Iran

A career built on blood

EU condolences 'big disappointment'

Iran 's Ebrahim Raisi was a year away from the end of his first presidential term when he died on May 20. Raisi, his Foreign Minister Hussein Amirabdollahian, and six other people — including two pilots — lost their lives when the helicopter transporting them went down near the Azerbaijani border.Raisi ""died as a martyr serving his country,"" said Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei State media outlets showed images and videos aimed to underline Raisi's popularity during his commemoration. According to the head of Iran's state broadcaster, millions of people had rushed to Tehran to attend the ceremony honoring the late president.""In a country where there are no real polls and free elections, they are forced to seek legitimacy in crowds around coffins,"" exiled Iranian journalist Mohammad Javed Akbarin commented in an online post. The right to free assembly, according to Akbarin, is not guaranteed to all Iran's citizens.Indeed, after Raisi's death was confirmed, Iran's judiciary warned that ""any acts of protest which jeopardize national security and hurt the emotions of grievers will be punished.""The case of reporter Manizheh Moazen shows this is no idle threat. After Raisi's death, she reposted a tweet emphasizing the president's role in the mass executions of political prisoners in the 1980s.""Due to my reaction to the death of Ebrahim Riasi, the judiciary has opened a case against me,"" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter.""Raisi never regretted his actions,"" Iranian writer and activist Shadi Amin told DW. The activist, currently based in Germany, focuses on helping people from Iran's LGBTQ+ community and other minority groups.""For over 40 years, Raisi has always been playing an important role in implementing the policies of the Islamic Republic, predominantly in suppressing the civilian population,"" she added.Raisi was 63 years old when he died. He started building his career early, joining the judiciary as a young cleric immediately after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and quickly making his way into the so-called death commission responsible for killing thousands of political prisoners. He then continued his career as a judge, becoming chief justice in 2019, and eventually president in 2021.In an interview following the 2021 election, Raisi defended his record in Iran's judiciary.""If a judge, a prosecutor or a lawyer defend the people's security, they should be praised for it,"" he told reporters, commenting on the mass killings in the 1980s.As president, Raisi played a key role in suppressing the protests against the Iranian regime that kept flaring up across the country, most recently after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini in September 2022.""He called for the implementation of misogynic law including the mandatory headscarves for women,"" according to Shadi Amin.At the same time, Shadi Amin points out that Iran's religious leaders have the last word on practically any topic in the country.""In recent years, there have been enough people who, like Raisi, have been brought in this system and are ready to act against the civilian population in harsh and brutal ways,"" said Amin. ""The only thing I regret are the condolences coming from the European Union and international organizations for a mass murder such as him. This is a big disappointment for Iranian women and its population.""","Iran's Ebrahim Raisi was a year away from the end of his first presidential term when he died.

Abortion pills may become controlled substances in Louisiana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/us-anthraxed/abortion-pills-may-become-controlled-substances-in-louisiana/articleshow/110347216.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Louisiana House , with a majority of 64 to 29, has passed a bill that would classify the drugs used in medication abortions as controlled substances , making it illegal to possess them without a prescription, reports CBS News.Louisiana will be the first state to categorize misoprostol and mifepristone , used in early-stage pregnancy termination, as controlled substances, if the legislation is signed into law, as reported by CBS News.Controlled substances are typically drugs considered addictive, such as opioids or depressants. This allows states to monitor the drugs and create a database of recipients, as well as criminalize possession without a prescription. However, the legislation exempts pregnant women from prosecution.Meanwhile, these two drugs are used for more than half of the abortions in the US. Mifepristone, approved by the FDA in 2000, has been under scrutiny in recent years, with the Supreme Court considering a case this term regarding the rules surrounding its use.""The State of Louisiana would effectively be creating a database of prescriptions for every woman who is prescribed mifepristone and misoprostol, regardless of the reason, truly monitoring women and their pregnancies,"" Schilling said. ""That should be unimaginable in America,"" said Ellie Schilling, Louisiana attorney specializing in reproductive health law.Although abortion is already banned in Louisiana in most circumstances, with exceptions for cases where the mother's life is at risk or the pregnancy is ""medically futile,"" the legislation could serve as a model for other states to target the medication commonly used in early-stage pregnancies.Mitch Landrieu, former mayor of New Orleans, while expressing concern, said, ""Women in Louisiana are one step closer towards living in a world where they can be monitored and tracked and even sent to prison for just holding FDA-approved medications.

NEW DELHI: The International Criminal Court (ICC) is pursuing arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant, and two other top Hamas leaders, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (also known as Mohammed Deif) and Ismail Haniyeh, according to a statement released by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan on Monday.The charges are related to the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, which Khan alleges constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity .The charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh, and al-Masri include ""extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention"", while the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include ""causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,"" said Khan in his statement.The ICC's decision to target Netanyahu marks the first time the court has sought an arrest warrant for the top leader of a close US ally, placing him in the same category as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is also facing an ICC arrest warrant over the war in Ukraine.A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan's application for the arrest warrants.Israel's top leaders slammed the development as a ""historical disgrace"".A furious Netanyahu lashed out at the ICC and the prosecutor, stating that the ""absurd"" move was ""exactly what new anti-Semitism looks like"".Vowing to bring down Hamas and achieve total victory, Netanyahu said Israel was fighting a ""just war"".Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz also hit out at the ICC chief prosecutor, stating: ""The Attorney General in the same breath mentions the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel alongside the abominable Nazi monsters of Hamas -- a historical disgrace that will be remembered forever.""Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz slammed the move which he said draws ""parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation (Hamas)"".

The ICC is required to issue arrest warrants against Israeli officials who are pursuing crimes of genocide in the Gaza Strip.""When reports of the potential ICC action surfaced last month, Netanyahu called it ""an outrage of historic proportions"" and asserted that Israel has an independent legal system that thoroughly investigates all violations of the law. In response to Netanyahu's comments, Khan stated, ""Nobody is above the law,"" and advised Israel to raise a challenge before the court's judges if they disagree with the ICC's jurisdiction.Although Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, the court claims jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court's founding principles in 2015.The US also slammed the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that such a ""shameful"" decision puts ""truce talks at risk"".""We reject the prosecutor's equivalence of Israel with Hamas ...

NEW DELHI: Mohammad Mokhber who was Iran's first vice president, has been appointed as the interim president following Mohammad Raisi's death in a chopper crash on May 19. Born on September 1, 1955, in Dezful, Khuzestan Province, he has a background in business administration and management. Known for his close ties to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , Mokhber assumed the role of first vice president in 2021 following Ebrahim Raisi 's election as president.In his capacity as interim president, Mokhber is part of a three-person council, along with the Speaker of Parliament and the head of the judiciary, responsible for organizing a new presidential election within 50 days if the president dies.Mokhber held several significant positions in Iran's economic and industrial sectors, notably serving as the head of Setad, an investment fund linked to the Supreme Leader. Setad, officially the Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam, was established by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to manage and sell properties abandoned after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, with proceeds primarily directed to charity.Mokhber was also involved in international dealings and was part of a delegation that visited Moscow in October, agreeing to supply surface-to-surface missiles and drones to Russia's military. This delegation included senior officials from Iran's Revolutionary Guards and an official from the Supreme National Security Council.His activities have led to international scrutiny.

I'm trying my best.""The new restrictions came after Adams' administration in March succeeded in altering the city's unique "" right to shelter "" rule requiring it to provide temporary housing for every homeless person who asks for it.Before the new rule came into effect, adult migrants without children were still limited to 30 days in a shelter, but they were able to immediately reapply for a new bed with no questions asked.The city also restricts migrant families with young children to 60-day stays, but they aren't impacted by the new rule and can still reapply without providing any justification.Still, an audit found that the rollout was ""haphazard,"" over the past six monthsImmigrant rights and homeless advocates say they're closely monitoring the eviction process, which impacts some 15,000 migrant adults. The city shelter system currently houses about 65,000 migrants, but many of those are families with kids.""Our concern is people will be denied for reasons that could be appealed or because of some error or because they didn't have all the documentation required,"" said David Giffen, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless. ""We're watching very carefully to see if that happens because nobody in need of shelter in New York City should ever be relegated to sleeping on the streets.""Adams, a Democrat, on Tuesday pushed back at critics who have called the city's increasingly restrictive migrant shelter rules inhumane and haphazardly rolled out, saying the city simply can't keep housing migrants indefinitely. New York City has provided temporary housing to nearly 200,000 migrants since the spring of 2022, with more than a thousand new arrivals coming to the city each week, he noted.""People said it's inhumane to put people out during the wintertime, so now they say it's inhumane to do it in the summertime,"" Adams said. ""There's no good time. There's no good time.""The move comes as Denver, another city that's seen an influx of migrants, embarks on an ambitious migrant support program that includes six-month apartment stays and intensive job preparation for those who can't yet legally work. Meanwhile Chicago has imposed 60-day shelter limits on adult migrants with no option for renewal, and Massachusetts has capped stays for families to nine months, starting in June.Adams had asked a court in October to suspend the ""right to shelter"" requirement entirely, but the move was opposed by immigrant rights and homeless advocacy groups. In March, they settled, with an agreement that set the new rules for migrants.The agreement still allows for city officials to grant extensions on shelter stays on a case-by-case basis.City officials say migrants need to show they're making ""significant efforts to resettle,"" such as applying for work authorization or asylum, or searching for a job or an apartment.Migrants can also get an extension if they can prove they have plans to move out of the city within 30 days, have an upcoming immigration-related hearing or have a serious medical procedure or are recovering from one.Migrants between the ages of 18 and 20 years old can also get extensions if they're enrolled full-time in high school.""While these changes will require some adaptation, we are confident that they will help migrants progress to the next stage of their journeys, reduce the significant strain on our shelter system and enable us to continue providing essential services to all New Yorkers,"" Camille Joseph Varlack, Adams' chief of staff, said Wednesday in an emailed statement.","Migrants without young children must now move out of the hotels, tent complexes and other shelter facilities run by the city. They must provide proof of ""extenuating circumstances"" and are granted an exemption. As of late Wednesday, 192 migrants had applied for an extension after hitting their limit, and 118 had been approved.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110347135,imgsize-1383977,width-400,resizemode-4/110347135.jpg"

The two leaders will meet again in the Oval Office on Thursday, followed by a joint news conference and a state dinner.Senior administration officials said Biden and Ruto would discuss a range of issues from trade to debt relief and the way forward for Haiti, Ukraine, Sudan and other areas during their meeting.On Wednesday, Biden said he and Ruto would launch a new era of technology cooperation between the two countries that would include work on cyber security, artificial intelligence and semiconductors. He did not mention the security designation.The US will also announce $250 million in new investments through the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), expanding the US financing agency's portfolio in Kenya to over $1 billion, DFC said.Both countries share a commitment to ensuring technology is developed and deployed in a manner that advances transparency, accountability, and human rights, a US official said.Kenya, like the United States, has become ""an engine for innovation"", the official said, citing its $1 billion ""Silicon Savannah"" technology hub that is home to more than 200 startups spanning a range of sectors, including clean energy, microelectronics, financial technology, and e-commerce.Businesses that took part included Alphabet; Baylis Emerging Markets, a private equity firm specializing in African markets; BasiGo, a Kenyan electric bus company; Teneo, a global CEO consulting and advisory firm, and Gearbox Software, which is an American video game development company.Washington also plans a new semiconductor partnership with Kenya, and is working with Congress to make it the first country in Africa to benefit from funding through the US CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, an administration official said.Biden's designation of Kenya as a major non-NATO ally comes as it is preparing to send forces to Haiti as part of a U.N.-led force deploying to address the security crisis in the Caribbean.The designation is granted by the United States to close, non-NATO allies that have strategic working relationships with the US military.The White House had no immediate comment.Biden in March designated Qatar as a major non-NATO ally of the US, fulfilling the promise he had made to Qatar earlier in the year.Gyude Moore, head of the Africa Initiative at the Center for Global Development, said Kenya had proven to be a dependable and reliable partner for the US at a time when South Africa was pursuing its own more independent foreign policy.Cameron Hudson, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the move would formalize a shift that has seen Kenya ""move more squarely into a US orbit"" in recent years, including greater cooperation on Somalia.""It's very significant.

Lawsuits claim 66 people were abused as children in Pennsylvania's juvenile facilities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lawsuits-claim-66-people-were-abused-as-children-in-pennsylvanias-juvenile-facilities/articleshow/110341983.cms,"HARRISBURG: Dozens of children who were sent to juvenile detention centers and similar facilities in Pennsylvania suffered physical and sexual abuse including violent rapes, according to four related lawsuits filed Wednesday.The lawsuits describe how 66 people, now adults, say they were victimized by guards, nurses, supervisors and others. Some attacks were reported to other staffers and were ignored or met with disbelief, the lawsuits allege.Their claims point to a broken juvenile justice system in Pennsylvania, said Jerome Block, a New York lawyer whose firm filed the new cases and is helping pursue similar lawsuits in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and Michigan.“The purpose of the juvenile justice system is to rehabilitate and educate and reform, to equip them to lead healthy, productive lives,” Block said in a phone interview before filing the suits. “Instead these men and women were sexually traumatized as children. They came to these facilities needing help. Instead, they had trauma inflicted upon them.”The lawsuits involve the Loysville Youth Development Center, the South Mountain Secure Treatment Unit and the North Central Secure Treatment Unit in Danville, all under the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services; Merakey USA’s Northwestern Academy outside Shamokin, which closed in 2016; and facilities run by Tucson, Arizona-based VisionQuest National Ltd. and Villanova-based Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health.Copies of the lawsuit were emailed Wednesday morning, seeking comment, to spokespeople for the Department of Human Services, Devereux and Merakey. Several messages were left in recent days for VisionQuest.All of those who are suing were born after Nov. 26, 1989, and meet the state's legal standards for filing claims of sexual abuse when they were children.Block said the legal team also represents more than 100 people who were similarly abused, but too long ago under time limits to file civil claims. Proposals to open a two-year window for such outdated claims have been blocked by Senate Republicans in the General Assembly.Eighteen of the latest plaintiffs describe rapes and other sexual abuse at Devereux facilities. One man says that when he was 14, while sedated during “major anger outbreaks,” a staff member sexually abused him while he was restrained “so he could not fight back.”Other claims, by 15 people who were confined at the state-run facilities, say children there “have long been subjected to a culture of exploitation, violence and rampant sexual abuse"" committed by guards, counselors and other staff.“The sexual abuse at commonwealth juvenile detention facilities has ranged from inappropriate strip searches to rape using violent physical force,” according to their lawsuit, which alleges negligence and failed oversight.One of the plaintiffs says she became pregnant as a teenager as the result of a violent rape by a counselor at North Central about 20 years ago, and that another staffer didn’t believe her when she reported the rape. The lawsuit doesn't describe what happened regarding her pregnancy.Merakey USA, which operated Northwestern Academy before it shut down in 2016, is accused of a “culture of sexual abuse and brutality,” including “inappropriate and criminal sexual relationships with children,” who were granted or denied privileges to pressure them into sex.That lawsuit says one 14-year-old girl who had not been sexually active was forced into sex acts by two Northwestern Academy staffers, and when she complained, she was accused of lying and her home leave passes were removed.A male therapist then had her write about her sexual encounters during twice-a-week sessions for five months, telling her it was treatment for sex addiction and for a book he was writing. When she asked for the book upon leaving the facility, its director told her the book did not exist and her experience ""would not be considered mental health treatment,” the lawsuit says.A task force to address problems in Pennsylvania's approach to juvenile justice — established by legislative leaders, the court system and then-Gov. Tom Wolf — concluded in 2021 that too many first-time and lower level juvenile offenders were being locked up, and Black offenders were disproportionately prosecuted as adults.A Democratic-sponsored bill to adopt some of the task force’s recommended changes is pending in the House after passing the Judiciary Committee in September on a party-line vote, with all Republicans opposed. There has also been a decades-long effort to establish an independent Office of Child Advocate. Supporters say talks about such legislation are currently ongoing.Malik Pickett, a senior attorney at Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia, said the lawsuits ""ring far too familiar for what we know from our nearly 50 years of advocacy.”The state's youth detention facilities are dangerous places for children, his emailed statement said.""We have experienced one crisis for youth in detention after another,"" Pickett said, while failing to pass meaningful changes.","66 people, now adults, say they were victimized by guards, nurses, supervisors and others.

The survey is a highly regarded source of estimates of tobacco, alcohol and drug use in the United States.In 2022, an estimated 17.7 million people used marijuana daily or near-daily compared to 14.7 million daily or near-daily drinkers, according to the study. From 1992 to 2022, the per capita rate of reporting daily or near-daily marijuana use increased 15-fold.The trend reflects changes in public policy. Most states now allow medical or recreational marijuana, though it remains illegal at the federal level. In November, Florida voters will decide on a constitutional amendment allowing recreational cannabis, and the federal government is moving to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.Research shows that high-frequency users are more likely to become addicted to marijuana, said Dr. David A. Gorelick, a psychiatry professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study.The number daily users suggests that more people are at risk for developing problematic cannabis use or addiction, Gorelick said.""High frequency use also increases the risk of developing cannabis-associated psychosis,"" a severe condition where a person loses touch with reality, he said.","In 2022, an estimated 17.7 million people used marijuana daily or near-daily.

The child was brought before the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, where his legal representative asserted that the judge dismissed the case after receiving an affidavit.Officials from WAPDA and PESCO expressed uncertainty regarding the child's involvement in the alleged offense.This incident follows a significant revelation last month, where power theft within Power Distribution Companies (DISCOs) reportedly caused a loss of PKR 438 billion to the national treasury. Sources indicated that these losses were a considerable portion of the total annual billing of PKR 723 billion.The power division identified the poorest performing DISCOs, highlighting companies in Hyderabad, Sukkur, Peshawar, Quetta, and Tribal areas for their records. On April 7, the Punjab energy department raised concerns about power distribution companies overcharging government institutions, which it labeled a burden on the provincial exchequer.The department noted that Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO), Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) were overcharging government departments.The department reported that there are over 102,000 electric connections across provincial departments, with a significant discrepancy between actual consumption and billed amounts. For the financial year 2022-23, the provincial departments consumed electricity worth over PKR 1.91 billion but were billed PKR 76 billion.In response to this issue, the federal government approved the deployment of Federal Investigation Officers (FIA) to electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) to curb power theft and enhance revenue recovery. This measure was in line with demands from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as reported by ARY News.","A 3-year-old toddler was booked for electricity theft in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

Weather forecasters warn Pakistanis to stay indoors ahead of new heat wave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/weather-forecasters-warn-pakistanis-to-stay-indoors-ahead-of-new-heat-wave/articleshow/110317818.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Authorities in Pakistan on Tuesday urged people to stay indoors as the country is hit by an extreme heat wave that threatens to bring dangerously high temperatures and yet another round of glacial-driven floods .Pakistan's most populous province, Punjab, is shutting all schools for a week because of the heat, affecting an estimated 18 million students.""The sweltering heat will continue this month,"" said Zaheer Ahmed Babar, a senior official at the Pakistan Meteorological Department. He added that temperatures could reach up to 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit) above the monthly average. This week could rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country, Babar said.It's the latest climate-related disaster to hit the country in recent years. Melting glaciers and growing monsoons have caused devastating floods, at one point submerging a third of the country.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual monthly rainfall, according to the national weather center. Last month's heavy rains killed scores of people while destroyed property and farmland, experts say the country witnessed heavier rains because of climate change .Pakistan is still trying to recover from $30 billion in losses caused by devastating climate-induced floods that killed 1,739 people in 2022.According to health officials, hospitals were instructed to set up emergency heatwave response centers so that those affected by the scorching temperatures could be quickly treated.Doctors say heatstroke is a serious illness that occurs when one's body temperature rises quickly because of sweltering heat, potentially causing some to fall unconscious. A severe heatstroke can cause disability or death.Some areas in Pakistan are also currently facing hours-long power outages.""We were without electricity for hours on Monday,"" said Ibrar Abbasi, who lives on the outskirts of Islamabad.Scientists have long warned that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and certain agricultural practices, will lead to more frequent and prolonged bouts of extreme weather, including hotter temperatures.Babar said another intense heat wave will hit the country in June, when the temperature is likely to reach 45 degrees (113 Fahrenheit). He said people should drink a lot of water and avoid unnecessary travel. Farmers and other livestock owners should take measures to protect their animals during extreme heat, he said.However, many people, especially laborers and construction workers in the impoverished nation, ask how they can stay indoors as their families will suffer if they don't work.""I am not feeling well because of the stifling heat, but I have to work,"" said Ghulam Farid, who owns a small general store in Sheikhupra, a city in Punjab province.Construction workers were seen sitting near a road on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, hoping to get a job. Among them was Mohammad Khursheed, 52, who said he has noticed a change in the patterns of seasons.""I feel the heat even in the morning, but people say the temperatures will go up even further,"" he said.","Pakistan's most populous province, Punjab, is shutting all schools for a week.

NEW YORK: In perhaps the first acknowledgement of its kind on a global forum that the ""new India is a dangerous entity"", Pakistan 's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.Pakistan's permanent representative at the world body also quoted from a report in a leading US daily to say the ""new India comes into your home and kills you"".Addressing the General Assembly on May 2, Akram said, ""Pakistan's foreign minister informed the Security Council, as well as the secretary general and the president of the General Assembly of India's campaign of targeted assassinations in Pakistan. This extra-territorial state terrorism is not limited to Pakistan. It has been extended to targeted killings of political opponents in Canada and attempted in the United States and probably in other countries.""""The Washington Post reported that Prime Minister Modi last week told his cheering supporters, and I quote, ""Today, even India's enemies know this is Modi. This is the new India. This new India comes into your home and kills you"". This new India is a dangerous entity, it is a net provider of insecurity, not security,"" Pakistan's permanent representative to the UN alleged.Earlier, top British daily, The Guardian, claimed in a report that the Indian government carried out assassinations of wanted individuals deep inside Pakistan as part of a ""wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil"".It said, citing intelligence sources, that targeted assassinations increased significantly in 2023, claiming India's involvement in the suspected deaths of about 15 people, ""most of whom were shot at close range by unknown gunmen"".Earlier, some countries in the West raised concerns over what they claimed were targeted killings on their soil at the behest of the Indian government.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused 'agents' allegedly in the employ of the Indian government of killing Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan leader and a designated terrorist by the country's elite National Investigation Agency (NIA), in 2020.However, India has dismissed the claim as 'absurd' and 'motivated'.Nijjar was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A purported video clip of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March, this year, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men in what was alleged to be a 'contract killing'.In a recent development in the Nijjar case, the Canadian Police arrested four Indian nationals for their alleged involvement in the killing of the separatist Khalistleader outside a gurudwara in British Columbia last June.Reacting to the arrests, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar denied receiving any evidence implicating Indian nationals' involvement in the killing in Canada of the India-designated terrorist.Responding to media queries, Jaishankar said, ""I also read that another arrest has been made. If that person is an Indian national, then usually by consular practice, you inform the government or the embassy of the country of origin. But beyond that, we have long maintained that if anything, any event in Canada, any violence in Canada, has any evidence or information which is relevant to be investigated in India, we are open to investigating it.""He emphasised that while any Indian national's arrest would usually prompt notification to the government or embassy, no specific evidence justifying investigation by Indian agencies has been received to date.""But to date, we have never received anything, which is specific and worthy of being pursued by our investigative agencies. And I'm not aware anything has changed in the last few days in that regard,"" the External Affairs Minister said at a media interaction at a seminar on Indian Capital Markets 'Roadmap for Viksit Bharat' at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in Mumbai earlier.At a weekly media briefing, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), too, informed that Canada had not formally conveyed the arrests and India had not yet received any consular access request.On being asked about the fourth Indian arrested by Canada in connection with the Nijjar killing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have seen reports of the fourth person being arrested. We have not been formally conveyed of it. So far, we have not received any consular access request as well.""Earlier, campaigning for the ongoing general elections in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a telling remark vis-a-vis its western neighbour, saying India does not send dossiers on terrorism anymore but eliminates terrorists in their own backyard.""Today, India doesn't send dossiers.(Today India strikes back at terrorists on their own turf),"" PM Modi said at a poll rally in Maharashtra's Latur.Expanding on the difference in how his government tackles terrorism as compared to previous Congress regimes at the Centre, Prime Minister Modi said the earlier approach of handing dossiers to Pakistan has been replaced by taking out the wanted terror conspirators on their own turf.At a separate rally, PM Modi doubled down on remarks made by the INDIA bloc leader Farooq Abdullah that Pakistan was not wearing bangles and was a nuclear-amed nation, saying, """" (I was told Pakistanis don't even have bangles, we will make them wear some)"".Addressing a public meeting in Muzaffarpur, PM Modi said, ""These (Congress and INDIA alliance) people are so afraid that they see Pakistan's atom bombs even in their dreams. Can such a government and leader run the country? They (INDI alliance leaders) say, ''. (i am told Pakistanis don't even have bangles...we will make them wear some. They are desperately crying out for wheat, they don't have electricity and now they don't even have bangles to wear.) Some leaders in the Opposition are even giving clean chits to the 26/11 accused.""""Some people are doubting the surgical strikes and air strikes (after the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks). These leaders want to weaken the morale of our forces and cast aspersions on our nuclear power. It seems like 'INDI alliance ne India ke khilaf supari le li hai' (INDI partners have taken out a contract against the country),"" PM Modi added.In the US, federal prosecutors earlier alleged the involvement of two Indian nationals, including a government employee, in a plot to murder Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Canadian also holding American citizenship, on its soil.According to the indictment of the US Justice Department, an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, who is currently in custody, was charged with the murder-for-hire of Pannun. The US Justice Department claimed that an Indian government employee, who was not identified in the indictment filed, recruited Gupta to hire a hitman to allegedly assassinate Pannun, which was foiled by US authorities.India set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.","Pakistan's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.

IMF asks Pakistan ensure transparency in working of Special Investment Facilitation Council,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-asks-pakistan-ensure-transparency-in-working-of-special-investment-facilitation-council/articleshow/110302522.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The IMF has asked Pakistan to share a draft of the under-preparation investment policy and ensure transparency in the working of the much-hyped Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) as the cash-strapped country is seeking a fresh bailout package from the global lender, a media report said on Tuesday. The SIFC was established in June last year under an "" economic revival plan "" devised by civilian and military leaders to capitalise on ""untapped potential in key sectors"" and attract foreign direct investment (FDI).The hybrid government body promises to create an enabling business environment in the country and offer a one-window solution to investors.A visiting team of the Washington-based lender , which is on a sort of assessment mission, has not yet converted ongoing engagement into formal talks with the Pakistani authorities, The News International reported.Both sides expressed divergent views on the macroeconomic framework for the next fiscal budget for 2024-25, the newspaper said.The Pakistani authorities informed the International Monetary Fund's assessment team that the new investment policy was under preparation and would be announced after conducting due deliberations, the report said.The IMF asked for transparency in the working of the SIFC. The assessment team also inquired about the potential investment in different projects and especially asked for privatisation of the national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other state-owned enterprises (SOEs).Envisaging the CPI-based inflation on the higher average rate of 12.7 per cent for the next budget 2024-25, the Washington-based lender also inquired about the tax exemptions offered by the government for the upcoming Special Economic Zones (SEZs) under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The IMF wants maximisation of non-tax revenues as the proposal under consideration is to increase the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) for increasing collection up to Pakistani Rs 1.08 trillion in the next fiscal year or slap a carbon levy to compensate the zero rate of GST on petroleum products, The News International reported.The international lender has recommended imposing 18 per cent GST on petrol and diesel along with PDL.The IMF has refused to accept the macroeconomic framework of the Finance Ministry and so far pitched the macroeconomic framework for the next budget 2024-25 including a real GDP growth rate of 3.5 per cent while the CPI-based inflation was projected on the higher side at 12.7 per cent.The Ministry of Finance has prepared a macroeconomic framework whereby the GDP growth was envisaged at 3.7 to 4 per cent while inflation was kept on average in the range of 11 to 12 per cent, the report said.For the outgoing fiscal year 2023-24, the provision GDP growth figure may hover around 2 to 2.5 per cent of GDP against the official target of 3.5 per cent, it said.Pakistan has made a formal request for a fresh bailout package of USD 6 to USD 8 billion under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the possibility of being augmented through climate finance. If successful, it would be the 24th IMF bailout programme for the country.Last month, Pakistan completed a short-term USD 3 billion programme with the IMF, which bailed the country out of any default.It was unclear whether the IMF mission would end with a formal staff-level agreement for the next bailout package, according to The Express Tribune newspaper.The duration, instrument, and size of the next IMF programme were open to discussion, the report said, quoting sources.Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high of 38 per cent last May.The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall, and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around two per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","The IMF has asked Pakistan to share a draft of the under-preparation investment policy and ensure transparency in the working of the Special Investment Facilitation Council.

Chief Justice of the IHC, Justice Aamer Farooq, presided over the hearing.PTI district president Aamir Mughal approached the IHC through his counsel and PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat. The PTI named the secretary of interior, chief commissioner Islamabad, and inspector general of police (IGP) Islamabad as respondents.PTI also requested the court to order the authorities to refrain from using force against anyone attending the public meeting.On May 16, Tehreek-e-Tahafuz-e-Ayeen-e-Pakistan also moved to the courts to seek permission to hold a rally in Faisalabad on May 17 as a part of its movement to 'save' Pakistan's constitution, Pakistan based Dawn reported.As a part of its movement, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan decided to hold power shows in Faisalabad and Karachi.Addressing a lawyer's convention in Faisalabad, Sunni Ittehad Council head Hamid Raza said they had decided to go ahead with the rally even if the government did not give permission.

Coated head to toe in eye-catching gold paint, they stood perfectly still, leaning on glimmering canes and tipping their top hats open. Perhaps in a different place, the emergence of mimes on the street looking to earn a few dollars might go unnoticed.But this is Pakistan , where things under the security state often are not as simple as they seem. So as the number of golden performers grew, so, too, did the intrigue around them. Could they be informants for the nation's intelligence agency? Lookouts for powerful politicians? Maybe spies for CIA ?Today, the ""golden men"" of Islamabad have been added to the ranks of the conspiracy theories sprouted, knocked down and rehashed every day across the city. In Pakistan, where the hand of the security services is seen everywhere, conspiracy theories have been embraced in the mainstream for decades. Suspicion has become so universal that wild tales take root after almost every news event. In the wake of catastrophic floods in 2010, people asserted that they had been caused by CIA weather-controlling technology. Media pundits claimed that a US ""thinktank"" was behind a failed car bombing by a Pakistani-American in Times Square that year and that Osama bin Laden was actually Jewish.In such a climate, everyone - even street performers - can be seen as potential tools of the state. For most of Pakistan's 76-year history, the surveillance was a routine facet of daily life. But in recent years, frustration with the military's role in politics has exploded. ""With the political atmosphere so polarised, we're becoming more suspicious of being watched or who is listening,"" said Ali Abas, 25, a resident of Islamabad.On the other side of the city, Mustaq Ahmed, 53, stood on a median of a busy intersection. His jacket, pants, walking cane and top hat were all spray-painted gold. Gold makeup was caked onto his face and hand. Ahmed once sold umbrellas, but became ""Golden Thakur"" three years ago after he overheard another golden man saying he made up to Pak Rs 8,000 - or nearly $30 - each day. It was more than five times what Ahmed was taking home. That cash has dwindled recently as the novelty of the golden men has waned, he said. When asked if he would ever supplement his income with a little side work for the intelligence agencies, he immediately replied: ""no, no, no."" Was there any chance that other golden men were earning a few extra dollars that way? ""Maybe,"" he said with a shrug.

'New bailout package': IMF asks Pakistan to 'impose' tax on monthly pensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/new-bailout-package-imf-asks-pakistan-to-impose-tax-on-monthly-pensions/articleshow/110263382.cms,"NEW DELHI: The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) mission has asked Pakistani authorities to impose a tax on monthly pensions exceeding Rs 1,00,000, according to sources cited by ARY News.The sources further revealed that pension reforms will be a necessary component of the ""new bailout programme,"" with policy discussions set to begin tomorrow as negotiations between Pakistan and the IMF enter their final stage.The IMF has ""insisted"" on taxing monthly pensions above Rs 100,000, which is expected to garner the necessary legislative support to tax wealthy pensioners. As the IMF and Pakistan continue their negotiations, it is clear that the new bailout programme will require strict economic measures. However, Pakistan remains committed to the IMF loan program and has no intentions of replacing it.To be eligible for the ""new bailout programme,"" sources indicate that Pakistan will need to practice fiscal discipline by reducing spending and deficits in accordance with IMF requirements. Last week, the IMF mission ""asked"" Pakistani authorities to raise the general sales tax (GST) to 18 percent during four rounds of talks for a new loan.The IMF mission noted that Pakistan's sales tax collection system is problematic, as the centre collects sales tax on commodities while the provinces collect it on services. They suggested that the federal government should be solely responsible for collecting sales tax. Additionally, the IMF demanded an end to GST exemptions and an increase to 18 percent on both commodities and services.During the fourth round of talks, the IMF mission also called for reforms in the insurance sector and the establishment of a separate regulatory body. They further demanded the privatization of three government-owned insurance companies.The IMF delegation is currently in Pakistan, as the country seeks to initiate another program with the global lender to address its ongoing financial crisis.","International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) mission has asked Pakistani authorities to impose a tax on monthly pensions exceeding Rs 1,00,000.

Fresh corruption allegations levelled against ex-Pak PM Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fresh-corruption-allegations-levelled-against-ex-pak-pm-imran-khan/articleshow/110249925.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's accountability watchdog has levelled fresh corruption allegations against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accusing him of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts linked to the state gift repository when he was in power, media reports said on Sunday. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) launched an inquiry against the 71-year-old Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi over the alleged misuse of the Toshakhana -- the state gift repository, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.The beleaguered former first couple has been convicted in earlier Toshakhana corruption cases as well.In January, Khan and Bushra were sentenced to 14 years in jail each by an accountability court for alleged corruption in state gifts they got from the state repository. The sentence was later suspended by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The previous Toshakhana graft case was filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the charges of hiring the sale of state gifts.The NAB investigation centres on the illegal possession and sale of seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts, including diamond and gold jewellery, the report said.According to the inquiry, items such as Graff and Rolex watches and diamond jewellery were allegedly sold without being legally owned or deposited in the Toshakhana, as required by law.The Toshakhana is a department under the Cabinet Division that stores gifts given to rulers and government officials by heads of other governments and foreign dignitaries.Under the rules governing Toshakhana - a Persian word meaning ""treasure house"" - government officials can keep gifts by paying a price, but first, the gift should be deposited.The gifts were purchased/retained at ""considerably lower rates"" and were ""routinely sold"" without properly declaring them. The expensive Graff watch set was also allegedly sold without ""retention"", according to the report.The NAB's findings suggest collusion between the buyers of the Graff watches and a private appraiser, who allegedly undervalued the watches by Rs 30 million.The undervaluation, confirmed via an email from Toshakhana, meant that only Rs 20.1 million, or 20 per cent of the watches' actual value of Rs 100.9 million, was deposited into the government treasury, the report said.""During the course of the inquiry, it was revealed that the value of luxury gift items was assessed in an unscrupulous and slipshod manner by a private appraiser [...] was not even an industry expert and did not possess the required experience or expertise to make these assessments,"" Geo News said, citing the report.After the report findings, the accountability watchdog was authorised to conduct further probes against Khan and Bushra. Separate call-up notices had also been served to them, which they have challenged in the IHC.The court will hear Bushra's appeal on June 4 and Khan's appeal on June 24, the report said.The former-cricketer-turned-politician has been lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since August last year. Since his removal from power in a no-confidence motion in April 2022, Khan has been convicted in at least four cases, including the cipher (secret diplomatic communication) case.","Pakistan's accountability watchdog accuses Imran Khan of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts.

Pakistan government forecasts USD 72 bn investment needed to meet 50 pc surge in power demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forecasts-usd-72-bn-investment-needed-to-meet-50-pc-surge-in-power-demand/articleshow/110249530.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a comprehensive overview of Pakistan's energy landscape, the government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade. This forecast, outlined in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP 2024-34) submitted to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), aims to bolster the country's power infrastructure to meet escalating demand, Dawn reported.Under the proposed plan, renewable energy sources are slated to account for a significant portion, with an expected surge to 46 per cent of the total energy mix within the next decade.This surge in capacity, estimated to rise from 42,000MW to 57,000MW, underscores the government's commitment to embracing sustainable energy solutions .The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) has provided insights into the anticipated growth in electricity demand, projecting increases ranging from 46 per cent under a low-growth scenario to 74 per cent in a high-growth scenario over the next ten years. To accommodate this surge, an estimated investment of USD 62-64 billion would be required, reflecting the scale of the challenge at hand, as reported by Dawn.The Transmission System Expansion Plan (TSEP 2024-34) outlines an additional USD 8.7 billion investment imperative for enhancing the transmission network. This allocation includes funds for both ongoing projects, requiring USD 3.2 billion for completion, and new projects necessitating USD 5.5 billion in funding.Employing state-of-the-art generation planning software, PLEXOS, the least-cost, long-term generation expansion plan has been meticulously developed. This plan factors in existing and future generation projects, policy frameworks, contractual obligations, natural resource allocations, and prevailing Grid Code provisions. It adheres closely to the National Electricity Policy 2021 and incorporates a series of assumptions to guide strategic decision-making.In crafting the base case scenario, NTDC has meticulously accounted for existing contractual obligations and projected retirements of power projects as stipulated in their respective Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), with the exception of KAPCO. The plan also factors in the retirement of 8,330MW of existing power generation capacity over the planning horizon.The forecasted demand is calibrated to accommodate the intermittency of variable renewable energy resources such as wind and solar PV, critical elements in achieving the government's ambitious renewable energy targets. With an estimated 87,600 hours of energy and peak demand forecasted from FY24 to 34, the plan aims to balance the evolving energy landscape with a diversified and resilient energy mix.By 2034, the envisioned energy mix will reflect a notable shift towards indigenous fuel sources, with local coal and renewables playing a prominent role. Hydropower is expected to contribute 46 per cent of the energy mix, accompanied by 10 per cent from variable renewable energy sources. The plan minimizes reliance on imported fuels, with RFO making no contribution and imported coal and RLNG accounting for a modest share of total energy requirements, Dawn reported.","The government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade.
