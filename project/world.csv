New record: 150-million-year-old Stegosaurus fossil sells for $45m,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/new-record-150-million-year-old-stegosaurus-fossil-sells-for-45m/articleshow/111822198.cms,"NEW DELHI: A 150 million-year-old well preserved nearly complete Stegosaurus fossil , known as "" Apex ,"" was sold at a Sotheby's auction on Wednesday for an astonishing $44.6 million, surpassing the pre-sale estimate of $4 million to $6 million.The anonymous American buyer outbid six other contenders and plans to explore the possibility of loaning the specimen to a US institution.The sale also broke the previous auction record for dinosaur fossils, which was set in 2020 when a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton named Stan sold for $31.8 million.Cassandra Hatton, head of Sotheby's science-related business, emphasised the significance of Apex's sale, stating, ""Apex 'has now taken its place in history, some 150 million years since it roamed the planet.'""However, selling such fossils has drawn criticism from academic palaeontologists who believe these specimens should be housed in museums or research centers that may not have the financial means to compete with high auction prices.Stegosaurus, known for its distinctive plates along its back, was one of the most recognisable dinosaurs. Apex, standing at 11 feet (3.3 meters) tall and measuring 27 feet (8.2 meters) from nose to tail, was a large stegosaurus that exhibited signs of arthritis, indicating its advanced age.The fossil was discovered in 2022 by commercial palaeontologist Jason Cooper on his property near the aptly named Dinosaur, Colorado, which is close to Dinosaur National Monument and the Utah border.",A 150 million-year-old well preserved nearly complete Stegosaurus fossil was sold at a Sotheby's auction on Wednesday for an astonishing $44.6 million.

The 160 year old lender has traditionally appointed its CEO from within.Since 2020, Elhedery has been the co head of the Global banking and markets business, the division that houses HSBC's trading and investment banking advisory businesses.Lebanon born Elhedery, who began his career in banking as a rates trader before joining HSBC in 2005, was named the surprise successor to Ewen Stevenson as CFO in October 2022, just weeks after returning from a sabbatical.He also led HSBC's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkiye region as the CEO of that division between July 2016 and February 2019.""Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory,"" he said in the bank's statement announcing his appointment.Quinn, who led the global lender for five years, will remain CEO until his successor starts in the role.His surprise departure was announced in April, and at that time he had said he wanted a better work life balance and planned to pursue a portfolio career.Quinn oversaw a raft of asset sales, navigated a global pandemic and a push by rebel investors to break up the 160 year bank, and guided the lender to record profit.The move comes at a time when HSBC, Europe's largest lender by assets with a balance sheet of $3 trillion, is betting on its historic Asian ties to ramp up profit.Since the financial crisis of 2008, HSBC has already shrunk its global footprint by around a quarter, exiting low growth markets to plough capital and resources into Asia.The bank's shares have risen 7% this year, against an 18% gain in the STOXX Europe banks index.HSBC said it will announce Elhedery's successor as Group CFO in due course.

In response, the government has ordered schools and universities nationwide to close indefinitely.The clashes on Tuesday prompted the education ministry to mandate the shutdown for ""the security of the students,"" said spokesman M A Khair. The order was extended to universities, where most protestors are enrolled.The protests, defying calls from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the supreme court to return to class, saw demonstrators mobilizing in cities across the country.Three students were killed in Chittagong, with signs of bullet injuries, and 35 others were injured, according to hospital director Mohammad Taslim Uddin. In Dhaka, two students died amid clashes where rival groups hurled bricks and blocked key roads, confirmed police inspector Bacchu Mia. An additional 60 people were injured in the capital.In Rangpur, a student died during clashes where police used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protestors. Rangpur Medical College hospital director Yunus Ali stated, ""The student was brought dead to the hospital by other students.""Tauhidul Haque Siam, a student reporter, recounted the violence in Rangpur, and said, ""Police opened fire from their shotguns on the protesters,"" and confirmed that the deceased student was ""killed in the firing,"" though this account couldn't be independently verified.In response to escalating violence and road blockades, the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) force was deployed in five major cities, including Dhaka and Chittagong.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the Bangladeshi government ""to protect the demonstrators against any form of threat or violence,"" highlighting the fundamental right to peaceful demonstration.Tuesday's violence followed confrontations the previous day between anti-quota demonstrators and members of the ruling Awami League's student wing, resulting in over 400 injuries in Dhaka.

But the ruling party goons are attacking our peaceful protests.""The protests demand an end to a quota system reserving more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the 1971 liberation war. Critics argue the system benefits children of pro-government groups supporting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Amnesty International has called on Bangladesh to ""immediately guarantee the safety of all peaceful protesters."" The US State Department also condemned the ""violence against peaceful protesters,"" drawing a rebuke from Bangladesh's foreign ministry.","Six students killed during protests in Bangladesh against quota system in government jobs.

The space rock passed through the atmosphere over the Big Apple around 11:15am, coinciding with reports from New Yorkers who saw a flash of fire streak across the sky and felt the ground lightly shaking beneath their feet.The ""daylight fireball"" traveled from the Statue of Liberty to Midtown Manhattan around noon. Twenty people across New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut reported seeing the fireball stretch across the sky, with one witness describing the shooting star as illuminated in green, yellow, and white, a New York Post report said.The spectacle lasted about 30 seconds before fragmenting into three pieces, according to an eyewitness report to the American Meteor Society. Nasa’s Meteor Watch estimates that the ""daylight fireball"" was first spotted about 40 miles above New York Harbor’s Upper Bay, where Lady Liberty stands.

"After attack on Donald Trump, right points finger at females in secret service",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-attack-on-donald-trump-right-points-finger-at-females-in-secret-service/articleshow/111817702.cms,"WASHINGTON: In the hours after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump , a sexist theory explaining how the Secret Service could have allowed such a grave security failure emerged in right-wing circles: It was the fault of incompetent women in his security detail.“Look, I’m not sure about who the individuals are on the individual detail, Secret Service, but I can tell you under this Biden administration, the one thing I’ve seen is massive DEI hires,” Rep.Cory Mills, R-Fla., said on Fox News, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion practices.“And I can tell you when you primarily, when you primarily go after D-E-I,” Mills continued, “you end up with D-I-E.”Benny Johnson, a right-wing commentator, was more blunt in a social media post viewed nearly 9 million times: “Absolute humiliation for this gaggle of female Secret Service Agents,” he wrote in a post that showed the chaotic aftermath of the shooting, adding: “DEI Secret Service make Presidents LESS Safe.”From an overwhelmingly male phalanx of agents guarding Trump that day, these critics pointed out a trio — visibly shorter than their peers and with their hair pulled back in a bun, a ponytail and with hairpins, respectively, as they put themselves in harm’s way to protect the former president — for criticism. Video of their movements, including a moment in which one visibly struggled to holster a weapon, has fueled an outcry among conservatives who have pinned the agency’s failings on its women, suggesting they were only hired to diversify the predominantly male organization.The agency is led by Kimberly Cheatle, the second woman to serve as its director.The Secret Service is under scrutiny for how agents secured the site of the campaign rally and ultimately responded to the shooting, which left Trump injured, a rally attendee killed, and two others severely wounded. It is the latest and most significant episode in a long saga of errors for the agency, which has been plagued in recent years by debauchery, reckless behavior and security failures.No evidence has surfaced that the response of any female agent in Trump’s detail — whose members shielded his body with their own after shots were fired — caused or contributed to the security breakdown.But the fixation on the few who surrounded Trump at Saturday’s rally reflects a larger grievance among some conservatives, who have argued that policies that promote diversity in hiring are inherently unfair and destructive — and, particularly when it comes to organizations such as the military and law enforcement — even dangerous.Among the suggestions made by those who blamed female Secret Service agents for Saturday’s attack: that they were too short; that the agency lowered its testing standards for them; and that women should not be able to serve in the agency at all.“I can’t imagine that a DEI hire from @pepsi would be a bad choice as the head of the Secret Service,” Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., wrote in an apparently sarcastic post on social media. Cheatle served in the Secret Service for 27 years before becoming the senior director of global security at PepsiCo.Conservatives have long argued that codified diversity efforts promote left-wing ideas about gender and race and distract from organizations’ core missions. The GOP-led House has repeatedly passed legislation that would eliminate such initiatives at the Pentagon and other government agencies.“A woke military is a weak military,” is a common refrain among right-wing lawmakers.Cheatle has spoken openly about her efforts to recruit more women into the service, in part to help combat recruitment and retention issues.“I’m very conscious, as I sit in this chair now, of making sure that we need to attract diverse candidates and ensure that we are developing and giving opportunities to everybody in our workforce, and particularly women,” Cheatle said in her first interview after being tapped to lead the agency, with CBS News.The news report said the agency’s goal was to have women make up 30% of recruits by 2030. They currently make up just under one-fourth of the Secret Service’s workforce, according to its website.The video of that interview, published on YouTube, became overrun in the days after the shooting with comments suggesting that neither Cheatle nor the women the agency has hired since are qualified for their jobs.Kym Craven, executive director of the National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, said discussions around whether women should serve on a protective detail were a diversion from the important security issues raised by the assassination attempt.“We’ve had critical incidents for centuries with men leading, and there’s never been a question that because of their gender they shouldn’t lead,” Craven said in an interview.“The incident itself will be under review, and the incident will stand for itself,” she continued. “Whether changes needed to be made, mistakes happened — that’s not for me to judge in any way. But the discussion around gender and that because someone is a woman, they should not lead an agency — that conversation just should not be happening at all.”Craven said women who serve in law enforcement agencies are held to the same physical agility and fitness standards men must meet.“There’s not a woman leader that I know of in this profession that’s asking for standards to be lowered or exceptions to be made for women in the field,” she said.Melanie Burkholder worked for six years as a Secret Service special agent, and in 2012 protected political candidates — including Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney — on the campaign trail.Burkholder said in an interview she found the debate over whether women could serve in the agency “ridiculous,” noting that the first female protective agents were sworn in to the Secret Service in 1971.“For us to be having a conversation about whether women add value, or whether women perform or whatever the question is — it’s ridiculous in my opinion to be having it at this point in time,” she said.A spokesperson for the Secret Service did not respond to a request for comment.But when Trump strode onto the floor of the Republican National Convention on Monday night in Milwaukee — his first public appearance since the shooting at his rally — he was flanked by what appeared to be an all-male phalanx of Secret Service agents.","Right-wing critics point out a trio of female Secret Service agents.

Did love for luxe labels & expensive sushi turn ex-CIA analyst into Seoul mole?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-love-for-luxe-labels-expensive-sushi-turn-ex-cia-analyst-into-seoul-mole/articleshow/111817347.cms,"NEW YORK: Sue Mi Terry , a prominent voice on US foreign policy, had a refined palate, a love for top-shelf sushi and a taste for designer labels. She liked coats by Christian Dior, handbags by Bottega Veneta and Louis Vuitton, and Michelin-starred restaurants.And, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, she accepted such luxury goods and other gifts in exchange for serving the South Korean government in Seoul.Terry, a former CIA analyst and a senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, is accused in a 31-page indictment released Tuesday of a yearslong effort to assist South Korean spies. The indictment says she even introduced the spies to congressional staff members, an action that she described as “bringing the wolf in.”The charges, which were brought by the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, were part of a concerted push by the Justice Department to combat foreign influence in US affairs, which has produced dozens of prosecutions in recent years. Such cases have been set off by illegal campaign contributions from overseas, covert influence operations and even the bribing of Sen. Bob Menendez, for which he was convicted Tuesday.In Terry’s case, prosecutors say she began operating as a foreign agent in 2013, five years after leaving the CIA. She was first contacted by an intelligence officer posing as a diplomat for the Korean mission to the United Nations in New York City, the indictment said, and in return for her work over the next decade, Terry received handbags, clothing and at least $37,000 in covert payments to the think tank where she was employed at the time.“Despite engaging in extensive activities for and at the direction of” the South Korean government, Terry did not register as a foreign agent with US officials, as required by law, prosecutors said. She faces two counts, one for failing to register under the federal Foreign Agents Registration Act, and the other for conspiring to violate it.In a statement, Lee Wolosky, Terry’s lawyer, said the allegations were unfounded and distorted “the work of a scholar and news analyst known for her independence and years of service to the United States.”“Dr. Terry has not held a security clearance for over a decade, and her views on matters relating to the Korean Peninsula have been consistent over many years,” Wolosky said. “In fact, she was a harsh critic of the South Korean government during times this indictment alleges that she was acting on its behalf.”He added, “Once the facts are made clear, it will be evident the government made a significant mistake.”Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for the Southern District, declined to comment. The South Korean Embassy did not immediately return a message seeking comment.Considered an expert on North Korea and broader security issues in the region, Terry has worked not only at the CIA, but at the National Intelligence Council and the National Security Council , places where she produced “hundreds of intelligence assessments,” according to her biography on the Council on Foreign Relations website.According to the indictment, federal agents had suspicions regarding Terry’s contact with South Korea as early as November 2014, when the FBI called her in for a voluntary interview.As she was questioned, Terry became “visibly nervous, changed her speech pattern and began to stutter and shift in her seat,” the indictment said. Over the ensuing years, agents would track Terry to numerous restaurants and luxury stores in Washington, D.C., providing photos of her dining with her handlers and standing next to them at cash registers as they bought her expensive goods. Several were included in court papers Tuesday.In an interview with the FBI in June 2023, Terry, who was born in Seoul but raised in the United States, admitted that she had resigned from the CIA in 2008 rather than be fired because the agency had “problems” with her contacts with members of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, the indictment said.But her national security work was only prelude to more wrongdoing after she left the government, according to prosecutors, including disclosing “nonpublic US government information” to intelligence officers working for South Korea. The indictment says Terry handed over handwritten notes of a private group meeting in 2022 regarding the US government’s policy toward North Korea that she attended with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.During this period, the indictment said, Terry worked for several well-known think tanks in Washington.Terry’s activity on behalf of South Korea started small and became more ambitious as she worked with three different handlers, the indictment said. At first, she mainly published opinion articles favorable to South Korea’s stance on North Korea, but soon she was facilitating meetings between incoming Trump administration officials and South Korean intelligence agents in 2016. By 2018, Terry was hosting meetings at a think tank at the request of her South Korean handlers, giving them access to US national security officials, the indictment said.Terry made media appearances and wrote articles in US and South Korean publications reflecting Seoul’s policy priorities, the indictment said, including an opinion piece for The New York Times in 2014. She also testified before Congress about North Korea, which required her to sign a form before each hearing declaring that she was not a registered foreign agent.In April 2023, Terry hosted an event at a think tank where she invited congressional staff members and worked to study South Korea’s alliance with the United States at the request of the South Korean National Intelligence Service. Terry then invited the staff members to a happy hour where South Korean intelligence officers were present, allowing the officers to “spot and assess” potential recruits, according to the indictment.As her work became more risky, her rewards were greater, prosecutors said. Her payment started with a $2,950 Bottega Veneta bag and ballooned to lump sums of $11,000 and then $25,000, paid to Terry’s gift account at the think tank where she worked, over which she had sole discretion, they said.During lavish dinners at primarily Michelin-starred sushi restaurants, followed by drinks at rooftop bars, Terry’s handler would feed her lines she would then parrot in media appearances in the form of policy recommendations regarding US-South Korea relations, the indictment said.Iva Zoric, a spokesperson for the Council on Foreign Relations, said the organization had learned of the indictment Tuesday and placed Terry on unpaid administrative leave. She added that the council would cooperate with any investigation.","Sue Mi Terry is a prominent voice on US foreign policy.

US presidential polls: Joe Biden circle shrinks as Democrats fear election wipeout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-polls-joe-biden-circle-shrinks-as-democrats-fear-election-wipeout/articleshow/111817320.cms,"WASHINGTON: In the nearly three weeks since President Joe Biden took the debate stage in Atlanta and plunged his reelection campaign into chaos, his closest consultations have been not with his White House chief of staff, his top communications strategist or even the leader of his campaign.Instead, he is relying on members of his family — a tight-knit clan that includes his son, Hunter, and the first lady, Jill Biden — along with a tiny group of loyalists to steer him through a self-created crisis and quell a rising rebellion against his candidacy from within his own party.Biden has not consulted directly with the pollsters on his 500-person campaign team about the state of the race against Donald Trump but has instead relied on Mike Donilon, a longtime friend, former pollster and Biden campaign messaging guru, to summarize the numbers, with regular memos and numerous daily phone calls.The ever-buzzing phone of Steve Ricchetti, a close counselor to Biden since his vice presidency, is the main conduit between concerned lawmakers and the president.Biden speaks frequently to his son, Hunter, who calls and texts the president and first lady multiple times a day to see how they are coping with the onslaught of scrutiny surrounding his father’s health, mental fitness and final presidential campaign.Recent interviews with more than three dozen people, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations about the campaign, reveal a truth about the state of the president’s campaign: the people steering Biden through the biggest political crisis of his presidency are true believers in the mythology of Joe Biden as the comeback kid, and they discount opinions to the contrary.The result is a historic standoff between Biden and his small inner circle on the one hand, and broad swaths of voters and elected Democrats fearful of an electoral wipeout in November on the other.It’s a battle Biden has seemed to embrace in recent days. When asked Monday night about whom he consults on issues like remaining in the race or dropping out, the president offered a terse response: “Me.”“Look, I’ve been doing this a long time,” he said in an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt, adding, “My mental acuity’s been pretty damn good.”Biden has expressed frustration to allies that people do not seem to accept that he is mentally cogent and fit to lead, according to a person familiar with his thinking. And he believes his polling should reflect what he sees as his accomplishments.The attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday has muted some of the public pressure on Biden to exit the race. But the party remains deeply divided. Leaders of the Democratic National Committee are using the moment to move swiftly to confirm him as his party’s presidential nominee by the end of July, according to four people briefed on the matter, while many other Democrats are in despair about Biden’s prospects.Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is running for Senate, warned during a private meeting with donors Saturday that his party was likely to suffer overwhelming losses in November if Biden stayed in the race, according to two people with direct knowledge of Schiff’s remarks at the meeting.Recent polls show Biden trailing in most or all of the battleground states.“I think if he is our nominee, I think we lose,” Schiff said at a fundraiser in New York, according to a person with access to a transcription of a recording of the event. “And we may very, very well lose the Senate and lose our chance to take back the House.”Although Biden is taking advice mostly from his closest circle, he has been trying to prove that he is up for reelection by holding a series of meetings with lawmakers intended to hear concerns about his candidacy. He has held private discussions with Democratic governors and lawmakers, including with Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, in Biden’s vacation home in Rehoboth, Delaware, on Saturday. But multiple participants said the encounters have been carefully choreographed events that failed to alleviate their worries.On Friday, Biden abruptly left a call with Hispanic members of the House after one lawmaker, Rep. Mike Levin, D-Calif., called on him to get out of the race. Three participants familiar with that call said questions were preselected by Biden’s staff. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesperson, called that claim “false.”On Saturday, as Biden prepared to meet with centrist members of the House, several participants said the Biden campaign tried to solicit questions beforehand, which Bates also denied.“They don’t want to hear my question, which is, ‘Are you cloistered? Have you heard what the polling is, that we no longer have three swing states; we have seven or 10?’” said Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., who has called for Biden to step aside. “The numbers are trending to more swing states, and worse numbers, and more congressional seats that are now contested. It’s going the opposite direction.”During the call, Biden brushed away Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., when she told him he was trailing in her state by 4 to 5 percentage points, according to two people who participated in the call.During an earlier call Saturday, with progressive members of the House, Biden appeared to read from a note passed to him by a staff member: “Stay positive, you are sounding defensive.” According to a lawmaker on the call, the president was poking fun at his aides, not accidentally reading the directive. But the lawmaker said it spoke to how stage-managed the calls have seemed.Other lawmakers say they remain mystified that Biden has not done more to reach out to House members and members of the Senate, including a visit to Capitol Hill, where Biden spent 36 years and that he maintains deep reverence for.Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., described the outreach from Biden as “too scripted and too superficial,” saying the “hard conversations” were not happening. And now, after the shooting at Trump’s rally Saturday night, he thought they might never occur.“I suspect the attempted assassination of Donald Trump will likely crowd out the serious reckoning that should happen around the Democratic nomination,” Torres, who has not called on Biden to step aside, said in an interview.As he has for much of his career, Biden is relying most heavily on input from his small group of aides, which also includes Bruce Reed, who advises the president on policy and writes many of his speeches. Reed and Anita Dunn, the president’s senior communications adviser, have crafted the 100-days agenda Biden debuted at a rally Friday.Close allies, including Ron Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff, and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., are also on speed dial. Biden is choosing their counsel over soliciting a broad range of views within a party that remains fiercely divided over his continued candidacy. And they all are betting that, at age 81, he will pull off the biggest upset of his political career.Complicating matters for people hoping for Biden to step aside is that he fared far better during a nearly hourlong news conference Thursday than he did at the debate. He also turned in an energetic performance Friday at a rally in Michigan, where he was buoyed by a chanting crowd that booed and pointed at the press when he criticized his media coverage.And he does have supporters who are encouraged by what they see.“President Biden met the moment by calling for this country to come together and reject any political violence,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. “In terms of his campaign, what is needed is a bold agenda for 2024 including rent caps, expanding Social Security and ending medical debt. He finally broke through by offering that in Detroit.”White House aides disputed the claim that Biden has closed himself off to outside voices.“President Biden is incredibly proud of the well-rounded team he has built, with whom he’s fighting for middle-class families, for our freedoms, and the rule of law,” said Bates, the White House spokesperson. “The president frequently meets with a wide variety of administration officials, ranging from policy experts to team members who engage with all manner of communities, to governors, mayors and members of Congress.”Bates added, “He has not made changes to the group of advisers he consults, who he trusts because they’ve demonstrated the integrity to tell the truth and keep the well-being of the American people front of mind.”Still, there have been concerns among Democrats about who is advising the president in such a high-stakes moment. Hunter Biden, who is based in Los Angeles, was recently in a White House meeting preparing his father for a speech and is known to informally advise him on other political matters. If he cannot reach either the president or first lady, he calls on Anthony Bernal, Jill Biden’s senior adviser, who is in most senior-level meetings involving the president — an unusual status for an East Wing aide.Bernal, who has been with the Bidens since the 2008 campaign, is known as an enforcer within the White House. The tight-knit Biden family prizes loyalty, and Bernal delivers: “The guy would walk in front of a speeding train for her,” a close friend of Jill Biden said.Bernal works closely with Annie Tomasini, the White House deputy chief of staff, who is almost always at the president’s side. A senior White House official, describing her value to the Bidens and to the administration, referred to Tomasini’s background as a three-time captain of her college basketball team at Boston University: “She wants to help the team, and wants to help the team win.”The small group’s value to Biden and his family, in large part, is that they place a high value on loyalty to him and his family. It was a sentiment that came through to some Democratic senators who attended a briefing with Ricchetti, Donilon and Jen O’Malley Dillon, Biden’s campaign chair, this past week, according to two people familiar with the meeting.People familiar with the dynamic say there is a larger group of senior aides who meet each day to plan for the hours ahead. Since the debate, there have been two daily meetings: one at 9 a.m. and the other at 9 p.m.That group includes Jeff Zients, the White House chief of staff, who meets with the president multiple times a day on topics ranging from foreign policy to natural disasters. Zients, who has been a main point of contact for Schumer, has been involved in several recent meetings to shore up support, including one between Biden and Democratic governors. He has joined calls with Democratic donors and with business leaders and Dillon, who speaks with Biden regularly, has held private conversations and joined several meetings with outside stakeholders, including with donors, lawmakers and party officials.Ben LaBolt, the White House communications director, also attends the larger meetings. So does Dunn, who runs communications strategy for the White House and who has prepared Biden for his recent interviews.Dunn and Donilon composed the letter Biden sent to congressional Democrats on Monday of last week, relaying his decision to stay in the race. Sending the letter was Donilon’s idea, according to a person familiar with the process.When Biden delivered an Oval Office address Sunday evening, Donilon and Dunn were in the room with him reading along.Biden family members and allies have accused Dunn and others, publicly and privately, of setting Biden up for failure in the debate and for curbing his public appearances — a charge her defenders in the White House say is unfair. Biden has told members of his debate preparation team, which was led by Klain and a cast of other aides including Reed and Donilon, that he is not upset with them, two people familiar with those discussions said.Hunter Biden, who was recently convicted on felony gun charges, has also been frustrated by the approach taken by Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, Biden’s personal attorney, to put some distance between the president and his son’s legal troubles. The president’s son disputed accounts that there were tensions.“I have nothing but gratitude for Bob and Anita who have tirelessly supported my entire family personally and professionally for years, and continue to do so today and going forward,” Hunter Biden said in a statement.Still, the tension between Dunn and some in Biden’s inner circle has risen since the debate, according to people familiar with the dynamic, and Dunn has expressed her frustrations to allies.Some Biden aides were relieved Thursday evening when the president seemingly opened the door to a data-based argument that he could not win the , saying he would leave the race if his advisers told him “there’s no way you can win.”But Biden swiftly shot down that possibility, adding, “No one is saying that. No poll says that.” His denial stoked questions among some aides about what information the president has been shown.To be sure, Biden has access to external polling. He is a longtime reader of newspapers that do high-quality surveys, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, according to people familiar with his media diet. He is particularly sensitive to front-page headlines. He also uses Apple News on his iPhone and is a regular watcher of cable television, particularly MSNBC. He watches his favorite show, “Morning Joe,” while working out in the mornings.But he has repeatedly and publicly questioned the reliability of polling data, wondering aloud at his news conference and to George Stephanopoulos in an ABC interview earlier this month whether polling was “as accurate as it used to be.”The Biden campaign had not conducted an extensive survey since the debate until Monday of last week, when it began fielding a poll in seven swing states, according to three people familiar with the campaign operations.Even so, Biden invokes polling in nearly every one of his public appearances, saying surveys show him winning the contest. Nearly every national poll released publicly since the debate shows Trump leading or an effectively tied contest.“Recent polls show us winning,” he said at a rally in Michigan on Friday evening, pointing to a Marist poll, a rare example of a recent survey showing Biden slightly ahead of Trump, though within the margin of error.","Biden has not consulted directly with the pollsters on his 500-person campaign team about the state of the race against Donald Trump. Instead, he is relying on members of his family — a tight-knit clan that includes his son, Hunter, and the first lady, Jill Biden.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111817368,imgsize-1328081,width-400,resizemode-4/111817368.jpg"

"'Taiwan should pay US for protection': Donald Trump sparks row, throws into question America's stance in event of Chinese invasion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/taiwan-should-pay-us-for-protection-donald-trump-sparks-row-throws-into-question-americas-stance-in-event-of-chinese-invasion/articleshow/111816871.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former US President Donald Trump has stirred controversy with his remarks suggesting that the self-governed island of Taiwan should pay for American protection against potential Chinese aggression. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Trump stated that ""Taiwan should pay us for defense "" and likened the arrangement to ""an insurance company"".Trump's statements diverge from the Biden administration's position, which has repeatedly pledged to deploy US troops in defense of Taiwan. This shift in approach has injected uncertainty into the US, stance on Taiwan, a territory that has become a contentious issue in the ongoing tensions between Washington and Beijing.Trump's rationale appears to be rooted in his perception of Taiwan's thriving semiconductor industry, which he claims has ""taken away the US' chip business"".He suggested that Taiwan's valuable semiconductor sector, dominated by companies like TSMC, is a key interest for Chinese President Xi Jinping, implying that Beijing may refrain from seizing the island due to this economic consideration.However, Trump's remarks have drawn criticism from lawmakers, such as Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who accused the former president of jeopardising Taiwan's interests and emphasized the importance of upholding commitments to the island's vibrant democracy.In response to Trump's statements, Taiwan's Premier Cho Jung-tai expressed the island's willingness to shoulder more responsibility for its own defense.Cho highlighted Taiwan's efforts to enhance its self-defense capabilities, including increasing its military budget and extending compulsory military service. This stance underscores Taiwan's determination to bolster its defenses in the face of growing Chinese military threats.Experts, such as Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund, have clarified that Trump's remarks did not indicate a refusal to defend Taiwan, but rather suggested that Taiwan should contribute more to collective defense efforts. However, this perspective still raises concerns about the potential implications for Taiwan's security and the broader regional stability.The Taiwan Relations Act, which mandates the US to provide Taiwan with military hardware and technology to deter potential invasion, remains a cornerstone of US policy. Analysts, like Tung Wen-chi of the National Chengchi University, have emphasized the significance of this legislation, describing it as a national consensus that would be challenging to alter.As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, Trump's stance on Taiwan's defense costs and the potential for US intervention in the event of a Chinese incursion will likely continue to be a topic of intense scrutiny and debate.The outcome of this election could have significant consequences for Taiwan's future and the broader geopolitical landscape.","Former US President Donald Trump has stirred controversy with his remarks suggesting that the self-governed island of Taiwan should pay for American protection against potential Chinese aggression.

Fireball over New York City: Nasa explains what caused large boom near Statue of Liberty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fireball-over-new-york-city-nasa-explains-what-caused-large-boom-near-statue-of-liberty/articleshow/111816186.cms,"NEW DELHI: New York City was sent into a frenzy on Wednesday morning as reports of a loud boom reverberated across the city, leaving residents and officials alike puzzled and concerned. The deafening sound, which originated near the Statue of Liberty , was accompanied by sightings of a rare daylight fireball in the sky, adding to the confusion and speculation surrounding the incident.As the city's emergency services scrambled to investigate the cause of the disturbance, social media platforms were flooded with eyewitness accounts and theories. Some described the fireball as a ""bright light"" streaking across the sky, while others reported feeling the ground shake from the impact of the boom.After conducting a thorough investigation, officials from the New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM) and Nasa confirmed that a rare daylight fireball meteor was responsible for the loud boom and sightings over Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens . The meteor, which entered the Earth's atmosphere at very high speed, created a sonic boom as it broke apart, causing the ground-shaking sensation felt by many residents The fireball over New York City on Wednesday was estimated to have a mass of approximately 850-900 kg and a diameter of 80-90 cm, making it close to being classified as an asteroid rather than a meteoroid . When the meteor broke apart, the energy released was equivalent to 66 tons of TNT The event was not limited to New York City, as similar reports of a loud noise were also received from New Jersey. The meteor's path and the resulting loud boom were a rare occurrence, making it a significant event for those who witnessed it.NASA meteor expert Bill Cooke stated that the meteor was a ""rare daylight fireball"" that would have been visible for hundreds of miles . He explained that meteors are typically only seen at night, making this a very unusual occurrence Despite the dramatic display, there are no reports of any damage or injuries caused by the meteor. NASA has confirmed that the fireball did not impact the ground and likely burned up in the atmosphere.Daylight fireballs are extremely rare, with only a few occurring each year. The last major daylight meteor event was in 2013, when a 20-meter asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, injuring over 1,000 people.","New York City was sent into a frenzy on Wednesday morning as reports of a loud boom reverberated across the city.

It stated that security forces killed all 10 assailants in the ensuing gunfight.The attack on Bannu cantonment, the ISPR said, had been orchestrated by militants based in Afghanistan. “The attempt to enter the cantonment was effectively thwarted by security forces personnel, which forced the terrorists to ram an explosives-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall of the cantonment,” ISPR said.It added that the suicide car bombing destroyed a portion of the wall and damaged adjoining infrastructure, resulting in the deaths of the eight soldiers.“In the ensuing operation, our troops effectively engaged the terrorists as a result of which all 10 terrorists were sent to hell,” the army said. “This timely and effective response by the security forces prevented a major catastrophe, saving precious innocent lives,” it added.Locals said the blast was heard miles away and caused damage to nearby houses and shops. They said they saw black smoke billowing above the site and heard gunshots in the cantonment area.A militant outfit allied with the globally designated terrorist group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) took responsibility for the attack shortly after it started.The ISPR statement attributed the assault to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group which, according to it, operates from Afghanistan and has used Afghan soil to orchestrate acts of terrorism inside Pakistan in the past.Bannu and adjoining districts in the border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have particularly seen frequent TTP attacks targeting military and police forces since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan three years ago.Pakistan maintains TTP leaders and fighters are being increasingly facilitated by the de facto rulers of Afghanistan. The Taliban govt dismisses the allegations, saying TTP is an internal problem for Pakistan to deal with.There has been a sharp rise in terror incidents since PM Shehbaz Sharif announced anewmilitary offensive against militancy and extremism in the country’s northwestern and southwestern border regions. The announcement was vehemently resisted by Pashtun and Baloch leaderships in Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces through public protests, rallies and digital media campaigns.","At least 15 people, including 10 soldiers, killed in two separate attacks in the volatile northwest bordering Afghanistan.

However, the PTI leader declined to meet with the team, which sought to interrogate him on charges related to inciting public unrest against the state, as reported by Dawn.According to Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Asghar, Imran Khan was arrested as the primary suspect in 12 cases registered at different police stations in Lahore. The charges against him range from provoking the public to attacks on government properties and military installations.Senior police officials specified that the focus of the investigation primarily centred on two cases: the assault on the Lahore corps commander's residence and the Askari Tower.The cases were filed at several police stations, including Sarwar Road, Gulberg, Race Course, Naseerabad, Shadman, and others in Lahore.In today's hearing at anti-terrorism Court-I before Judge Khalid Arshad , the police requested a 30-day physical remand for Imran Khan to facilitate further investigation into the 12 cases. Imran Khan appeared via video call from Adiala Jail, represented by his lawyers, Azhar Siddique and Usman Gul, who objected to the remote proceedings and insisted on his physical presence.After hearing arguments from both sides, Judge Khalid Arshad reserved his verdict briefly and later granted a 10-day physical remand for Imran Khan. This remand applies to cases registered at Sarwar Road, Gulberg, Race Course, Shadman, Model Town, and Mughalpura police stations, totaling five cases at Sarwar Road, three at Gulberg, and one each at the other mentioned stations, Dawn reported.",An anti-terrorism court in Lahore has granted police a 10-day physical remand of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) founder Imran Khan. The unrest erupted nationwide last year after Imran Khan was detained by paramilitary rangers from the Islamabad high court during a corruption case proceeding.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111772203,imgsize-1111159,width-400,resizemode-4/111772203.jpg"

Import premiums during the period remained unchanged at USD 9.60 and USD 6.50 per barrel for petrol and HSD, respectively, while the Pakistani Rupee depreciated by about 17 paise against the dollar over the same fortnight.The government also disclosed its decision to raise the maximum limit of the petroleum development levy (PDL) to PKR 70 per litre through the Finance Bill. This move aims to bolster revenue collection, targeting PKR 1.28 trillion for the current fiscal year, up from PKR 960 billion in the previous year and surpassing the initial budget target by PKR 91 billion.Taxes on both petrol and HSD currently stand at approximately PKR 77 per litre, alongside a fixed PKR 60 per litre PDL, which notably impacts consumers. Additionally, a PKR 17 per litre customs duty is applied uniformly to both locally produced and imported petrol and HSD.The price hikes in petrol and diesel are expected to impact inflation, with petrol predominantly used in private transport, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, while diesel is crucial for heavy transport vehicles and contributes significantly to the cost of essential commodities such as vegetables, Dawn reported.","Petrol prices surged by PKR 9.99 per litre, reaching PKR 275.6/ltr, while HSD saw a rise of PKR 6.18/ ltr.

He termed the govt's move ""ridiculous and desperate posturing by a regime exposed day by day for its lack of legitimacy and popular appeal"".Activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir said the coalition govt's pursuit of a ban on PTI ""not only shows how weak PML-N is but also how desperate and frustrated the establishment has become"".Last week, the govt authorised Pakistan's ISI to intercept phone calls and messages ""in the interest of national security"" amid nationwide outrage over the allegedly unbridled powers the spy agency already enjoys.","The governing coalition's step is seen as an attempt to block PTI from becoming the single largest party in the National Assembly.

The former first couple was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) soon after a district and sessions court on Saturday quashed their conviction in their un-Islamic marriage case.The court's short order also stated to release Khan and Bibi immediately unless they were wanted in other cases.The NAB, which filed a new Toshakhana case against the couple, on Sunday presented them before Judge Muhammad Ali Warraich of the accountability court.The judge conducted the hearing inside the Adiala Jail due to security reasons.NAB Deputy Director Mohsin Haroon, who led the team to arrest them, requested their physical remand and the court, after hearing the lawyers, agreed to grant an eight-day remand.The court then ordered to present the two on July 22.The remand period can be extended to a maximum of 40 days at the request of NAB if it is needed to probe the suspects.Khan, objecting to the absence of media, said at the beginning of the hearing: ""If the media is not allowed, I will walk out of the court.""The court subsequently ordered media representatives to be brought inside the jail, and the hearing commenced once they arrived.Khan, 71, then addressed the judge directly, asserting that his wife had no involvement in the Toshakhana case, The Express Tribune reported.""I have read the Quran four times in jail, and it places a great responsibility on judges,"" he stated. ""Bushra Bibi is only imprisoned to cause me distress.""Bibi, 49, was also re-arrested on Saturday in the new NAB reference as she was to be released from Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail.He accused higher authorities of targeting his wife due to his decisions and said: ""My wife is being targeted by the King because I removed him from the ISI position, and my wife did not support him.""He referred to the army chief Gen.

Judge Bashir said a decision was made at gunpoint,"" Khan pleaded.""A former prime minister being told in the middle of the night that he has to appear for a brand new case in the morning,"" he remarked wryly.He harshly criticised the accountability watchdog and alleged that it was operating like robots, doing whatever they are paid to do.He added, ""In the previous case, the jewellery set, which was valued at Rs 18 million, was claimed to be worth Rs 3.25 billion.""""I am only speaking about my wife. Re-arresting her [Bushra Bibi] was a grave mistake,"" the cricketer-turned-politician said.The new Toshakhana case is based on the accusation that the couple during Khan's government purchased gifts from the state depository in violation of rules.This is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.Last week, the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the National Assembly and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.",Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi handed over to anti-corruption officials.

A district and session court on Saturday overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case related to the violation of the mandatory waiting period for a Muslim woman between two marriages.The relief came a day after the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the national and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some kind of change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.The court in the Iddat case verdict stated that Khan and his wife should be released ""if not required to be detained in any other case"" and anticipating his release a large number of PTI supporters accompanied by key leaders reached the Adiala Jail Rawalpindi, where they have been kept, to welcome them.But the PTI feared counter-measures by the government and announced that Khan would be arrested in three cases related to May 9 violence. However, it emerged that he and his wife were taken into custody by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB ) in a fresh Toshakhana corruption case .Khan and his wife during his government allegedly obtained gifts from the gift repository at low prices and sold them at higher rates.It is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.The new case alleged that the couple got some precious watches and other gifts from the state depository by violating rules.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.Despite dozens of cases against him and several party leaders, he has kept up his rhetoric by attacking the senior Army leadership , and his supporters churning out half-baked stories against the establishment on social media.The Army this month after a key meeting termed the attack on social media as ""digital terrorism"", calling it ""unwarranted criticism by some quarters"".Army commanders stated that the onslaught of politically motivated digital terrorism, unleashed by conspirators, duly abetted by their foreign cohorts against state institutions is meant to induce despondency in the nation and sow discord through the peddling of blatant lies, fake news and propaganda.The forum affirmed that military leadership is cognizant of the full spectrum of the challenges and resolved to shoulder its constitutionally mandated responsibilities with the support of the resilient people of Pakistan.Khan on his side uses the presence of media on the occasion of hearing cases against him in the Adiala Jail to fire salvos at rivals, showing unflinching resolve to fight. He also reiterates not to spare his tormentors.His own X handle is active, apparently operated by someone on his behalf, charging his opponents from the Army and civilians with an unwavering commitment. The same attitude has been displayed by his party leaders who often compete with each other to breathe more fire than others.All this had added to his hardships despite getting relief from the courts regularly.In the latest arrest, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) is expected to produce Khan and his wife before an accountability judge to seek their physical remand. Under the law, NAB can detain a person for 40 days on remand for investigation.As courts operate within rules, it is not easy for his legal team to secure his release.The circuitous legal battle is getting more entangled due to the official opposition to his release from jail.Recently, political advisor to Prime Minister, Rana Sanaullah, reportedly stated that new cases would be lodged against Khan in the coming days. Talking to the reporters in Lahore on June 15, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stated that Khan's detention for the next five years was necessary to bring economic stability.""People come to us and tell us if Pakistan has to progress then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,"" he said.","A district and session court overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case.

This was the last case keeping Khan in prison but he will not walk free as the authorities immediately issued fresh orders for his arrest in three other cases.In a short order, additional sessions judge Afzal Majoka directed authorities to immediately release Khan and his wife if they are not wanted in any other case.After the decision Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said, “Mr Khan has been arrested in three more cases.” The three cases are linked to violence against the military and other state installations after his brief arrest in May 2023.“An anti-terrorism court in Lahore approved the request to arrest Imran Khan in the May 9 case,” the PTI statement read. The party warned that keeping Khan, 71, in jail after Saturday’s decision would lead to another political crisis.Just days before national polls on Feb 8 the couple were sentenced to seven years in jail in the “iddat” case after the court found them guilty of breaking Islamic law by failing to observe the required interval between Bibi’s divorce from her previous husband and her marriage to Khan. The verdict had coincided with his convictions and sentences in the Toshakhana (state treasure store) and cipher cases. His sentences in two alleged graft cases, however, were suspended, while his sentence in the cipher case, linked to leaking of state secrets, was overturned. Various courts have also freed him in several other cases linked to the events of May 9, 2023 when his first arrest had caused riots across the country, following which the state launched a crackdown against him and his party.Ahead of Khan’s acquittal in a fake marriage case , a pair of applications was filed by Khawar Fareed Maneka, Bushra’s previous husband. One application asked the court to carry out a medical checkup of his ex-wife to ascertain her menstrual cycle while the other called on religious scholars for consultation on further deliberation on the duration of “iddat”.Before ordering Khan and his wife’s release, judge Majoka dismissed both applications. “Both petitions seeking the formation of a medical board and consultations with religious scholars are hereby rejected,” the verdict stated.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023.

Judge Majoka announced the judgment in the afternoon after reserving the verdict earlier in the day, acquitting Khan, 71, and Bushra, 49.""If they are not wanted in any other case, then PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi should be released [from jail] immediately,"" the judge said after accepting their appeals. However, it was not immediately clear if Khan would be released, as this was the only case for which he was currently imprisoned following the suspension of his Toshakhana corruption case sentence and acquittal in the cipher case.Imran Khan, the cricketer-turned-politician, has been behind bars since August last year after being sentenced in the Toshakhana corruption case and subsequently convicted in other cases ahead of the February 8 elections.Maneka filed the case against the couple in November 2023, alleging that they married without observing the mandatory Iddat period. He sought to have the marriage declared null and void.Khan and Bibi married in 2018, the same year Khan won the general elections and became prime minister. Bibi, who was ostensibly Khan's spiritual guide, divorced her husband of 28 years, with whom she had five children, and developed a romantic relationship with Khan.

As a result, over 600,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan since the order was issued last year. Human rights organizations have cautioned that some of those sent back to Afghanistan may face persecution by the Taliban , who took power in 2021 and have implemented strict Islamic laws, denying girls access to higher education and excluding women and girls from many areas of public life.Malala, who grew up in Pakistan's Swat valley and had to relocate to the UK after being shot at the age of 15 for resisting the Pakistan Taliban's ban on girls' education, emphasized the importance of protecting girls and women, given the bleak future they face in Afghanistan. She expressed hope that Pakistan would reverse its policy, stating, ""I hope that Pakistan reverses its policy and that they protect girls and women especially because of the dark future that they would be witnessing in Afghanistan"".On her birthday, recognized by the UN as Malala Day, the activist addressed the challenges faced by Afghan girls, who have been banned from education for over three years. While finding the situation shocking, she admired the resilience of Afghan activists. The Malala Fund is advocating for the UN to formally expand its definition of crimes against humanity to include ""gender apartheid,"" a term used by the UN to describe the situation in Afghanistan.Malala criticised the recent talks between the UN and the Taliban in Doha, which took place without the presence of women. She called for a ""principled engagement"" with the Taliban and urged world leaders to realize that excluding women and girls from such discussions is doing the Taliban a favor.She specifically called out countries with feminist foreign policies, such as Canada and France, to condemn such conversations.Furthermore, Malala called for an urgent ceasefire in the ongoing war in Gaza, expressing concern over the bombing of schools in the region. She emphasized the importance of providing humanitarian support to innocent civilians and praised countries that have resumed funding for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, despite Israeli accusations of its workers being involved in Hamas's attack against Israel on October 7.","Malala Yousafzai has expressed deep concern over Pakistan's decision to deport undocumented Afghan refugees.
