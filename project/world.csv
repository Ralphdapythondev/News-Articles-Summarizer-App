Netanyahu vows Israel will fight alone even without US help,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-vows-israel-will-fight-alone-even-without-us-help/articleshow/109994571.cms,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu struck a defiant tone against President Joe Biden after the US withheld a shipment of bombs as a warning to its top Middle East ally not to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah.In a first, punchy clip on the social media site X, Netanyahu said: “If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone” and “fight tooth and nail.” He then pivoted to a more conciliatory approach when chatting with Phil McGraw, the American talk show host known as Dr.Phil.“I’ve known Joe Biden for many years, 40 years and more,” Netanyahu said in the interview Thursday on “Dr. Phil Primetime” broadcast on Merit Street Media. “We often had agreements, but we’ve had our disagreements and we’ve been able to overcome them. I hope we can overcome them now.”Netanyahu said Israel must go into Rafah to finish off the remaining battalions of Hamas, the US-designated terrorist group that killed 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped about 250 last Oct. 7. He said Hamas will “murder again and again” if allowed to survive in Rafah.“We have to achieve victory,” he said. “That means we have to destroy all these battalions, which we will. We face very strong opposition to that, but we’re going to overcome it.”Netanyahu said Israel would do its utmost to make sure civilians leave Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering, before any attack. He also criticized the “madness” of pro-Palestinian rallies on US college campuses, saying protesters are “supporting genocide,” adding that this reflected “the sorry state of American higher education.”On Wednesday, Biden said he would halt additional shipments of offensive weapons to Israel if it launches a ground invasion of Rafah, decrying the potential loss of civilian life as “just wrong.”“We’re going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks that came out of the Middle East recently,” Biden said in an interview with CNN, referring to air-defense weaponry. “But it’s just wrong. We’re not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells.”Like Netanyahu, US officials followed sharp criticism with more conciliatory remarks on Thursday.White House officials insisted the US stands by its ally, while urging Netanyahu to refrain from an assault that could worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Spokesman John Kirby reiterated that the administration paused, but didn’t cancel, the shipment of about 3,500 bombs, which he said was limited to specific munitions that could add to the civilian death toll in Gaza.“The arguments that somehow we’re walking away from Israel flies in the face of the facts,” Kirby told reporters.There were also indications that the White House hadn’t sought an open confrontation with Netanyahu.US officials initially planned to inform the Israeli government privately that the US intended to pause the bomb shipment, in order to ramp up pressure on Netanyahu — but not to follow through unless there was a major incursion into urban areas of Rafah. But that plan was foiled when Israeli officials leaked it, people familiar with the situation said.","Netanyahu says he's known Biden for 40 years, hopes they can overcome their disagreements. He says Israel must go into Rafah to finish off the remaining battalions of Hamas. Biden said he would halt additional shipments of offensive weapons to Israel if it launches a ground invasion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109994607,imgsize-1545069,width-400,resizemode-4/109994607.jpg"
US Meddling: Russia Accuses US of Meddling in India's Affairs in Pannun Case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/russia-accuses-us-of-meddling-in-indias-affairs-in-pannun-case/articleshow/109990859.cms,"Accusations reflect US’s India disrespect: Russia spokesperson

NEW DELHI: Russia waded into the Gurpatwant Singh Pannun murder-for-hire case on Wednesday to claim that the US had not yet provided any “reliable evidence” about the involvement of Indian nationals in the alleged murder plot to kill the Khalistani rabble rouser, and also accused the Americans of meddling in India’s internal affairs and “complicating” the ongoing Lok Sabha elections by destabilising the internal political situation.According to an agency report, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, when asked about a report by the Washington Post claiming that India was trying to adopt the policies of Russia and Saudi Arabia, said, “According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain GS Pannun.”“Speculation on this topic in the absence of evidence is unacceptable. Washington lacks understanding of India's national mentality and history and continues to make unfounded accusations about religious freedoms in India.”India had earlier formed a committee in Nov last year to probe the US allegations and said the information shared by US authorities had a bearing on India’s own security too, but strongly refuted the claims in the Post report, saying it made “unwarranted and unsubstantiated” imputations on a serious matter and that an investigation into the case was underway.The Washington Post report had identified an Indian govt official who allegedly ordered the hit on Khalistani separatist and US national Pannun. The report also shared the US “assessment” that top Indian security officials, including then RAW chief Samant Goel, approved the plot. “Regular unfounded accusations by the US against New Delhi... we see that they groundlessly accuse not only India but also many other states of violating religious freedoms. These are a reflection of the United States’ misunderstanding of the national mentality, the historical context of the development of the Indian state and disrespect for India as a state,” Maria Zakharova further said on the matter.Describing the interference as a “colonial period mentality”, the Russian spokesperson accused the White House of complicating the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. “The reason is that they try to unbalance the internal political situation in India in order to complicate the (ongoing) parliamentary elections. That is part of meddling into India’s internal affairs,” RT news quoted Zakharova as saying. PM Modi had spoken about efforts by foreign actors to influence Indian polls.",Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the US had not yet provided any “reliable evidence” about the involvement of Indian nationals in the alleged murder plot.

Indians caught in OPT fraud get another shot to live & work in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indians-caught-in-opt-fraud-get-another-shot-to-live-work-in-us/articleshow/109990961.cms,"Scam's modus operandi

A 'stipulated dismissal agreement' recently approved in a US district court has given a shot in the arm to more than 90 foreign nationals, many of them Indians, who fell victim to an Optional Practical Training (OPT) fraud committed by their former OPT-employer company. These individuals had been denied re-entry to the US or were held ineligible for a visa, including a work visa .Now, all these sanctions have been lifted.A few individuals, who had found themselves embroiled in such a fraud, had reached out to TOI explaining their predicament. For instance, one such individual, originally from Chennai who had enrolled in a company which was apparently blacklisted by the US department of homeland security ( DHS ), was denied entry by the border and customs officials when he landed at a US airport after a brief vacation at home. He points out that this company had been certified for conducting OPT. He had been in this company for some months, before realising he wasn't given projects to work on under guidance as is required under OPT regulations and had shifted to another firm. Despite a short stint with this alleged blacklisted company, he suffered.Jesse Bless, one of the attorneys who represented the plaintiffs, told TOI, ""After months of negotiations, the US DHS, agreed to review the govt's internal records. DHS confirmed these plaintiffs (former students, undergoing OPT training and swindled by their OPT-employer company) are not inadmissible to the US or ineligible for a visa simply because they worked for a nefarious OPT-company. In other words, with the inadmissibility lifted, these plaintiffs have now regained another opportunity to live and work in the US.""International students are eligible for a one-year OPT to gain work experience in the US. In addition, those in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) field get an additional two-year tenure for their OPT. According to an Open Doors Report, for the academic year 2022-23, there were 2.7 lakh Indian students in the US of which 69,000 were undergoing OPT.Jonathan Wasden, who also represented these students, explained to TOI that these firms were certified by DHS under the e-Verify system as eligible to hire OPT students. ""They began to aggressively market consulting jobs to recent graduates on social media platforms. After offering employment they would state that some more training was needed. While the companies did not ask for money in exchange for OPT job offers, they charged for the training - typically a charge of under $ 500 - that too of dubious quality, In addition, many of these students were not assigned any projects, so as to gain work experience,"" he said.DHS did not alert the public to the scam. Instead, it raided some of these firms and seized employee lists. It then began matching names in their system to names on the list. Some erstwhile OPT-students were holding H-1B visas and were gainfully employed for several years. On return from a vacation to India, they were told by the consulate that DHS had made them inadmissible to the US. Wasden said students should watch out for any company that asks them to pay for training or anything else. Through an attorney students should report this to the DHS, this would offer them some protection at a later date from being rendered inadmissible or ineligible for a visa, he added.","More than 90 foreign nationals, many of them Indians, fell victim to an Optional Practical Training (OPT) fraud committed by their former OPT-employer company.

Trump attorney and Stormy Daniels trade barbs during questions about alleged 2006 sexual encounter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-attorney-and-stormy-daniels-trade-barbs-during-questions-about-alleged-2006-sexual-encounter/articleshow/109989302.cms,"NEW YORK: Donald Trump's defense attorney on Thursday accused Stormy Daniels of slowly altering the details of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, trying to persuade jurors that a key prosecution witness in the former president's hush money trial cannot be believed.“The details of your story keep changing, right?” attorney Susan Necheles asked at one point.“No,” Daniels said.As the jury looked on, the two women traded barbs over what Necheles said were inconsistencies in Daniels' description of the encounter with Trump in a hotel room . He denies the whole story.“You made all this up, right?” Necheles asked.“No,” Daniels shot back.But despite all the talk over what may have happened in that hotel room, despite the discomfiting testimony by the adult film actor that she consented to sex in part over a “power imbalance,"" the case against Trump doesn’t rise or fall on whether her account is true or even believable. It’s a trial about money changing hands — business transactions — and whether those payments were made to illegally influence the 2016 election.Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records. The charges stem from paperwork such as invoices and checks that were deemed legal expenses in company records. Prosecutors say those payments largely were reimbursements to Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet.The testimony over the past three weeks has seesawed between bookkeepers and bankers relaying the nuts-and-bolts of check-paying procedures and wire transfers to unflattering, seamy stories about Trump and the tabloid world machinations meant to keep them secret.This criminal case could be the only one against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee to go to trial before voters decide in November whether to send him back to the White House. Trump has pleaded not guilty and casts himself as the victim of a politically tainted justice system working to deny him another term.Meanwhile, as the threat of jail looms over Trump following his repeated gag order violations, his attorneys are fighting the judge’s order and seeking a fast decision in an appeals court. If the court refuses to lift the gag order, Trump’s lawyers want permission to take their appeal to the state’s high court.“Here we sit after two and a half weeks, and I think you’ll see some very revealing things today,” Trump said outside the courtroom.At the time of the payment to Daniels, Trump and his campaign were reeling from the October 2016 publication of the never-before-seen 2005 “Access Hollywood” footage in which he boasted about grabbing women’s genitals without their permission.Prosecutors have argued that the political firestorm over the “Access Hollywood” tape hastened Cohen’s payment to keep Daniels from going public with her claims that could further hurt Trump in the eyes of female voters.The tape rattled RNC leadership, and “there were conversations about how it would be possible to replace him as the candidate if it came to that,"" according to testimony from Madeleine Westerhout, a Trump aide who was working at the Republican National Committee when the recording leaked.Daniels was on the stand for 7 1/2 half hours over two days. During questioning from prosecutors, she relayed in graphic detail what she said happened during their 2006 encounter, after the two met at a celebrity golf outing at Lake Tahoe where sponsors included the adult film studio where she worked.Trump scowled and shook his head through much of Daniels’ description, including how she found the Republican presidential sitting on the hotel bed in his underwear after she returned from the bathroom and that he did not use a condom. At one point, the judge told defense lawyers during a sidebar conversation — out of earshot of the jury and the public — that he could hear Trump “cursing audibly.”Trump’s lawyers have sought to paint Daniels as a liar and extortionist who’s trying to take down Trump after drawing money and fame from her story about him. And they say the hush money payments were an effort to protect his reputation and family — not his campaign — by shielding them from embarrassing stories about his personal life.On Thursday, Necheles grilled Daniels on her description of the encounter in which she described fear and discomfort even as she consented to sex. She testified earlier this week that while she wasn’t physically menaced, she felt a “power imbalance” as Trump, in his hotel bedroom, stood between her and the door and propositioned her.As for whether she felt compelled to have sex with him, she reiterated Thursday that he didn’t drug her or physically threaten her. But, she said, “My own insecurities, in that moment, kept me from saying no.”Necheles suggested that her work in porn meant her story about being shocked and frightened by Trump’s alleged sexual advances was not believable.“You’ve acted and had sex in over 200 porn movies, right?” Necheles asked. “And there are naked men and women having sex, including yourself, in those movies?”Necheles continued: “But according to you, seeing a man sitting on a bed in a T-shirt and boxers was so upsetting that you got lightheaded. The blood left your hands and feet, and you felt like you were going to faint.”The experience with Trump was different from porn for a number of reasons, Daniels explained, including the fact that Trump was more than twice her age, larger than her and that she was not expecting to find him undressed when she emerged from the bathroom.“I came out of a bathroom seeing an older man that I wasn’t expecting to be there,” she said.Necheles pressed her on why she accepted the payout to keep quiet instead of going public.“Why didn’t you do that?” she asked, wondering why Daniels didn’t hold a news conference as she had planned.“Because we were running out of time,” Daniels said.Did she mean, Necheles asked, that she was running out of time to use the claim to make money?“To get the story out,” Daniels countered. The negotiations were happening in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign.While she was in talks with Cohen, Daniels was also talking with other journalists as a “backup” plan, she testified. Necheles accused her of refusing to share the story with reporters because she wouldn’t be paid for it.“The better alternative was for you to get money, right?” Necheles said. Daniels said she was most interested in getting her story out and ensuring her family’s safety.“The better alternative was to get my story protected with a paper trail so that my family didn’t get hurt,” Daniels replied.But she testified that she never spoke with Trump about payment, and said she had no knowledge of whether Trump was aware of or involved in the transaction.“You have no personal knowledge about his involvement in that transaction or what he did or didn’t do,” Trump lawyer Susan Necheles asked.“Not directly, no,” Daniels responded.Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger later asked Daniels: “Have you been telling lies about Mr. Trump or the truth about Mr. Trump?”“The truth,” said Daniels, who also said that although she has made money since her story emerged, she also has had to spend a lot to hire security, move homes and take other precautions, and she still owes Trump hundreds of thousands of dollars in attorneys fees.“On balance, has publicly telling the truth about Mr. Trump been a net positive or net negative in your life?” Hoffinger asked.“Negative,” Daniels replied quietly.","Daniels was on the stand for 7 1/2 half hours over two days.

Saudi Arabia's stark warning against Israel's Rafah ground operation| seeks Int'l intervention

Has the US ever withheld military aid from Israel before?

American President Joe Biden has warned that the US would not provide offensive weapons to Israel for a potential full-scale assault on Rafah, a critical Hamas stronghold in Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Biden affirmed the US's commitment to Israel's defense by continuing to supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive equipment. However, he made it clear that if Israeli forces were to enter Rafah, the US would withhold supplying weapons and artillery shells.Biden reiterated the conditional nature of US military support: ""I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem."" Biden's stance marks a significant policy shift, emphasizing a strategic withdrawal from supporting offensive operations in such densely populated areas, saying, ""We’re not walking away from Israel’s security.We’re walking away from Israel’s ability to wage war in those areas.""Here is all you need to know about why the US is stopping some bomb shipments to IsraelThe US has paused a shipment that includes 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs. These are significant because their use in densely populated areas like Rafah can lead to high civilian casualties. President Biden expressed this concern clearly: “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers.""The decision comes amidst escalating violence in Gaza, particularly in Rafah, where the potential for civilian casualties is substantial due to the dense population. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated, ""We've been very clear...from the very beginning that Israel shouldn't launch a major attack into Rafah without accounting for and protecting the civilians that are in that battlespace."" The concern is that the large bombs could cause excessive damage and civilian deaths in such settings.Israel's US ambassador, Gilad Erdan, described the US decision to pause the bomb shipment as ""very disappointing,"" even frustrating, suggesting it might be a result of political pressure on Biden. Despite this, Erdan expressed confidence that the US would not completely stop supplying arms to Israel.Yes, there have been instances in the past where the US has withheld military aid from Israel. For example, in 1982, President Ronald Reagan imposed a six-year ban on cluster weapons sales to Israel following reports that they were used in populated areas during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Such decisions are often influenced by concerns over the use of US supplied weapons in conflict zones and their impact on civilian populations.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Joe Biden has warned that the US would not provide offensive weapons to Israel for a potential full-scale assault on Rafah, a critical Hamas stronghold in Gaza.

New Russian space weapon raises alarm in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-russian-space-weapon-raises-alarm-in-us/articleshow/109919862.cms,"NEW DELHI: US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia 's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, which could potentially transform Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) into a perilous battleground. The discussions about this emerging threat were highlighted by Mallory Stewart, the US assistant secretary of state for arms control, and John Plumb, the assistant secretary of defense for space policy, underscoring the serious implications of such developments.The ASAT weapon in question, allegedly already tested by Russia in high radiation orbits under the guise of electronic testing, diverges from typical scientific satellite protocols. This weapon is designed to disrupt a wide array of satellite operations spanning civilian, commercial, and military sectors by detonating in LEO, which extends approximately 100 to 1200 miles above the Earth, a report in Asia Times said.While there is no immediate deployment, the indiscriminate nature of such a weapon could severely damage satellites and impair critical global services including communication, weather forecasting, and security operations. The US officials emphasized the widespread implications of deploying such technology, noting its potential to make LEO unusable for any satellite operations.The concept of using nuclear weapons in ASAT roles isn't new and harks back to Cold War anxieties. Historical precedents like the US's Project 437 during the Kennedy administration, which was later abandoned due to its potential to damage both enemy and US satellites and infrastructure indiscriminately, illustrate the complexities and risks associated with such weapons.Recent simulations, such as those conducted by Chinese military scientists, have explored the effects of a nuclear detonation at altitude on satellite functionality. These studies show that while a high-altitude nuclear explosion would not create a traditional explosive cloud due to the absence of air, it would generate a belt of high-energy particles trapped by Earth’s magnetic field, posing a significant risk to spacecraft.In response to the decisive role satellite constellations like Elon Musk’s Starlink have played in modern warfare, evidenced by their utility in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, both Russia and China have hinted at developing ASAT capabilities to counter these systems. Reports suggest that these nations view the neutralization of such satellite networks as crucial to diminishing their adversaries' operational effectiveness.US and allied commercial satellites, including those like Starlink which have been pivotal in supporting Ukraine, have been identified by Russian officials as potential targets in the event of escalating hostilities. This stance highlights the broader strategy of using space capabilities as a means of asserting dominance and the potential shift towards militarization of space, despite international treaties like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which seeks to bar such activities.The development and potential deployment of nuclear ASAT weapons pose not only a technological or tactical challenge but also a diplomatic and strategic one, threatening the fabric of international space law and the peaceful use of outer space.",US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite weapon.

The bodies of the deceased and the injured were taken to a hospital and cops have initiated a probe to arrest the perpetrators.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109969254,imgsize-11600,width-400,resizemode-4/109969254.jpg"
Problem of plenty: Record 9 million 'akiya' homes are vacant in Japan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/problem-of-plenty-record-9-million-akiya-homes-are-vacant-in-japan/articleshow/109948491.cms,"Japan is grappling with a significant challenge as the number of vacant homes , known as ""akiya,"" has surged to a record high of nine million, which is more than the population of New York City . This alarming increase is largely attributed to the country's continuously declining population, presenting a unique set of problems for both urban and rural areas.According to Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Chiba, ""This is a symptom of Japan’s population decline.It’s not really a problem of building too many houses, but a problem of not having enough people."" This situation is exacerbated in cities like Tokyo and Kyoto, where abandoned homes are increasingly common, a CNN report said.The akiya issue is not just a housing market concern but also poses significant risks during disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, which Japan is prone to. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications reports that 14% of all residential properties in Japan are now vacant, encompassing second homes and those temporarily unoccupied due to owners working abroad, the CNN report said.These vacant homes can hinder the efforts to rejuvenate aging towns, becoming hazards due to lack of maintenance and complicating rescue efforts during disasters. Yuki Akiyama, a professor from the faculty of architecture and urban design at Tokyo City University, highlighted the dangers posed by akiya during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Noto Peninsula in January. ""When an earthquake or a tsunami occurs, there is a possibility that vacant houses will block evacuation routes as they break down and get destroyed,"" Akiyama explained.The issue also has a negative impact on the value of real estate in areas with high concentrations of akiya, as these properties stall development and lower regional attractiveness. ""The value of the area will be reduced because it is a place where you can’t buy and sell it properly and you can’t do large-scale development,"" said Akiyama.While some have turned to renovating these homes into guesthouses or cafes, Hall warned that the process is not as straightforward as it seems, especially for foreigners. ""The truth is most of these homes are not going to be sold to foreigners, or that the amount of administrative work and the rules behind it [are] not something easy for somebody who doesn’t speak Japanese and read Japanese very well,"" he said.As Japan's population continues to shrink and the number of children born each year declines, the challenge of managing and repurposing these empty homes remains daunting. With the fertility rate remaining far below the replacement level, the problem of too many homes and too few people is expected to persist, shaping the future of housing and urban development in Japan.",The number of vacant homes in Japan has surged to a record high of nine million. The increase is largely attributed to the country's continuously declining population. 14% of all residential properties in Japan are now vacant.

A storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency - the weather service's highest alert level - was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.The National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: ""We're getting overloaded right now.""Rita Thompson, Marketing & Communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.""Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,"" the weather agency alert said.In North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.More than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.The National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.Crews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.In Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties - all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.Kalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.Samantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.Her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.""I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,"" she said. ""My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.""Travis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.""There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,"" Wycoff said. ""It was just a lot of chaos.""In southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.Candice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and ""the wind just picked up all at once.""""It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,"" Holmes told WDRB-TV.","Tornadoes touch down in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. Two people killed in Tennessee, one in North Carolina.

They have a law, you can't go more than two kilometers to vote. So there'll be one guy who lives in the mountains as a monk (at) someplace. They will walk for two days to bring the voting machine, execute the vote,"" he said, responding to a question expressing concerns over the status of democracy in India.He said that during elections times in India, there are people who check trucks to make sure that nobody has cash going around. ""There's probably walk-in money, as they call it in some cities here in the United States, Philadelphia, that's like a tradition where cash kind of gets you votes and things like that. So, I've been impressed with certain things they do that are better than us.""He, however, added there are things that ""we keep our eyes on. And I just disagree that we don't speak out about them"",""We put them out. It's not the only thing. I mean, some people want us to only say that. But this is too important a relationship to spend all day long only saying that over and over. You're not going to get anything else done. It'll become a self-fulfilling prophecy that they will not be close to us. Whereas where we find the common ground, which I think is really human to human, very deep,"" he said.""You have a lot of leaders there who have come worked, been educated here, have an affinity. There's a huge positive polling of Americans. I told the president before the state visit that Americans poll better in India than Americans do in America. They like us more than we like ourselves. That's rare in the world today,"" Garcetti said, adding that Poland is the only other country that comes close.This is a huge advantage for the US, he said.""... If you don't know state governments in India, which are as powerful as the centre and are run by opposition parties, and there's plenty of criticisms you can make, too, about other parties that have been in power. If you look at history in India, there's not been some golden era where everybody's rights have been respected,"" Garcetti said.""America's role is to stand up for the principles and the values that we have, to never retreat from those and talk about them. But is the relationship only that and those points of conflict? Absolutely not. It would be bad diplomacy, it would be bad policy. But in my heart, 100 percent, I believe, not only will this still continue to be one of the world's most vibrant democracies,"" Garcetti said.""I 100 percent believe we can trust this relationship.

Biden, in an interview with CNN on Wednesday, said that the US was still committed to Israel's defence and would supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms but that if Israel goes into Rafah, ""we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.""Biden acknowledged that ""civilians have been killed in Gaza"" by the type of heavy bombs that the US has been supplying - his first validation of what administration critics have been loudly protesting, even if he still stopped short of taking responsibility.His threat to hold up artillery shells expanded on earlier revelations that the US was going to pause a shipment of heavy bombs.The US has historically provided enormous amounts of military aid to Israel. That has only accelerated in the aftermath of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which killed some 1,200 people in Israel and led to about 250 being taken captive by militants.Biden's comments and his decision last week to pause the shipment of heavy bombs to Israel are the most striking manifestations of the growing daylight between his administration and Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu's govt. Biden said Wednesday that Israel's actions around Rafah had ""not yet"" crossed his red lines, but has repeated that Israel needs to do far more to protect the lives of civilians in Gaza.The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound (900-kg) bombs and 1,700 500-pound (225-kg) bombs, according to a senior US administration official. The focus of US concern was the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban area.""Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,"" Biden told CNN. ""I made it clear that if they go into Rafah - they haven't gone in Rafah yet - if they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem."" ""We're not walking away from Israel's security,"" the Democratic president continued. ""We're walking away from Israel's ability to wage war in those areas.""Defence secretary Lloyd Austin earlier Wednesday confirmed the weapons delay, telling the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defence that the US paused ""one shipment of high payload munitions.""It also comes as the Biden administration is due to deliver a first-of-its-kind formal verdict this week on whether the air strikes on Gaza and restrictions on delivery of aid have violated international and US laws designed to spare civilians from the worst horrors of war.

At first, under both Truman and President Dwight Eisenhower, the US refused to sell Israel weapons at all.President John F Kennedy became the first to open up the arsenal by providing Hawk antiaircraft missiles.

Though last week's claims were the most since the final week of August 2023, it's still a relatively low number of layoffs and not cause for concern.The four-week average of claims, which softens some of the weekly volatility, rose by 4,750 to 215,000.Weekly unemployment claims are considered a proxy for the number of U.S. layoffs in a given week and a sign of where the job market is headed. They have remained at historically low levels since the pandemic purge of millions of jobs in the spring of 2020.Last month, U.S. employers added just 175,000 jobs, the fewest in six months and another sign that the labor market may be loosening. The unemployment rate inched back up to 3.9% from 3.8% and has now remained below 4% for 27 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s.The government also recently reported 8.5 million job openings in March, the lowest number of vacancies in three years.Moderation in the pace of hiring, along with a slowdown in wage growth could give the Fed the data its been seeking in order to finally issue a cut to interest rates.The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark borrowing rate 11 times beginning in March of 2022 in a bid to stifle the four-decade high inflation that took hold after the economy rebounded from the COVID-19 recession of 2020. The Fed’s intention was to loosen the labor market and cool wage growth, which can fuel inflation.Many economists thought there was a chance the rapid rate hikes could cause a recession, but jobs have remained plentiful and the economy forged on thanks to strong spending by U.S. consumers.Though layoffs remain at low levels, companies have been announcing more job cuts recently, mostly across technology and media. Google parent company Alphabet, Apple and eBay have all recently announced layoffs.Outside of tech and media, Peloton, Stellantis, Nike and Tesla have recently announced job cuts.In total, 1.79 million Americans were collecting jobless benefits during the week that ended April 27.

US says Rafah offensive would jeopardize cease-fire talks as Biden threatens to halt more Israel aid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-says-rafah-offensive-would-jeopardize-cease-fire-talks-as-biden-threatens-to-halt-more-israel-aid/articleshow/109989054.cms,"WASHINGTON: The United States warned on Thursday that Israel will be dealing a strategic victory to Hamas if it carries out plans for an all-out assault on Rafah , the militants' last major stronghold in Gaza.The warning was backed by a new threat from President Joe Biden : He says he will pause more offensive military assistance to Israel if it goes through with the operation in a city where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering.Biden last week put on hold a shipment of large bombs to Israel over concerns the weapons are of the type that has caused significant civilian casualties in Gaza and would almost certainly do more such damage if Israel conducted a major offensive in Rafah.On Wednesday, he held out the possibility of holding up future shipments of bomb guidance kits and artillery to Israel, in hopes the threat would turn Israel back from an operation in the city.The pronouncements are part of last-ditch push for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right government to rethink their public commitments to invade the city in an effort to eradicate Hamas. The U.S. believes such a move would result in significant civilian casualties and exacerbate an already dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza.The U.S. is making its sharpest moves yet to influence the decision-making of its ally in the ongoing war against the militant group that was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Some 1,200 people in Israel were killed and about 250 were taken captive.“Our view is any kind of major Rafah ground operation would actually strengthen Hamas' hands at the negotiating table, not Israel’s,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. He said more civilian deaths in Rafah from an Israeli offensive would give more ammunition to Hamas' “twisted narrative” about Israel.Talks in Cairo aimed at securing a six-week cease-fire to allow for the release of some hostages and a surge of food and aid to civilians in Gaza are continuing, Kirby added. But CIA Director Bill Burns and other delegations to the talks left Egypt on Thursday without a deal.Kirby said it was too soon to know whether the aid holdup had altered the Israeli calculus, but that the U.S. was continuing to advise Israel on how it could defeat Hamas through more surgical operations.“We believe that they have put an enormous amount of pressure on Hamas and that there are better ways to go after what is left of Hamas in Rafah than a major ground operation,"" he added.Biden, in an interview with CNN on Wednesday, insisted that despite the arms hold up, the U.S. was still committed to Israel's defense and would supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms .He acknowledged that “civilians have been killed in Gaza” by the type of heavy bombs that the U.S. has been supplying. It was his first validation of what administration critics have been loudly protesting, even if he still stopped short of taking responsibility. His threat to hold up artillery shells expanded on earlier revelations that the U.S. was going to pause a shipment of heavy bombs.Biden said Israel’s actions around Rafah had “not yet” crossed his red lines, but he has repeated that Israel needs to do far more to protect the lives of civilians in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry puts the toll at more 34,000 dead, though it doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians.Israel's military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said that despite the American pause, “we have what we need” to press ahead with the mission. His comments came after Netanayahu brushed Biden's threat, saying in a statement, ""If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone.”The U.S. has historically provided enormous amounts of military aid to Israel. The shipment that was paused was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) bombs and 1,700 500-pound (225-kilogram) bombs, according to a senior U.S. administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. The focus of U.S. concern was the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban area.“I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem,"" Biden said.“We’re not walking away from Israel’s security,"" the Democratic president continued. “We’re walking away from Israel’s ability to wage war in those areas.”U.S. officials had declined for days to comment on the halted transfer. Word about it came as Biden on Tuesday described U.S. support for Israel as “ironclad, even when we disagree.”Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, in an interview with Israeli Channel 12 TV news, said the decision to pause the shipment was “a very disappointing decision, even frustrating."" He suggested the move stemmed from political pressure on Biden from Congress, the U.S. campus protests and the upcoming election.The decision also drew a sharp rebuke from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who said they only learned about the holdup from press reports, despite assurances from the Biden administration that no such pauses were in the works. The Republicans called on Biden in a letter to swiftly end the blockage, saying it “risks emboldening Israel's enemies,” and to brief lawmakers on the nature of the policy reviews.Biden has faced pressure from some on the left and condemnation from the critics on the right who say Biden has moderated his support for an essential Mideast ally.“The American people support Israel overwhelmingly,” said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican, who pushed a resolution condemning Biden’s decision. “And they also believe that Israel needs to do what is necessary, and if that includes going into Rafah to root out the Hamas threat, then that is necessary for their very survival.”Former President Donald Trump, entering a New York courthouse for his criminal trial over hush money payments, criticized Biden as well, saying Thursday that “What Biden is doing with respect to Israel is disgraceful.” The presumptive GOP presidential nominee added, “If any Jewish person voted for Joe Biden, they should be ashamed of themselves. He’s totally abandoned Israel.”Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Biden ally, said in a statement the pause on big bombs must be a “first step.”“Our leverage is clear,” Sanders said. “Over the years, the United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Israel. We can no longer be complicit in Netanyahu’s horrific war against the Palestinian people.”Israeli troops on Tuesday seized control of Gaza’s vital Rafah border crossing in what the White House described as a limited operation that stopped short of the full-on Israeli invasion of the city that Biden has repeatedly warned against.Israel has ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from the city. Israeli forces have also carried out what it describes as “targeted strikes” on the eastern part of Rafah and captured the Rafah crossing, a critical conduit for the flow of humanitarian aid along the Gaza-Egypt border.The State Department is separately considering whether to approve the continued transfer of Joint Direct Attack Munition kits, which place precision guidance systems onto bombs, to Israel, but the review didn’t pertain to imminent shipments.","Biden last week put on hold a shipment of large bombs to Israel over concerns the weapons are of the type that has caused significant civilian casualties in Gaza. On Wednesday, he held out the possibility of holding up future shipments of bomb guidance kits and artillery to Israel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109989038,imgsize-168636,width-400,resizemode-4/109989038.jpg"

In response to this change, we modified the recording algorithm to be more sensitive to neural population signals, improved the techniques to translate these signals into cursor movements, and enhanced the user interface."""" These refinements produced a rapid and sustained improvement in BPS, that has now superseded Noland’s initial performance.""In a blog post, Neuralink said that in the weeks since Noland's surgery, he has used the link to control his laptop from various positions, including while lying down in bed.Noland played online computer games with friends (Chess, Civilization VI), browses the internet, live streams, and uses other applications on his MacBook, all by controlling a cursor with his mind. He has even used the Link to play Mario Kart on a Nintendo Switch console — something he had not been able to do since his spinal cord injury.""[The Link] has helped me reconnect with the world, my friends, and my family. It's given me the ability to do things on my own again without needing my family at all hours of the day and night,"" Noland said.Currently, the company's current work is focused on pushing cursor control performance to the same level as that of able-bodied individuals, and on expanding functionality to include text entry.

The HRCP demanded economic justice and protection of civil rights and stressed the importance of upholding democratic principles and the rule of law.In its annual report, 'State of Human Rights 2023', released on Wednesday, the HRCP noted with concern that irreparable political divisions led to public acts of arson and violence on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan.""What followed was flagrant disregard for the Constitution as unelected forces tightened their grip on the country's democratic structures and civic spaces shrank to an all-time low,"" the report read, according to Dawn.According to the report, the state's response to the May 9 riots was to quell dissent by resurrecting military courts to try civilians, perpetrating enforced disappearances, ordering mass arrests and allegedly orchestrating public disassociation from the PTI among many senior party leaders.The report noted that the right to freedom of expression and assembly took a particular hit during the year. According to the report, the rule of law was poor, with six-year high in fatalities related to terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations. The report noted that the practice of extrajudicial killings continued while street crime and the incidence of mob lynchings witnessed a rise.According to the report, journalists, activists and political workers were subjected to enforced disappearances across the country, like what happened in previous years, Dawn reported. The report noted that young Baloch women held a long march from Turbat to Islamabad to protest against alleged extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.The report said that religious minorities reported an increasing climate of fear, particularly following the attack in Jaranwala, in which scores of churches and homes were torched and looted by mobs after allegations of blasphemy against a Christian man.The report said that Afghan nationals were rounded up in police raids and sent to deportation centres. Speaking at the launch of the report, HRCP secretary-general Harris Khalique said the economic crisis in 2023 had 'pushed tens of millions of ordinary citizens to the brink of desperation.'Speaking on incidents of enforced disappearances, Harris Khalique condemned the role and performance of the Commission of Inquiry of Enforced Disappearances and termed it 'disgraceful,' Dawn reported.HRCP chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt called it critical for the state to fulfil people's rights to education, livelihood and health. He also expressed concern over the low rate of trade unionisation.

Pakistan SC suspends Peshawar HC order denying reserved seats to Imran-backed party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-sc-suspends-peshawar-hc-order-denying-reserved-seats-to-imran-backed-party/articleshow/109898987.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party aligned with candidates backed by incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities in the national and provincial legislatures.Since the Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was barred by the top court from contesting the Feb 8 elections under its traditional electoral symbol of a cricket bat on technical grounds, the party had subsequently struck an alliance with another party, Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), in an attempt to secure reserved seats in parliament.Under Pakistan’s election rules, political parties are allotted reserved seats — (there are 60 for women and 10 for minorities in the National Assembly) — in proportion to the number of parliamentary seats they win in the election. This completes the NA’s total strength of 336 seats.In March, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had ruled that SIC was not eligible for reserved seats and decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries. The verdict was rejected by PTI as unconstitutional and the alliance had filed a plea against the electoral watchdog’s decision in the Peshawar HC, but it rejected the appeal.In response, SIC moved the Supreme Court last month urging it to allot the party the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and set aside the Peshawar HC ruling.Accepting SIC’s appeal for a hearing, the apex court clarified that the Peshawar HC order upholding ECP’s decision was suspended to the extent of the remaining reserved seats distributed among other parties.After losing the extra reserved seats, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government had lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities.

"Pakistan wheat scam probe: Evasive response of govt raises concerns, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-wheat-scam-probe-evasive-response-of-govt-raises-concerns-says-report/articleshow/109853452.cms,"LAHORE: The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive, despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 's assurance to safeguard farmers ' interests, Dawn reported.While he has pledged unwavering support for farmers, the federal government's reluctance to thoroughly probe the alleged scam and hold accountable those responsible is palpable.Heading the fact-finding committee tasked with unravelling irregularities in the wheat import is Cabinet Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal. However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.
