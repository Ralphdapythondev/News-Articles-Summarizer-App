'How ABC moderators allow Harris to lie?'

Embarrassing moderators did pure work of bias

Trump wants ABC News banned on grounds of bias

After the heated debate between the presidential candidates vice president Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump , political analyst accused ABC News of being biased and giving soft treatment to the Democratic nominee over her flip, flop policy.Mark Halperin, a journalist and former political director at ABC News, alleged that the media was shielding Harris at all costs.He criticised the moderators' gentle handling of Harris' policy inconsistencies, calling it the ""biggest failure of the night.""During a livestream on his media platform 2WAY on Wednesday, Halperin said, ""Not only was one news organization fully on board to continue through Election Day protecting her at all costs, but we saw in the coverage of the debate, which was laughably uneven, no recognition that it was laughably uneven. In fact, mostly praise for how great a job ABC did.""He added, ""Bigger to me, was last night was the best — and if the Harris campaign continues to hide her, maybe only chance — to get her to explain her issue position changes. That to me was the biggest failure.""The perceived bias of ABC debate co-moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis drew criticism from various analysts. Megyn Kelly, a former presidential debate moderator, delivered her brutal review of ABC's 2024 presidential debate.In a post on X, she said, ""ABC's Bias, How Trump Could Have Played it, and Whether the Debate Sways Voters with @Kmele, @mcmoynihan and @MattWelch Plus, the left's over-the-top Taylor Swift Kamala endorsement reaction, Harris' 'medical misinformation' on abortion, and more.""While the debate was going on, Kelly posted a series of tweets slamming the moderators and Harris.""The absolute gall of ABC to keep “fact checking” ONLY Trump while letting her lie in every answer is infuriating,"" she said.In another post, she said, ""These moderators are a disgraceful failure and this is one of the most biased, unfair debates I have ever seen. Shame on you.""Several people on social media throughout the debate targeted Muir and Davis' for “one-sided” fact-checking.Donald Trump Jr. also hammered the moderators for only fact-checking Trump, but not Harris.“Weird how the hack moderators at @abcnews are only ‘Fact checking’ Trump and allowing Kamala to lie nonstop,” he wrote. “The Fake News is the enemy of the people!”Political commentator Noah Pollak called the moderators ""worst moderators in presidential debate history"" and their duty as ""pure work of bias.""""ABC hosts embarrassing themselves protecting Harris from having to answer whether she supports partial birth late term abortions,"" he said in a post on X.Earlier, Trump even complained the debate was rigged, with the moderators “correcting everything” he said while not challenging Kamala Harris.“I think ABC took a big hit last night. To be honest, they’re a news organization—they have to be licensed to do it. They ought to take away their license for the way they did that,"" he said.Senator Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) voiced frustration, tweeting, “ABC’s selective ‘Fact Checking’ is why no one believes biased ‘Fact Checking.’” Other conservatives, including Hogan Gidley, a former Trump White House spokesman, criticised the moderators for failing to challenge Harris on several key issues, leaving Trump to fact-check her claims himself.","Mark Halperin, a journalist and former political director at ABC News, alleged that the media was shielding Harris at all costs.

Residents describe storm as ‘little scary’

Third hurricane in US this year

Hurricane Francine hit Louisiana on Wednesday evening as a Category 2 storm, cutting power to roughly 190,000 customers and causing severe flooding along the Gulf Coast. The storm made landfall in Terrebonne Parish , southwest of Morgan City, with winds near 100 mph.Francine's eye made landfall at 5 pm CT in Terrebonne Parish, driving hurricane-force winds inland toward southern Louisiana near Baton Rouge.According to Morgan City Fire chief Alvin Cockerham, significant damage including flooded streets, downed power lines, and broken tree limbs was reported in Louisiana. “It’s a little bit worse than what I expected, to be honest with you,” he said. “It’s too dangerous to be out there in this.”The National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts that Francine will gradually turn northward, moving across southeastern Louisiana and southwestern and central Mississippi on Thursday. The storm's impacts could extend hundreds of miles outward, even as its center moves inland.Francine was the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and rapidly strengthened before landfall. The storm has increased the risk of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, with conditions expected to last into Friday morning.The National Hurricane Center advised residents to remain indoors as Francine moved inland. The storm was expected to pass near New Orleans and weaken as it travels northeast through Mississippi, bringing heavy rain and potential flash flooding to several cities. Brad Reinhart, a senior hurricane specialist, warned that some areas could see up to 12 inches of rain.Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said the National Guard would assist affected areas with food, water, vehicles, boats, and helicopters for search and rescue.President Joe Biden granted an emergency declaration for Louisiana, and states of emergency were declared by the governors of Louisiana and Mississippi.The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency distributed over 100,000 sandbags to the southern part of the state, and several schools were closed.Governor Landry said, ""After declaring a state of emergency, we have now determined that this storm is of such severity that an effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and local governments. This federal assistance is needed to save lives and property.""Airlines canceled flights into and out of Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport through Thursday morning.Coastal communities faced high waves, flooded streets, and strong winds. Power outages were widespread in southeast Louisiana, affecting coastal parishes and neighboring areas.Laura Leftwich , sheltering at her mother’s home, saw birdhouses swept away by the wind and shared video footage of street flooding with friends. “It’s a little scary,” she said.Resident Luis Morfin sought shelter at a friend’s home, leaving his camper outside the levee. “We knew what we were expecting,” he said.Francine is the third hurricane to hit the continental US this year. Earlier in the season, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in Matagorda, Texas, on July 8 as a Category 1 storm. Hurricane Debby followed on August 5, also as a Category 1 storm, hitting near Steinhatchee, Florida.A Tornado Watch was issued for much of Louisiana and southern Mississippi through Wednesday evening as storm bands moved in from the Gulf of Mexico.","Hurricane Francine hit Louisiana on Wednesday evening as a Category 2 storm.

Kamala makes expressions her weapon while Trump yells into mic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-makes-expressions-her-weapon-while-trump-yells-into-mic/articleshow/113275268.cms,"She turned to him with an arched brow. A quiet sigh. A hand on her chin. A laugh. A pitiful glance. A dismissive shake of her head. From the opening moments of her first debate against Donald Trump Kamala Harris craftily exploited her opponent's biggest weakness. Not his record. Not his divisive policies. Not his history of inflammatory statements. Instead, she took aim at a far more primal part of him: his ego.At his rallies, on his sycophantic social media network and surrounded by flatterers at Mar-a-Lago, Trump is unquestioned, unchallenged and never ever mocked.That changed over the course of 90 minutes in Philadelphia on Tuesday, when the woman who had never before met him succeeded, bit by bit, in puncturing his comfortable cocoon and triggering his annoyance and anger. Harris questioned the size and loyalty of the crowds at his rallies. And she claimed his fortune was built by his father, recasting a business mogul who proudly boasts of being a self-made man as just another nepotism baby.Harris warned that world leaders were ""laughing at Donald Trump"" and saw him as a ""disgrace"". And when she referred to his 2020 election loss as the moment he was ""fired by 81 million people"", he grew visibly angry. Then she stood by and watched, as Trump did himself a whole lot of damage. Trump expressed his feelings by yelling into the microphone.In answer after answer, the former prez reminded Americans of his role in so much of what many would rather forget: the deadly and devastating pandemic, his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election, a bloody siege on the US Capitol and the fall of Roe v. Wade. He lingered on his criminal charges and praised Viktor Orban, the strongman leader of Hungary. He defended a false claim that migrants in Ohio are eating their neighbours' dogs and cats and recycled years-old anti-abortion attack lines that Democrats supported ""execution after birth"".When Harris brought up his criminal convictions, Trump accused Democrats of turning the judicial system against him: ""I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me."" ""He is so easy to trigger,"" Governor Gavin Newsom of California, a Harris ally, said in the post-debate spin room.From the moment Harris crossed the stage to shake Trump's hand, the Democratic prez nominee made clear her intention to transform a night expected to be about her into a referendum on him. She displayed a composure and tactical restraint that was palpable through the television screen. Equally palpable was his fury, which at times seemed to make him unable to even look at his opponent. ""She's a Marxist - everybody knows she's a Marxist,"" Trump said when Harris accused him of coddling China during the pandemic. ""Her father is a Marxist professor in economics, and he taught her well."" Harris looked at him with a condescending smile, performatively leaning in to hear more. He's the former reality TV star, but she clearly understood the power of the medium. Her expression was her rebuttal.As the governors, senators, activists and political gadflies spun his performance in the post-debate spin room, a surprise guest suddenly appeared and was swarmed by more than 100 journalists. It was Trump. Prez candidates rarely - if ever - spin their own performances in the minutes after exiting the stage. But Trump couldn't let it go. ""It was,"" he said, ""my best debate ever.""

US aircraft carrier in the Middle East is heading home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-aircraft-carrier-in-the-middle-east-is-heading-home/articleshow/113274985.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Pentagon's rare move to keep two Navy aircraft carriers in the Middle East over the past several weeks has now finished, as the USS Theodore Roosevelt is heading home, according to US officials.US defense secretary Lloyd Austin had ordered the Roosevelt to extend its deployment for a short time and remain in the region as the USS Abraham Lincoln was pushed to get to the area more quickly.The Biden administration beefed up the US military presence there to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies and to safeguard US troops.US commanders in the Middle East have long argued that the presence of a US aircraft carrier and the warships accompanying it has been an effective deterrent in the region, particularly for Iran. Since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip began last fall, there has been a persistent carrier presence in and around the region - and for short periods they have overlapped to have two of the carriers there at the same time.Prior to last fall, however, it had been years since the US had committed that much warship power to the region.The decision to bring the Roosevelt home comes as the war in Gaza has dragged on for 11 months, with tens of thousands of people dead, and international efforts to mediate a cease-fire between Israel and the Hamas militant group have repeatedly stalled as they accuse each other of making additional and unacceptable demands.For a number of months earlier this year the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower remained in the Red Sea, able both to respond to help Israel and to defend commercial and military ships from attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. The carrier, based in Norfolk, Virginia, returned home after an over eight-month deployment in combat that the Navy said was the most intense since World War II.US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements, said the San Diego-based Roosevelt and the USS Daniel Inouye, a destroyer, are expected to be in the Indo-Pacific Command's region on Thursday. The other destroyer in the strike group, the USS Russell, had already left the Middle East and has been operating in the South China Sea.The Lincoln, which is now in the Gulf of Oman with several other warships, arrived in the Middle East about three weeks ago, allowing it to overlap with the Roosevelt until now.There also are a number of US ships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and two destroyers and the guided missile submarine USS Georgia are in the Red Sea.","US commanders in the Middle East have long argued that the presence of a US aircraft carrier and the warships accompanying it has been an effective deterrent in the region.

An Ohio city reshaped by Haitian immigrants lands in an unwelcome spotlight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/an-ohio-city-reshaped-by-haitian-immigrants-lands-in-an-unwelcome-spotlight/articleshow/113274741.cms,"SPRINGFIELD: Many cities have been reshaped by immigrants in the last few years without attracting much notice. Not Springfield , Ohio.Its story of economic renewal and related growing pains has been thrust into the national conversation in a presidential election year - and maliciously distorted by false rumors that Haitian immigrants are eating their neighbors' pets.Donald Trump amplified those lies during Tuesday's nationally televised debate, exacerbating some residents' fears about growing divisiveness in the predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000.At the city's Haitian Community Help and Support Center on Wednesday, Rose-Thamar Joseph said many of the roughly 15,000 immigrants who arrived in the past few years were drawn by good jobs and the city's relative affordability. But a rising sense of unease has crept in as longtime residents increasingly bristle at newcomers taking jobs at factories, driving up housing costs, worsening traffic and straining city services.""Some of them are talking about living in fear. Some of them are scared for their life,"" Joseph said.A ""Welcome To Our City"" sign hangs from a parking garage downtown, where a coffee shop, bakery and boutique line Springfield's main drag, North Fountain Street. A flag advertising ""CultureFest,"" the city's annual celebration of unity through diversity, waves from a pole nearby.Melanie Flax Wilt , a Republican commissioner in the county where Springfield is located, said she has been pushing for community and political leaders to ""stop feeding the fear.""""After the election and everybody's done using Springfield, Ohio, as a talking point for immigration reform, we are going to be the ones here still living through the challenges and coming up with the solutions,"" she said.Ariel Dominique, executive director of the Haitian American Foundation for Democracy, said she laughed at first at the absurdity of the false claims. But seeing the comments repeated on national television by the former president was painful.""It is so unfair and unjust and completely contrary to what we have contributed to the world, what we have contributed to this nation for so long,"" Dominique said.The falsehoods about Springfield's Haitian immigrants were spread online by Trump's running mate, JD Vance , on the eve of Tuesday's debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris . It's part of a timeworn American political tradition of casting immigrants as outsiders.""This is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame,"" Trump said at the debate after repeating the falsehoods. When challenged by ABC News moderator David Muir over the false claims, Trump held firm, saying ""people on television"" said their dogs were eaten, but he offered no evidence.Officials in Springfield have tried to tamp down the misinformation by saying there have been no credible or detailed reports of any pets being abducted or eaten. State leaders are trying to help address some of the real challenges facing the city.Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine , a Republican, said Tuesday he would add more law enforcement and health care resources to an aid package the state has already provided to Springfield.Many Haitians have come to the US to flee poverty and violence. They have embraced President Joe Biden 's new and expanded legal pathways to enter, and have shunned illegal crossings, accounting for only 92 border arrests out of more than 56,000 in July, the latest data available.The Biden administration recently announced an estimated 300,000 Haitians in the US could remain in the country at least through February 2026, with eligibility for work authorization, under a law called Temporary Protected Status. The goal is to spare people from being deported to countries in turmoil.Springfield, about 45 miles from the state capital of Columbus, suffered a steep decline in its manufacturing sector toward the end of the last century, and its population shrank as a result. But its downtown has been revitalized in recent years as more Haitians arrived and helped meet the rising demand for labor as the economy emerged from the pandemic. Officials say Haitians now account for about 15% of the population.The city was shaken last year when a minivan slammed into a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy. The driver was a Haitian man who recently settled in the area and was driving without a valid license. During a city commission meeting on Tuesday, the boy's parents condemned politicians' use of their son's death to stoke hatred.Last week, a post on the social media platform X shared what looked like a screengrab of a social media post apparently out of Springfield. The post claimed without evidence that the person's ""neighbor's daughter's friend"" saw a cat hanging from a tree to be butchered and eaten, outside a house where it claimed Haitians lived. It was accompanied by a photo of a Black man carrying what appeared to be a goose by its feet.On Monday, Vance posted on X: ""Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country."" The next day, he posted again, saying his office had received inquiries from Springfield residents who said ""their neighbors' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants.""Long-time Springfield resident Chris Hazel, who knows the park and neighborhood where the pet and goose abductions were purported to have happened, called the claims ""preposterous.""""It reminds me of when people used to accuse others and outsiders as cannibals. It's dehumanizing a community,"" he said of the accusations against the city's Haitian residents.Sophia Pierrilus , the daughter of a former Haitian diplomat who moved to the Ohio capital of Columbus 15 years ago and is now an immigrant advocate, agreed, calling it all political.""My view is that's their way to use Haitians as a scapegoat to bring some kind of chaos in America,"" she said.With its rising population of immigrants, Springfield is hardly an outlier. So far this decade, immigration has accounted for almost three-quarters of US population growth, with 2.5 million immigrants arriving in the United States between 2020 and 2023, according to the US Census Bureau. Population growth is an important driver of economic growth.""The Haitian immigrants who started moving to Springfield the last few years are the reason why the economy and the labor force has been revitalized there,"" said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, which provides legal and social services to immigrants across the USNow, she said, Haitians in Springfield have told her that, out of fear, they are considering leaving the city.","Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, account for about 15% of the city's population.

He inherited a country plagued by hyperinflation and guerrilla violence, which he addressed through bold economic reforms and the defeat of the Shining Path rebels.However, his government collapsed in 2000 due to a corruption scandal involving his spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos . Fujimori sought exile in Japan, his parents' country of origin, and later faced arrest in Chile and extradition to Peru.In 2009, Fujimori was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights crimes, becoming the first democratically elected Latin American president to be convicted of such offenses in his own country, Reuters reported.The charges stemmed from his role in ordering military death squads to carry out two massacres that claimed 25 lives during his presidency, amidst the conflict with communist guerrillas that resulted in nearly 70,000 deaths over two decades in Peru.He had been pardoned in December. Despite his conviction, Fujimori's daughter announced in July that he planned to run for Peru's presidency for the fourth time in 2026.“My father and I have talked and decided together that he will be the presidential candidate,” Keiko Fujimori, leader of the right-wing Fuerza Popular party, said on social networks, as per AP news agency.However, Peruvian law prohibits individuals found guilty of corruption from running for the office of president or vice president.","Alberto Fujimori, the former president of Peru, has died at the age of 86 after a prolonged battle with cancer.

In a notable moment during Tuesday night’s presidential debate, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump shared a handshake, marking their first face-to-face meeting in the campaign.As the debate began, both candidates took the stage for what was their initial direct encounter. Initially, Trump seemed to head towards his podium without acknowledging Harris, who was approaching the center of the stage.In a gesture of politeness, Harris altered her path to meet Trump at his podium, extending her hand.“Kamala Harris. How are you?” Harris greeted.“Nice to see you, I'm fine,” Trump responded as he shook her hand.“Let’s have a good debate,” Harris replied.The handshake signified the end of an eight-year period without handshakes on the presidential debate stage. Although there are no formal rules or stipulations requiring such gestures, this exchange added a touch of civility to the high-stakes political confrontation.Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced off for the first time in what might be their only debate before the November presidential election, offering a dramatic glimpse into their contrasting visions for the country. The debate came after a tumultuous summer for both candidates and presented a critical opportunity to sway undecided voters.The encounter provided Americans with their clearest view yet of a campaign that has shifted significantly since the last debate in June, which saw President Joe Biden withdraw from the race. Harris immediately targeted Trump, linking him to the conservative Project 2025 agenda and GOP efforts to restrict abortion access, while also criticizing his inflammatory rhetoric.Trump countered by questioning Harris’s effectiveness as vice president and attacking her handling of illegal migration. He made several contentious claims about migrants, including an assertion that they are “taking jobs” from African Americans and Hispanics. Harris, seemingly unfazed, responded with a smirk when Trump repeated baseless accusations about immigrants.The debate took place in a small, blue-lit amphitheater turned television studio, devoid of a live audience, which minimized the typical noise of applause or jeers. The close proximity of the candidates’ lecterns highlighted the intensity of the debate.Following the June 27 debate, which led to Biden’s exit from the race, Trump survived an assassination attempt, and both sides finalized their running mates. This debate, hosted by ABC News, represents a rare instance of sustained questioning for Harris, who has given only one formal interview in the past six weeks.Early ballots for the presidential race are set to be distributed just hours after the debate, with absentee ballots beginning to go out in Alabama on Wednesday.",Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced off for the first time in what might be their only debate before the November presidential election.

"'America's no. 1 condom' allegedly contains cancer-causing 'forever chemicals,' lawsuit claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/americas-no-1-trojan-condom-allegedly-contains-cancer-causing-forever-chemicals-lawsuit-claims/articleshow/113207169.cms,"Study reveals PFAS contamination in condoms and lubricants

PFAS absorption through skin higher than previously thought

A new lawsuit claims that Trojan condoms, marketed as ""America's No. 1 Condom,"" contain toxic ""forever chemicals"" linked to cancer. Plaintiff Matthew Goodman filed the proposed class action in Manhattan federal court, alleging that the condoms contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are harmful to health. PFAS , known for their persistence in the environment and human body, are used in many consumer products for their non-stick and water-resistant properties.Goodman claims lab tests of Trojan Ultra Thin condoms revealed the presence of organic fluorine, a marker for PFAS, and that these chemicals are not disclosed on the packaging. He argues that had he known about the presence of these chemicals, he would not have purchased the product or would have paid significantly less. The lawsuit seeks at least $5 million in damages for customers nationwide who purchased Trojan condoms.PFAS exposure has been linked to several health issues, including cancer, low birth weights, and reduced immune response. Church & Dwight, the manufacturer, has not yet responded to requests for comment following the lawsuit.A study by consumer advocacy group Mamavation has uncovered potential contamination of condoms and lubricants with PFAS, or ""forever chemicals."" The EPA-certified lab testing found traces of PFAS in 14% of the 29 products tested, including Trojan Ultra Thin condoms. The tests detected organic fluorine, a sign of PFAS, in 3 out of 25 condom samples and 1 out of 4 lubricants. These chemicals are widely used for their water, oil, and stain-resistant properties but are persistent and toxic.The contamination is believed to stem from manufacturing processes, where PFAS may be unintentionally introduced into the products. Linda Birnbaum , a scientist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, raised concerns about exposure in sensitive areas of the body, saying, ""The vagina and penis are highly vascular areas, making them more vulnerable to the effects of toxic chemicals.""Mamavation has called for the condom industry to take action to remove PFAS from these products, stressing that the full health risks of exposure in intimate areas are not yet known. Consumers are encouraged to seek safer alternatives while manufacturers work on addressing potential contamination.Recent research, titled Dermal bioavailability of perfluoroalkyl substances using in vitro 3D human skin equivalent models, has shown that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can be absorbed through the skin at higher levels than previously believed. In the study, human skin models were exposed to 17 different PFAS compounds, and certain chemicals, such as perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), had the highest absorption rates, at 58.9% and 48.7%, respectively.Shorter-chain PFAS, particularly those with carbon chains of eight or fewer atoms, showed greater absorption compared to longer-chain variants, which tend to accumulate in the skin rather than being directly absorbed. The study also suggested that factors like skin pH could influence how PFAS penetrate the skin.

Political responses:

Current status:

Allexis Telia Ferrell , a 27-year-old from Canton, Ohio , has become a controversial figure following her recent arrest for allegedly killing and consuming a cat. The disturbing case has not only sparked outrage but also fueled an unusual online trend involving Donald Trump memes.Ferrell was arrested on September 6, 2024, after witnesses reported that she stomped on a cat’s head before eating it in front of residents.Charged with animal cruelty , including injuring animals, prohibitions concerning companion animals, and disorderly conduct, Ferrell’s bond was set at $100,000.The case has generated significant media attention and public outcry. Right-wing social media accounts have bizarrely linked Ferrell's actions to unfounded claims about illegal Haitian migrants consuming pets and wild birds in Springfield, Ohio. This connection has led to the creation of AI-generated memes depicting Donald Trump holding cats and ducks, reflecting the surreal nature of the situation.In response to the controversy, Trump’s campaign issued a statement that read, “President Trump will deport migrants who eat pets. Kamala Harris will send them to your town next. Make your choice, America.” This statement highlights the campaign’s use of sensationalist narratives to rally support.JD Vance , Trump’s running mate and Ohio Senator, also reacted to the situation. “Months ago, I raised the issue of Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio,” Vance tweeted. He continued, “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.”Ferrell remains in custody as her case progresses through the legal system. The unusual combination of a disturbing criminal case and viral political memes continues to draw significant attention and debate.","Allexis Telia Ferrell, 27, was arrested for allegedly killing and consuming a cat.

Rare 12th-century picture stone discovered in Germany featuring Christian imagery; read on to find out more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rare-12th-century-picture-stone-discovered-in-germany-featuring-christian-imagery-read-on-to-find-out-more/articleshow/113250765.cms,"Picture stone: Key features and historical significance



Purpose and future of the picture stone



Also Read |

In a remarkable archaeological discovery, a homeowner in Klotzow, Germany, has unearthed a rare 12th-century "" picture stone "" while conducting construction work. This ancient artefact, known as a ""bildstein,"" is a valuable addition to the limited number of such stones found along the Baltic coast of Germany and Poland, with only about 20 having been discovered to date.The intricately carved stone features a detailed depiction of a figure believed to be Otto of Bamberg , a prominent bishop known for his role in spreading Christianity throughout the Pomerania region.Otto, who lived from 1060 to 1139, was instrumental in the Christianization of what is now modern-day Germany and Poland and, and was noted for his diplomatic and religious influence in the area.The carving on the stone includes a figure dressed in a cap, shawl, and robe, and holding what appears to be a banner. A distinctive cross etched onto the shawl suggests that the figure could be a high-ranking religious official. This detail aligns with historical records indicating that Otto of Bamberg was known to have worn a pallium—a special garment granted to archbishops and bishops—when he received one from Pope Paschal II in 1111. The pallium’s presence in the carving supports the theory that the stone depicts Otto.The precise purpose of these mediaeval picture stones remains a topic of scholarly debate. They might have served as memorials or tombstones commemorating important individuals of the time. Given the religious symbolism of the cross on this particular stone, it is likely that it was intended to honour a significant figure in the Christianization of the region.Following further analysis, the stone is set to be permanently displayed in Klotzow, providing the local community and visitors with an opportunity to explore this important piece of mediaeval history. The discovery not only enhances the understanding of the Christianization process in Pomerania but also sheds light on mediaeval religious art and practices.","A homeowner in Klotzow, Germany, has unearthed a rare 12th-century "" picture stone "" This ancient artefact, known as a ""bildstein,"" is a valuable addition to the limited number of such stones found along the Baltic coast of Germany and Poland.

The detentions followed alleged violation of norms during the rally.In a separate development, Ali Amin Gandapur , chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) from Imran’s PTI, went missing from Islamabad for eight hours Monday and emerged in his provincial capital Peshawar Tuesday.Sources revealed Gandapur was in the custody of an intelligence agency and added that the CM of the northwestern province was quizzed for hours before his release early Tuesday.Gandapur came under fire for a tirade against the military during PTI’s protest-cum-power show Sunday in Islamabad’s suburbs. “Fix your institution, fix your generals, fix yourself. If the founder of PTI (Imran) is not legally released within one to two weeks, we will have him freed ourselves,” the CM vowed.While several PTI lawmakers apologised for Gandapur’s remarks, Imran defended him, saying he had merely expressed the nation’s sentiments. “Party members who have apologised for Gandapur’s remarks are weak and cowards. They should not remain in PTI,” Imran was quoted as saying at his prison in Rawalpindi.Last week, the federal govt passed a law to “regulate” public gatherings in Islamabad. It set three-year jail terms for participants of “illegal” assemblies, with 10 years for repeat offenders. The Islamabad administration had allowed PTI’s Sunday’s rally from 4pm till 7pm, but the gathering went on until 11pm. “They were arrested due to violation of the new law,” Islamabad police spokespersonTaqi Jawad said, referring to PTI arrests, including that of chairman Gohar Khan .Since his removal from power in April 2022, Imran and his PTI have waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against the military.The PTI says it has faced a months-long crackdown since protesters allegedly linked to the party attacked and damaged govt and military installations on May 9, 2023, after Khan’s brief arrest that day in a land graft case. Hundreds of PTI arrests followed. Many remain behind bars. The military, which says Imran and his party were behind the attacks, has initiated army court trials of at least 103 people accused of involvement in the violence.In Feb this year, Imran and PTI were barred from the national election, which was alleged to have been rigged. Candidates aligned with the party, forced to contest independently, still won most seats in parliament but not enough to form the govt. PTI alleged that its mandate was “stolen” by PM Shebaz Sharif’s governing coalition with the all-powerful military’s backing. Both deny the claim.",Several leaders and lawmakers of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) detained. The detentions followed alleged violation of norms during the rally.

Imran Khan’s party leaders arrested in Pakistan after violent protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khans-party-leaders-arrested-in-pakistan-after-violent-protests/articleshow/113205117.cms,"What does the new law say

Several top leaders of Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad. The arrests included barrister Gohar Khan, Sher Afzal Marwat, and advocate Shoaib Shaheen, following a violent clash between PTI supporters and police during a protest demanding Khan's release. The arrests have been widely condemned by PTI as politically motivated.PTI has vehemently opposed the arrests, calling them a ""direct attack on democracy."" In posts on X (formerly Twitter), the party criticised the government's actions, arguing that the arrests are an attempt to suppress their movement.PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari condemned the detentions as ""illegal"" and said, ""These arrests won’t change anything; they will only increase public anger against this puppet government.""Omar Ayub Khan, another senior PTI figure, also denounced the arrests and revealed that police had been forming teams to apprehend him and other top PTI members, including Zartaj Gul Wazir . ""This fascist regime has gone completely mad... We will continue raising our voices for our leader, PM Imran Khan ,"" he wrote on X.Despite the crackdown, many PTI lawmakers remained inside Parliament House to avoid arrest, and more detentions are expected in the coming days. The Islamabad high court bar association has also condemned the arrests, demanding the release of Marwat and Shaheen, both respected members of the legal community.The arrests occur amidst growing political tension in Pakistan. Imran Khan, who has been imprisoned since 2022 on corruption charges, remains a central figure in the country's political landscape. His supporters’ continued protests and the government’s aggressive response have only heightened the political discord.The arrests were made under the newly enacted Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Bill, 2024. This legislation, which came into effect just before the PTI rally, empowers authorities to regulate and ban public gatherings in Islamabad. Under this law, the district magistrate can disband any assembly deemed likely to disturb public peace, with penalties including up to three years in prison or fines. Repeat offenders face even harsher penalties, potentially extending to 10 years of imprisonment. The PTI leaders were accused of violating these regulations by inciting their supporters to clash with police during the protest.","Top leaders of Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad.

At least 16 more Taliban members were wounded in the clash, the second since last week along one of the 18 border crossings linking Pakistan's Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces with Afghanistan in the southwest and northwest.Confirmation of the Taliban casualties by Pakistan's state-owned media contrasted with a statement by Afghanistan that unprovoked firing and shelling from across the border caused civilian deaths and displacement.Pakistan said the fighting started after the Taliban attempted to illegally set up a checkpoint near the border. Light and heavy weapons were used by both sides, officials said.“Afghan Taliban opened unprovoked firing with heavy weapons yesterday from inside Afghanistan, targeting Pakistani checkpoints,"" Radio Pakistan reported Monday. ""Pakistani security forces responded effectively and killed eight Afghan Taliban, including commanders Khalil and Jan Muhammad .""Scores of families along the Durand Line, the 2,640km border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, have fled their homes due to repeated clashes between the Islamic Emirate forces and the Pakistani military.""We have two casualties, one of them a woman, and about 11 wounded,"" Thamin Khan , a resident of Zazi Maidan district, was quoted as saying by official Afghan media.""Bullets struck our homes and it is unclear what will happen next. This situation has caused problems for us, forcing many to migrate,"" Mohibullah, another resident of the conflict zone, said.Videos circulating on social media showed heavy gunfire in the area.Khost's deputy governor directed residents and the forces stationed along the Durand Line to respond appropriately to any attacks, while the Afghan deputy minister for borders and tribal affairs said in Kabul that the latest dispute had been resolved. Pakistan military's media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations, hadn't responded to the claim till late Monday.Clashes between Afghan Taliban and Pakistani forces have occurred frequently along the Durand Line, a disputed border, in recent years, often resulting in casualties on both sides.Of the 18 border crossings, Chaman and Torkham are the busiest. Clashes often lead to closure of these border crossings, disrupting trade and movement of people. The Torkham border has been shut for the past three days after Afghan Taliban announced they were investigating reports of Pakistani fighter jets violating Afghan airspace to patrol Nangarhar and Kunar provinces.Pakistani officials have accused the Afghan Taliban of sheltering the banned militant group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

How costly is a cup of tea in Kabul? Ask Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/how-costly-is-a-cup-of-tea-in-kabul-ask-pakistan-terrorism-ttp-imran-khan-taliban-afghanistan/articleshow/113190988.cms,"'Missteps by Imran Khan govt'



Strategy backfires

NEW DELHI: In an unusual critique of the military establishment, Pakistan 's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three-star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism throughout the country.In September 2021, as the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan after the sudden pullout of US troops in August, then ISI chief general Faiz Hameed had visited Kabul and was photographed enjoying tea, during which he assured a journalist that ""everything will be fine"" -- a pivotal point in Pakistan's military and intelligence strategy towards Afghanistan.""The country is paying a price for that cup of tea in Afghanistan,"" said Dar, without naming Hameed.The deputy PM further said that the decision by the general to release some militants was the reason behind increased attacks across Pakistan. ""Those released at that time are masterminding terrorism in Balochistan today,"" he said, indicating there is a widely held belief that the decisions made by military leaders during this period were not only misguided but have also contributed to the current instability in Pakistan.Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, made the rem­a­rks during a press conference at the Pakistan High Commi­ss­i­on in London.Stating that the 2021 visit to Kabul could not have happened without the permission of former PM Imran Khan, Dar hit out at the ""mistakes"" made by the ousted leader, particularly in relation to economic and security decisions, and linked the former administration's ""missteps"" to the current rise in terrorism and economic challenges.""I find it difficult to accept that he [Hameed] could have gone without the permission of the prime minister [Imran Khan]. We are working with the security establishment on issues today, these things are not possible without the PM's approval,"" said Dar.After criticising military officials of the ""past"", Dar was quick to praise the curr­ent military establishm­ent.""They cannot be praised en­o­ugh as its members are very professional. Their agenda is Pakistan, as is ours. This is a very good omen. They are not interested in who comes in government or opposition,"" he said.The Taliban's rise to power was initially seen by some in Pakistan as a potential boon, with expectations that the group would help curb the activities of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has long posed a threat to the Pakistani state.However, the reality has proven to be quite different, with the TTP intensifying its attacks since the Taliban's takeover, undermining the very stability that Pakistan hoped to achieve through its support of the Taliban.The situation in Balochistan is particularly alarming. The province has witnessed a significant uptick in violence, with attacks attributed to both the TTP and other militant groups.The Pakistani military's response has included increased operations against these groups, but the effectiveness of these measures remains in question. Dar's comments suggest a recognition that past decisions, particularly those made by military leaders like Hameed, have directly contributed to the current security crisis.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three- star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism.

The rally - postponed twice in the last two months - was held near Sangjani Cattle Market in the suburbs of Islamabad after the capital administration issued a no-objection certificate (NOC).Thousands of PTI supporters attended the rally, proving that the party's power base was intact despite several hurdles it faced, including the incarceration of its 71-year-old founder.Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been in jail in different cases. On Sunday, Khan completed 400 days in prison.The rally was scheduled to end at 7 pm (local time) as per the NOC. As soon as the deadline ended, the district administration directed the police to take action against the rally-goers for not complying with the NOC.The authorities stated that the organisers violated the rules and regulations by not concluding the gathering before the deadline.In response to the crackdown, PTI workers began pelting stones at police, injuring many security personnel, including Senior Superintendent of Police Shoaib Khan .""Strong turnout for PTI rally despite the state's tactics to limit numbers through roadblocks and containers, and despite the risk of violent crackdowns and arrests. Its size and popularity ensure its mobilization capabilities remain intact despite relentless attempts to curb it,"" Micheal Kugleman, a South Asian expert, said in a post on X.Several PTI leaders addressed the gathering, demanding Khan's immediate release. PTI leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan said the party would not sit until Khan was released.""We are soldiers of Imran Khan and will not sit until he is set free,"" he said, adding that soon Khan would be with his supporters.He condemned physical hurdles put on roads to restrict the movement of participants and also announced that the PTI would now hold rallies across the country.It was the first major rally by the PTI in Islamabad since the February 8 elections. The party wants to exert pressure on the government to release Khan, who languishes in jail despite the courts either acquitting him or giving him bail in all cases he was convicted.PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said the government turned the city into a cage, but still thousands of people attended the rally. ""It shows that Imran Khan is a reality, and you will have to accept it...Imran Khan is a leader and will always be a leader,"" he said.He told the participants that Khan was their only leader who never surrendered and would never surrender. He warned that the PTI would not accept new cases against Khan.Gohar said that the PTI planned this rally for six months and followed Khan's instructions to hold the rally after getting permission from the government. He criticised the government for introducing a new law to restrict political activities.Slogans were raised during the rally demanding Khan's release from jail.He ended his speech with the promise that ""Imran Khan will be soon out of jail and with his people"".The key speech was made by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur who came from Peshawar, leading a large number of Khan's supporters from the province.In his emotional address, he vowed to continue the struggle for the rights of people. He said those who put Khan in jail were being humiliated while ""Khan is winning in jail"".He said that the government gave permission for the rally and blocked all roads leading to the venue of the rally. ""Imran Khan you have won while all others lost,"" he said, vowing to go to any length for Khan.He also announced to hold the next rally in Lahore, irrespective of whether the government gives permission or not.Gandapur also rejected that Khan would be tried under army law, saying no one could do it.Khan has repeatedly shown a willingness to hold talks with the establishment while refusing to sit with the government. So far, all his tactics have failed to get any relief. Mass protest is an option, but his party has been facing pressure to avoid it.Today's rally was a test for both the government and the PTI as it will help them gauge the ground power swell for Khan and fine-tune their policies and tactics in the coming days.Sources told PTI that the Islamabad administration put security on high alert this morning and blocked off multiple arteries leading to the capital city. Hospitals were put on alert by the administration. The Metro bus services were stopped in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Addressing the rally, former minister Hammad Azhar said the hindrance created by the rulers showed that they were afraid of Khan and his supporters.He pointed out that most of the party's Punjab leadership is in jail, paying tribute to incarcerated leaders, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Umar Sarfraz Cheema .Another leader Sher Afzal Marwat said they will soon hold rallies in Punjab for Khan's release and the supremacy of law and the Constitution.""We will enter Punjab with 50,000 people from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa within a week,"" he said, adding that they will even set off on foot and face the tear gas.Additional forces have been summoned to the location where the clash between the police and party workers originally started.Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law the Public Order and Peaceful Assembly Bill 2024 hours before the planned rally, instituting strict measures for unauthorised gatherings.The new law introduces penalties for holding gatherings without permission in Islamabad, with violators facing up to three years in prison and fines.

IG Islamabad and tout government should STOP playing with people's lives. This is highly disgusting and shameful, the people sent a huge message today!"" the party added.The rally, which had faced multiple delays due to revoked permissions, finally commenced on the outskirts of Islamabad on Sunday. Despite being denied permission several times earlier, the PTI brought together supporters from across the province, as reported by Dawn.Addressing the rally, senior PTI leader Hammad Azhar said that the gathering was a stand for the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution in Pakistan. ""We will, God willing, secure Imran Khan's release,"" Azhar said, adding that no obstacle would deter their cause.The rally had originally been scheduled for July, then postponed to August, before being further delayed due to security concerns cited by authorities. PTI has been pushing for Imran Khan’s release since his imprisonment in August.Although Khan’s conviction in the Iddat case was recently overturned, his release was blocked by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), which arrested him in connection with a new Toshakhana case shortly after. His previous Toshakhana sentences were suspended, and he was also acquitted in the cipher case by the Islamabad high court.PTI has been trying to secure permission for a public meeting in Islamabad for several months, but the district administration has repeatedly denied their requests, citing security risks. The party even approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in March for approval.In July, PTI announced another protest , but the district administration revoked their non-objection certificate (NOC) at the last moment, delaying the rally until September 8. Despite preparations for the event, the capital police blocked major entry points to the city, citing intelligence reports of a ""medium-level"" terrorism threat linked to the gathering.Senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser decried the government’s preventive measures, including the placement of containers and police blockades. ""It is unfortunate that this fascist government with a stolen mandate is creating such a hostile environment,"" Qaiser said in a video message posted on X.

Speaking to a private news channel Geo News, Asif said, ""Evidence against the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) points towards military trial.""Imran Khan has been embroiled in numerous legal cases, including one related to the May 9 riots, where military installations were attacked.Fearing prosecution in a military court, Khan filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking to halt the trial. However, the IHC raised concerns about the petition's validity, citing the absence of a specific first information report (FIR) or supporting documentation.Khan's petition comes amid ongoing legal debates. In December 2023, Pakistan's Supreme Court , in a 5:1 majority ruling, suspended an earlier decision that declared civilians' military trials unlawful. This ruling, tied to the May 9 riots, has left the final decision on military trials pending the court's verdict on intra-court appeals filed by the federal and provincial governments and the defence ministry.Asif also commented on former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, who he claimed aspired to become Pakistan's army chief. Asif alleged that Faiz had reached out to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) seeking support for his bid, offering loyalty in exchange. Faiz, currently facing allegations of land grabbing, was arrested by the army in August.""General (retd) Faiz wanted to become army chief, his name was on the list. He contacted the PML-N leadership in this regard and assured of his loyalty against support for his bid for army chief,"" said Asif.He further noted that Faiz's frustrations grew after the appointment of the current army chief. Asif suggested that Faiz may now try to deflect blame onto others, adding, ""He [Faiz] might say that even if he was part of the conspiracy then the objectives [of conspiracy] were of the PTI founder's and not his.""Meanwhile, Imran Khan, who is currently detained in Adiala Jail, has warned of protests if the government undermines the judiciary's independence. In a message shared on social media, Khan said, ""Pakistan's army belongs to everyone – to the whole nation – not just one political party or the army chief. They robbed the election and are now not allowing the judiciary to function independently.""Khan also criticised the treatment of Pakistan's current leadership in prison, claiming they enjoyed preferential conditions compared to him. ""I have not spent a single day at the prison hospital,"" he said, contrasting his treatment with that of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and others, who, according to him, had access to air-conditioned rooms with en-suite bathrooms during their time in custody.","Khawaja Asif says evidence against Imran Khan points towards military trial.

On both occasions, the military had publicly denied direct involvement, saying indigenous Kashmiri rebels were fighting Indian forces.In 1999, however, thousands of paramilitary Northern Light Infantry regulars, drawn exclusively from Gilgit-Baltistan and skilled in high-altitude combat, were sent to occupy military posts that Indian troops would vacate in the snowy months.They established positions on the heights and commanded a view of the Srinagar-Leh highway, a major supply route for Indian troops stationed on the Siachen glacier.When India detected the incursion in early May 1999, Pakistan had claimed they were Kashmiri militants fighting Indian rule.According to observers, Pakistan had sent troops to Kargil to cut Indian supplies to Siachen, inflict heavy losses on Indian troops and pressure them into negotiating a settlement of the Kashmir dispute on Pakistani terms. Since Islamabad had conducted nuclear tests a year earlier, Pakistani generals were expecting a muted response from India.But the Indians hit back hard, sending infantry backed by artillery and air support. By mid-June the Pakistani positions on the hills began to fall. There were also international calls for Pakistan to withdraw its forces. Evidence suggested the Pakistani military leadership had not shared details of the Kargil operation with the govt of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif . On July 4, Sharif was forced to announce a unilateral ceasefire. His govt was toppled in a military coup two months later.India had reconquered the Kargil heights by July 26. It lost more than 500 troops in the war, while estimates of Pakistani losses range from 400 to about 4,000. Thousands of people made homeless by the war are displaced in Pakistan to this day.","Pakistan's military had attempted on at least two occasions to send its forces into Kashmir to start a rebellion against Indian rule.

The discovery could potentially offer a drastic boost to the nation's economy, according to a Pakistani senior security official quoted by DawnNewsTV.The official explained that the survey has successfully identified the location of the reserves, and relevant government bodies have been informed.These resources, located in the depths of Pakistani waters, represent a critical step towards capitalising what the official referred to as the "" blue water economy .""While this discovery could lead to a major boost for Pakistan’s energy sector, the process of exploration is still in its early stages.The work of digging wells and actually getting oil out could take several years. The official also talked about the potential of the blue water economy, pointing out that valuable minerals and elements could be extracted from the ocean, providing additional economic benefits for Pakistan.Estimates suggest that this discovery could be among the world’s largest oil and gas reserves , potentially placing Pakistan as the holder of the fourth-largest deposit globally.Venezuela currently leads in terms of oil reserves, with approximately 3.4 billion barrels, followed by countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Canada, and Iraq. The US is also notable for holding the most significant untapped shale oil reserves.In an interview with DawnNewsTV, Muhammad Arif, a former member of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) said that while the discovery is a positive development, there is no guarantee the reserves will be as large or easily recoverable as initially hoped.He said, ""If this is a gas reserve, it can replace LNG imports and if these are oil reserves, we can substitute imported oil.""The significant financial investment needed to explore offshore oil and gas reserves, estimating the cost at around $5 billion just for exploration, further claimed Arif.","A significant deposit of petroleum and natural gas has been discovered within Pakistan's territorial waters. The discovery could potentially offer a drastic boost to the nation's economy. The process of exploration is still in its early stages, and the work of digging wells and actually getting oil out could take several years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113155173,imgsize-37516,width-400,resizemode-4/113155173.jpg"
"Watch: In a first, Pakistan army admits involvement in 1999 Kargil War",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/watch-in-a-first-pakistan-army-admits-involvement-in-kargil-war/articleshow/113150376.cms,"Operation Vijay in response

NEW DELHI: In a first, Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War , during a recent defence day speech. Previous army chiefs and political leaders, such as Pervez Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif, have acknowledged Pakistan's involvement in the Kargil operation.According to several media reports, General Munir -- while addressing a ceremony at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi to mark the country's 59th Defence Day, said: ""Be it 1948, 1965, 1971 or 1999 Kargil war, thousands of Shuhadas (martyrs) have sacrificed their life for the country and nation.""This marks the first time a serving army chief has openly admitted to the army's direct role in a conflict that has long been shrouded in denial and controversy in Pakistan.The audio of the video, which has been circulated widely online, has not been independently verified.For years, Pakistan's military and political leadership has maintained a narrative that distanced itself from the Kargil operations, often referring to the infiltrators as mere ""Kashmiri freedom fighters"".India has, however, repeatedly said that the operation was a calculated military strategy aimed at altering the Line of Control (LoC) and asserting Pakistan's claim over Kashmir.The Kargil War was characterised by its high-altitude combat and brutal conditions, taking place in one of the most challenging terrains on Earth.The Pakistani military's strategy involved infiltrating troops disguised as militants into Indian territory, occupying strategic heights that overlooked key supply routes.The operation was intended to disrupt Indian logistics and draw international attention to the Kashmir issue, thereby internationalising the longstanding conflict.In strong retaliation to the Pakistan 'infiltrators', between mid-May and July 1999, the Indian Armed Forces gradually recaptured critical positions from the Pakistani infiltrators. The Kargil War officially concluded on July 26, 1999, when the Army announced the complete eviction of Pakistani forces from Indian soil.Over two months, intense battles took place in the challenging mountainous terrain. The Indian Army, as part of Operation Vijay, managed to drive out Pakistani intruders and successfully recaptured Tiger Hill and other strategic positions.","Pakistan army chief publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War.

He expressed his delight at attending PM Modi 's event and described his visit as a ""success"" for the Maldives and the region.Relations between India and the Maldives have been strained since Muizzu became president.

"The Taliban's repression of women in Afghanistan is outrageous, the UN rights chief says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/the-talibans-repression-of-women-in-afghanistan-is-outrageous-the-un-rights-chief-says/articleshow/113201830.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Taliban's repressive control over women and girls in Afghanistan is unparalleled and will jeopardize the country's future, the UN rights chief warned Monday.Volker Turk said new morality laws that ban women's voices and bare faces in public, along with sweeping bans on education and most jobs, were outrageous and amounted to systematic gender persecution.""I shudder to think what is next for the women and girls of Afghanistan,"" Turk told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. The Taliban were not immediately available for comment.The Taliban - who took over Afghanistan in 2021 during the final weeks of US and Nato withdrawal - have excluded women from most areas of public life and stopped girls from going to school beyond sixth grade, despite initial promises of a more moderate rule.They are also restricting women's access to work, travel and health care if they are unmarried or don't have a male guardian, and punishing those who don't comply with the Taliban's interpretation of hijab, or Islamic headscarf.The Taliban last month issued the ban on women's voices in public under new laws approved by the supreme leader in efforts to combat vice and promote virtue.""I want to make clear my abhorrence of these latest measures, which include forbidding even eye contact between women and men who are not related and imposing mandatory covering for women from head to toe, including their faces,"" Turk said.Taliban policies are propelling Afghanistan further down a path of isolation, pain and hardship, he added.Last year, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the country needs $4.62 billion in aid for nearly 24 million people in need. The Taliban takeover drove millions into poverty and hunger after foreign aid stopped almost overnight.Sanctions, a halt on bank transfers and frozen billions in Afghanistan's currency reserves restricted access to global institutions and the outside money that supported the country's aid-dependent economy before the withdrawal of US and NATO forces.The situation for children was especially devastating, with 12.4 million children in desperate need, Turk said, but a massive shortfall in funding was ""sharply undercutting"" the response by the UN and its partners.Another speaker at the council session was Richard Bennett , the UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Afghanistan. Bennett has frequently criticized the Taliban's treatment of women and girls. Last month, he confirmed he was no longer allowed to visit the country.In his first address since being barred from Afghanistan, Bennett said the morality laws reinforced the Taliban's institutionalized system of sex and gender discrimination, segregation and oppression and affected almost the entire population."" Unaddressed , the repercussions will shape future generations,"" he said.Bennett said he had talked to Afghans in several provinces who had described a visible increase in the presence of morality inspectors as well as tightening restrictions, in particular on people's freedom of movement.""We have also received information that barbers are instructed not to shave men's beards shorter than the specified length, while the ban on broadcasting of images of human beings is impacting the media,"" he said.Afghan media have reported that the Vice and Virtue Ministry has stopped female journalists from working in Daikundi province and administered a religious test to government employees, warning they risk dismissal if they do not participate.There have also been reports that the state-controlled broadcaster RTA has stopped airing in Kandahar province, the Taliban's power center in the south and the base of its leader Hibatullah Akhundzada , because morality laws prohibit the depiction of living beings.The Taliban have not responded to requests for comment on the reports.","Taliban's control over women and girls in Afghanistan is unparalleled, says UN rights chief. Volker Turk says new morality laws that ban women's voices and bare faces in public are outrageous. He says sweeping bans on education and most jobs are systematic gender persecution.
