Want to bet on US elections? This last-minute ruling has changed gambling rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/want-to-bet-on-us-elections-this-last-minute-ruling-has-changed-gambling-rules/articleshow/114162153.cms,"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris (R)

Millions of dollars are being bet on the outcome of the US presidential election after a court ruling opened the door for legal political gambling , raising the stakes in an already tense and closely contested race.With just weeks to the D-Day, November 5 vote, election contracts on platforms like Interactive Brokers are heating up, following a Washington court decision that allowed a startup, Kalshi , to offer election betting despite ongoing legal appeals.By Friday, contracts for a Harris victory were trading between 48 and 50 percent, making it a near 50-50 split between Harris and Trump . More than $6.3 million has already been gambled on this matchup alone.This comes on the heels of the October 2 ruling, which marks a pivotal moment in a long-standing regulatory battle over the legality of political betting in the United States.Offshore markets, which have operated outside US regulators' purview, have seen even larger sums, with more than $1.7 billion already placed on the Harris-Trump race through platforms like Polymarket. There, Trump holds a slight edge with 54 percent support versus 45 percent for Harris.Supporters of election betting, or ""event contracts,"" argue that these markets offer a financial hedge against potential outcomes, akin to futures trading. ""These contracts allow people to take a position on what they think is going to happen and manage their risk accordingly,"" saidSteve Sanders , executive vice president at Interactive Brokers, which has already seen more than a million contracts traded in a matter of days.However, critics warn against widespread election gambling, especially in a politically polarised climate rife with disinformation. During recent court proceedings, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) General Counsel Rob Schwartz raised concerns about the potential for misinformation to fuel bets.""We live in a country where tens of millions believe the last election was stolen,"" Schwartz said, highlighting the risks of undermining public trust in election integrity .Despite these concerns, the court allowed betting to continue while the legal case against Kalshi moves forward. Judge Patricia Millett acknowledged the need for election integrity but said the CFTC hadn’t shown enough evidence that election contracts would cause harm.While the legal fight goes on, political betting markets will likely stay open through Election Day, which could influence the future of legal gambling in the US. For advocates like Pratik Chougule, co-founder of the Coalition for Political Forecasting, the court's decision is a big win. ""It's been a good year for political betting,"" he said, hopeful that legal election markets will continue to grow.Further court rulings may close political betting again, but this is unlikely to happen before the November 5 election, keeping the markets active for now.","More than $6.3 million has already been gambled on the Harris-Trump race alone.

National Coming Out Day: Los Angeles recognises October 11 as National Coming Out Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/los-angeles-recognises-october-11-as-national-coming-out-day/articleshow/114162099.cms,"Representative Image (Picture Credit: Reuters)

Los Angeles made a significant move by officially recognising October 11 as a National Coming Out Day , after Philadelphia in celebration of this important occasion.The date becomes significant as it commemorates the anniversary of the second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, which took place in 1987 amid the early days of the AIDS crisis, as quoted by ABC News.This day aims to foster a safe and inclusive environment for the LGBTQ+ community, where all individuals can openly express their true identities without any fear of judgment.The proclamation comes after anti-LGBTQ+ legislation is on the rise across the United States, with the ACLU reporting over 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced in state legislatures for the 2024 session.“Even in California, often viewed as a progressive state, we’re seeing concerning incidents of anti-gay and anti-trans rhetoric,” said Los Angeles City Council member Nithya Raman.“It’s vital that we create spaces where everyone feels safe and accepted,” she added.National Coming Out Day was founded in 1988 by activists Jean O'Leary and Robert Eichberg. Los Angeles has played a key role in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, notably with the opening of The Black Cat , a gay bar, in 1966. This happened during the time when same-sex relationships were still illegal in California.The bar became the site of a violent police raid on New Year's Eve that sparked protests against anti-LGBTQ+ violence and discrimination.Today, the Black Cat stands as a symbol of resilience and progress in the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ rights.","National Coming Out Day was founded in 1988 by activists Jean O'Leary and Robert Eichberg.

"Residents slog through flooded streets, clear debris after Hurricane Milton tore through Florida",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/residents-slog-through-flooded-streets-clear-debris-after-hurricane-milton-tore-through-florida/articleshow/114161893.cms,"Del Ockey, a seasonal Florida resident from Canada, walks near the damaged bridge from Hurricane Milton, that leads onto his property, Friday, October 11, 2024, in Riverview, Fla. (AP)

LITHIA: Florida residents slogged through flooded streets, gathered up scattered debris and assessed damage to their homes on Friday after Hurricane Milton smashed through coastal communities and spawned a barrage of deadly tornadoes.At least 10 people were dead, and rescuers were still saving people from swollen rivers, but many expressed relief that Milton wasn't worse.The hurricane spared densely populated Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized.Gov. Ron DeSantis warned people to not let down their guard, however, citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing water that could hide dangerous objects.""We're now in the period where you have fatalities that are preventable,"" DeSantis said. ""You have to make the proper decisions and know that there are hazards out there.""About 2.2 million customers remained without power in the state, according to poweroutage.us. St. Petersburg's 260,000 residents were told to boil water before drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth, until at least Monday.Also Friday, the owner of a major phosphate mine disclosed that pollution spilled into Tampa Bay during the hurricane.The Mosaic Company said in a statement that heavy rains from the storm overwhelmed a collection system at its Riverview site, pushing excess water out of a manhole and into discharges that lead to the bay. The company said the leak was fixed Thursday.Mosaic said the spill likely exceeded a 17,500-gallon minimum reporting standard, though it did not provide a figure for what the total volume might have been.Calls and emails to Mosaic seeking additional information about Riverview and the company's other Florida mines received no response, as did a voicemail left with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.The state has 25 such stacks containing more than 1 billion tons of phosphogypsum, a solid waste byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer mining industry that contains radium, which decays to form radon gas. Both radium and radon are radioactive and can cause cancer. Phosphogypsum may also contain toxic heavy metals and other carcinogens, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel.Florida's vital tourism industry has started to return to normal, meanwhile, as Walt Disney World and other theme parks reopened. The state's busiest airport, in Orlando, resumed full operations Friday.Arriving just two weeks after the devastating Hurricane Helene, Milton flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays ' baseball stadium and toppled a construction crane.Crews from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office on Friday were assisting with rescues of people, including a 92-year-old woman, who were stranded in rising waters along the Alafia River. The river is 25 miles (40 kilometers) long and runs from eastern Hillsborough County, east of Tampa, into Tampa Bay.In Pinellas County, deputies used high-water vehicles to shuttle people back and forth to their homes in a flooded Palm Harbor neighborhood where waters continued to rise.Ashley Cabrera left with her 18- and 11-year-old sons and their three dogs, Eeyore, Poe and Molly. It was the first time since Milton struck that they had been able to leave the neighborhood, and they were now headed to a hotel in Orlando.""I'm extremely thankful that we could get out now and go for the weekend somewhere we can get a hot meal and some gas,"" Cabrera said. ""I thought we'd be able to get out as soon as the storm was over. These roads have never flooded like this in all the years that I've lived here.""Animals were being saved, too. Cindy Evers helped rescue a large pig stuck in high water at a strip mall in Lithia, east of Tampa. She had already rescued a donkey and several goats after the storm.""I'm high and dry where I'm at, and I have a barn and 9 acres,"" Evers said, adding that she will soon start to work to find the animals' owners.In the Gulf Coast city of Venice, Milton left behind several feet of sand in some beachfront condos, with one unit nearly filled. A swimming pool was packed full of sand, with only its handrails poking out.Some warnings were heeded and lessons learned. When 8 feet (2.4 meters) of seawater flooded Punta Gorda during Hurricane Helene last month, 121 people had to be rescued, Mayor Lynne Matthews said. Milton brought at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) of flooding, but rescuers only had to save three people.""So people listened to the evacuation order,"" Matthews said.Heaps of fruit were scattered across the ground and trees toppled over after both Milton and Hurricane Helene swept through Polk County and other orange-growing regions, Matt Joyner of trade group Florida Citrus Mutual said Friday.Milton arrived at the start of the orange growing season, so it is still too early to evaluate the full scope of the damage.Florida has already seen orange production diminish over the years, with the industry still recovering from hurricanes of years past while also waging an ongoing battle against a deadly greening disease. Milton could be the knockout punch for some growers, Joyce said.In the western coastal city of Clearwater, Kelvin Glenn said it took less than an hour early Thursday for water to rise to his waist inside his apartment. He and seven children, ranging in age from 3 to 16, were trapped in the brown, foul floodwaters for about three hours before an upstairs neighbor opened their home to them.Later that day, first responders arrived in boats to ferry them away from the building.""Sitting in that cold, nasty water was kind of bad,"" Glenn said.Short-term survival is now turning into long-term worries. A hotel is $160 a night. Everything inside Glenn's apartment is gone. And it can take time to get assistance.""I ain't going to say we're homeless,"" Glenn said. ""But we've got to start all over again.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency has enough money to deal with the immediate needs of people impacted by Helene and Milton but will need additional funding at some point, FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said Friday.The disaster assistance fund helps pay for the swift response to hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. Congress recently replenished the fund with $20 billion - the same amount as last year.","The owner of a major phosphate mine disclosed that pollution spilled into Tampa Bay during the hurricane.

US Coast Guard: Watch: Captain clings to cooler for 8 hours in sea before getting rescued during Hurricane Milton,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-captain-clings-to-cooler-for-8-hours-in-sea-before-getting-rescued-during-hurricane-milton/articleshow/114161340.cms,"US Coast Guard rescue helicopter (Picture Credit: X)

As Hurricane Milton struck Florida, a fishing boat captain was stranded for 8 hours in the Gulf of Mexico . The captain faced extreme conditions in the sea before finally being rescued by the US Coast Guard .The captain, whose name was not released, went out early at around 3 am on Wednesday to repair his broken boat ‘Captain Dave,’ as reported by the Washington Post.Around noon, the boat’s owner reported to the Coast Guard that the captain hadn’t checked in. “Watchstanders were able to make radio contact with the captain who reported the rudder was fouled with a line and became disabled during his transit back to port,” the US Coast Guard agency said in the release.The fishing vessel earlier in the week had broken down some 20 miles off John’s Pass in Pinellas County, and the captain and another crew member were rescued from it on Monday, but the vessel was left with salvage arrangements to be made.At that time, the Coast Guard reported winds of around 30 mph and waves reaching 6-8 feet. As conditions worsened with Hurricane Milton approaching, Coast Guard officials instructed the captain to wear alife jacket and keep the boat's emergency beacon close to ensure he could be located.However, by 6:45 pm, roughly two hours before Milton made landfall 20 miles south of John’s Pass, the Coast Guard lost contact with him. The Coast Guard launched a tedious search and rescue operation at around 5:30 am on Thursday, deploying airplane and helicopter crews.After a harrowing night of survival, the captain was found clinging to a cooler 30 miles off Longboat Key, around 1:30 pm on Thursday, more than 8 hours later after contact was lost.“This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,” Lt. Cmdr. Dana Grady, the Coast Guard’s command center chief in St. Petersburg, Fla., said in a news release.The unnamed captain survived the extreme conditions in an incredibly dangerous situation. “He experienced the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph winds, 20-25 foot waves, for an extended period of time to include overnight,” Grady said in the release.“He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler,” Grady said.","A fishing boat captain was stranded for 8 hours in the Gulf of Mexico as Hurricane Milton struck Florida.

US President Joe Biden , on Friday, updated the press on the federal response to recent hurricanes while making some light-hearted jokes about his Cabinet members. He stressed the administration's focus on restoring power and clearing debris in affected states, jokingly calling Energy secretary Jennifer Granholm his ""boss"" and referring to vice president Kamala Harris as ""the president.""During the briefing, Biden acknowledged the severe toll the hurricanes have taken on states such as North Carolina and Florida .""Our hearts go out to all those folks who've lost not only personal property, but their homes and some lost lives and are grieving after the aftermath of the tornadoes, brutal wind, record downpours and historic flooding,"" he said, as quoted by Fox News. Hurricane Milton has caused an estimated $50 billion in damages, while North Carolina officials confirmed at least 92 fatalities from Hurricane Helene . In Florida, eight people were reported dead after Milton spawned four tornadoes in St Lucie County, with millions of residents still without power.Biden praised the efforts by Florida governor Ron DeSantis , which enabled 50,000 power line workers to restore electricity to 1 million customers. The president assured that the federal government, through FEMA , the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Guard, is fully engaged in rescue and recovery efforts.During his speech, Biden paused briefly before Granholm reminded him to pass the microphone to the vice president. He grabbed Granholm's hand and said, ""She's my boss here,"" before jokingly correcting himself when he referred to Harris as ""the president.""Before giving the floor to Harris, Biden confirmed his administration would seek additional funding from Congress for hurricane recovery . ""We're going to need a lot of help. We need a lot more money,"" he said.Vice President Harris, speaking via teleconference, outlined the federal efforts to deliver food, water, medical supplies, and generators to affected areas. She also mentioned her talks with Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about preventing price-gouging in disaster zones.""We continue to coordinate resources with local and state authorities, including food, water, medical supplies and generators,"" Harris said, assuring that the administration would ""work with teams on the ground to restore water and power as quickly as possible in the coming days and weeks.""Harris added, ""President Biden and I will make sure that the communities that are there on the ground and have been affected will have the resources they need not only to respond to the storm, but also to recover.""Harris's comments come amid tension with governor DeSantis, who refused her call about the hurricane response , saying she had ""no role"" in the process.""We are in this for the long haul,"" she said, reaffirming the administration’s dedication to recovery efforts in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.","US President Joe Biden updated the press on the federal response to recent hurricanes.

In Kitsap County , Washington , 911 calls about loose livestock and troublesome pets are not unusual. However, a recent call from a woman near Poulsbo about being surrounded by 50 to 100 raccoons drew significant attention. The situation became so overwhelming that the woman ultimately fled her property.The story began a decade ago when she started feeding a family of raccoons and it was fine until about six weeks earlier, but when the number showing up went from a handful to around 100 it became a problem.The woman said, “Over time those raccoons became more aggressive, demanding food, they would hound her day and night — scratching at the outside of her home, at the door. If she pulled up her car, they would surround the car, scratch at the car, and surround her if she went from her front door to her car or went outside at all.”“They saw this as a food source now, so they kept coming back to it and they kept expecting food,” she added.The sudden increase in the raccoon population remains unclear, but both the sheriff's office and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife confirmed that the woman did not break any law while feeding those raccoons, as it is illegal in the state to feed large carnivores such as coyotes and bears.“This is a nuisance problem of her own making that she must address,” said Kevin McCarty, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office.Deputies who responded said that there were at least 50 to 100 raccoons present on her property.After consulting with a wildlife conflict specialist , the woman has stopped feeding the raccoons, and they have started to disperse.","A woman in Kitsap County, Washington, received a call about a large group of raccoons on her property.

A dog found tied to a fence on a Florida highway during evacuations ahead of Hurricane Milton is now recovering at a rescue facility in Tallahassee, the Leon County Humane Society has confirmed.The dog was spotted by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper on Wednesday along Interstate 75 near Tampa, standing in rising floodwater that had already reached its belly. Video footage showed the distressed dog barking as the trooper approached.""I don’t blame you,” the trooper said. “It’s OK, buddy, it’s OK"", as quoted by Fox59 News.After rescuing the animal, the Florida Highway Patrol issued a plea to residents, urging them not to abandon pets during evacuations. “Do NOT do this to your pets, please,” the agency wrote in a post.The incident gained national attention. A representative from the Leon County Humane Society later confirmed the dog was safely under their care. “We know that without the help of Florida Highway Patrol Troopers, this dog would not have made it through,” the Humane Society said in a message posted on its Facebook page. “We’re grateful the Troopers understood he was a scared and abandoned dog and treated him so patiently and kind during the rescue.”The dog has since been named “Trooper” to honour those who saved him. Although Trooper is safe, the Humane Society said he remains stressed and is “still decompressing.” Full recovery could take months.The organisation strongly condemned the act of abandoning animals during emergencies. “It was cruel and thoughtless, not only toward him, but toward the people trying their best to handle the incoming storm,” read the Facebook post.The Humane Society has received numerous adoption inquiries but will not be accepting applications until Trooper is fully rehabilitated. “We want to be sure we know exactly what he needs before even considering adoption,” they wrote, confirming the dog will remain in foster care until fully ready for a new home.","Dog was found tied to a fence on a Florida highway during evacuations ahead of Hurricane Milton.

Trump: Trump to face women-only audience in Fox News Town Hall amid gender polling gap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-to-face-women-only-audience-in-fox-news-town-hall-amid-gender-polling-gap/articleshow/114158548.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump

Former US President Trump is set to participate in a Fox News town hall next week, aimed exclusively at female voters , as he attempts to expand his appeal among a demographic he has traditionally struggled to win over.The event will be recorded on Tuesday in Cumming, Georgia, and will air on Wednesday morning. It will be moderated by Harris Faulkner, a seasoned interviewer who has spoken with Trump multiple times.“Women constitute the largest group of registered and active voters in the United States, so it is paramount that female voters understand where the presidential candidates stand on the issues that matter to them most,” Faulkner said.Fox News has also invited vice president Kamala Harris to participate in a similar forum. Harris has confirmed her attendance at a live town hall hosted by CNN on October 23, following Trump’s refusal to debate her on that date.Despite his popularity among male voters, Trump lags behind Harris among women, according to recent polling . An ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted after the September 10 debate showed Harris leading Trump by 9 percentage points among female voters, 53% to 44%. A New York Times/Siena College poll revealed an even wider gap, with Harris at 53% and Trump at 42% among women. On the other hand, Trump holds a big advantage among men, garnering 56% support to Harris's 39%.","The event will be recorded on Tuesday in Cumming, Georgia, and will air on Wednesday morning.

A family in New York City sued a funeral home after their mother’s casket was allegedly sent to the wrong country for burial, as reported by Fox News .Carmen Maldonado , who passed away shortly after her 96th birthday, was meant to be laid to rest in Ecuador beside her husband. However, her children claim the Rivera Funeral Home in Corona mistakenly sent her body to Guatemala .“The family was absolutely devastated and in shock,” said Phil Rizzuto, the family’s attorney.The family discovered the error through a TikTok video featuring a family in Guatemala who were stunned to find Maldonado’s body during a funeral for their son. According to Rizzuto, both bodies had been prepared by Rivera Funeral Home.“The funeral home led them to believe their mother’s body was still in the building in Queens, and they were making excuses as to why there was a delay in transporting her to Ecuador,” Rizzuto explained. Initially, the funeral home denied the family’s claims, but they later admitted the mistake after being shown the video.Maldonado’s son had to fly to Guatemala to retrieve her body and bring it back to Ecuador for burial. Rizzuto expressed frustration, stating, “They minimized it, and they told them it was no big deal. You know, it was just a mistake.”The family is suing Rivera Funeral Home and its parent company for their alleged misconduct. Rizzuto said, “A mistake is one thing, but to then try to cover it up is … a whole other level of misconduct.”",Carmen Maldonado was meant to be laid to rest in Ecuador beside her husband.

Lewellen and her boyfriend, Dewey Bennett , faced the difficult task of getting to a hospital while bracing for the approaching storm, as reported by NBC News .The storm hadn’t yet made landfall, but water was already seeping into their home when Lewellen’s contractions began.At 39 weeks pregnant, they knew they needed to act quickly, fearing that flooded roads would prevent them from reaching the hospital in time. “I just didn’t want to go through what I had to go through with the last hurricane back in 2017,” said Bennett, whose father had died after emergency services couldn’t reach him during the storm.While contemplating evacuation to West Palm Beach , which was hit by nine tornadoes , they decided to stay put. When Lewellen’s contractions intensified after 4.5 hours of labour at home, they went to Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Venice. “My mum was driving us, and it was extremely windy,” Lewellen said, adding that few cars were on the road due to the dangerous conditions.Once at the hospital, Lewellen's mother wasn’t allowed to stay with her due to hospital restrictions. “I was very upset that my mum couldn’t stay because she’s my best friend,” she said. They managed to stay connected via FaceTime throughout much of the labour.As the hurricane intensified, Lewellen watched from her hospital window as strong winds battered Sarasota. “I was telling him, ‘Oh, that tree looks like it’s going to fly out of the ground!’” she said. The tree eventually uprooted, heightening the tension of the night.Problems arose when doctors informed Lewellen that her baby was in the wrong position, requiring an emergency C-section . A failed epidural left her in severe pain until she was given anaesthesia. “I was very scared. If I didn’t have the doctors and nurses I had, it would’ve been a lot worse,” she said.At 11.45 pm, Dewey Lester Bennett IV was born, an 8-pound baby boy. Bennett said, “My cheeks hurt because I haven’t stopped smiling.”Despite the storm, Lewellen and Bennett were elated by their newborn’s safe arrival. Holding their son for the first time, Lewellen described it as “the most indescribable feeling.” Reflecting on the birth, she added with a smile, “He is a miracle baby .”","22-year-old Kenzie Lewellen went into labour at 4 am on Wednesday in Port Charlotte, Florida.

Maladroit in Detroit: Trump trashes MoTown in weird Michigan gambit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maladroit-in-detroit-trump-trashes-motown-in-weird-michigan-gambit/articleshow/114156707.cms,"WASHINGTON: MAGA megaphone Donald Trump 's maverick campaign style came to the fore again on Thursday when he dumped on Detroit while speaking to the Detroit Economic Club , warning that the famed motor city will be doomed if Kamala Harris becomes president.In fact, he went further. “Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president. You’re going to have a mess on your hands,"" Trump said in the largest city in Michigan, a battleground state that is crucial to his White House prospect.Polls show him tied within the margin of error in Michigan, and disquiet over Democrats' stand on the middle-east among the state's 300,000 Arab-American community centering around nearby Dearborn was thought to give Trump a chance to win. Some analysts think he may have blown it, with one political operative saying it is like someone ""calling us ugly and then asking us out on a date.""Detroiters did not take kindly to the slight. ""I represent Detroit in Congress. Detroit is a city with a booming economy, diverse culture, and some of the best people in America,"" snapped back Shri Thanedar, the Indian-American Congressman from the 13th Congressional district that includes Detroit, asking Trump to ""keep Detroit and our people out of your mouth.""“This is the greatest city in the country & we’ve bounced back after Trump killed our jobs, closed our businesses, & tried to throw out our votes. #Detroit threw Trump out of the White House last time and we’ll do it again,"" the state's House Speaker Joe Tate said. Kamala Harris too pitched in, saying Trump's trashing of another great American city a ""further evidence on a very long list of why he is unfit to be president.""But such bluntspeak is part of Trump's campaign shtick, one that includes painting much of urban America as a dystopian hellscape that only he can rescue. He has said this about San Francisco, New York, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia, among other cities, and even further, called the US ""a stupid country run by stupid people.” All the cities have large black and minority populations.Trump put-down of Detroit came when he was pledging to restore its once famed reputation as the center of automobile world. While the so-called Motown has lost much of its mojo with automobile production moving across the border to Canada and Mexico, and further afield to China and India, the city has been bouncing back in recent years, reporting the first increase in population in decades this year as manufacturing trickles back.In another rambling speech that lasted almost two hours, Trump also griped about Barack Obama getting a Nobel Peace Prize and he not getting one, and boasted about getting Michigan's Man of the Year award some 20 years ago, berating the media for questioning his claim by pulling out a paper clipping from a local newspaper that showed an even more minor award given by the local unit of the Republican Party.Trump though threw out more financial largesse aimed at winning votes, pledging to make interest on car loans fully tax deductible.","'Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president.

Harris is dressed in a Gabriela Hearst suit and wears her now-famous Tiffany earrings , which previously sparked conspiracy theories during her debate with former President Donald Trump, with some claiming they were disguised audio devices.In the article, Vogue highlights Harris' rise in politics, calling her someone “summoned for acts of national rescue” after President Joe Biden decided to end his reelection campaign. “With President Joe Biden’s decision to end his reelection campaign, the world looked to Harris with hopes and doubts,” the profile says.Recalling the moment Biden informed her of his decision, Harris said she had been making pancakes with her nieces when the president’s call came through. “It’s Joe Biden,” she remembered telling her family, adding that it was “a dramatic turn to the day"", as quoted by the New York Post .Harris shared that she couldn’t immediately reach her husband, Doug Emhoff , who was in Los Angeles when flights were grounded due to a computer glitch. “I’m like, ‘Where is he? Somebody find him! Why isn’t he answering?’” she said, eventually learning he was working out.The vice president also discussed her campaign plans, revealing she intends to prioritise lowering costs for Americans. “One of my first calls — outside of family — will be to the team that is working with me on our plan to lower costs for the American people,” Harris told Vogue.","US vice president Kamala Harris appeared on the cover of Vogue's October digital issue.

Minority Report: Obama chides 'bros' for ditching Kamala while she woos the hombres,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/minority-report-obama-chides-bros-for-ditching-kamala-while-she-woos-the-hombres/articleshow/114154464.cms,"WASHINGTON: Amid concern in Democratic quarters about waning support from young black men for Kamala Harris , former President Barack Obama came out swinging for his protege on Thursday, urging ""brothers"" to overcome the sexism that appeared to be holding them back from supporting her.Campaigning for Harris in Pennsylvania, where black vote will be a big factor if she is to win, Obama took a paternal big brother approach as he chided young black men for their hesitation in accepting the idea of having a woman as President, reminding them that “when we get in trouble and the system isn’t working for us, they’re the ones out there marching and protesting.”Obama's sharp rebuke came amid surveys indicating one in four black men under 50 support Donald Trump over Kamala Harris, compared to the over 90 per cent support Obama had.Even Joe Biden polled better (80 percent +) among blacks than Harris, who commands 90 percent plus among black women, but is seen losing ground among black men, particularly the younger demographic. Blacks constitute about 14 percent of the voting population in the US.In a blunt message to black men, Obama chided them for thinking about sitting out or supporting ""somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable."" Harris, he said, understands the struggles and pain and joy of black men, unlike Trump, who is hardly likely to care for them when he remained unmoved when his own vice-president was threatened with hanging.Obama also challenged the MAGA narrative of Trump as an economic genius, reminding voters that he had handed over a good economy with 75 straight months of job growth after spending eight years cleaning up the mess that the Republicans had left him. ""Yeah, it was pretty good, because it was my economy. It wasn't something he did,"" Obama said. He also pushed back on the immigration issue, saying Trump had four years in the White House to solve the problem but he has no plans to do so other than use it as a wedge issue to divide people.While Obama was pitching for the black vote for her, Harris was in Nevada to woo Latinos, who are also less chuffed about her although she still leads Trump among the demographic. A Pew Research Center poll shows her ahead of Trump among Latinos by 16 per cent -- 54-38. In 2020, exit polls showed Biden beating Trump by 33 percent, 65-32. Of the seven battleground states, two -- Nevada and Arizona -- have large Latino votes that can swing the election. Some surveys show Trump ahead in Nevada by as much as 5 percent (considered a safe bet outside the margin of error), mainly on account of his wooing the hospitality industry with his ‘no tax on tips” pledge in a state with more than 350,000 hospitality jobs.In a Las Vegas town hall hosted by the Spanish tv network Univision, Harris carefully threaded the delicate line on immigration -- a key issue for Latinos -- between an “orderly and humane pathway to earned citizenship for hardworking people” and tough border policing. She also addressed health care and pocketbook issues that are weighing on women, even as the Trump campaign, in continued social media warfare between the two sides, ridiculed her purported dependence on teleprompters for answers. It turned out the teleprompter was there only to help translate questions from Spanish.","Obama chides young black men for their hesitation in accepting the idea of having a woman as President.

The body of a Seattle woman was found inside a suitcase at a homeless encampment , which raised concerns about the dangers of these sites across the United States, as reported by Fox News.Shannon Reeder , a 37-year-old mother, had been missing since November 2023. Her remains were discovered by police on 27 September 2024, in a suitcase near a pile of rubbish at an encampment by Seattle’s Dr Jose Rizal Park, while authorities were clearing the area.Police are now investigating the circumstances surrounding her death.“Detectives are working with those who knew her to put together a timeline of her movements prior to her death,” the Washington State Patrol said. They have urged anyone with information to contact investigators, as they continue to explore whether Reeder died at the camp or elsewhere.According to the National Institutes of Health, violent crime rates are 40 times higher in homeless populations. Washington state has already closed 47 encampments in five counties since 2022, but the problem persists, with more than 31,000 homeless individuals across the state. King County , where Seattle is located, reported 14,149 homeless people during a 2023 count, making it the third-highest homeless population in the country after New York City and Los Angeles.Mark Powell , a former reserve police officer in San Diego, condemned the lack of control over these camps. “There are campsites all over the state of Washington, in California – every state has campsites and there are rules and regulations in the campsites… none of those rules apply [in homeless encampments],” he told Fox News Digital.He continued, “Somebody placed her in a suitcase and left her to die or left her to rot in the middle of an encampment. You would never see that happen anywhere else – you can’t just bury a person in your backyard.”Crisis counsellor Scott Silverman, who works with homeless veterans, described the camps as unsafe for vulnerable groups. ""Living in an encampment is not a safe thing for anybody… especially women, children and seniors because they’re easily targeted.""Homeless encampments have also been linked to public health crises , with diseases such as hepatitis A, typhus, and tuberculosis spreading due to unsanitary conditions. Silverman and other officials stress that without regular supervision, these camps will remain a serious threat to the homeless and nearby communities.","Shannon Reeder, a 37-year-old mother, had been missing since November 2023.

The major event is expected to see high-level Chinese representation and will also be attended by Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Incessant violent incidents in Pakistan’s northwest and southwest have raised serious questions about the ability of its forces to protect high-profile events and foreigners in the country.The assailants, according to police, broke into the miners’ quarters in Balochistan’s Dukki district, gathered the workers together and opened indiscriminate fire. “A group of armed men attacked the Junaid coal company mines in Dukki area in the early hours using heavy weapons,” said Humayun Khan Nasir, in charge of Dukki police station. The victims belonged to various regions of Pakistan, as well as Afghanistan. “Most of the victims were from Pashtun-speaking regions within Balochistan. Three of the deceased and four of the injured are Afghan nationals,” Nasir added.Khairullah Nasir, the coal mine owner, said the attackers used hand grenades, rocket launchers, and other modern weapons in the attack. He added the attackers also set fire to “10 coal engines and machinery”.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which often targets civilians and security forces, accusing them of robbing Balochistan of its resources, including minerals and gas.The BLA had carried out multiple attacks in Aug that resulted in more than 50 killings, including that of 23 passengers, mostly from Punjab province, who were shot dead after being taken out of their vehicles. On Monday the group had claimed responsibility for a suicide bomber attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers near Karachi airport. Two Chinese citizens were killed in that attack.There are hundreds of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in projects linked to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

Amidst the deteriorating relationship, Pakistani border troops and Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in a clash while the former country's forces engaged in fence repair work.The incident occurred after the Afghan side launched an attack on a border post in the Naushki-Ghazni sector of the Pak-Afghan border , as reported by The Express Tribune. In response, the Pakistan Army launched a strong counterattack on the Afghan checkpoints, resulting in significant casualties for the Afghan Taliban.The Pakistani newspaper's sources suggested that Pakistan would continue to take robust measures to defend its borders, and its security forces reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the country's territorial integrity, delivering a decisive response to this aggression from Afghanistan.This incident was not an isolated case of unprovoked aggression from Afghan forces. In the previous month, the Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing using heavy weapons, targeting Pakistani check posts from the Afghan region of Plosin. The fighting that took place during the night between September 8 and 9 resulted in the death of at least 16 Afghan Taliban fighters and the injury of 27 others.The Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 2021, allegedly with the support of Pakistan, which had hoped that they would eliminate the threat of militancy emanating from their soil. However, for Pakistan, such hopes turned out to be an illusion as the Afghan Taliban failed to uproot the hideouts of Pakistan Taliban from their territory, leading to an increase in attacks against Pakistan and souring ties between Islamabad and Kabul.","Pakistani border troops and Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in a clash while the former country's forces engaged in fence repair work.

ISLAMABAD: The JUI-F has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition on a proposed constitutional amendment , according to a media report on Wednesday. The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has claimed that the decision to table the 'Constitutional Package' in Parliament had been postponed by the government at its request, The Dawn newspaper reported.The paper quoted sources in the party as saying that the stance regarding opposition to the amendment had not changed, calling the matter ""disputed"".According to a JUI-F source, the government agreed to postpone the amendment at the demand of Maulana Rehman. ""Now…this matter will be taken up after the SCO summit,"" said a party office-bearer.On Monday, the Maulana attended a multi-party moot on Palestine at the invitation of the president and the prime minister and also held a meeting with the bigwigs of the ruling coalition, giving rise to speculations that he had agreed to support the government.However, according to the party spokesperson, there was no truth to these reports while insiders termed the amendment disputed which the JUI-F chief would not agree to ""under the current circumstances"".Sources said the JUI-F endorsed a separate constitutional court but expressed reservations over the constitutional amendment.""Our concern was based on common sense - we demanded the document that we were supposed to vote for, but the government negotiating teams failed to do so,"" a senior party official remarked on the dialogue between the government and the JUI-F last month.The JUI-F still expects the government to share the draft with the party. The JUI-F leader said they would also share their draft on the constitutional court with the government and expected the government to do the same. In order to take everyone on board, the JUI-F leaders have suggested a separate constitutional bench instead of an independent court.On the other hand, the government is almost ready to table the constitutional amendment, and sources in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) believe that this time, it would not be rushed through Parliament.""There will be separate sessions of the National Assembly and Senate and it is likely to be held on October 18,"" they added.It is likely that the National Assembly and Senate sessions will separately be convened on the same day and after getting it cleared from one house, the amendment would be introduced in the other the same day.In order to achieve a two-thirds majority, the ruling alliance has been trying to win over Maulana Rehman as well as some Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-linked lawmakers whose votes against the party line would not be annulled following a review of Article 63A of the Constitution.The Pakistan Peoples Party and PML-N are in contact with Akhtar Mengal, the head of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) as well, hoping to secure the support of two BNP senators.Sardar Mengal, who recently resigned from the National Assembly, is still a member of the house as his resignation hasn't been accepted by the NA speaker, Dawn reported.",The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit , following India's refusal earlier. Last Friday, India confirmed that foreign minister S Jaishankar would lead a delegation to Pakistan for the summit in Islamabad.Responding to a question on Jaishankar's visit and India-Pakistan relations , the spokesperson said that Pakistan had ""officially received notification"" about the visit and is prepared to welcome all participating members.Further on the question of bilateral talks, the spokesperson cited Jaishnakar's refusal and assured to toe the same line.""Regarding your question about bilateral meetings, I would like you to refer to the remarks made by the Indian minister for external affairs on 5th of October, in which he maintained that his visit was meant for a multilateral event and not for discussing Pakistan-India relations. These remarks are self-explanatory,"" she said.The last time an Indian external affairs minister visited Pakistan was when Sushma Swaraj in December 2015 travelled for a forum on the Afghanistan issue. However, Jaishankar's upcoming visit is looked at as a significant move by New Delhi, given the strained bilateral relations between the two countries.Tensions escalated after India carried out airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Balakot in February 2019, following the Pulwama terror attack. Relations worsened further after India revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and reorganised the state into two union territories in August 2019, leading Pakistan to downgrade diplomatic ties.India has consistently stated its desire for normal relations with Pakistan, which New Delhi has said will depend on Islamabad creating an environment free of terrorism and hostility.In May 2023, Pakistan's then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India for an SCO foreign ministers' meeting in Goa, marking the first such visit by a Pakistani foreign minister in nearly 12 years.Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, however, confirmed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will chair the upcoming Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting of the SCO.""We expect high-level participation from SCO members; the observer state of Mongolia; Turkmenistan as a special guest; and representatives of the international organisations, including Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and European Economic Community (EEC),"" she said.The spokesperson stated that the CHG meeting will focus on discussions regarding cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, environment, and socio-cultural connections, while also reviewing the SCO's overall performance.","Pakistan has ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit.

The songs included one proclaiming the universal victory of the Islamic revolution.The theft has heightened fears gripping Hindus after the regime change in Aug, putting a question mark on chief advisor Mohammad Yunus's promise to provide security to the minority community and safeguard their rights.Anger among Hindus ran high in Chattogram after a group of six, including Shahidul Karim, who teaches at Tanzimul Ummah Madrasa, and Mohammad Nurul Islam, a teacher of Darul Irfan Academy, recited Islamic songs after misleading the organisers. The group was allowed on the dais after they told the organisers that they intended to sing nationalist songs.The two clerics have been detained. The six are members of Chattogram Cultural Academy, a pro-Jamaat-e-Islami body, according to sources. Jamaat, however, denied any links with those detained.Chattogram deputy commissioner Farida Khanom visited the puja venue Thursday and assured that the administration would nab the absconding accused within 48 hours.The puja committee expelled two of its senior functionaries for not being vigilant enough. The anger was shared by others. ""Why would an Islamic group sing in a puja celebration? Who gave them this right? Sure, this is intentional,"" music director and song writer Prince Mahmud wrote on Facebook.","India has conveyed its displeasure to authorities over theft of the crown gifted by PM Modi for the legendary Jeshoreshwari Kali temple.

In a first, an individual of Nepali origin and a US citizen tied the knot in Kathmandu . This marriage reportedly was Nepal’s first legally registered same-sex marriage between citizens of different countries.Nepali citizen Prajit Budhathoki , 27, and US national Joey Foster Ellis ,30, got married in Kathmandu on Thursday.Their union was registered on October 6 in Dharan , marking the seventh same-sex marriage in the country.Joseph expressed his excitement, saying that they had been living together for over two years and were overjoyed at finally receiving legal recognition for their relationship.The couple’s wedding was a blend of Hindu and Christian rituals, officiated by Brahmin and Christian priests.The marriage followed Nepal’s recent Supreme Court ruling that recognised same-sex unions, allowing temporary registration of marriages for ""sexual minorities and non-traditional couples."" After legally registering their union in the Dharan sub-metropolitan city, Prajit and Joey held a religious ceremony that combined traditions from both their cultures.The wedding ceremony began with Hindu rituals led by priests from the revered Pashupati temple. Priest Shiva Raj Regmi expressed joy in officiating the ceremony and was quoted by the Himalayan Times saying, ""Love is accepted by our scriptures regardless of who it comes from.""Following this, Christian priest Mark Lodico solemnised their marital vows with an exchange of rings. An emotional Joey proclaimed his love and excitement for their shared future, saying, ""I accept you just as you are"", quotes the Himalayan Times.The couple faced several bureaucratic challenges during the registration process, with the local administration being unfamiliar with the procedures for same-sex marriages.Former MP and LGBTQ+ activist Sunil Babu Pant played a key role in supporting the couple and officiated as their symbolic father. He also helped the couple in facilitating their marriage registration and was pivotal in making the religious ceremony happen.Advocate Sacistha Shrestha, who played a role in registering Prajit and Joseph's marriage, stressed that while Nepal has taken a progressive stance, further legal clarity is needed. ""There are still ambiguities, especially for binational couples, and the procedural framework must be refined to ensure equal rights and recognition for all couples,"" she said.The event not only garnered widespread attention but also had the backing of the US Embassy in Kathmandu, which congratulated the newlyweds, stating that this union represents Nepal's growing acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights.","Nepali citizen Prajit Budhathoki and US national Joey Foster Ellis got married in Kathmandu on Thursday.

"'Mountaineering testament to strength...': Nima Rinji Sherpa becomes youngest to summit all 14 peaks above 8,000 meters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/mountaineering-testament-to-strength-nima-rinji-sherpa-becomes-youngest-to-summit-all-14-peaks-above-8000-meters/articleshow/114081056.cms,"Nima Rinji Sherpa

An 18-year-old Nepali mountaineer Nima Rinji Sherpa set a new world record by becoming the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.As per the news agency ANI, his historic feat was completed on Wednesday when he successfully scaled Tibet's 8,027-metre-high Shisha Pangma , marking the culmination of his two-year mission to conquer the most daunting mountains on the planet.Summiting all 14 ""eight-thousanders"" is considered the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, requiring climbers to cross into ""death zones,"" where oxygen levels are too low to support human life for long periods. Nima’s success at such a young age has been hailed as a remarkable testament to his strength and determination.Looking back at his journey, Nima posted about the achievement on his Instagram page. He said, ""This summit is not just the culmination of my personal journey, but a tribute to every Sherpa who has ever dared to dream beyond the traditional boundaries set for us. Mountaineering is more than labour; it is a testament to our strength, resilience, and passion.""Wanting this feat to be an inspiration for the younger generation, he further said, ""Through #SherpaPower, I want to show the younger generation of Sherpas that they can rise above the stereotype of being only support climbers and embrace their potential as top-tier athletes, adventurers, and creators. We are not just guides; we are trailblazers. Let this be a call to every Sherpa to see the dignity in our work, the power in our heritage, and the limitless possibilities in our future.""""To humanity as a whole: let this climb remind us that the peaks we reach together, united, are far greater than any individual achievement. As a teenager, witnessing the division caused by borders, wars, racism and other conflicts, I call for love, respect, and harmony among all people. In this vast world, we are but one human race. No summit, no boundary, no conflict is worth more than the peace and unity we can achieve by understanding and supporting one another,"" he added.Then he called out to the people to preserve nature and said, ""The mountain does not define us; we define the mountain We are its guardians, similarly the world we live in should be defined by people who reside in it ! Let’s all unite to protect and preserve our natural resources to live a sustainable and adventurous life!""Nima Rinji hails from a family of renowned mountaineers.He reached the summit of Shisha Pangma early in the morning, accompanied by fellow climber Pasang Nurbu Sherpa. ""He reached the summit this morning. He had trained well, and I was confident he would do it,"" said his father, Tashi Sherpa, while expressing pride in his son’s accomplishment.The President of the Nepal Mountaineering Association , Nima Nuru Sherpa also expressed his happiness at Rinji’s achievement. “This is a proud moment for our country. Nima broke all the stereotypes, and his success has given a message that nothing is impossible if you have a strong determination"".Nima Rinji began his mountaineering career in earnest in August 2022 when he summited Mount Manaslu at the age of 16. By June 2024, he had successfully climbed his 13th mountain, Kanchenjunga, the third-highest peak in the world. His ascent of Shisha Pangma on October 9, 2024, completed his record-breaking achievement.The record for the youngest person to summit all 14 peaks was previously held by Mingma Gyabu 'David' Sherpa, who achieved the feat at the age of 30 in 2019. Nima Rinji, however, accomplished the same feat at just 18 years and five months, completing his journey in two years and ten days, according to Seven Summit Treks, the expedition organiser.Nepali climbers, particularly Sherpas, have long been considered the backbone of the climbing industry in the Himalayas, often carrying equipment and setting up routes for foreign climbers. However, in recent years, Sherpas have gained recognition in their own right, taking centre stage in some of the most challenging climbs.","Nima Rinji Sherpa is the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.

Bangladesh's Yunus says no elections before reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshs-yunus-says-no-elections-before-reforms/articleshow/114042114.cms,"'Write as you please'

Bangladesh 's interim leader has refused to give a timeframe for elections following the ouster of his autocratic predecessor, saying in an interview published Tuesday that reforms are needed before polls.Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus was appointed the country's ""chief advisor"" after the student-led uprising that toppled ex-premier Sheikh Hasina in August.The 84-year-old microfinance pioneer is helming a temporary administration, to tackle what he has called the ""extremely tough"" challenge of restoring democratic institutions.""None of us are aiming at staying for a prolonged time,"" Yunus said of his caretaker government, in an interview published by the Prothom Alo newspaper.""Reforms are pivotal,"" he added. ""If you say, hold the election, we are ready to hold the election. But it would be wrong to hold the election first.""Hasina's 15-year rule saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.More than 600 people were killed in the weeks leading up to her ouster, according to a preliminary United Nations report which said the figure was likely an underestimate.Her government was also accused of politicising courts and the civil service, as well as staging lopsided elections, to dismantle democratic checks on its power.Yunus said he had inherited a ""completely broken down"" system of public administration that needed a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.""Reforms mean we will not allow a repetition of what happened in the past"", he added.Yunus also batted away criticism at the numerous politicians, senior police officers and other Hasina loyalists arrested on murder charges after her government's ouster.The arrests have prompted accusations that Yunus' caretaker government would hold politicised trials of senior figures from Hasina's regime.But Yunus said it was his intention that any criminal trials initiated against those arrested would remain free from government interference.""Once the judicial system is reformed, then the issues will come forward, about who will be placed on trial, how justice will be carried out,"" he said.At least 25 journalists -- considered by Hasina's opponents to be partisans of her government -- have been arrested for alleged violence against protesters since her downfall.Press watchdog Reporters Without Borders has condemned those arrests as ""systematic judicial harassment"".But Yunus insisted he wanted media freedom.""Write as you please,"" he told the newspaper.""Criticise. Unless you write, how will we know what is happening or not happening?""","Muhammad Yunus was appointed the country's ""chief advisor"" after the student-led uprising that toppled ex-premier Sheikh Hasina in August.
