Three Rohingya died during the nearly two-week-long trip from Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh to the waters off Labuhan Haji in South Aceh district, local police said.Authorities have transferred 11 Rohingya to a government hospital since Sunday after their health worsened.""Our community, the fishing community, refuses to let them land because of what happened in other places.

Protesters in Bangladesh have seiged the presidential palace, Banga Bhaban , demanding the resignation of President Mohammed Shahabuddin. The Anti-discrimination Student Movement , which led the campaign to remove Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , held a rally at the central Shaheed Minar in Dhaka earlier on Tuesday, where they announced their 5-point demands, including the President's resignation.As the protesters marched towards Banga Bhaban at night, they were met with barricades set up by the army.The protesters gathered outside the palace, chanting slogans calling for the President's resignation. ""The President is a crony of Hasina's authoritarian government. He must resign immediately"", a protester said.Mohammed Shahabuddin, also known as Chuppu, is the 16th President of Bangladesh. He was elected unopposed in the 2023 presidential election, nominated by the Awami League. The Anti-discrimination Student Movement has called for the abolition of the 1972 constitution and the drafting of a new one that reflects the context of 2024.The students have also demanded the banning of the Awami League's student organisation, Bangladesh Chatra League , and the resignation of President Mohammed Shahabuddin . They have called for the elections held in 2014, 2018, and 2024 under Sheikh Hasina to be declared illegal and for the disqualification of the Members of Parliament who won these elections.Additionally, they have called for the announcement of a Proclamation of the Republic in line with the spirit of the July-August uprising.The protests, which began in July with students demanding an end to the quota system for government jobs, evolved into anti-government demonstrations. As the protests intensified, Sheikh Hasina, 76, resigned as Bangladesh's Prime Minister on August 5 and fled to India. An interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was established, and on August 8, Yunus was sworn in as the head of Bangladesh's interim government.","Protesters in Bangladesh have seiged the presidential palace, Banga Bhaban.

E Coli Outbreak: Deadly E coli outbreak linked to McDonald's burger hits 10 US states: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deadly-e-coli-outbreak-linked-to-mcdonalds-burger-hits-10-us-states-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/114483137.cms,"Representtative image (Picture credit: Reuters)

Here's what you need to know:

Infections were reported in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

At least 49 individuals were affected, with 27 cases in Colorado and 9 in Nebraska.

One death was reported in Colorado; 10 hospitalizations, including a child with severe kidney complications.

All interviewed individuals reported consuming food from McDonald’s, primarily Quarter Pounders.

Investigators are examining slivered onions and beef patties as potential sources of contamination.

Preliminary findings suggest slivered onions from a single supplier may be linked to some illnesses.

McDonald’s has removed Quarter Pounder hamburgers and slivered onions from menus in affected states and parts of Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

The company has temporarily halted the distribution of slivered onions sourced from the implicated supplier and emphasized its commitment to food safety.

The implicated strain, E coli O157:H7, causes approximately 74,000 infections annually in the US, leading to severe symptoms including fever, stomach cramps, and bloody diarrhoea.

Young children are particularly vulnerable and can experience severe complications like acute kidney failure.

McDonald's has faced a decline in global same-store sales for the first time in nearly four years, prompting the introduction of a $5 meal deal that does not include the Quarter Pounder.

Following the CDC’s announcement, company shares dropped 9 per cent in after-hours trading.

An E coli outbreak associated with McDonald’s Quarter Pounder hamburgers has emerged as a significant public health concern, impacting at least 49 individuals across ten states. Federal health officials have confirmed that the outbreak has resulted in one death and ten hospitalizations, including a child facing severe kidney complications.The centers for disease control and prevention ( CDC ) is actively investigating the situation, which has sparked concerns regarding food safety and the fast-food giant’s menu offerings.The infections have been traced back to a period between September 27 and October 11, with the majority of cases reported in Colorado , which has logged the highest number of infections.As officials work to identify the source of the contamination, initial findings suggest that slivered onions and hamburger patties may be to blame. McDonald’s has responded to the outbreak by removing the implicated items from menus in affected states and halting distribution of certain ingredients.This outbreak comes at a challenging time for McDonald's , which has recently experienced declines in global same-store sales. As the fast-food chain grapples with the impact of inflation on consumer behavior, this health crisis may further strain its reputation and financial performance. The investigation is ongoing, with health officials urging the public to be vigilant about the symptoms of E coli infection.","At least 49 individuals were affected, with 27 cases in Colorado and 9 in Nebraska.

DHAKAL: Slogan-shouting student protesters in Bangladesh tried to break through the security barricade in front of Prez Mohammed Shahabuddin 's official residence in Dhaka late Tuesday to demand his resignation, culminating in a baton-charge by army and police that left three of them wounded.The trigger for the protest, reminiscent of the mass uprising that toppled the erstwhile Awami League government in August, was over Shahabuddin's purported remark suggesting that there was no ""documentary evidence"" of ex-PM Sheikh Hasina formally resigning before fleeing the country on August 5.Till 11.50pm, the protesters were parked in front of the gates to Bangabhaban, the presidential residence. An explosion was reported amid the chorus of slogans. The congregation of protesters baying for a presidential change came a day after interim government 's law adviser Asif Nazrul accused Shahabuddin of perpetuating the ""lie"" spread by Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy about his mother not even getting time to officially resign.Students also staged a demonstration at Dhaka's Shahbagh intersection to press the administration to accede to five demands, including rewriting the constitution, banning Awami League's student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League by the end of the week, a new proclamation of the republic, and declaring the last three national elections - 2014, 2018, 2024 - illegal. The interim government's council of advisers invited a student delegation to a round of talks Wednesday, agitation coordinator Hasnat Abdullah said. In the evening, students blocked Dhaka's Gulistan road near Bangabhaban.The president appealed to all to refrain from destabilising or embarrassing the interim government by creating any fresh controversy on a ""resolved issue"".BNP senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said the interim government was playing ""hide and seek"" over the arrest of members of the erstwhile Hasina cabinet.","Three students wounded as protesters try to break through security barricade in front of Prez Mohammed Shahabuddin's official residence in Dhaka.

Four experts were divided on whether the giveaway violates federal laws that make it a crime to pay or offer to pay a person to register to vote. Musk's representatives did not respond.""There is certainly an argument that this falls within the scope of a federal prohibition on paying a person to vote or register to vote,"" said Daniel Weiner of left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice. But Brad Smith, Federal Election Commission ex-chairman, said Musk is likely in the clear because signing the petition is far removed from registering to vote.While Musk's promotion does not directly induce people to register, its timing and focus on battleground states indicate the petition component is merely a pretext, according to Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California who said the sweepstakes is therefore illegal. Adav Noti of the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center agreed, saying it is illegal to give out money on the condition that people are registered to vote. But Smith said Musk has other plausible reasons for wanting people to sign the petition, including gathering names of likely voters who support his causes. Musk, world's richest person, has so far given $75 million to Trump's campaign.

The new poll showed that voters have a dim view of the state of the economy and immigration - and they generally favour Trump's approach on these issues.

Will Hamas get a new chief after Yahya Sinwar's death? Here's what reports suggest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/will-hamas-get-a-new-chief-after-yahya-sinwars-death-heres-what-reports-suggest/articleshow/114443946.cms,"The Palestinian militant group Hamas is leaning toward appointing a ruling committee based in Doha rather than a single successor following the death of their chief, Yahya Sinwar Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces last week, a move that has spurred discussions within the group about its leadership moving forward.According to sources within Hamas, the group has decided not to name a new leader until the next internal elections scheduled for March, provided circumstances allow.“The Hamas leadership's approach is not to appoint a successor to the late chief, the martyr Yahya Sinwar, until their next elections,” a source from the group told AFP.Mewanwhile, a five-member committee, which was formed in August after the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, will assume leadership responsibilities. Sinwar, who was appointed Gaza chief of Hamas in 2017, ascended to the top leadership role after Haniyeh's assassination in July.The committee, comprised of key representatives from Gaza, the West Bank, and the Palestinian diaspora, includes Khalil al-Hayya (Gaza), Zaher Jabarin (West Bank), and Khaled Meshaal (representing Palestinians abroad). Two other key members are Mohammed Darwish, head of Hamas's Shura advisory council, and the political bureau's secretary. All members of the committee are currently based in Qatar.The committee has been tasked with governing Hamas during the ongoing conflict, making strategic decisions, and shaping the group's future plans. “The committee will govern the movement during the war and exceptional circumstances, as well as its future trajectory,” the source said.Another source revealed that there had been internal discussions about appointing a political chief whose identity would remain secret, but the leadership ultimately chose to proceed with collective rule through the committee.Sinwar's death came as Israeli forces intensified their military operations in Gaza. He was killed in southern Gaza, more than a year into the war that erupted after Hamas launched a major offensive on October 7.The death of Yahya Sinwar has created a leadership vacuum within the Palestinian terrorist organization. Various reports speculated about potential candidates who could step into the role.","Hamas is leaning toward appointing a ruling committee based in Doha rather than a single successor following the death of their chief, Yahya Sinwar Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces last week.

The Arctic Circle , an extraordinary region covering 4% of Earth’s surface, is a land of extremes where the sun can shine at midnight or darkness may reign at noon. Despite its harsh conditions, this vast area is home to hundreds of thousands of people across eight countries, including the U.S. (Alaska), Canada, Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland.It boasts unique wildlife, such as the Arctic fox, and notable cities like Murmansk , the largest north of the Circle.The region is governed by the Arctic Council , focusing on sustainable development and environmental protection. With dramatic landscapes and natural wonders like the Northern Lights, the Arctic Circle continues to fascinate, though its boundaries slowly retreat due to Earth's shifting axial tilt.The Arctic Circle stretches from 66 to 67 degrees north. Alaska's Point Barrow is the northernmost point of the U.S., but Canada, Russia, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Greenland, and Iceland all have land in the region.The Arctic fox, with its thick fur and nomadic nature, travels across the entire region. Its white coat provides natural camouflage from predators like polar bears and wolves.Murmansk, a Russian port with around 295,000 people, is the largest city in the Arctic. Norilsk, also in Russia, follows, known for mining and the Nord Kamal Mosque. Tromsø, Norway, is the most populous city outside of Russia and is renowned for viewing the Northern Lights.Established in 1996, the Arctic Council addresses sustainable development and environmental protection in the region. Military issues are excluded from its mandate.Even during the polar night, communities still experience twilight. For example, in Utqiaġvik, Alaska, the sun doesn’t rise for 65 days, but twilight still lasts for three to six hours daily.In the North Pole, the sun rises during the spring equinox in March and doesn’t set until September, earning the Arctic the nickname ""Land of the Midnight Sun."" In Tromsø, Norway, this phenomenon lasts for about two months.While the Arctic's average winter temperature is minus 40°F (minus 40°C), the Antarctic is far colder at minus 76°F (minus 60°C) in winter due to the South Pole's lack of moderating seawater. Unlike the Arctic, the Antarctic Circle has no permanent human settlements.The Arctic Circle Centre in Norway is a great tourist spot with breathtaking views, a cafe, and a gift shop, though it’s not open year-round.Earth's axial tilt is shifting, causing the Arctic Circle’s boundary to retreat by 46 to 49 feet (14 to 15 metres) annually, altering the region over time.","The Arctic Circle is home to hundreds of thousands of people across eight countries.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Described as erratic and detached from the company's core, Musk's rambling answers left many questioning whether he truly understood the business. ""Wasn't this guy supposed to be a genius?"" one employee asked after the chaotic exchange.The meeting began with Twitter’s chief marketing officer , Leslie Berland, easing Musk into a Q&A session.Her first question was simple: “Why do you love Twitter?” Musk, however, gave an answer that left many staff scratching their heads. “I find, like, I learn a lot from what I read on Twitter... It's a great way to get a message out over the phone,” Musk rambled, before veering off-topic to joke, “Some people use their hair to express themselves, I use Twitter.”Employees were alarmed by Musk’s vague responses and apparent lack of preparation. “I actually turned to a stranger in the Commons and said, ‘What is happening right now?’” an employee recalled. Despite the confusion, some, like Randall Lin, thought the reaction was overblown, suggesting, “With Elon, you kind of know what you're going to get.”When Berland pressed Musk on how Twitter employees could earn his trust, Musk dodged the question, responding with, “If somebody is getting useful things done, then that’s great. But if they’re not... why are they at the company?” His nonchalant attitude towards employee trust did little to ease concerns.The final question about whether Musk would take on the CEO role prompted a more bizarre response. Musk, who already held the title of ""Techno King"" at Tesla, dismissed titles as unimportant. Instead, he shifted the conversation to his overarching philosophy on extending the lifespan of civilization, contemplating alien life and the nature of the universe. ""Many employees were stunned by this seemingly irrelevant monologue,"" according to a former engineer, who said Musk ""either hasn't given this much thought or doesn't take this seriously.""The meeting concluded with widespread disbelief among employees. “He did not land the plane,” a former executive quipped, criticising Musk's inability to offer coherent leadership at a time of great uncertainty for the company.Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in 2022, valued at $44 billion, led to mass layoffs, with nearly 80 percent of the staff being let go. Employees who remained were warned of ""extremely hardcore"" working conditions, as Musk set the tone for his reign over the platform now known as X.","Elon Musk met with Twitter employees for the first time following his acquisition of the social media platform.

So part of my plan includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries,"" she said.This is not the first time that Harris has faced questions about Biden's mental fitness, earlier, in a more contentious exchange with Fox News' Bret Baier, Harris also defended Biden against allegations of cognitive decline. “I have watched from the Oval Office to the Situation Room, and he has the judgement and experience to make very important decisions,” she asserted. Harris pointed out that Biden is not the one running for re-election, saying, “Joe Biden is not on the ballot,” and shifted focus to concerns about former President Donald Trump, asserting, “He’s not stable.”Harris' support has seen a decline in recent weeks, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll showing Harris leading Trump by a slim margin of 46% to 43%, yet highlights a troubled electorate with a significant portion feeling the country is on the wrong track. Voter sentiment reflects widespread discontent, with 70% indicating that the cost of living is deteriorating and 60% believing the economy is heading in the wrong direction.","Vice President Kamala Harris was asked about her observations of President Joe Biden's debate performance during a recent NBC News interview.

'Lightning rod'

'Outlawed'

LOS ANGELES: Donald Trump may have become involved with a porn star, but if elected president he could try shutting down the entire industry, adult film stars are warning in a push to get young men to vote against the Republican next month.The #HandsOffMyPorn campaign has spent $200,000 so far on ads to run on adult websites, warning viewers that prominent allies of Trump want to ban pornography and lock up the stars who bring it to vivid, graphic life.And they want Americans to fight back at the ballot box.""If you care about adult entertainment , if you consume or create adult entertainment, you gotta vote November 5,"" porn actress Siouxsie Q told AFP. ""There's no two ways about it.""The initiative comes in response to Project 2025 , a blueprint for reshaping the federal government should Trump, the Republican nominee, win the election.Page five of the 900-page tome's foreword states: ""Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned.""Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025. But dozens of his allies and former administration members co-wrote the document, and Democrats have argued that many of its policies match his own positions.The #HandsOffMyPorn campaign is aimed primarily at men, who are four times more likely to report watching porn than women, according to the Institute for Family Studies.Just weeks before the extremely close US election between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, pollsters report a giant gender division among voters.Trump enjoys a strong lead among male voters, regularly taking his machismo-drenched pitch to young men on right-wing podcasts.Now, #HandsOffMyPorn's ""public service announcements"" are being played to users in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, often just before they watch adult videos.Stars like Siouxsie Q appear and say: ""Hey, I know you're busy. I know you're doing something. Hold on. If you want to keep doing this, you really need to vote on November 5... Enjoy!""Harris is not in any way affiliated with the #HandsOffMyPorn campaign, which is paid for by the independent Artists United for Change committee, noted Siouxsie Q.""Hopefully, secretly, she likes what we're doing,"" she added.Crackdowns on pornography are nothing new for the United States.But Holly Randall, a 26-year veteran of the adult industry, said she has never seen such a potentially devastating threat to the sector.That even includes when her parents, who worked in porn during Ronald Reagan's crackdown in the 1980s, had to film hardcore scenes in secret.""I've seen these attacks come and go.... Project 2025, is the most explicit iteration of wanting to completely outlaw porn,"" she said.""Absolutely, I am worried about imprisonment,"" added Siouxsie Q, who made her name performing in feminist, queer and bondage films, before moving on to producing.Porn stars also warn that the consequences could extend far beyond even their wildly popular industry.According to Siouxsie Q, pornography is the ""canary in the coal mine"" for the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. She pointed also to Republican-led banning of sex education books from school libraries.And Randall said adult entertainment is a ""lightning rod"" for wider issues such as trans rights, same-sex marriage and even reproductive rights.""It's always the easiest thing to attack, because it represents people's uncertainty and fear about the changing morals of sexuality and of gender fluidity,"" she said.Trump has repeatedly claimed he has nothing to do with Project 2025.However, a New York Times investigation this week found ""well over half"" of the document's authors had been in Trump's previous administration or on his campaign or transition teams.Randall noted the irony of Trump -- convicted for fraud over ""hush money"" payments to porn star Stormy Daniels -- becoming embroiled in the movement, even if she suspects he personally ""doesn't actually care whether or not it's outlawed.""""But it's the people around him, like (Trump running mate) J.D. Vance, these ultra-right-wing conservatives, who want to ban porn,"" she said.Vance wrote the foreword to an upcoming book by Kevin D. Roberts -- the author of the Project 2025 section that calls for a ban on porn.""I think Trump will easily step aside and allow that to happen,"" said Randall.","#HandsOffMyPorn campaign has spent $200,000 so far on ads to run on adult websites.

US President Joe Biden, in his most scathing criticism yet, said that to counter Donald Trump 's radical proposals, ""we got to lock him up."" Speaking to supporters at a Democratic campaign office in Concord, New Hampshire, Biden quickly clarified that he meant ""politically lock him up ,"" drawing applause from the crowd. His remarks come just weeks ahead of the November 5 election, highlighting the intense political climate surrounding Trump's multiple criminal charges.Biden's comments come as Trump, the Republican candidate, faces multiple criminal charges stemming from efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election .While the White House has generally refrained from commenting on Trump’s legal issues, Biden’s remarks signal a notable shift in rhetoric. During his address, Biden warned that Trump's potential return to the White House poses a grave threat to democracy, asserting, “Our democracy is at stake.”This political tension echoes the 2016 election, when Trump infamously urged supporters to ""lock her up"" regarding Hillary Clinton, a chant that became a hallmark of his campaign. Now, Biden’s rallying cry has been met with cheers from his base, though Vice President Kamala Harris has distanced herself from the slogan at her events, stating, ""The courts will handle that. Let's handle November, shall we?""Biden also highlighted concerns raised by global leaders regarding Trump’s possible re-election. “Every international meeting I attend... they pull me aside and say, ‘Joe, he can’t win. My democracy is at stake,’” he revealed, underlining the international ramifications of the election.During the rally, Biden acknowledged the support Harris has received from some prominent Republicans, including former Congresswoman Liz Cheney. However, his focus remained firmly on Trump, whom he accused of having ""anti-democratic"" attitudes and aligning himself with authoritarian figures.With polls showing a tight race between Trump and Harris, Biden's sharp rhetoric underscores the high stakes of the forthcoming election. He concluded, “We must win.”","US President Joe Biden said that to counter Donald Trump's radical proposals, ""we got to lock him up"" Biden's comments come as Trump faces multiple criminal charges stemming from efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Pakistan plans artificial rain for the second time after Lahore declared world's most polluted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-plans-artificial-rain-for-the-second-time-after-lahore-declared-worlds-most-polluted/articleshow/114472983.cms,"The Punjab province of Pakistan on Tuesday announced plans for artificial rain to help reduce the impact of smog , following an alarming Air Quality Index (AQI) of 394 in Lahore.This would mark the second time that Lahore, the cultural capital of Pakistan, would carry out cloud seeding for artificial rain, being one of the cities to face the worst pollution regularly.The cloud seeding was done for the first time in December 2023 to combat hazardous levels of smog and it cost an estimated Rs 350 million.Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world on Monday with an alarming AQI of 394.The AQI measures the concentration of different pollutants in the air, with values above 100 classified as unhealthy and those above 150 considered ""very unhealthy.""Addressing a press conference, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said, ""Yesterday Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world. We have taken a number of initiatives to address the matter and now we are planning for artificial rain in the city.""She, however, did not declare any date for it.The Punjab government , led by Maryam Nawaz, has launched the 'Anti-Smog Squad' to monitor areas affected by smog as this hazardous pollution has caused significant health problems for city residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation, and skin infections.These squads will be educating farmers about alternative methods for residue disposal, the hazards of burning crop residues and promoting the use of super seeders.Smog is a specific phenomenon that arises from a mixture of smoke and fog, occurring when certain polluting microparticles combine with cold, moist air and linger near the ground. This results in reduced visibility and can lead to various health problems.Previously, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had also called for ""climate diplomacy"" with India to mitigate smog impact in the province.She said that stubble burning in Punjab, India also impacts across the border because of air direction and hence both sides should make joint efforts to combat smog.""This issue needs to be taken up with India forthwith,"" she said.""Obstacles to environmental improvement must be removed. Smog causes breathing difficulties and damages eyesight,"" the CM added.Meteorology plays an important role in determining the level of air pollution in north Pakistan, just as it is a major factor in the neighbouring region of northwest India. After the rainy season crop is harvested, farmers from both sides tend to burn stubble adding to the existing causes of pollution caused due to industrial emissions and transport.Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, the Environment Ministry said,""The positive effects of the measures taken to combat smog will become visible in 8 to 10 years. Environmental protection has been included as a subject in the curriculum in the province.”She also urged the farmers to avoid burning the crop residues, as it harms not only the crops but also their children's health.","Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world on Monday with an alarming AQI of 394.

Pakistan Parliament: Pakistan parliament clips powers of judiciary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-clips-powers-of-judiciary/articleshow/114436941.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s parliament clipped the powers of the Supreme Court in the early hours of Monday by empowering the executive through an amendment to the constitution passed with a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the National assembly.With full backing from the powerful military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ’s govt had been attempting since last month to introduce a set of constitutional changes in parliament apparently aimed at granting more powers to the executive in making judicial appointments.The 26th Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2024, passed during a late-night session of parliament, aimed at taking away the SC’s suo motu powers, setting the chief justice of Pakistan’s term at three years, and empowering the PM to appoint the next top judge from among the three most senior SC judges. It states that a 12-member parliamentary committee, comprising eight NA members and four from the Senate, will appoint the chief justice from a panel of the three most senior judges of the top court for a period of three years. The panel will forward the name to the PM who will then send it to the president for appointment.The bill, tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, was approved by the NA with 225 votes, one more than required for a two-thirds majority, after a handful of turncoats from jailed former PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) voted against the party’s policy. In the Senate, the required number for two-thirds was 64 and 65 members voted in favour. Hours later, President Asif Ali Zardari gave formal assent to the new law. Imran’s party, however, abstained from voting.An earlier attempt, in Sept, by the governing PML-N to bulldoze the amendments did not succeed as it failed to win the support of some opposition lawmakers and the legislation could not be tabled despite the two Houses being in session.Sharif’s govt said the constitutional amendment has ensured that parliament will not remain a rubber stamp in future. The current govt’s tensions with the judiciary have been on the rise since controversial nationwide general elections were held in Feb this year.The new legislation, specifically about judicial reforms, was passed just days ahead of the retirement of chief justice Qazi Faez Isa . Khan’s PTI has been accusing Isa of being aligned with govt, an allegation govt has repeatedly rejected.Under the previous law, Justice Isa would have been automatically replaced by the senior puisne judge, currently Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, who has consistently issued verdicts deemed favourable to Khan and PTI.PTI assailed the “conscience” of lawmakers affiliated with it who voted in favour of the amendment. “They won votes on Imran Khan’s name and sold their vote to the same mafia against whom the public gave them the mandate!” the party said on its ‘X’ account, sharing pictures of the said lawmakers and terming them “seditious”.“These conscience-sellers would be counted among the darkest characters in Pakistan’s history,” it added.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan criticised the bill, saying it would make the judiciary “subservient” for all time.",Pakistan's parliament clipped the powers of the Supreme Court in the early hours of Monday by empowering the executive.

The Hindu community in Narowal, numbering over 1,453 people, has since lacked a proper place to conduct their rituals.Narowal district once had 45 Hindu temples, all of which have fallen into disrepair over time.The restoration work is currently focused on constructing a boundary wall around the four kanals of land, after which the temple will be handed over to the Pak Dharamsthan Committee.Hindus represent the largest minority group in Pakistan. Official estimates suggest that there are around 7.5 million Hindus in the country, though the community claims the number is closer to 9 million.

Controversy over the amendments



Row over how Bill was passed

Historical achievement: PM Shehbaz Sharif



Charter of Democracy



In a late-night session that began at 11.36pm on Sunday and extended well past midnight, the Pakistan National Assembly passed at 5am on Monday the highly controversial 26th Constitutional Amendment that critics say effectively neuters the judicial system of the country.In another sign of the desperate hurry, President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the law mere hours after the approval of both houses of parliament.The Constitution (26th Amendment) Act, 2024, was introduced to address perceived issues within the judicial system of Pakistan, particularly focusing on the powers of the Supreme Court and the appointment of its Chief Justice.While proponents argue that these reforms are necessary for improving judicial efficiency and accountability, opponents contend that they threaten judicial independence and may pave the way for increased political interference in legal matters.The timing and nature of this amendment have raised suspicions about political motivations behind it.Critics argue that this move is an attempt by the ruling coalition led byShehbaz Sharif to exert control over an independent judiciary, particularly in light of ongoing tensions with former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).The PTI has vehemently opposed these changes, viewing them as a direct threat to judicial independence and an effort to undermine checks and balances within government institutions.Many legal experts and political analysts have expressed concern that limiting the CJP's tenure could lead to politicisation within the judiciary. By establishing a commission that includes political appointees, there are fears that judicial appointments may become more susceptible to political influence rather than being based solely on merit and legal expertise.The legal community has also voiced strong opposition against these amendments, stating that the changes could lead to a judiciary that is less willing to challenge government actions or uphold constitutional rights if they are perceived as beholden to political interests.There are serious allegations of coercion surrounding the passage of the 26th Constitutional Amendment.Local media reports suggested that members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) faced intimidation tactics, including threats of abduction, to ensure their support for the Bill. PTI leaders have claimed that their lawmakers were pressured into voting in favor of the amendment or faced consequences for non-compliance.The process leading up to the amendment has also been criticised for its lack of transparency and consensus among political parties. While some coalition members gave broad support for the amendment, others, particularly from PTI, expressed their refusal to participate in what they describe as a coerced vote.The hurried nature of this legislative process has raised questions about whether adequate deliberation occurred among lawmakers regarding such significant constitutional changes.The government required 224 votes to pass the Bill. As voting commenced under the chairmanship of NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, 225 members of the National Assembly supported the motion, while 12 members from the PTI and the Sunni-Ittehad Council (SIC) opposed it.The Bill comprised 27 clauses. After the passage of the first clause, the PTI members walked out of the assembly.Following the passage of the bill, PM Shehbaz Sharif delivered a speech and congratulated the parliament for the ""historical achievement"", said a report by Dawn.""This amendment, the 26th, is not just an amendment, but an example of national solidarity and consensus. A new sun will rise, emanating across the nation,"" PM Shehbaz said.PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari thanked the PML-N, MQM-P, IPP, JUI-F, ANP, and other parties for their contributions to the Bill.He also extended his gratitude to the PTI, stating: ""I also thank the PTI for playing a part in this historic achievement. This is a political success, and I wish you wouldn't have portrayed your own victory as a loss.""PTI's Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, took over the floor of the NA and criticised the amendments, arguing that they did not reflect the will of the Pakistani people.Taking a jab at law minister Tarar and Bilawal, he said that those who had ""gone missing"" should have been thanked as well during the note of thanks. Ayub detailed how PTI lawmakers were ""tortured and harassed"".""These were all tactics to pressure us. The mistreatment of Imran Khan in jail is also an example,"" he said.Ayub also questioned the urgency behind passing the amendments, asking: ""What would have happened had it been passed on October 31?""He also said that the amendments were an attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary.Meanwhile, Defence minister Khawaja Asif said the amendment had been passed by the Senate ""to restore respect and dignity of the parliament and the House"". ""There must be consistency in our political behaviour otherwise we will not get the respect and dignity we seek,"" he said.As per the report by Dawn, Asif went on to say that the constitutional amendments were not something that the government had ""newly invented"" but it was a continuation of the Charter of Democracy that all political leaders, including Imran, had unanimously signed.The Charter of Democracy was signed in London on May 14, 2006, by major political parties in response to the military dictatorship of General Pervez Musharraf, with the aim of promoting democratic norms and preventing the abuse of power by unelected institutions such as the military and judiciary.",The amendment limits the tenure of the Chief Justice of Pakistan to three years. A new 12-member commission has been established to appoint the CJP. The amendment seeks to dilute the Supreme Court's suo motu powers.

HYDERABAD: In a public rally on Friday, leading Pakistpolitician Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari warned that if political parties in parliament do not reach a consensus on the 26th constitutional amendment , he will push the amendment through parliament using a brute, or two-thirds majority, Dawn reported. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party which is led by his father Asif Ali Zardari who is the President of Pakistan.Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ) is in coalition with PM Shehbaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N). These two parties along with Fazlur Rehman's Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) have come together to implement the 26th constitutional amendment in Pakistan's constitution.While addressing a PPP rally in Pakistan's Hyderabad city to mark the anniversary of the attack on his mother's homecoming parade in 2007, Bilawal Bhutto said, ""It is my desire to have consensus among all political parties in parliament for this amendment. The second option, which is not my preferred path, is to rely on the majority's vote to pass it,"" Dawn noted.He urged political parties to consider the future and work towards raising the dignity of parliament, adding that they operate within a certain ""political space"".Bhutto noted that while the PPP was unable to establish a constitutional court during its 2008-2013 government, he is committed to fulfilling the promise made by Benazir Bhutto.He acknowledged opposition to the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), particularly fromPTI leaders, but insisted that the new court would ensure equal representation for all provinces.PTI has been protesting across Pakistan against the implementation of the constitutional amendments as the Party alleges that the bill would undermine the powers of judiciary.PTI leaders have also alleged that bribes up to Rs 1 Billion are being offered to lawmakers to garner support for passing the amendment law.In the public rally, Bilawal Bhutto gave out historical justifications for implementation of the 26th amendment saying that even Muhammad Ali Jinnah had called for a separate court for routine justice matters at the 1930 Round Table Conference.The FCC, Bhutto claimed, would protect the rights of provinces by providing equal representation and addressing disputes between the federation and provinces.As per Dawn, Bhutto insisted that his mother and former Pakistan PM Benazir Bhutto had supported the establishment of the FCC because she understood the ""real face"" of the judiciary, which he said had repeatedly legitimised dictatorial rule.""After abolishing the 'One Unit' system in the country through parliament, my mother wanted to eliminate the concept of 'One Unit' in the judiciary as well,"" he added.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: Over 34 universities in Pakistan 's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been facing a financial crisis , with a collective loss of Pakistani Rupees ( PKR ) 15 billion, ARY News reported.According to the details, the financial crisis is due to the significant disparity between the income of the universities and expenditures.

NEW DELHI: Police in Pakistan used tear gas and batons to disperse student protesters on Thursday after they ransacked a college building. The protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger and demonstrations in four cities.Reports of the incident spread on social media, increasing tensions on college campuses. Students in Rawalpindi, Punjab province, burned furniture and blocked a key road before vandalizing a college building.Earlier, a security guard died during clashes between student protesters and police in Gujrat, also in Punjab province. Authorities arrested one person related to the guard's death and another for spreading misinformation about the alleged rape.In Lahore, over two dozen students were injured earlier this week while demanding justice for the alleged victim, who students claim was raped at the Punjab Group of Colleges.In response to the growing unrest, the government banned rallies in Punjab. The Federal Investigation Agency filed cases against 36 people accused of spreading misinformation on social media.Authorities, including the Punjab chief minister, and the woman’s parents denied any assault happened. However, Punjab police called on the public to share any information regarding the alleged rape.The unrest seems to have started spontaneously, as student unions in Pakistan have been banned since 1984.These protests also come after a woman reported being gang-raped during a polio vaccination drive in Sindh province last month. Police arrested three men involved, but the woman's husband expelled her from home, citing damage to the family name.","Protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger.

LAHORE: Describing foreign minister S Jaishankar ’s visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting as a positive development that should provide an opening for more substantive engagements between the 2 countries, former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi saying the latter’s decision to visit Sharif’s home in 2015 was not an ordinary gesture. Sharif sought progress in ties saying the relationship should not be held captive by the past.Sharif, a 3-time PM and elder brother of Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.“Achhe bhare talukkat ko tabah aur barbad karne waali baat ki (he worked to destroy a healthy relationship). I would have never used that kind of language. We believe in certain values that must be respected,” said Sharif, adding he had fond memories of Modi’s only visit to Pakistan on December 25, 2015, Sharif’s birthday.As then Pakistan PM, Sharif had received Modi at his home in Lahore. “I got a call from him saying he was in Kabul and wanted to visit me on his way back to India. I told him he was most welcome. He also met my mother during the visit. What he did wasn’t a chota (small) gesture,” said Sharif, in a meeting with Indian journalists in Lahore who travelled to Pakistan to cover Jaishankar’s engagements. The former PM is also the leader of the ruling PMLN party. His daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Sharif was also present in the interaction.Khan’s personal attacks against Modi after India revoked the special status of J&K only led to further deterioration of relations between the 2 countries. Sharif did not comment on India’s recent actions in the union territory as he said this wasn’t the occasion to discuss it. PM Shehbaz too had avoided raking up the Kashmir issue even in a roundabout manner at the SCO meeting.Sharif also called upon both sides to look ahead and not be held back by the past even though he didn’t make any specific commitment on resumingtrade ties or reappointing high commissioner. He did say that if there’s an opening, cheezein niklengi (things will emerge).Asked about his 2015 peace initiative with Modi that was scuttled quickly by the Pathankot terror attack, Sharif said it’s important to ensure any such effort is not disrupted. “India is our hamsaya (neighbour) mulk and we can’t change that even if we want it. We would have liked Modi to come (for SCO) but it’s good Jaishankar came. We have tried and tried again (to normalise ties). We lost the past 75 years and it’s important we don’t lose another 75 years,” said Sharif, who is known to share a close personal rapport with Modi.“Both sides have their giley-shikwe (grievances). It will be better if we can bury the past,” he added. When asked if he would play the role of building bridges, he said he was doing it.Sharif also backed SAARC, trade and cricket ties with India, saying neither country gains anything by not allowing their teams to play each other. He also recalled how former Indian PM A B Vajpayee had approached him to buy electricity from Pakistan. “I would allow my team to play. If there’s a cricket tournament on India and Pakistan and India are playing in the final, I’ll travel to India to watch it. There should be progress. SAARC or any such opportunity should not be missed. It’s important to make full use of it,” he said.“I believe we are a potential market for each other. Why should Indian and Pakistani farmers and manufacturers go outside to sell their products. Goods now go from Amritsar to Lahore via Dubai. Who is benefitting from this? What should take 2 hours takes 2 weeks,” he added.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi.

Lahore, Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday dismissed allegations of an on-campus rape incident at a Lahore college as fabricated, accusing Pakistan's jailed former premier Imran Khan's party of using the false claim to incite widespread student protests and create unrest in the province. She also demanded that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party be treated in the same way as ""banned organisations"" in the country.Maryam, daughter of former three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, claimed that the rape incident was fabricated to create unrest in Punjab. She accused political opponents, particularly PTI, of using students and the media to propagate false information for political gains.On Wednesday, a large number of students held demonstrations in Jehlum, Faisalabad, and Gujrat, demanding justice for the alleged rape victim.However, the chief minister stated that no incident of rape took place at the Punjab College for Women in Lahore. She alleged that PTI and its media supporters spread the fake news to destabilise the province by manipulating innocent students.On Monday, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured during clashes with police over the alleged rape incident. Protesters claimed that the college administration had deleted CCTV footage to cover up the case.Maryam accused PTI of attempting to destabilise the government by spreading false narratives, particularly during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which portrayed Pakistan positively on the global stage. The two-day SCO summit concluded on Wednesday.She warned of strict action against those spreading fake news, including media personnel. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said, adding that the girl in question had suffered a back injury, not a rape, and was in the hospital ICU since October 2, contradicting the circulated claims.Addressing PTI founder Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail for the last 15 months, she remarked, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are.""The chief minister also accused certain individuals from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and abroad of fuelling the controversy through fake news.""The issue isn't social media, but rather PTI, which needs to be controlled...and everything will be fine. They are operating through fake accounts,"" she alleged.Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has launched a probe against those involved in spreading disinformation through social media platforms about the alleged on-campus rape incident.A seven-member team headed by Deputy Director Cybercrime Lahore Waqas Saeed will identify individuals responsible for the disinformation campaign and the subsequent law-and-order situation.","Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz dismisses rape claims as fabricated.

"No bilateral but India, Pak ‘break the ice’ with Jaishankar visit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-bilateral-but-india-pak-break-the-ice-with-jaishankar-visit/articleshow/114294074.cms,"Modi, Sharif likely to come face to face at COP29 in Nov



ISLAMABAD: External affairs minister S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days even though there was no formal bilateral meeting between the foreign ministers on the margins of the SCO heads of government summit in Islamabad, diplomatic sources said. The fact that the first visit by an Indian foreign minister to Pakistan in almost 9 years went off without a hitch was seen as a positive development by the Indian government.As he departed after a 24-hour stay in Islamabad from the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, Jaishankar, who had said recently India isn’t passive on Pakistan and will react to positive and negative developments accordingly, thanked Shehbaz and Dar in a post on X for the hospitality and courtesies.While Indian government sources described the talks as casual conversations, Pakistan officials said there was a brief pull aside, which lasted for 5 to 7 minutes, between Jaishankar and Dar on the sidelines of the dinner hosted by Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday evening. Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), is learnt to have joined Jaishankar and Dar.A source speaking on condition of anonymity said Pakistan suggested resumption of bilateral cricketing ties as a way of “breaking the ice”. Naqvi was later quoted as saying that Jaishankar’s visit was an ice-breaker even though neither side proposed a bilateral meeting. Pakistan is looking to host the Champions Trophy next year and would like India to participate.The relationship between the 2 countries has remained in deep-freeze since the abortive bid to resume the dialogue process in 2015 under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. Things only worsened after Pakistan recalled its high commissioner in August 2019, following India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K.Indian government sources appreciated the fact that Shehbaz didn’t rake up any bilateral issue in his remarks as the host of the summit.While Jaishankar’s remarks on terrorism were seen as a message for Pakistan, Indian sources said the minister had only spoken about issues that the SCO has identified as key challenges and that other member-states can also relate to.Jaishankar is learnt to have had another extended conversation with Dar at the SCO lunch table on Wednesday where both were seated next to each other. “It wasn’t initially planned that way but later they sat together and spoke over lunch in the presence of other delegates,’’ said.Both sides denied that there was any proposal for resumption of dialogue. Shehbaz and Indian PM Narendra Modi are expected to come face to face next month at COP29 in Azerbaijan but for any substantive engagement, India will want Pakistan to first reappoint high commissioner.After his return from Pakistan, Jaishankar said in another post on X that India made a positive and constructive contribution to the talks in Islamabad and identified 8 takeaways from India’s perspective from the documents that were signed. These included upholding fair and balanced connectivity projects in accordance with international law, the goals and principles of the UN Charter and SCO Charter and a fair, open, inclusive and transparent multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.Significantly, another Pakistan minister, Ahsan Iqbal, had told visiting Indian journalists on Tuesday that Pakistan wants the 2 countries to return to the 1999 Lahore Declaration that called upon both sides to refrain from intervening and interfering in each other’s internal affairs. Shehbaz’s brother Nawaz Sharif, who reached the agreement with then Indian PM A B Vajpayee, has repeatedly accused former president Pervez Musharraf of scuttling the Declaration through his Kargil adventurism.","S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days.

"SCO must root out terrorism, respect territorial integrity: Jaishankar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/sco-must-root-out-terrorism-respect-territorial-integrity-jaishankar/articleshow/114294032.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Combating terrorism , extremism and separatism – characterised as “3 evils’’ by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) since its inception in 2001 – is essential for the Eurasian group to realise its goals of balanced growth and integration, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said, addressing the 23meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government in Islamabad.However, Jaishankar did not name or single out Pakistan and ensured his remarks fell strictly under the ambit of the SCO Charter that doesn’t allow bilateral issues to be raised at the forum.Without skirting round the issue of terrorism though, the minister said activities across borders characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism would be detrimental to trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchangesJaishankar sought an honest conversation on the issue saying, “if trust is lacking or cooperation inadequate, if friendship has fallen short and good neighbourliness is missing somewhere, there are surely reasons to introspect and causes to address”. He said attaining these original SCO objectives was even more important in an uncertain world marred by conflicts and debt.“It is axiomatic that development and growth requires peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the three evils,’’ said the minister.In a message to both China and Pakistan, the minister also said SCO cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and connectivity must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. “It should recognize territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas,’’ said the minister, adding cooperation can’t progress if global practices are cherry-picked, especially of trade and transit.India was again the only country in SCO to not endorse China’s BRI in the SCO joint statement. BRI’s flagship China Pakistan Economic Project ( CPEC ) passes through PoK, which India sees as under illegal occupation of Pakistan. Since it became a full member of SCO in 2017, India has repeatedly reminded member-states that it’s important for them to respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. China was represented by Premier Li Qiang in the meeting.The minister also spoke about the need to make the UN Security Council more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable. “The SCO must be in the lead of advocating such change, not hold back on a matter of such importance,’’ said the minister. China is the only P5 country not to publicly declare support for India’s UNSC permanent membership bid.“While we each make our contribution, the world order is more than the sum of its parts. As it changes, global institutions do need to keep pace. That is why the case for ‘reformed multilateralism’ gets stronger by the day. Comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council, both in the permanent and non-permanent categories, is essential,’’ said the minister.","S Jaishankar said activities across borders characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism would be detrimental to trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges.
