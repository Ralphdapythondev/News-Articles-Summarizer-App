The search for a man accused of a heinous attack on a nine-month-old baby has intensified following his swift escape from Australia, authorities confirm. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of a 33-year-old foreign national who is now believed to be overseas.On August 27, a disturbing incident unfolded at Hanlon Park in Stones Corner, Queensland, when a stranger approached a family and allegedly poured a boiling hot coffee over the infant before fleeing the scene.Surveillance footage captured the man running from the park, dressed in a black hat, glasses, a blue shirt, and cargo shorts.Detective Inspector Paul Dalton , leading the South Brisbane district Child Protection Investigation Unit, revealed that the investigation has faced significant hurdles, reported NBC. Despite identifying the suspect on September 1, just 12 hours after the CCTV footage was reviewed, the man had already left Australia on August 31. Dalton described the case as ""one of the most complex and frustrating"" of his career, noting the suspect's apparent counter-surveillance tactics.“It wasn’t until September 1 that we could name the individual,” Dalton explained. “We were initially given incorrect information, which added to the complexity.”The infant, who has undergone multiple surgeries, is now recovering from his injuries. His mother expressed her profound distress over the suspect's escape, revealing the emotional toll the attack has taken on her family. ""It sounds like they were very, very close in catching him,"" she said, her voice breaking with emotion.She described the ongoing fear and anxiety that now haunt her daily life. ""Returning home, I had panic attacks, and I still continue to do so. I will always have fear and anxiety being out in public with my son.""Authorities are working with international partners to locate and apprehend the suspect. While the country to which the suspect fled has not been disclosed, Dalton assured that efforts are underway to bring the accused back to face justice.“The Queensland Police Service is fully committed to doing everything we can lawfully to get this person back here,” Dalton said, reported NBC.A GoFundMe campaign launched for the baby has raised over $150,000, reflecting the public’s support. The boy’s father expressed gratitude for the financial and emotional backing received from the community, highlighting the family’s resilience amid their ordeal.As the investigation continues and the search for the suspect intensifies, the family remains hopeful for justice. “This horrific event should have never happened,” the boy’s mother said. “Hopefully one day justice will be served.”The case remains a stark reminder of the challenges faced in bringing perpetrators to justice, particularly when they evade capture and cross international borders.","A stranger poured boiling hot coffee over a nine-month-old baby in a park in Queensland, Australia, on August 27.

Yagi's devastation: A national crisis

Storm continues to threaten

In a devastating turn of events, the Phong Chau Bridge in northern Vietnam collapsed dramatically as Super Typhoon Yagi unleashed its full force over the weekend. The catastrophic failure of the busiest bridge in the country was captured in harrowing dashcam footage, showing vehicles plunging into the Red River below as floodwaters surged.The moment of disaster was starkly witnessed when a lorry, unable to stop in time, plunged into the raging waters as the bridge decking gave way.Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc confirmed that ten cars and two scooters had fallen into the river.Nguyen Minh Hai , who was riding his motorcycle across the bridge when it collapsed, described his terrifying experience: “I was so scared when I fell down. I felt like I’d just escaped death. I can’t swim and I thought I would have died,” he said from his hospital bed, as reported by BBC.Watch video-The collapse occurred on Monday, following the typhoon's landfall on Saturday. More than 60 lives have been lost since Yagi struck, making it one of the deadliest storms to hit Vietnam in three decades. As rescue operations continued, authorities reported that 13 people were still missing, and searches were underway to locate them.In response to the disaster, the military has been mobilized to construct a temporary pontoon bridge to span the gap left by the collapse. Meanwhile, efforts to rescue survivors from the river have so far saved at least three people.The ongoing damage assessment revealed that part of the 375-meter (1,230-foot) bridge remains intact, though it is unclear when full repairs will be completed.Typhoon Yagi, which brought winds of up to 203 km/h (126 mph), has wreaked widespread havoc across northern Vietnam. The storm left 1.5 million people without power and caused severe infrastructural damage.The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development reported that landslides and flash floods, triggered by the typhoon, resulted in at least 44 deaths, including a 68-year-old woman, a one-year-old boy, and a newborn baby.The storm's wrath extended beyond human casualties; it tore roofs from buildings, uprooted trees, and inflicted extensive damage on factories. Notably, images from Reuters depict the collapsed walls of an LG Electronics factory in Hai Phong city, illustrating the typhoon's destructive force.Though Yagi has weakened into a tropical depression, authorities have warned that it will continue to cause disruptions as it moves westward. With more than 240 people injured, and the damage continuing to unfold, the full impact of Vietnam's most powerful storm of the year is still being assessed.","The Phong Chau Bridge in northern Vietnam collapsed as Super Typhoon Yagi struck.

OSIRIS-APEX: Nasa's spacecraft to study the asteroid

A cosmic relic

What's in a name?

In a cosmic drama unfolding before our eyes, the asteroid 99942 Apophis , dubbed the "" God of Chaos "" for its menacing potential, is making headlines once more. As Earth prepares for an unprecedented celestial rendezvous in 2029, Nasa 's latest revelations promise to keep our eyes on the skies.Discovered in 2004 by astronomers at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Apophis quickly rose to notoriety.With a diameter of approximately 1,100 feet (335 meters), it was initially deemed one of the most dangerous near-Earth objects. The asteroid was predicted to come perilously close to Earth in 2029, sparking fears of a potential collision. This forecast, however, has been revised as astronomers tracked Apophis with increasing precision.The breakthrough came in March 2021. Using the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex and the Green Bank Telescope, scientists gathered high-resolution radar data that allowed them to accurately map Apophis's orbit.Apophis, classified as an S-type asteroid, is composed of silicate materials mixed with nickel and iron. Its shape, resembling a ""peanut,"" adds to the intrigue. Scientists are keen to understand its rotation and structural dynamics, including its potential for ""asteroid quakes"" due to gravitational interactions.On April 13, 2029, Apophis will pass within 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) of Earth's surface—closer than the geostationary satellites that orbit the planet. This close approach will offer a rare, unfiltered view of the asteroid for those in the Eastern Hemisphere. ""Although Apophis made a recent close approach with Earth, it was still nearly 10.6 million miles away,"" explained JPL scientist Marina Brozovic. ""We were able to acquire incredibly precise information about its distance, setting up a wonderful science opportunity.""The recent surge in attention is largely due to reports of Nasa broadcasting a live feed of Apophis , offering a rare glimpse at an asteroid of this magnitude as it hurls through space. However, this claim is incorrect.Although NASA and other astronomers are actively monitoring Apophis due to its close approach to Earth in 2029, there is no continuous live feed dedicated to tracking the asteroid.The potential changes in its trajectory can be tracked on Nasa's official website Experts, however, are reassuring the public that despite the asteroid's nickname, the chances of a collision remain incredibly slim — at least this time around.“Apophis is not on a direct collision course with Earth in 2029,” said Dr Sarah Thompson, a leading astrophysicist at Nasa, according to media reports. “But we’re watching closely, as space objects can have unpredictable behavior over time.”“It’s a one-in-a-million shot, but it’s there,” Dr Thompson added. “We’re using every resource we have to calculate its movements and ensure we’re not taken by surprise.”However, Davide Farnocchia of Nasa’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, said the extensive analysis confirmed that the asteroid poses no threat for at least the next century. ""A 2068 impact is not in the realm of possibility anymore,"" said Farnocchia.As per media reports, if Apophis were to ever strike Earth, the results would be catastrophic. An impact from an asteroid of this size would release energy equivalent to over 1,200 megatons of TNT—enough to flatten entire cities. The event would have both local and global effects, from tsunamis to severe atmospheric disruptions.In anticipation of this close encounter, Nasa has repurposed its OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, now dubbed OSIRIS-APEX, for a detailed study of Apophis. After successfully completing its mission to collect samples from asteroid Bennu in 2023, OSIRIS-APEX will fly by Apophis on April 23, 2029, and then conduct an 18-month investigation. The spacecraft will map Apophis’s surface, analyze its composition, and observe any changes triggered by the flyby.Formed over 4.6 billion years ago, Apophis is a remnant from the early solar system. Its journey from the main asteroid belt to its current near-Earth orbit was shaped by planetary forces, particularly Jupiter's gravity.Named after the ancient Egyptian demon of chaos, Apophis continues to captivate scientists and the public alike. As we prepare for the asteroid’s close approach, it reminds us of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of our solar system.","On April 13, 2029, Apophis will pass within 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) of Earth's surface.

Strict rules on props and interaction

High stakes in a close race

In what is shaping up to be a historic and highly anticipated showdown, US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet in a head-to-head debate on Tuesday night. The event marks the first time the two will directly face off as they vie for the presidency in what has become a closely contested race.The debate, which will be hosted by ABC, follows weeks of heated negotiations between the two campaigns regarding the format, rules , and logistics.As the campaigns sharpen their strategies, voters are eager to witness the direct exchange of ideas and positions between two of the country’s most prominent political figures.The debate will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, a fitting location given its historical significance in American democracy. The 90-minute event is scheduled to start at 9:00 pm local time on Tuesday (6.30 IST Wednesday), and it will be aired live across major networks. Unlike previous debates, this one will take place without an audience in the room, an effort to minimize distractions and ensure the focus remains solely on the candidates.Moderating the debate will be ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, both seasoned journalists known for their sharp questioning and ability to handle tense moments. The debate will feature two commercial breaks, offering brief pauses during what promises to be a charged exchange.One of the most hotly debated topics leading up to the event was whether microphones would be muted, a feature used in the past to prevent interruptions. This issue reignited tensions between the campaigns, with each side accusing the other of dodging tough questions. Trump’s team argued against mic muting, claiming it stifles free speech, while Harris’s camp pointed to past debates where constant interruptions derailed meaningful discussion.ABC ultimately decided that each candidate’s microphone would be live only during their allotted speaking time. When one candidate is speaking, the other’s mic will be muted, ensuring a smoother exchange. Only the moderators will have the authority to ask questions, and no topics or questions have been shared with the candidates beforehand, further adding to the anticipation surrounding the event.There will be no opening statements from the candidates, a departure from typical debate formats. Instead, the candidates will dive directly into answering questions, with each given two minutes per question to state their position. Following this, their opponent will have two minutes to rebut, creating an opportunity for direct engagement on each topic. An additional minute will be provided for follow-ups, clarifications, or further responses, allowing both Trump and Harris to refine their arguments or counter the other’s claims.At the end of the debate, both candidates will have the chance to deliver two-minute closing statements, with Trump going last due to the result of a virtual coin toss. This structure ensures that each candidate will have ample time to make their case while maintaining the debate’s brisk pace.To maintain a level playing field and avoid theatrics, the debate will follow strict rules regarding props and materials. Both candidates will stand behind podiums for the entire duration of the event, and neither will be allowed to bring props or pre-written notes to the stage. They will be equipped with only a pen, a pad of paper, and a bottle of water. This eliminates any opportunity for one candidate to gain an advantage through visual aids or pre-prepared statements.Additionally, campaign staff will not be permitted to communicate or interact with the candidates during the commercial breaks, reinforcing the expectation that Harris and Trump must rely solely on their own preparation and quick thinking.This debate comes at a critical juncture in the election, as polls show a dead heat between the two candidates. For Trump, the event represents an opportunity to demonstrate his continued appeal to voters and defend his record in office. For Harris, the debate is a chance to solidify her position as a presidential contender and challenge Trump’s policies head-on.With the nation watching, both candidates are expected to come prepared for a fiery exchange. The outcome of the debate could shape the direction of the race in its final weeks, making it a must-watch event for voters on all sides of the political spectrum.","US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet in a head-to-head debate on Tuesday night.

The manhunt

Couch’s background

Community response

Joseph A Couch, 32, is the man at the center of a massive manhunt following a shooting spree along Interstate 75 in southeastern Kentucky. Suspected of firing into 12 vehicles and injuring five people, Couch has been the target of a daylong search by local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies.On Saturday evening, Couch allegedly opened fire from a cliff above the interstate, targeting vehicles traveling both northbound and southbound.Authorities responded to reports of gunfire around 5:30 pm (local time), and Couch was quickly identified as a suspect after police recovered his abandoned SUV and an AR-15 rifle near the scene. In total, 20 to 30 rounds were fired, hitting 12 vehicles and leaving five people injured. Despite serious injuries, including one person shot in the face, all victims were reported to be in stable condition.The search for Couch has focused on a rugged, wooded area near the interstate, just outside the city of London, Kentucky. A drone and helicopter equipped with infrared technology have been employed to track his movements, but the challenging terrain has hindered efforts. Authorities suspended the search after nightfall on Sunday but are expected to resume early Monday.Local residents have been urged to lock their doors and avoid the search area, as Couch is believed to be armed and dangerous. Laurel County public schools canceled Monday classes as a precaution.Couch has a military background, having served in the National Guard for four years with an engineer battalion. Despite his service, he has had minor run-ins with the law, including a 2015 conviction for criminal mischief and unlawful transactions with a minor. Earlier this year, he was charged with ""terroristic threatening,"" but the case was dismissed due to the victim's failure to appear in court.Authorities are still investigating Couch’s motives for the shooting, which they described as a “random act” of violence. However, no specific targets were identified, and law enforcement officials emphasized that the attack appeared to be unplanned.The shootings have rattled the small community of London, Kentucky, with several local churches canceling services and residents anxiously following updates. Cody Shepherd, a local resident, noted that police scanners and helicopters dominated the weekend as authorities searched for Couch.""This is tragic... It's a wake-up call when it hits home,"" said Rodney Goodlett, pastor of Faith Assembly of God.As the search continues, police remain determined to bring Couch into custody, vowing to leave no stone unturned in the hunt.","Joseph A Couch, 32, is the man at the center of a massive manhunt following a shooting spree along Interstate 75 in southeastern Kentucky.

With travel insurance, these costs are shifted to the insurance provider, easing the financial burden on the host country. COVID-19 The global COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of health and safety measures. Many countries now require travel insurance to ensure that tourists are financially covered in case they contract the virus during their stay.Travel insurance can significantly impact the visa application process. In some cases, it is even a visa eligibility requirement. If you cause injury or damage during your travels, travel insurance ensures that affected locals receive fair compensation without immediate out-of-pocket expenses from you.

Why are workers in Japan turning to paid services to leave their jobs?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/why-are-workers-in-japan-turning-to-paid-services-to-leave-their-jobs/articleshow/113201498.cms,"The growing demand for resignation services



The struggles of resigning in Japan



Challenges with employers and company culture

In Japan, where workplace loyalty and long hours are deeply ingrained in the culture, resigning from a job can be an emotionally taxing and challenging process. To address this, businesses like Exit and Albatross have stepped in, offering services to help employees resign from their jobs with minimal stress. These companies handle everything from informing employers of the resignation to managing final work-related formalities.Exit, one of the pioneers in this niche market, was launched in 2017.Since then, it has assisted around 10,000 people annually with their resignations. For a fee of 20,000 yen (approximately Rs 11,600), Exit handles the entire resignation process—making the initial call to the employer, discussing the last working day, and collecting company property such as uniforms and technology.Inspired by Exit's success, other companies like Albatross and Momuri have entered the market, offering similar services. Albatross manages the resignation process by contacting the employer and specifying the employee's last working day. Momuri, which translates to ""I can't do this anymore,"" has also gained popularity, reflecting the widespread difficulties workers face in Japan.The demand for resignation services is driven by the difficulties where many Japanese workers encounter when trying to quit their jobs. The pressure from employers can be immense, with some employees reporting that resignation letters have been torn up or that they have faced harassment when attempting to leave. Exit's co-founder, Toshiyuki Niino, explains that in Japan, people are not typically educated to debate or express opinions, making the resignation process particularly stressful.The resignation difficulties often stem from poor workplace conditions. Employees frequently deal with difficult bosses, unpaid overtime, and restrictions on using paid time off. While most bosses accept resignations when handled by a third party, some situations require legal negotiations. According to Shinji Tanimoto, CEO of Albatross, legal involvement is sometimes necessary when employers are reluctant to let employees go.Interestingly, as these services become more popular, some Japanese companies have started reaching out to quitting agencies for referrals when they need to fill positions, signalling a shift in the traditional employment practices in Japan.","In Japan, where workplace loyalty and long hours are deeply ingrained in the culture, resigning from a job can be an emotionally taxing and challenging process.

US woman senator using male chief of staff as 'sex slave': Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-woman-senator-using-male-chief-of-staff-as-sex-slave-report/articleshow/113209511.cms,"A California state senator has been accused of forcing her male chief of staff into a sexually abusive relationship, leading to physical injuries.Republican Senator Marie Alvarado-Gil, 50, faces a lawsuit filed by her former chief of staff, 57-year-old Chad Condit , in which he claims she used him as a ""sex slave,"" resulting in a serious back injury, the Daily mail reported.Condit, the son of former Congressman Gary Condit , alleges that Alvarado-Gil frequently coerced him into performing oral sex, including one instance in a car that led to herniated discs in his back.In the civil lawsuit filed in Sacramento superior court, he describes the relationship as ""sex-based quid pro quo"" marked by ""unwelcome advances and sexual behaviors coupled with punishment and flexing of power.""Alvarado-Gil, who was elected in 2022 and hired Condit soon after, fired him in December 2023. She has strongly denied the allegations, labeling Condit as ""a disgruntled former employee"" who has ""fabricated an outlandish story ... to get a payday.""According to the lawsuit, one incident occurred when the two were on a trip to Inyo County. After returning to the car, Condit claims, ""She had her pants pulled down and said, 'I want you to kiss it and prove your loyalty.'"" The lawsuit recounts that she exposed herself and demanded he perform oral sex. Condit says he complied out of fear and numbness after months of alleged abuse.Condit further claims that during one encounter in the confined space of a car, he suffered significant physical injuries.""He performed the act 'in a car seat with his body having to twist and contort,'"" which, according to the lawsuit, led to ""three herniated discs in his back and a collapsed hip.""As Condit began to resist her advances, he claims, Alvarado-Gil became unhappy and retaliated by threatening his job. The lawsuit details how her advances intensified, with the senator allegedly making inappropriate comments about his father’s scandal-ridden past and even discussing sexual fantasies with Condit and other staff members.The lawsuit also claims that Alvarado-Gil made remarks about ""throuples"" and speculated whether Condit’s wife would be interested in such a relationship.Condit alleges that Alvarado-Gil would make sexualized comments about colleagues, including stating that if Republican state Sen. Roger Niello ""was younger and I was single, I would jump his bones.""By August 2023, Condit says he began to reject her demands for oral sex, using his back injury as a reason. Shortly after, Condit claims he received a ""bogus disciplinary letter"" accusing him of inappropriate behavior. He also says Alvarado-Gil visited his home to accuse him of infidelity to his wife.In October 2023, Condit underwent surgery for his back injuries, and by the end of the year, Alvarado-Gil fired him. Condit asserts that before his termination, she had threatened to hire his wife, Helen , as further retaliation.The lawsuit also names the California State Senate, accusing its staff of allowing the alleged harassment. Condit claims the Secretary of the Senate ""blindly accepted Alvarado-Gil's retaliatory actions and ratified her abuse of him.""Secretary of the Senate Erika Contreras responded on Friday, stating that while the Senate takes all complaints seriously, it could not comment on ongoing litigation. Alvarado-Gil's attorney, Ognian Gavrilov , dismissed the allegations as the work of a ""disgruntled former employee"" seeking financial gain, asserting that the senator would be cleared of any wrongdoing.Condit and Alvarado-Gil have had a contentious relationship, with public feuds in the past. Alvarado-Gil previously filed an ethics complaint against Condit in May, seeking an investigation into his handling of infrastructure funding. Additionally, Alvarado-Gil, who switched her party affiliation from Democrat to Republican in August 2023, has been a controversial figure due to her stance on crime policies.The lawsuit does not allege any instances of sexual intercourse, but Condit claims the abuse was ongoing throughout his employment. Alvarado-Gil, a mother of six, is also married, and the lawsuit claims she had an understanding with her husband, who allegedly cheated on her as well.","Republican Senator Marie Alvarado-Gil, 50, faces a lawsuit filed by her former chief of staff, 57-year-old Chad Condit.

Recently, Celine Dion, Foo Fighters, and ABBA have also expressed their disapproval of Trump using their music in his 2024 election campaign.Last month, Foo Fighters stated that they did not authorise the Trump campaign to use their song “My Hero,” which was played at a rally in Arizona where Trump was joined by Robert Kennedy Jr, shortly after Kennedy endorsed the former president.Pop star Celine Dion's management team released a statement condemning the use of her classic song ""My Heart Will Go On"" during a campaign rally.","Jack White and Meg White, members of the White Stripes, sued Trump, his campaign, and his deputy director of communications.

"US elections 2024: Harris leads national polls ahead of key debate, but Trump narrows gap in swing states",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-2024-harris-leads-national-polls-ahead-of-key-debate-but-trump-narrows-gap-in-swing-states/articleshow/113208649.cms,"US elections: Polling expert noted that the momentum has shifted slightly in Trump’s favor, warning that Harris could face further challenges as Republicans continue to paint her as too progressive.

Polls show a close race

Swing state showdown

High-stakes debate ahead

Tight polls, strong fundraising for Harris

Momentum shifts and challenges

As the 2024 US presidential election approaches on November 5, what was expected to be a repeat of the 2020 election turned into a high-stakes contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump following Joe Biden's exit from the race for the White House. This left the nation wondering whether it would witness a historic moment with its first female president or a return to Trump’s leadership.Polls had consistently shown Biden trailing Trump before he exited the race.At that time, Kamala Harris was also not polling strongly, but after hitting the campaign trail, she managed to narrow the gap. According to recent national polling averages, Harris led with 47%, while Trump sat at 44%, reported BBC. Harris’s campaign received a slight bump during the Democratic convention in Chicago, where she spoke of “a new way forward.” However, Trump’s endorsement by Robert F. Kennedy in late August did not seem to alter the race, as his numbers remained relatively steady.While these national figures offered insights, they did not paint the full picture due to the US Electoral College system. The real battle was fought in a handful of swing states—Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and others—that could tip the scales in either direction. In these key battlegrounds, the margin between the candidates was razor-thin, often less than one percentage point. Pennsylvania, with its significant electoral vote count, was expected to play a crucial role in determining the winner.The looming presidential debate is expected to be a game-changer. A New York Times/Siena poll suggested that Trump held a narrow one-point lead nationally, signaling that the race remained highly competitive. What was even more telling was that while 90% of voters said they knew all they needed to about Trump, only 71% said the same about Harris. This discrepancy meant that Harris had much more to prove during the debate, where a large audience was tuning in to decide between the two candidates.“We were up against a guy who was a convicted felon, a terrible president, and continued to be a terrible human,” a Democratic strategist said. “Yet, this race was still tight as a tick.”Despite the neck-and-neck race, some Democrats believed the tight polls could actually benefit Harris. “I was glad this poll came out. It was a gift to Democrats,” said Anthony Coley, a former Biden administration official, who saw the close numbers as a motivating factor.Polling expert Nate Silver also noted that the momentum had shifted slightly in Trump’s favor, warning that Harris could face further challenges as Republicans continued to paint her as too progressive. A Times poll reflected this narrative, with 44% of respondents agreeing that Harris was too progressive compared to 32% for Trump being too conservative.Still, Harris’s camp remained optimistic, with strategists pointing to her strong fundraising numbers. In August, her campaign raised a staggering $361 million—nearly triple what Trump’s campaign brought in. Democratic strategist Christy Setzer downplayed concerns over Trump’s recent lead in the polls, saying, “Anyone worried that a single poll, showing Trump up by a single point, needed more drama in their life.”Harris’s base continued to rally behind her, with packed campaign events across swing states. “The paths that Kamala Harris had to 270 [electoral votes] had expanded from when she stepped into the race,” noted Democratic strategist Joel Payne.As the campaign intensified, all eyes were on the upcoming debate, where Harris had the chance to elevate her candidacy and shift the narrative in her favor.",The 2024 US presidential election will be held on November 5. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are in a neck-and-neck race.

"'America's no. 1 condom' allegedly contains cancer-causing 'forever chemicals,' lawsuit claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/americas-no-1-trojan-condom-allegedly-contains-cancer-causing-forever-chemicals-lawsuit-claims/articleshow/113207169.cms,"Study reveals PFAS contamination in condoms and lubricants

PFAS absorption through skin higher than previously thought

A new lawsuit claims that Trojan condoms, marketed as ""America's No. 1 Condom,"" contain toxic ""forever chemicals"" linked to cancer. Plaintiff Matthew Goodman filed the proposed class action in Manhattan federal court, alleging that the condoms contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are harmful to health. PFAS , known for their persistence in the environment and human body, are used in many consumer products for their non-stick and water-resistant properties.Goodman claims lab tests of Trojan Ultra Thin condoms revealed the presence of organic fluorine, a marker for PFAS, and that these chemicals are not disclosed on the packaging. He argues that had he known about the presence of these chemicals, he would not have purchased the product or would have paid significantly less. The lawsuit seeks at least $5 million in damages for customers nationwide who purchased Trojan condoms.PFAS exposure has been linked to several health issues, including cancer, low birth weights, and reduced immune response. Church & Dwight, the manufacturer, has not yet responded to requests for comment following the lawsuit.A study by consumer advocacy group Mamavation has uncovered potential contamination of condoms and lubricants with PFAS, or ""forever chemicals."" The EPA-certified lab testing found traces of PFAS in 14% of the 29 products tested, including Trojan Ultra Thin condoms. The tests detected organic fluorine, a sign of PFAS, in 3 out of 25 condom samples and 1 out of 4 lubricants. These chemicals are widely used for their water, oil, and stain-resistant properties but are persistent and toxic.The contamination is believed to stem from manufacturing processes, where PFAS may be unintentionally introduced into the products. Linda Birnbaum , a scientist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, raised concerns about exposure in sensitive areas of the body, saying, ""The vagina and penis are highly vascular areas, making them more vulnerable to the effects of toxic chemicals.""Mamavation has called for the condom industry to take action to remove PFAS from these products, stressing that the full health risks of exposure in intimate areas are not yet known. Consumers are encouraged to seek safer alternatives while manufacturers work on addressing potential contamination.Recent research, titled Dermal bioavailability of perfluoroalkyl substances using in vitro 3D human skin equivalent models, has shown that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can be absorbed through the skin at higher levels than previously believed. In the study, human skin models were exposed to 17 different PFAS compounds, and certain chemicals, such as perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), had the highest absorption rates, at 58.9% and 48.7%, respectively.Shorter-chain PFAS, particularly those with carbon chains of eight or fewer atoms, showed greater absorption compared to longer-chain variants, which tend to accumulate in the skin rather than being directly absorbed. The study also suggested that factors like skin pH could influence how PFAS penetrate the skin. Even in ionised forms, PFAS can still permeate the skin, indicating that dermal exposure may be a significant source of PFAS absorption.","Plaintiff Matthew Goodman filed the proposed class action in Manhattan federal court.

Kennedy Jr. will remain on the state’s November presidential ballot, despite his efforts to withdraw and endorse former President Donald Trump . Kennedy had suspended his independent campaign in August and filed a lawsuit to remove his name, fearing he would take votes away from Trump in the crucial battleground state.Kennedy’s lawyer, Aaron Siri, criticised the ruling, arguing it would confuse voters. “This plainly has nothing to do with ballot or election integrity,” he said, claiming the decision would mislead voters into supporting a withdrawn candidate. Meanwhile, Benson’s office praised the court's swift action, with spokesperson Angela Benander noting that election officials can now continue preparing ballots on time.Kennedy sued Michigan’s Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to withdraw from the ballot, hoping to prevent splitting votes in a state where Trump won by just 10,000 votes in 2016. However, the court's decision overturned a lower court ruling, ensuring Kennedy's name will remain. The justices stated that Kennedy ""has not shown an entitlement to this extraordinary relief.”The ruling undermines Kennedy's attempt to consolidate support for Trump. Last week, Kennedy encouraged his supporters to vote for Trump “no matter what state you live in.” While his poll numbers were in single digits before he withdrew, a recent CNN poll showed Kennedy still had 4% support in Michigan, a figure that could influence the outcome. The same poll found Vice President Kamala Harris leading with 48% against Trump’s 43%.Kennedy has tried to remove his name from ballots in other key states.

Authorities have provided new details on the man accused of shooting five people on Interstate 75 in Kentucky. According to an arrest warrant, Joseph Couch , 32, sent a chilling text message just 30 minutes before the incident, vowing to ""kill a lot of people.""The warrant, written by Capt. Richard Dalrymple of the Laurel County Sheriff’s Office, states that Couch texted a woman at 5:03 p.m.saying, ""I’m going to kill a lot of people. Well, try at least,"" followed by another message where he threatened to take his own life. The woman who received the texts has been identified by the Lexington Herald-Leader as Couch’s ex-wife, though their relationship is not detailed in the affidavit.Authorities responded to the first report of the shooting around 5:30 p.m. but struggled to locate Couch’s phone until nearly 7:00 p.m., about 90 minutes after the shooting. Couch is charged with five counts each of attempted murder and first-degree assault.A search of the area near where Couch’s vehicle was abandoned uncovered a green duffel bag with Couch’s name, spent shell casings, and a Colt AR-15 rifle. Authorities believe Couch fired 20 to 30 rounds, hitting multiple vehicles.Law enforcement has been conducting a rigorous search in a densely wooded area near London, Kentucky, where the shooting took place. Local officials have pledged to continue the search until Couch is apprehended. ""We’re not going to quit until we do lay hands on him,"" said Sheriff John Root .Several school districts in southeastern Kentucky closed as the search continued into its third day.

New US antitrust trial focuses on Google's online ad dominance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-us-antitrust-trial-focuses-on-googles-online-ad-dominance/articleshow/113204932.cms,"One month after a judge declared Google's search engine an illegal monopoly, the tech giant faces another antitrust lawsuit that threatens to break up the company, this time over its advertising technology. The justice department , joined by a coalition of states, and Google each made opening statements Monday to a federal judge who will decide whether Google holds a monopoly over online advertising technology.The regulators contend that Google built, acquired and maintains a monopoly over the technology that matches online publishers to advertisers. Dominance over the software on both the buy side and the sell side of the transaction enables Google to keep as much as 36 cents on the dollar when it brokers sales between publishers and advertisers, the govt contends in court papers. They allege that Google also controls the ad exchange market, which matches the buy side to the sell side. ""One monopoly is bad enough. But a trifecta of monopolies is what we have here,"" justice department lawyer Julia Tarver Wood said.In her opening statement, Google lawyer Karen Dunn said the govt's case is based on an internet of yesteryear. The company says the case is improperly focused on display ads and banner ads that load on web pages accessed through a desktop computer and fails to take into account consumers' migration to mobile apps and the boom in ads placed on social media sites.As per Google's annual reports, revenue has actually declined in recent years for Google Networks , the division that includes services like AdSense and Google Ad Manager that are at the heart of the case, from $31.7 billion in 2021 to $31.3 billion in 2023,The Virginia case comes on the heels of Google's defeat over its search engine, which generates the majority of its $307 billion in annual revenue.

'Inspired attacks across the world'

Facing serious charges

The US department of justice ( DOJ ) announced criminal charges against two alleged leaders of a white supremacist group, the Terrorgram Collective, accusing them of inciting attacks against Black, Jewish, LGBTQ people, and immigrants to provoke a race war. Dallas Humber , 34, and Matthew Allison , 37, were arrested on Friday and face a 15-count indictment for soliciting hate crimes, the murder of federal officials, and providing material support to terrorists.According to the indictment unsealed in Sacramento, California, the Terrorgram Collective operated on the social media platform Telegram, where they encouraged white supremacist violence and sought to destabilize the US by targeting government officials and critical infrastructure. ""Today's arrests are a warning that committing hate-fueled crimes in the darkest corners of the internet will not hide you,"" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. ""We will hold you accountable.""The group’s ideology, known as white supremacist accelerationism, promotes the belief that societal collapse is necessary to establish a white ethnostate. The indictment alleges that Humber and Allison led the group in producing propaganda videos and publications promoting violent actions, including bias-motivated attacks and terrorist attacks on government infrastructure.Dallas Humber and Matthew Allison , leaders of the Terrorgram Collective, meticulously planned a series of violent acts to advance their white supremacist ideology. They aimed to incite a race war and destabilize the US by targeting government infrastructure and high-profile officials. Their strategy involved detailed instructions on how to execute attacks on federal buildings, energy facilities, and individuals deemed “high-value targets” based on race, religion, or other identifiers. By using the Telegram platform, they disseminated propaganda, created hit lists, and guided followers on carrying out bias-motivated and terrorist attacks.""Attacks on “high-value targets” — like politicians and government officials — whose murders Terrorgram believes would sow chaos and further accelerate the government’s downfall,"" the DOJ said.The Terrorgram Collective's influence extended far beyond the US, inspiring violent acts around the world. Their propaganda and guidance led to real-world attacks, including a deadly shooting outside an LGBT bar in Slovakia, a planned assault on energy facilities in New Jersey, and a stabbing near a mosque in Turkey. These incidents underscore the group's ability to incite violence globally, demonstrating how extremist ideologies can motivate and direct individuals to commit acts of terror and hatred across international borders. The widespread impact of their actions highlights the urgent need for global cooperation in combating such extremist threats.The charges against Humber and Allison include conspiracy, soliciting hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials, doxing, threatening communications, and distributing bomb-making instructions. If convicted, they each face a maximum penalty of 220 years in prison. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke reiterated the federal government’s resolve to combat hate crimes, especially as extremist groups increasingly turn to online platforms. ""The Justice Department is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans,"" she said.The case remains under investigation by the FBI's Sacramento and Salt Lake City offices, with support from multiple law enforcement agencies. The DOJ’s Civil Rights and National Security Divisions are leading the prosecution.","Dallas Humber, 34, and Matthew Allison, 37, were arrested on Friday and face a 15-count indictment for soliciting hate crimes, the murder of federal officials, and providing material support to terrorists.

Several top leaders of Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad. The arrests included barrister Gohar Khan, Sher Afzal Marwat, and advocate Shoaib Shaheen, following a violent clash between PTI supporters and police during a protest demanding Khan's release. The arrests have been widely condemned by PTI as politically motivated.PTI has vehemently opposed the arrests, calling them a ""direct attack on democracy."" In posts on X (formerly Twitter), the party criticised the government's actions, arguing that the arrests are an attempt to suppress their movement.PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari condemned the detentions as ""illegal"" and said, ""These arrests won’t change anything; they will only increase public anger against this puppet government.""Omar Ayub Khan, another senior PTI figure, also denounced the arrests and revealed that police had been forming teams to apprehend him and other top PTI members, including Zartaj Gul Wazir . ""This fascist regime has gone completely mad... We will continue raising our voices for our leader, PM Imran Khan ,"" he wrote on X.Despite the crackdown, many PTI lawmakers remained inside Parliament House to avoid arrest, and more detentions are expected in the coming days. The Islamabad high court bar association has also condemned the arrests, demanding the release of Marwat and Shaheen, both respected members of the legal community.The arrests occur amidst growing political tension in Pakistan. Imran Khan, who has been imprisoned since 2022 on corruption charges, remains a central figure in the country's political landscape. His supporters’ continued protests and the government’s aggressive response have only heightened the political discord.The arrests were made under the newly enacted Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Bill, 2024. This legislation, which came into effect just before the PTI rally, empowers authorities to regulate and ban public gatherings in Islamabad. Under this law, the district magistrate can disband any assembly deemed likely to disturb public peace, with penalties including up to three years in prison or fines. Repeat offenders face even harsher penalties, potentially extending to 10 years of imprisonment. The PTI leaders were accused of violating these regulations by inciting their supporters to clash with police during the protest.","Top leaders of Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad.

Strategy backfires

NEW DELHI: In an unusual critique of the military establishment, Pakistan 's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three-star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism throughout the country.In September 2021, as the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan after the sudden pullout of US troops in August, then ISI chief general Faiz Hameed had visited Kabul and was photographed enjoying tea, during which he assured a journalist that ""everything will be fine"" -- a pivotal point in Pakistan's military and intelligence strategy towards Afghanistan.""The country is paying a price for that cup of tea in Afghanistan,"" said Dar, without naming Hameed.The deputy PM further said that the decision by the general to release some militants was the reason behind increased attacks across Pakistan. ""Those released at that time are masterminding terrorism in Balochistan today,"" he said, indicating there is a widely held belief that the decisions made by military leaders during this period were not only misguided but have also contributed to the current instability in Pakistan.Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, made the rem­a­rks during a press conference at the Pakistan High Commi­ss­i­on in London.Stating that the 2021 visit to Kabul could not have happened without the permission of former PM Imran Khan, Dar hit out at the ""mistakes"" made by the ousted leader, particularly in relation to economic and security decisions, and linked the former administration's ""missteps"" to the current rise in terrorism and economic challenges.""I find it difficult to accept that he [Hameed] could have gone without the permission of the prime minister [Imran Khan]. We are working with the security establishment on issues today, these things are not possible without the PM's approval,"" said Dar.After criticising military officials of the ""past"", Dar was quick to praise the curr­ent military establishm­ent.""They cannot be praised en­o­ugh as its members are very professional. Their agenda is Pakistan, as is ours. This is a very good omen. They are not interested in who comes in government or opposition,"" he said.The Taliban's rise to power was initially seen by some in Pakistan as a potential boon, with expectations that the group would help curb the activities of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has long posed a threat to the Pakistani state.However, the reality has proven to be quite different, with the TTP intensifying its attacks since the Taliban's takeover, undermining the very stability that Pakistan hoped to achieve through its support of the Taliban.The situation in Balochistan is particularly alarming. The province has witnessed a significant uptick in violence, with attacks attributed to both the TTP and other militant groups.The Pakistani military's response has included increased operations against these groups, but the effectiveness of these measures remains in question. Dar's comments suggest a recognition that past decisions, particularly those made by military leaders like Hameed, have directly contributed to the current security crisis.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three- star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism.

The rally - postponed twice in the last two months - was held near Sangjani Cattle Market in the suburbs of Islamabad after the capital administration issued a no-objection certificate (NOC).Thousands of PTI supporters attended the rally, proving that the party's power base was intact despite several hurdles it faced, including the incarceration of its 71-year-old founder.Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been in jail in different cases. On Sunday, Khan completed 400 days in prison.The rally was scheduled to end at 7 pm (local time) as per the NOC. As soon as the deadline ended, the district administration directed the police to take action against the rally-goers for not complying with the NOC.The authorities stated that the organisers violated the rules and regulations by not concluding the gathering before the deadline.In response to the crackdown, PTI workers began pelting stones at police, injuring many security personnel, including Senior Superintendent of Police Shoaib Khan .""Strong turnout for PTI rally despite the state's tactics to limit numbers through roadblocks and containers, and despite the risk of violent crackdowns and arrests. Its size and popularity ensure its mobilization capabilities remain intact despite relentless attempts to curb it,"" Micheal Kugleman, a South Asian expert, said in a post on X.Several PTI leaders addressed the gathering, demanding Khan's immediate release. PTI leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan said the party would not sit until Khan was released.""We are soldiers of Imran Khan and will not sit until he is set free,"" he said, adding that soon Khan would be with his supporters.He condemned physical hurdles put on roads to restrict the movement of participants and also announced that the PTI would now hold rallies across the country.It was the first major rally by the PTI in Islamabad since the February 8 elections. The party wants to exert pressure on the government to release Khan, who languishes in jail despite the courts either acquitting him or giving him bail in all cases he was convicted.PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said the government turned the city into a cage, but still thousands of people attended the rally. ""It shows that Imran Khan is a reality, and you will have to accept it...Imran Khan is a leader and will always be a leader,"" he said.He told the participants that Khan was their only leader who never surrendered and would never surrender. He warned that the PTI would not accept new cases against Khan.Gohar said that the PTI planned this rally for six months and followed Khan's instructions to hold the rally after getting permission from the government. He criticised the government for introducing a new law to restrict political activities.Slogans were raised during the rally demanding Khan's release from jail.He ended his speech with the promise that ""Imran Khan will be soon out of jail and with his people"".The key speech was made by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur who came from Peshawar, leading a large number of Khan's supporters from the province.In his emotional address, he vowed to continue the struggle for the rights of people. He said those who put Khan in jail were being humiliated while ""Khan is winning in jail"".He said that the government gave permission for the rally and blocked all roads leading to the venue of the rally. ""Imran Khan you have won while all others lost,"" he said, vowing to go to any length for Khan.He also announced to hold the next rally in Lahore, irrespective of whether the government gives permission or not.Gandapur also rejected that Khan would be tried under army law, saying no one could do it.Khan has repeatedly shown a willingness to hold talks with the establishment while refusing to sit with the government. So far, all his tactics have failed to get any relief. Mass protest is an option, but his party has been facing pressure to avoid it.Today's rally was a test for both the government and the PTI as it will help them gauge the ground power swell for Khan and fine-tune their policies and tactics in the coming days.Sources told PTI that the Islamabad administration put security on high alert this morning and blocked off multiple arteries leading to the capital city. Hospitals were put on alert by the administration. The Metro bus services were stopped in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Addressing the rally, former minister Hammad Azhar said the hindrance created by the rulers showed that they were afraid of Khan and his supporters.He pointed out that most of the party's Punjab leadership is in jail, paying tribute to incarcerated leaders, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Umar Sarfraz Cheema .Another leader Sher Afzal Marwat said they will soon hold rallies in Punjab for Khan's release and the supremacy of law and the Constitution.""We will enter Punjab with 50,000 people from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa within a week,"" he said, adding that they will even set off on foot and face the tear gas.Additional forces have been summoned to the location where the clash between the police and party workers originally started.Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law the Public Order and Peaceful Assembly Bill 2024 hours before the planned rally, instituting strict measures for unauthorised gatherings.The new law introduces penalties for holding gatherings without permission in Islamabad, with violators facing up to three years in prison and fines.

Despite being denied permission several times earlier, the PTI brought together supporters from across the province, as reported by Dawn.Addressing the rally, senior PTI leader Hammad Azhar said that the gathering was a stand for the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution in Pakistan. ""We will, God willing, secure Imran Khan's release,"" Azhar said, adding that no obstacle would deter their cause.The rally had originally been scheduled for July, then postponed to August, before being further delayed due to security concerns cited by authorities. PTI has been pushing for Imran Khan’s release since his imprisonment in August.Although Khan’s conviction in the Iddat case was recently overturned, his release was blocked by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), which arrested him in connection with a new Toshakhana case shortly after. His previous Toshakhana sentences were suspended, and he was also acquitted in the cipher case by the Islamabad high court.PTI has been trying to secure permission for a public meeting in Islamabad for several months, but the district administration has repeatedly denied their requests, citing security risks. The party even approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in March for approval.In July, PTI announced another protest , but the district administration revoked their non-objection certificate (NOC) at the last moment, delaying the rally until September 8. Despite preparations for the event, the capital police blocked major entry points to the city, citing intelligence reports of a ""medium-level"" terrorism threat linked to the gathering.Senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser decried the government’s preventive measures, including the placement of containers and police blockades. ""It is unfortunate that this fascist government with a stolen mandate is creating such a hostile environment,"" Qaiser said in a video message posted on X. ""They approved the NOC and the court has permitted the rally, but Rawalpindi has been closed off.""PTI Punjab spokesperson Shaukat Basra also claimed that the police in Punjab had received ""unconstitutional"" orders to block workers from joining the rally.","The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) has accused the police of opening fire on its supporters during a rally in Islamabad on Sunday. The party members gathered to demand the release of their imprisoned leader and former Prime Minister, Imran Khan. In a social media post, PTI condemned what it called ""heavy shelling"" on peaceful protesters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113171864,imgsize-618089,width-400,resizemode-4/113171864.jpg"
"Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan likely to face military trial, says defence minister Khawaja Asif",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/former-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-likely-to-face-military-trial-says-defence-minister-khawaja-asif/articleshow/113166679.cms,"Pakistan's defence minister , Khawaja Asif , has indicated that former Prime Minister Imran Khan will likely face a military trial as legal challenges continue to mount against him. Speaking to a private news channel Geo News, Asif said, ""Evidence against the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) points towards military trial.""Imran Khan has been embroiled in numerous legal cases, including one related to the May 9 riots, where military installations were attacked.Fearing prosecution in a military court, Khan filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking to halt the trial. However, the IHC raised concerns about the petition's validity, citing the absence of a specific first information report (FIR) or supporting documentation.Khan's petition comes amid ongoing legal debates. In December 2023, Pakistan's Supreme Court , in a 5:1 majority ruling, suspended an earlier decision that declared civilians' military trials unlawful. This ruling, tied to the May 9 riots, has left the final decision on military trials pending the court's verdict on intra-court appeals filed by the federal and provincial governments and the defence ministry.Asif also commented on former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, who he claimed aspired to become Pakistan's army chief. Asif alleged that Faiz had reached out to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) seeking support for his bid, offering loyalty in exchange. Faiz, currently facing allegations of land grabbing, was arrested by the army in August.""General (retd) Faiz wanted to become army chief, his name was on the list. He contacted the PML-N leadership in this regard and assured of his loyalty against support for his bid for army chief,"" said Asif.He further noted that Faiz's frustrations grew after the appointment of the current army chief. Asif suggested that Faiz may now try to deflect blame onto others, adding, ""He [Faiz] might say that even if he was part of the conspiracy then the objectives [of conspiracy] were of the PTI founder's and not his.""Meanwhile, Imran Khan, who is currently detained in Adiala Jail, has warned of protests if the government undermines the judiciary's independence. In a message shared on social media, Khan said, ""Pakistan's army belongs to everyone – to the whole nation – not just one political party or the army chief. They robbed the election and are now not allowing the judiciary to function independently.""Khan also criticised the treatment of Pakistan's current leadership in prison, claiming they enjoyed preferential conditions compared to him. ""I have not spent a single day at the prison hospital,"" he said, contrasting his treatment with that of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and others, who, according to him, had access to air-conditioned rooms with en-suite bathrooms during their time in custody.","Khawaja Asif says evidence against Imran Khan points towards military trial.

On both occasions, the military had publicly denied direct involvement, saying indigenous Kashmiri rebels were fighting Indian forces.In 1999, however, thousands of paramilitary Northern Light Infantry regulars, drawn exclusively from Gilgit-Baltistan and skilled in high-altitude combat, were sent to occupy military posts that Indian troops would vacate in the snowy months.They established positions on the heights and commanded a view of the Srinagar-Leh highway, a major supply route for Indian troops stationed on the Siachen glacier.When India detected the incursion in early May 1999, Pakistan had claimed they were Kashmiri militants fighting Indian rule.According to observers, Pakistan had sent troops to Kargil to cut Indian supplies to Siachen, inflict heavy losses on Indian troops and pressure them into negotiating a settlement of the Kashmir dispute on Pakistani terms. Since Islamabad had conducted nuclear tests a year earlier, Pakistani generals were expecting a muted response from India.But the Indians hit back hard, sending infantry backed by artillery and air support. By mid-June the Pakistani positions on the hills began to fall. There were also international calls for Pakistan to withdraw its forces. Evidence suggested the Pakistani military leadership had not shared details of the Kargil operation with the govt of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif . On July 4, Sharif was forced to announce a unilateral ceasefire. His govt was toppled in a military coup two months later.India had reconquered the Kargil heights by July 26. It lost more than 500 troops in the war, while estimates of Pakistani losses range from 400 to about 4,000. Thousands of people made homeless by the war are displaced in Pakistan to this day.","Pakistan's military had attempted on at least two occasions to send its forces into Kashmir to start a rebellion against Indian rule.

The discovery could potentially offer a drastic boost to the nation's economy, according to a Pakistani senior security official quoted by DawnNewsTV.The official explained that the survey has successfully identified the location of the reserves, and relevant government bodies have been informed.These resources, located in the depths of Pakistani waters, represent a critical step towards capitalising what the official referred to as the "" blue water economy .""While this discovery could lead to a major boost for Pakistan’s energy sector, the process of exploration is still in its early stages.The work of digging wells and actually getting oil out could take several years. The official also talked about the potential of the blue water economy, pointing out that valuable minerals and elements could be extracted from the ocean, providing additional economic benefits for Pakistan.Estimates suggest that this discovery could be among the world’s largest oil and gas reserves , potentially placing Pakistan as the holder of the fourth-largest deposit globally.Venezuela currently leads in terms of oil reserves, with approximately 3.4 billion barrels, followed by countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Canada, and Iraq. The US is also notable for holding the most significant untapped shale oil reserves.In an interview with DawnNewsTV, Muhammad Arif, a former member of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) said that while the discovery is a positive development, there is no guarantee the reserves will be as large or easily recoverable as initially hoped.He said, ""If this is a gas reserve, it can replace LNG imports and if these are oil reserves, we can substitute imported oil.""The significant financial investment needed to explore offshore oil and gas reserves, estimating the cost at around $5 billion just for exploration, further claimed Arif.","A significant deposit of petroleum and natural gas has been discovered within Pakistan's territorial waters.

NEW DELHI: In a first, Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War , during a recent defence day speech. Previous army chiefs and political leaders, such as Pervez Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif, have acknowledged Pakistan's involvement in the Kargil operation.According to several media reports, General Munir -- while addressing a ceremony at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi to mark the country's 59th Defence Day, said: ""Be it 1948, 1965, 1971 or 1999 Kargil war, thousands of Shuhadas (martyrs) have sacrificed their life for the country and nation.""This marks the first time a serving army chief has openly admitted to the army's direct role in a conflict that has long been shrouded in denial and controversy in Pakistan.The audio of the video, which has been circulated widely online, has not been independently verified.For years, Pakistan's military and political leadership has maintained a narrative that distanced itself from the Kargil operations, often referring to the infiltrators as mere ""Kashmiri freedom fighters"".India has, however, repeatedly said that the operation was a calculated military strategy aimed at altering the Line of Control (LoC) and asserting Pakistan's claim over Kashmir.The Kargil War was characterised by its high-altitude combat and brutal conditions, taking place in one of the most challenging terrains on Earth.The Pakistani military's strategy involved infiltrating troops disguised as militants into Indian territory, occupying strategic heights that overlooked key supply routes.The operation was intended to disrupt Indian logistics and draw international attention to the Kashmir issue, thereby internationalising the longstanding conflict.In strong retaliation to the Pakistan 'infiltrators', between mid-May and July 1999, the Indian Armed Forces gradually recaptured critical positions from the Pakistani infiltrators. The Kargil War officially concluded on July 26, 1999, when the Army announced the complete eviction of Pakistani forces from Indian soil.Over two months, intense battles took place in the challenging mountainous terrain. The Indian Army, as part of Operation Vijay, managed to drive out Pakistani intruders and successfully recaptured Tiger Hill and other strategic positions.","Pakistan army chief publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War.

The incentivised deals included high guaranteed returns and commitments to even pay for unused power.However, a sustained economic crisis has slashed power consumption, leaving the country with excess capacity that it needs to pay for.Short of funds, the government has built those fixed costs and capacity payments into consumer bills, sparking protests by domestic users and industrial associations.Four sources in the power sector told Reuters changes to contracts demanded included slashing guaranteed returns, capping dollar rates and moving away from paying for unused power. The sources requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.On Saturday, local media outlet Business Recorder said in a report citing sources that 24 conditions have been proposed for the transition of capacity based model to take-and-pay model.However, Leghari told Reuters that no new draft agreements or specific demands had been officially sent to power companies and said the government would not force them to sign new watered down contracts.""We would sit and talk to them in a civil and professional manner,"" he said, adding that the government has always maintained contractual obligations to investors, both foreign and local.

Pakistan has also committed to stop power sector subsidies.Leghari said current rates were not affordable for domestic or commercial consumers and this was hurting growth because power prices were no longer regionally competitive, putting critical exports at a disadvantage.He said the aim was to bring tariffs down to 9 US cents per unit for commercial users from about 28 cents currently.","Pakistan is renegotiating contracts with independent power producers to rein in ""unsustainable"" electricity tariffs.

The Taliban were not immediately available for comment.The Taliban - who took over Afghanistan in 2021 during the final weeks of US and Nato withdrawal - have excluded women from most areas of public life and stopped girls from going to school beyond sixth grade, despite initial promises of a more moderate rule.They are also restricting women's access to work, travel and health care if they are unmarried or don't have a male guardian, and punishing those who don't comply with the Taliban's interpretation of hijab, or Islamic headscarf.The Taliban last month issued the ban on women's voices in public under new laws approved by the supreme leader in efforts to combat vice and promote virtue.""I want to make clear my abhorrence of these latest measures, which include forbidding even eye contact between women and men who are not related and imposing mandatory covering for women from head to toe, including their faces,"" Turk said.Taliban policies are propelling Afghanistan further down a path of isolation, pain and hardship, he added.Last year, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the country needs $4.62 billion in aid for nearly 24 million people in need. The Taliban takeover drove millions into poverty and hunger after foreign aid stopped almost overnight.Sanctions, a halt on bank transfers and frozen billions in Afghanistan's currency reserves restricted access to global institutions and the outside money that supported the country's aid-dependent economy before the withdrawal of US and NATO forces.The situation for children was especially devastating, with 12.4 million children in desperate need, Turk said, but a massive shortfall in funding was ""sharply undercutting"" the response by the UN and its partners.Another speaker at the council session was Richard Bennett , the UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Afghanistan. Bennett has frequently criticized the Taliban's treatment of women and girls. Last month, he confirmed he was no longer allowed to visit the country.In his first address since being barred from Afghanistan, Bennett said the morality laws reinforced the Taliban's institutionalized system of sex and gender discrimination, segregation and oppression and affected almost the entire population."" Unaddressed , the repercussions will shape future generations,"" he said.Bennett said he had talked to Afghans in several provinces who had described a visible increase in the presence of morality inspectors as well as tightening restrictions, in particular on people's freedom of movement.""We have also received information that barbers are instructed not to shave men's beards shorter than the specified length, while the ban on broadcasting of images of human beings is impacting the media,"" he said.Afghan media have reported that the Vice and Virtue Ministry has stopped female journalists from working in Daikundi province and administered a religious test to government employees, warning they risk dismissal if they do not participate.There have also been reports that the state-controlled broadcaster RTA has stopped airing in Kandahar province, the Taliban's power center in the south and the base of its leader Hibatullah Akhundzada , because morality laws prohibit the depiction of living beings.The Taliban have not responded to requests for comment on the reports.","Taliban's control over women and girls in Afghanistan is unparalleled, says UN rights chief.
