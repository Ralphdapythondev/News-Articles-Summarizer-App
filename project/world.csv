"Houthis strike again: Oil tanker damaged, US drone shot down",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/houthis-strike-again-oil-tanker-damaged-us-drone-shot-down/articleshow/109675875.cms,"YEMEN: Yemen 's Houthis have struck again, with reports emerging of an oil tanker damaged and a US drone shot down amid escalating tensions over Israel's offensive in Gaza, Al Jazeera reported.In his latest televised address, the Houthis' military spokesman, Yahya Saree, claimed responsibility for targeting the ""British oil ship Andromeda Star"" in the Red Sea with naval missiles.The vessel sustained minor damage, according to the US Central Command (CENTCOM), but is continuing its journey unimpeded.There were no injuries reported among the maritime military coalition deployed in the area to counter such attacks.Saree also announced the downing of a MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US military, stating it was shot down while conducting hostile missions in the airspace of Yemen's Saada governorate. The US military has yet to comment on the incident, but CBS News confirmed the crash of an MQ-9 inside Yemen, sparking an ongoing investigation, according to Al Jazeera.This marks the third US drone shot down by the Houthis since the outset of the conflict in Gaza, with previous incidents occurring in November and February. Despite this, the Houthis have remained silent on further attacks against vessels in nearby waters, although the US military reported anti-ship missiles being fired at the MV MAISH, a vessel flying the Antigua/Barbados flag.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) confirmed two attacks on a vessel, likely the MV Andromeda Star, near al-Mukha (Mocha) in Yemen. The first explosion occurred in close proximity to the vessel, followed by a second attack involving two missiles, resulting in damage.The Houthi military's recent activity follows their claim of targeting the ""Israeli ship MSC Darwin"" in the Gulf of Aden and launching missiles and drones at targets in Israel's southern port city of Eilat. Prior to this, they had attacked the US-flagged Maersk Yorktown and the Israeli-linked MSC Veracruz, prompting defence responses from US and UK warships.Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, the group's leader, dismissed suggestions of diminished military capabilities, asserting that more attacks are imminent. Addressing demonstrators in Sanaa and beyond, he declared a new theater of confrontation, targeting ships in the Indian Ocean as well, as reported by Al Jazeera.The Houthis have vowed to cease their attacks on one of the world's busiest maritime routes if Israel halts its offensive in Gaza. These attacks have not only disrupted global trade but also impacted traffic at Israel's Eilat port.In Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, large-scale protests have been a weekly occurrence since the conflict began, expressing solidarity with Palestinians and condemning Israel and its allies. Initially focused on Israeli-linked ships in the Bab al-Mandeb strait, the Houthis have since broadened their targets to include US and UK vessels following military actions by Washington and London in Yemen.Houthi-run media reported millions more joining demonstrations across Yemen, highlighting the widespread support for their cause, Al Jazeera reported.","Yemen's Houthis claim responsibility for targeting the ""British oil ship Andromeda Star"" The vessel sustained minor damage, according to the US Central Command (CENTCOM), but is continuing its journey unimpeded.

Tory rift sparks 'Op Save Rishi': Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/tory-rift-sparks-op-save-rishi-report/articleshow/109671976.cms,"Rishi Sunak said this week he's putting UK defence spending on a "" war footing ."" He might as well have been talking about his own position.Allies of the UK PM described the last few days as him entering campaign mode for a general election he must call by the end of Jan. A plan to tighten rules for welfare payments, ramming his flagship policy to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda through parliament and a pledge to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030 all secured newspaper front-page coverage.An aide characterised the tempo shift as ""Operation Save Rishi"" ahead of a more immediate test, as the Conservative Party gears up for local council and mayoral elections Thursday. Sunak's internal Tory critics have warned that any result suggesting the opposition Labour Party is marching to office would trigger efforts to oust him. The recent flurry of activity was in part about getting Sunak through next week without a leadership challenge, members of his team said on condition of anonymity.The Tories are defending just under 1,000 seats from the last vote in 2021, when the party was boosted by the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine. The party's national support has slumped since, and Labour's 20-point lead in the polls could translate to a loss of half of those seats. Yet there's even more focus on the outcome of two mayoral races, in the West Midlands and Tees Valley in northern England, where Tories Andy Street and Ben Houchen are battling to stay in their roles. Both are seen as a figureheads for recent Conservative inroads into traditional Labour areas, and losing both would be seen by many in the party as a bellwether for a national defeat. A group of Tories, who claim to have been gathering support for a leadership change, are waiting for a moment to act. They are proposing House of Commons member Penny Mordaunt as their preferred candidate, and are sharing polling with other MPs showing she's viewed favourably by public. But a Mordaunt ally said she wouldn't quit after May 2 votes or call for leadership change, a position that appears to bolster Sunak's position.","Allies of the UK PM described the last few days as him entering campaign mode for a general election he must call by the end of Jan.

"US man allegedly kills wife, buys sex doll with her life insurance money: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-man-allegedly-kills-wife-buys-sex-doll-with-her-life-insurance-money-report/articleshow/109670703.cms,"NEW DELHI: On the morning of Halloween in 2019, Colby Trickle, a resident of Hays, Kansas, called 911 to report that his wife, Kristen Trickle , aged 26, had shot herself in their home. Sergeant Brandon Hauptman from the Hays Police Department responded to the call and, after speaking with Colby Trickle and examining the scene, became suspicious of Colby's involvement in his wife's death.However, three days later, the coroner, Dr. Lyle Noordhoek, determined Kristen Trickle's death to be a suicide , allowing Colby Trickle to continue with his life. Despite this, investigators persisted in their investigation of the case, reported CBS News.Colby Trickle, a member of the Army Reserve, received payouts from two life insurance policies for his wife, totaling over $120,000. Investigators discovered that he spent nearly $2,000 on a life-size sex doll just two days after receiving the insurance money. Detective Joshua ""JB"" Burkholder expressed his concern to '48 Hours' correspondent Erin Moriarty, saying, ""There's a mourning process that I think everyone needs to go through — should go through when a loved one dies and to have him ordering this type of doll just months after his wife's death was concerning.""Delynn Rice, Kristen Trickle's aunt, was appalled upon learning about the sex doll purchase, telling Moriarty, ""I was just appalled that he would use Kristen's life insurance money for a sex doll. It just was like he bought a replacement of her with her money."" According to Assistant Ellis County Attorney Aaron Cunningham, Colby Trickle spent the entire $120,000 insurance payout within approximately eight months, not only on the life-size sex doll but also on video games, debt repayment, and music equipment to pursue his aspirations of becoming a performer.Colby Trickle remained free for nearly two years as investigators built a case against him. Sergeant Hauptman shared his observations about Colby Trickle's behavior immediately after reporting Kristen Trickle's self-inflicted gunshot wound. Although Colby appeared to be grieving, Hauptman noted unusual aspects of the scene, such as Kristen being found wearing only underwear and the gun seeming too large for her to have used.Hauptman also mentioned that while it does occur, it is uncommon for women to complete a suicide that results in facial injuries.Another suspicious detail for the police was Kristen Trickle's phone alarm, which kept going off at the scene that morning. Burkholder recalled silencing it, stating, ""She had set an alarm to get up, to get ready for work, and had plans for that day. A lot of times, individuals who are thinking about suicide and do commit suicide, they don't have any plans for the day. They're not setting alarms. It doesn't matter when they get up.""Colby Trickle willingly spoke with investigators on multiple occasions without legal representation, sharing detailed accounts of his alleged military intelligence work and deployments to the Middle East and Central America. However, when investigators inquired with the military, they were informed that Colby Trickle had never been deployed overseas or outside the country. These lies, combined with the inconsistencies at the scene, heightened investigators' suspicions about Colby Trickle's version of events surrounding Kristen Trickle's death.On July 14, 2021, 21 months after Kristen Trickle's death, Colby Trickle was charged with first-degree murder and interfering with law enforcement. During his trial in September 2023, prosecutors presented evidence of Colby Trickle's sex doll purchase to the jury.Tina Kreutzer, Colby Trickle's mother, testified as a defense witness, claiming that her son was experiencing nightmares and sleep difficulties following his wife's death and that the doll was intended for warmth and comfort rather than sexual purposes.Brant Rice, Kristen Trickle's uncle, expressed his disgust.","Colby Trickle, a member of the Army Reserve, received payouts from two life insurance policies for his wife, totaling over $120,000.

How Iran avoided escalation with Israel through quick military maneuvering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-iran-avoided-escalation-with-israel-through-quick-military-maneuvering/articleshow/109586561.cms,"By swiftly replacing the radar, Iran aimed to maintain its defensive posture and readiness, at least in appearance, to deter further Israeli strikes.

The replacement allowed Iranian propagandists to claim operational readiness and resilience, thereby managing domestic and international perceptions.

Most critically, by not responding further and instead quickly repairing the site, Iran avoided a potential escalation that could have drawn in more regional players and possibly led to a full-scale war.

Khamenei tacitly acknowledges that Tehran hit little in its attack on Israel

In a recent flare-up between Iran and Israel, where both nations exchanged missile and drone strikes, tensions soared, hinting at the potential for a broader conflict. However, the situation de-escalated as quickly as it escalated, with Iran making a strategic move to replace a destroyed air defense radar, thus avoiding further provocation and managing to save face on the international stage, a report in the Economist said.On April 13, for the first time in its history, Iran directly launched a barrage of drones and missiles toward an Israeli air base, which was met with a precise Israeli counterstrike.In response, the Israeli missiles on April 19 targeted and destroyed a critical piece of Iranian air defense, the 30n6e2 ""Tombstone"" radar , located near the heavily fortified Natanz nuclear complex. This radar is essential for tracking incoming air threats and guiding interceptor missiles.Following the Israeli retaliation, new satellite imagery analyzed by Chris Biggers, a former imagery analyst at America’s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, revealed that Iran had swiftly replaced the destroyed ""Tombstone"" radar with a different model, the 96l6e ""Cheese board"" radar. This radar was placed in the exact location of the previous one, and the missile launchers appeared ready for action. Biggers noted that this switch was likely a tactic of ""denial and deception,"" aimed at portraying the site as still operational, despite the replacement radar's incompatibility with the existing defense system, the Economist report said.This quick substitution by Iran served multiple strategic purposes:Meanwhile, during a meeting with Iran's top military leaders, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran's supreme leader, downplayed the effectiveness of a significant drone-and-missile attack on Israel, subtly admitting that the assault didn't achieve its intended impact. Despite the substantial scale of the attack, Khamenei emphasized that the number of missiles that hit their targets was not a priority.Khamenei's remarks, which were broadcast on state television, came in the context of heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, particularly as conflicts continue in the Gaza Strip. He said, “Debates by the other party about how many missiles were fired, how many of them hit the target and how many didn’t, these are of secondary importance. The main issue is the emergence of the Iranian nation and Iranian military’s will in an important international arena. This is what matters.”(With inputs from agencies)","Iran quickly replaced a destroyed air defense radar, avoiding further provocation and managing to save face on the international stage.

NEW DELHI: Pro-Palestine, anti-war protests have gained momentum across universities in the US leading to the arrest of hundreds of students at Columbia University among others.The University of Southern California on Thursday cancelled its graduation ceremony, and dozens more college students were detained on other campuses throughout the country.An Indian-origin student at Princeton University was also arrested and barred from the campus for staging pro-Palestine protests .The protesting students are asking that institutions cut their financial ties with Israel and divest from firms that they believe are aiding the Gaza conflict.Last week, pro-Palestinian student demonstrators set up a tent encampment at New York's Ivy League universities. Police attempted to evict the encampment on April 18, arresting over 100 demonstrators. However, the approach backfired, energizing students around the country and prompting demonstrators at Columbia to regroup.On Wednesday, university administrators announced that they were extending the time for demonstrators to clear out. They said the demonstrators had agreed to remove a large number of tents and that only students would remain at the encampment. They also decided to prohibit all racist language and harassing messages.An Indian-origin student at Princeton University was arrested and barred from the campus for staging pro-Palestine protests. Coimbatore-born Achinthya Sivalingan is facing disciplinary action, a university spokesperson said.Protesters put up tents for a student-led pro-Palestine encampment in McCosh Courtyard around 7am on Thursday. Following warnings from University officials, two Princeton students were arrested, while the remaining protestors packed up their camping gear and resumed the action as a sit-in, according to the Princeton Alumni Weekly.US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said on Friday that viewpoints should be expressed in a 'peaceful' manner, emphasizing that 'nobody should feel threatened'.""It's the moment, you know, having a lot of discord in the world. And we in America believe opinions should be expressed, but nobody should feel threatened. If anything goes over the line where somebody feels individually threatened. That's something that's unacceptable, and there will be consequences,"" Envoy Garcetti told ANI.""At the same time, people do have that right to express their opinions, their differences in a peaceful manner, in a way where we can agree to disagree, agree, or we can respect each other's different opinions. And that's, I think, the goal for all of us,"" he added.As protests raged around campus, the University of Southern California canceled its graduation ceremony. The institution has previously canceled the graduating address of the school's pro-Palestinian valedictorian, citing safety concerns.According to the Los Angeles Police Department, more than 90 persons were arrested Wednesday night for allegedly trespassing during a university demonstration. One person has been arrested for alleged assault with a deadly weapon.To avoid demonstrations, Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, sealed most of the gates to its famed Harvard Yard before classes began Monday and restricted entrance to those with school identification.The school also erected banners telling students not to set up tents or tables on campus without permission. Despite these efforts, protesters set up a 14-tent camp on Wednesday, following a march protesting the university's suspension of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee.On Thursday, Boston Police said that 108 persons were arrested at an Emerson College encampment. According to police, four officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries.Earlier this week, at New York University, a student-led encampment grew to hundreds of demonstrators. On Wednesday, police reported they had arrested 133 protestors. They stated everyone was freed with a summons to appear in court on disorderly behavior charges.","Indian-origin student arrested in US, barred from varsity for taking part in protests.

"'Divest from Israel': Columbia, Harvard say no to student demands",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/divest-from-israel-columbia-harvard-say-no-to-student-demands/articleshow/109645691.cms,"A cause celebre is ringing out across Harvard Yard, Columbia’s South Lawn, Yale’s Beinecke Plaza and UC Berkeley’s Sproul Plaza: Disclose and divest.And university students say they won’t stop protesting against Israel until that demand is met.“We’re willing to risk suspension, expulsion and arrest, and I think that that will put pressure,” said Malak Afaneh, a law student at University of California, Berkeley, and a protest organizer.She and her fellow pro-Palestinian demonstrators want universities to cut their investments in everything tied to Israel and weapons that fuel the war in Gaza. That means funds run by BlackRock, Google as well as Amazon’s cloud service, Lockheed Martin and even Airbnb.It’s a long-shot demand — university administrators and lawmakers have for decades rejected the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel, viewing it as antisemitic because it calls into question the legitimacy of the Jewish state and singles out the policies of one country.It’s fiercely opposed by many donors and alumni, and what’s more, acting on the BDS concept is discouraged by laws in more than half of US states, including New York and California. That’s unlikely to change anytime soon.“I have consistently opposed all forms of antisemitism, including discrimination against and demonization of the people of Israel through the BDS movement ,” said California Assembly Democratic Caucus Chair Rick Chavez Zbur. “I would strongly oppose any attempts to change laws protecting against such discrimination.”Yet it’s gaining proponents, especially among students at elite universities since Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel and sparked the conflict in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.They’re chanting on college grounds, waving Palestinian flags, wearing keffiyehs and beating drums. Encampments have sprouted on campuses, including at Harvard where about 30 tents currently stand in front of the John Harvard statue, according to the Harvard Crimson.Some protesters, including at Columbia and Berkeley, have threatened Jewish students and expressed support for Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the US.All that has left universities struggling to balance the right to free speech with the need for maintaining order and ensuring the safety of students. But on the question of divestment, they are unmoved.Harvard, which has the largest US endowment at almost $51 billion, made clear this month it “opposes calls for a policy of boycotting Israel and its academic institutions.” Brown refused to acknowledge BDS demands while students led an eight-day hunger strike. Yale this week wouldn’t even consider a proposal to divest from weapons makers and instead police rounded up protesters outside of the Schwarzman Center, arresting more than 40 students.BDS supporters take inspiration from the drive to isolate South Africa during the apartheid era — including actions taken at the time by Columbia, Michigan State and California universities — and recent pushes for colleges to address fossil fuel holdings.This time at Michigan State, where groups of students are camped in tents in People’s Park, there’s no appetite for severing ties with Israel.“Divestment would conflict with stewarding the institution’s financial health, would increase investment risks, and limit returns and jeopardize the assurance resources will continue to be available now and for future generations,” said Sandy Pierce, chair of Michigan State University’s board, speaking earlier this month at a Board of Trustees meeting.Columbia in February declined a proposal to withdraw financial support from Israel, months before students set up tents on the Morningside Heights campus and created a standoff with the university that resulted in more than 100 arrests.Ray Guerrero, 27, who’s studying for a masters in public health, helped pen the divestment proposal for the Columbia University Apartheid Divest coalition. The group has a litany of demands, including cutting ties to Israeli academic institutions, defunding public safety and reparations for the indigenous people of New York. Guerrero understands the goals are lofty for the immediate term, but stresses the main focus for now is disclosure and divestment around Columbia’s $13.6 billion endowment.Layla Saliba, a 24-year-old studying for a masters in social work, is part of CUAD’s research team, which she said has been studying the school’s financial disclosures, including its tax forms and 13Fs disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission.“We were only able to get about 0.6% of their investments as public information,” she said.The latest 13F discloses just $47 million of its holdings, with the vast majority stock in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. That leaves billions of dollars undisclosed.“That’s really concerning because our endowment, yes, it’s funded by benefactors, it’s funded by donors, but a portion of that is also funded with our tuition dollars,” Saliba said. “And we feel that as students, we need to have more transparency on that.”Universities say the protesters’ claims aren’t accurate.The University of California, which opposes any boycott of Israel, said in a statement that tuition fees are not used for investments. College endowments are almost always funded with donations and investment gains. What’s more, they fund financial aid for students and other operating expenses such as teacher salaries.And the challenge isn’t just ideological. Endowments typically don’t hold large concentrations of single stocks as they used to decades ago, when activists targeted companies operating in South Africa.Endowments have long relied on external managers, including private equity firms and hedge funds. Almost 700 institutions hold about $840 billion in endowment assets. They also use ETFs, index funds or mutual funds that pool hundreds of stocks and bonds.With private equity, a school’s money may be locked up for several years, without an option to withdraw, while hedge fund managers can rapidly move in and out of securities without disclosing their trades to investors.“These active strategies are not buying stocks to hold on for the long term,” said Philip Zecher, chief investment officer of Michigan State University’s $4 billion fund. “They’re looking to make money off trading. It’s not like your grandmother buying AT&T stock and sitting on it for 50 years.”The fight against fossil fuel investment, a cause championed by students for decades, also shows how hard it can be to implement divestment.

In a statement that underscores the change in corporate America, Garcetti said, ""The old joke was you could not become a CEO in the US if you are Indian, now the joke is you cannot become a CEO in America if you are not Indian, whether it is Google, Microsoft or Starbucks, people have come and made a big difference.""During an interview at the American Center, the envoy highlighted the US's commitment to fostering people-to-people ties, particularly through educational exchanges, which he described as having the potential to ""last a lifetime."" Garcetti revealed that the US mission in India is gearing up to handle an increased number of student visa applications this year, reflecting a continuing trend of rising interest among Indian students in American education.Further commenting on the visa process, Garcetti recalled President Joe Biden's directive to reduce visa wait times for Indians, saying, ""He did! It is the first time, I think in American history that a President has told an ambassador—get those visas waiting time down.""

'Asking for trouble': Why Japanese academics are shunning China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/asking-for-trouble-why-japanese-academics-are-shunning-china/articleshow/109640702.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Japanese academics are increasingly hesitant to attend events in China following the unexplained disappearance of Fan Yuntao , a 61-year-old expert in international law and politics based at Tokyo’s Asia University. Fan, who was last in contact with his family in April last year, reportedly told them he was being taken for questioning by Chinese government officials, according to Kyodo News.The unsettling incident is part of a troubling pattern involving several Chinese academics based in Japan, including Hu Shiyun and Zhu Jianrong, who have also vanished under mysterious circumstances.These cases have prompted fears among the academic community, leading to a decline in participation in academic events in China, a South China Morning Post report said.Fan’s university has confirmed that he is on leave but has refrained from providing further details to protect personal data. His disappearance has sparked significant criticism of the Japanese government’s passive approach, with social media users and academics alike decrying the lack of action.Yoichi Shimada, a professor of international relations at Fukui Prefectural University, expressed his reluctance to travel to China, citing the absence of assurances for his safe return. “There seems to be no clear reason for these arrests. It is impossible for me and other academics to go there now,” Shimada said.The issue also affects Japanese businesspeople and members of the Chinese diaspora who been arrested after returning to China. Jeff Kingston, an American director of Asian Studies at the Tokyo campus of Temple University, acknowledged the risks but noted his lower profile might spare him from such threats.Critics argue that Japan's response to these incidents is insufficient, particularly in light of Beijing’s new anti-espionage laws that have intensified fears of wrongful detention. Shimada further criticized the Japanese government’s ineffectiveness, stating, “I have no faith that the Japanese government would do much to get me home if I was accused of something; they are weak-kneed when it comes to China.”This situation highlights a growing concern over academic freedom and safety among Japanese scholars regarding engagement with Chinese institutions amid escalating geopolitical tensions.","Japanese academics are increasingly hesitant to attend events in China following the unexplained disappearance of Fan Yuntao.

Blinken is expected to visit Israel while in the region.The call also came three weeks after Biden told Netanyahu that he would rethink his support for Israel's war unless the country did more to facilitate the delivery of food and other supplies to Gaza and limit civilian casualties. Since then, humanitarian aid to Gaza has increased substantially, but still not as much as is needed.Under the US-sponsored ceasefire proposal, Israel would halt hostilities for six weeks and release hundreds of Palestinians held in its prisons in exchange for the release of 40 hostages held by Hamas, mainly women, older men and those with health conditions. Later stages of the deal would then extend ceasefire and result in more hostages being freed.","Biden's call came just hours after secretary of state Antony Blinken left Washington for his latest trip to West Asia.

Just minutes into his speech at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner Saturday, Biden launched into the issues dominating the 2024 election , including his age and former Prez Donald Trump 's hush-money trial in New York.""The 2024 election's in full swing and yes, age is an issue,"" Biden said in a roughly 10-minute speech.""I'm a grown man running against a 6-year-old.""""Donald has had a few tough days lately. You might call it 'stormy' weather,"" Biden said, an oblique reference to Stormy Daniels, a porn actor who claims to have had sex with Trump in 2006 and received a hush-money payment in the days before the 2016 election, a deal at the centre of his New York trial. The comments were notable given Biden has forbidden his aides from talking about Trump's legal troubles.While he rarely mentioned Trump by name early in his presidency, Biden has aggressively taunted him as of late and kept it going Saturday. ""Age is the only thing we have in common,"" Biden, 81, said of Trump, 77. ""My vice-president actually endorses me,"" he said, referring to former vice-president Mike Pence's decision not to endorse Trump.Biden also used his speech at the dinner to warn about his political opponent's threats on democracy - increasingly a focus of his message to voters. ""Focus on what's actually at stake,"" he said. ""The stakes couldn't be higher.""The century-old event, often referred to as Washington's ""nerd prom"", provided a break to journalists and govt officials from their normal jousting for a night of glitz and gossip in celebration of the free press. Outside the gates of the Washington Hilton, however, outrage over Biden's support for Israel's war in the Gaza Strip was evident. As journalists and politicians arrived at the hotel, pro-Palestinian protesters chanted, ""Shame on you!"" Other protesters wearing press vests with the names of more than 100 Palestinian journalists who have been killed in Gaza lay down in front of the dinner venue.Colin Jost, the co-anchor of ""Weekend Update"" on ""Saturday Night Live"", spent roughly 23 minutes poking fun at the prez. But Jost's speech was relatively light, even supportive of Biden. He ended it by noting that his grandfather, who recently died, had voted for Biden in the last election. ""The reason he voted for you is because you're a decent man,"" he said.Trump reacted to the event by calling it ""really bad"" in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Have you heard the one about Trump? Biden tries humor on the campaign trail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/have-you-heard-the-one-about-trump-biden-tries-humor-on-the-campaign-trail/articleshow/109671313.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is out to win votes by scoring some laughs at the expense of Donald Trump , unleashing mockery with the goal of getting under the former president's thin skin and reminding the country of his blunders.Like a comic honing his routine, the Democratic president has been testing and expanding his jokes over the past few weeks.It started with jabs about his Republican opponent's financial problems, and now Biden regularly pokes fun at Trump's coiffed hair, his pampered upbringing and his attempt to make a few extra bucks by selling a special edition of the Bible.The jokes are the latest attempt to crack the code on how to clap back at Trump, whose own insult comedy schtick has redrawn the boundaries of what is acceptable in modern politics. Few have had much luck, whether they try to take the high road or get down and dirty with Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president.""This is a constant challenge,"" said Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama. Trump is ""not someone who plays by the rules. So it's up to Biden to figure out how to adapt and play by new rules of engagement.""So far, Biden has been trying to thread a delicate needle to boost his chances of a second term. He uses humor to paint Trump as a buffoon unworthy of the Oval Office, but the president stops short of turning the election into a laughing matter.Sometimes he finds that a few jokes can energize an audience even more than a major policy victory and draw precious attention away from an opponent who otherwise commands the spotlight even while stuck in a New York courtroom for his first criminal trial.The latest example came at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner on Saturday night. After years of Trump constantly needling Biden as ""sleepy"" and mocking his age (Biden is 81, Trump is 77), Biden lobbed the insult back after Trump appeared to doze off in court.Biden nicknamed his rival ""Sleepy Don,"" adding, ""I kind of like that. I may use it again.""""Of course the 2024 election's in full swing and yes, age is an issue,"" he said. ""I'm a grown man running against a 6-year-old.""Trump didn't seem to appreciate the ribbing, posting on his social media platform that the dinner was ""really bad"" and Biden was ""an absolute disaster.""But jokes at the annual black-tie affair, which also features a professional comedian (this year it was Colin Jost of NBC's ""Saturday Night Live""), are nothing new. The real meat of Biden's routine comes during campaign speeches in which he devotes a few moments to taking digs at Trump in between recitations of policy proposals and legislative accomplishments.""Remember when he was trying to deal with COVID? He suggested: Inject a little bleach in your vein,"" Biden said Wednesday to a labor union, describing Trump's guidance from the White House during the pandemic. ""He missed. It all went to his hair.""In Tampa, Florida, the day before, he assailed Trump for the Supreme Court's ruling that overturned abortion protections - with three justices nominated by Trump voting in the majority of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - and then pivoted to the former president's hawking of a $60 ""God Bless the USA"" Bible.""He described the Dobbs decision as a 'miracle,'"" Biden said of Trump. ""Maybe it's coming from that Bible he's trying to sell. Whoa. I almost wanted to buy one just to see what the hell is in it.""Biden rarely references Trump's court cases, but jokes about financial problems that began soon after the former president was ordered to pay $454 million in a civil case in New York.""Just the other day,"" Biden said at a fundraiser in Dallas last month, ""a defeated-looking guy came up to me and said, 'Mr. President, I need your help. I'm being crushed with debt. I'm completely wiped out.' I had to say, 'Donald, I can't help you.'""Even when Biden tries his hand at humor, he rarely strays far from talking about policies. He likes to note that he signed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law - after his opponent failed to do so despite repeatedly holding White House events to drum up support for an idea that never materialized.""He promised 'Infrastructure Week' every week for four years and never built a damn thing,"" Biden said this month to a group of laughing union members.The dilemma is that Trump, who tells voters the whole American political system is hopelessly corrupt, can get away with name-calling that would backfire on other candidates. During his rallies, Trump imitates Biden as a feeble old man who cannot find the stairs after giving a brief speech, and he calls the president ""crooked"" and ""a demented tyrant.""The Republican's campaign said the insults will only intensify as Biden tries to give them a taste of their own medicine.Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, said Biden is ""shuffling his feet like a short-circuited Roomba,"" referring to the robot vacuum, while failing to address the ""out-of-control border"" and ""runaway inflation.""Rick Tyler, who worked on the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2016, said voters have a double standard because expectations are different for Trump, who first became famous as a real estate developer and the star of the reality TV show ""The Apprentice.""""Celebrities don't really have standards, and Trump is in that lane,"" Tyler said. For a politician going up against Trump, ""it's like trying to play a sport with the wrong equipment.""Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., found that out the hard way in the Republican primary in 2016. After Rubio joked about Trump having ""small hands"" - suggesting that another part of him was small, too - Trump swung back by saying, ""I guarantee you there's no problem.""""Nobody has ever beaten Trump by getting in the ring with him,"" said Alex Conant, communications director for Rubio's campaign.Karen Finney, who advised Democrat Hillary Clinton in her 2016 White House run, said Trump can bait opponents into ""communicating on his terms, not your terms.""""It's the kind of thing where you have to have a balance,"" she said. ""You could spend all day just responding.""But if Trump's humor is blunt, Biden sometimes tries to get the most mileage by staying subtle. During a Pittsburgh stop earlier this month, Biden spoke elliptically about Trump's trial, betting his audience was already in on the joke.Trump, he said, is ""a little busy right now.""","Biden regularly pokes fun at Trump's coiffed hair, his pampered upbringing and his attempt to make a few extra bucks by selling a special edition of the Bible.

"College protesters want ‘amnesty.’ At stake: Tuition, legal charges, grades and graduation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/college-protesters-want-amnesty-at-stake-tuition-legal-charges-grades-and-graduation/articleshow/109670645.cms,"Maryam Alwan figured the worst was over after New York City police in riot gear arrested her and other protesters on the Columbia University campus, loaded them onto buses and held them in custody for hours.But the next evening, the college junior received an email from the university. Alwan and other students were being suspended after their arrests at the “ Gaza Solidarity Encampment,” a tactic colleges across the country have deployed to calm growing campus protests against the Israel-Hamas war.The students' plight has become a central part of protests, with students and a growing number of faculty demanding their amnesty . At issue is whether universities and law enforcement will clear the charges and withhold other consequences, or whether the suspensions and legal records will follow students into their adult lives.Terms of the suspensions vary from campus to campus. At Columbia and its affiliated Barnard College for women, Alwan and dozens more were arrested April 18 and promptly barred from campus and classes, unable to attend in-person or virtually, and banned from dining halls.Questions about their academic futures remain. Will they be allowed to take final exams? What about financial aid? Graduation? Columbia says outcomes will be decided at disciplinary hearings, but Alwan says she has not been given a date.“This feels very dystopian,” said Alwan, a comparative literature and society major.What started at Columbia has turned into a nationwide showdown between students and administrators over anti-war protests and the limits offree speech . In the past 10 days, hundreds of students have been arrested, suspended, put on probation and, in rare cases, expelled from colleges including Yale University, the University of Southern California, Vanderbilt University and the University of Minnesota.Barnard, a women's liberal arts college at Columbia, suspended more than 50 students who were arrested April 18 and evicted them from campus housing, according to interviews with students and reporting from the Columbia Spectator campus newspaper, which obtained internal campus documents.On Friday, Barnard announced it had reached agreements restoring campus access to “nearly all” of them. A statement from the college did not specify the number but said all students who had their suspensions lifted have agreed to follow college rules and, in some cases, were put on probation.On the night of the arrests, however, Barnard student Maryam Iqbal posted a screenshot on the social media platform X of a dean's email telling her she could briefly return to her room with campus security before getting kicked out.“You will have 15 minutes to gather what you might need,” the email read.More than 100 Barnard and Columbia faculty staged a “Rally to Support Our Students” last week condemning the student arrests and demanding suspensions be lifted.Columbia is still pushing to remove the tent encampment on the campus main lawn where graduation is set to be hosted May 15. The students have demanded the school cuts ties with Israel-linked companies and ensure amnesty for students and faculty arrested or disciplined in connection with the protests.Talks with the student protesters are continuing, said Ben Chang, a Columbia spokesperson. “We have our demands; they have theirs,” he said.For international students facing suspension, there is the added fear of losing their visas, said Radhika Sainath, an attorney with Palestine Legal, which helped a group of Columbia students file a federal civil rights complaint against the school Thursday. It accuses Columbia of not doing enough to address discrimination against Palestinian students.“The level of punishment is not even just draconian, it feels like over-the-top callousness,” Sainath said.More than 40 students were arrested at a Yale demonstration last week, including senior Craig Birckhead-Morton. He is due to graduate May 20 but says the university has not yet told him if his case will be submitted to a disciplinary panel. He worries about whether he will receive a diploma and if his acceptance to Columbia graduate school could be at risk.“The school has done its best to ignore us and not tell us what happens next,” said Birckhead-Morton, a history major.Across the country, college administrators have struggled to balance free speech and inclusivity. Some demonstrations have included hate speech, antisemitic threats or support for Hamas, the group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, sparking a war in Gaza that has left more than 34,000 dead.May commencement ceremonies add pressure to clear demonstrations. University officials say arrests and suspensions are a last resort, and that they give ample warnings beforehand to clear protest areas.Vanderbilt University in Tennessee has issued what are believed to be the only student expulsions related to protesting the Israel-Hamas conflict , according to the Institute for Middle Eastern Understanding. More than two dozen students occupied the university chancellor’s office for several hours on March 26, prompting the university to summon police and arrest several protesters. Vanderbilt then issued three expulsions, one suspension and put 22 protesters on probation.In an open letter to Chancellor Daniel Diermeier, more than 150 Vanderbilt professors criticized the university’s crackdown as “excessive and punitive.”Freshman Jack Petocz, 19, one of those expelled, is being allowed to attend classes while he appeals. He has been evicted from his dorm and is living off campus.Petocz said protesting in high school was what helped get him into Vanderbilt and secure a merit scholarship for activists and organizers. His college essay was about organizing walkouts in rural Florida to oppose Gov. Ron DeSantis’ anti-LGBTQ policies.“Vanderbilt seemed to love that,” Petocz said. “Unfortunately, the buck stops when you start advocating for Palestinian liberation.”","Hundreds of students have been arrested, suspended, put on probation and, in rare cases, expelled from colleges.

NEW DELHI: At least two individuals, including a child, lost their lives in tornadoes that swept through Oklahoma , Officials mentioned on Sunday as emergency teams were evaluating the extensive destruction to residences and establishments caused by the strong winds, hail, and flooding.Dozens of tornadoes have caused chaos in the central part of the country since Friday, leading to flood alerts and advisories being issued on Sunday for Oklahoma and neighboring states such as Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Texas.A tornado tore through Holdenville in Oklahoma, a town with approximately 5,000 residents, on late Saturday, resulting in the deaths of two individuals and injuries to four others, as reported by Hughes County Emergency Medical Services.Holdenville is located approximately 80 miles (128.75 kilometers) away from Oklahoma City.Gov. Kevin Stitt said, ""My prayers are with those who lost loved ones as tornadoes ripped through Oklahoma last night.""He issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency in 12 counties as a result of the aftermath of the severe weather. Rescue teams were engaged in clearing debris and evaluating the damage caused by the intense storms that knocked down power lines.As of Sunday morning, nearly 33,000 customers in Oklahoma were experiencing power outages, as reported by power outage, a platform that monitors electrical service disruptions, while Texas had almost 67,000 customers without electricity. Substantial damage from the storm was documented in the southern Oklahoma town of Sulphur, where officials also noted unspecified injuries.The Murray County Sheriff's Office advised individuals to avoid the city in order to facilitate the access of emergency personnel, given the extensive damage caused by tornadoes. This information was shared through a statement on the agency's Facebook page.""Stay home and do not come to look,"" the sheriff's office said.The tornado damage began on Friday afternoon close to Lincoln, Nebraska. An industrial structure in Lancaster County was struck, resulting in its collapse with seventy individuals present inside. Although some individuals were initially trapped, all were successfully evacuated, and the three reported injuries were not deemed life-threatening according to officials.Subsequently, one or potentially two tornadoes then spent around an hour creeping toward Omaha, leaving behind damage consistent with an EF3 twister, with winds of 135 to 165 mph, said Chris Franks, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service's Omaha office.Eventually, the tornado struck the Elkhorn neighborhood in western Omaha, a city with a population of 485,000 individuals and a metropolitan-area population of around 1 million.Staci Roe surveyed the devastation to her home, saying, ""There was no home to come to.""","At least two individuals, including a child, lost their lives in tornadoes that swept through Oklahoma.

However, he also added, ""We absolutely condemn the anti-Semitism language that we've heard of late and certainly condemn all the hate speech and the threats of violence out there.""The protests, which originated at Columbia University in New York, have quickly spread to other universities nationwide.Although many campuses have remained peaceful, the number of protesters arrested by police, sometimes in riot gear using chemical irritants and tasers, is increasing rapidly. The arrests include 100 at Northeastern University in Boston, 80 at Washington University in St Louis, 72 at Arizona State University, and 23 at Indiana University.Among those arrested at Washington University was Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who criticized the police for their aggressive tactics, which she claimed provoked the very disturbances they were intended to prevent. ""This is about freedom of speech on a very critical issue,"" she told CNN shortly before her arrest on Saturday. ""And there they are, sending in the riot police and basically creating a riot,"" she added.University administrators have faced challenges in finding the most appropriate response, balancing the need to respect free speech rights with the necessity of containing inflammatory and sometimes violently anti-Semitic rhetoric from protesters. The University of Southern California closed its main campus to the public late Saturday after pro-Palestinian groups re-established an encampment that had been previously cleared, as announced by the school on X.With final exams approaching in the coming weeks, some universities, such as the Humboldt campus of California State Polytechnic University, have closed and directed students to complete their coursework online.The activists organizing the campus protests , not all of whom are students, are demanding a ceasefire in Israel's conflict with Hamas and urging colleges to cut ties with Israel.",Pro-Palestinian demonstrations have swept across US universities in recent weeks.

Chants accused US journalists of undercovering the war and distorting its reality.Ralliers cried “Free, free Palestine’’. They cheered when a Palestinian flag was unfurled from a top-floor hotel window.Organizers of the protest aimed to draw attention to the high number of Palestinian and other Arab journalists killed by Israel's military since the conflict began in October. One organizer criticized the White House Correspondents’ Association for its perceived silence on the killings of Palestinian journalists.A preliminary investigation by the Committee to Protect Journalists released on Friday reported that nearly 100 journalists have been killed while covering the Gaza war. Israel has defended its actions, stating that it has targeted militants.Criticism of the Biden administration's support for Israel's military offensive in Gaza has also sparked protests in American college campuses, with students advocating for divestment from Israel.Protests that originated at Columbia University in New York have spread nationwide, with demands for universities to sever financial ties with Israel and divest from companies allegedly facilitating Israel's war on Gaza, which has resulted in significant casualties. Law enforcement intervention to remove protesters has led to numerous arrests and prompted faculty members at various universities to express no confidence in their leadership.","Hundreds of protesters rallied against the Gaza war outside the event.

But at places like the University of Southern California and Emory University, police have moved in quickly to break up protests, arresting students and faculty members, along with others, as NYT reported.Early Saturday, police cleared an encampment at Northeastern University, arresting about 102 protesters for trespassing and disorderly conduct. Protesters had 15 minutes to disperse. Nearby, a group chanted, ""Let the Kids Go,"" and slogans against the war in Gaza, while booing police cars and taunting officers.The student's situation has become a focal point of protests, as both students and an increasing number of faculty members call for their amnesty.

US Police departments experience increase in officer numbers post-Covid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-police-departments-experience-increase-in-officer-numbers-post-covid/articleshow/109662346.cms,"NEW DELHI: A survey conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum ( PERF ) reveals a notable development in police departments across the United States. After experiencing a historic exodus of officers following the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 killing of George Floyd , Police departments are now seeing an increase in their ranks.In 2023, more sworn officers were hired than in any of the previous four years, while fewer officers resigned or retired, law enforcement agencies responded to a survey by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF).The death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020 in Minneapolis triggered widespread protests against police brutality and intensified scrutiny of law enforcement nationwide.The exodus of officers resulted in departments reallocating resources, redirecting personnel from investigative tasks and quality of life concerns like abandoned vehicles or noise violations to address rising crime rates. Consequently, some areas experienced slower response times or limited emergency responses due to shortages, according to police officials.“I just think that the past four years have been particularly challenging for American policing,"" said Chuck Wexler, executive director of PERF, a nonprofit policing think tank based in Washington, DC ""And our survey shows we’re finally starting to turn a corner.”Individual departments are turning that corner at different rates, however, according to Wexler, who noted many are still struggling to attract and keep officers.As a whole, the profession “isn't out of the woods yet,” he said.The survey shows that while small and medium departments had more sworn officers than they did in January 2020, large departments are still more than 5% below their staffing levels from that time, even with a year-over-year increase from 2022 to 2023, according to Associated Press survey with several unions and police departmentsThe survey also showed smaller departments with fewer than 50 officers are still struggling with a higher rate of resignations and retirements.The survey asked only for numbers, Wexler said, so it's hard to say whether those officers are leaving for larger departments or leaving the profession altogether. He also said smaller departments, which account for 80% of agencies nationwide, were underrepresented in the responses PERF received.Several larger police departments have raised officer salaries and introduced incentives like signing bonuses to attract experienced officers willing to transfer, a competitive edge smaller departments lack. However, a dozen smaller departments have dissolved, forcing municipalities to depend on state or county assistance for policing. Despite offering competitive pay, even some of the highest-paying large departments are facing challenges in recruiting new hires.“I don’t think it’s all about money. I think it’s about the way people perceive their job and feel they are going to be supported,” Wexler said. “You have West Coast departments that are paying six figures, but still seeing major challenges in hiring.”Maria “Maki” Haberfeld, chair of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says departments have been too focused on officer numbers . She worries some are lowering education requirements and other standards to bolster numbers instead of trying to find the best people to police their communities.“Policing is a real profession that requires more skills and more education than people can understand,"" she said. ""It’s not about tattoos or running a mile in 15 minutes. It’s really more about emotional intelligence, maturity and making those split-second decisions that don’t use deadly force.”Haberfeld also cautioned that any staffing gains made through incentives could easily be erased, especially as officers, including some in riot gear, have been seen breaking up protests against the Israel-Hamas war at universities across the country.“In policing, it takes decades to move forward and a split second for the public attitude to deteriorate,” she said.PERF's survey showed a more than a 20% drop in resignations overall, from a high of almost 6,500 in 2022 to fewer than 5,100 in 2023. They are still up over early pandemic levels in 2020, however, when a few more than 4,000 officers resigned across all responding departments.","In 2023, more sworn officers were hired than in any of the previous four years.

The Houthis stated that they used a surface-to-air missile to bring down the Reaper, as part of a renewed series of attacks this week by the rebels following a relative lull in their pressure campaign during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.""A US Air Force MQ-9 drone crashed in Yemen,"" confirmed US Air Force Lt. Col. Bryon J. McGarry, a Defence Department spokesperson, to The Associated Press on Saturday. He added that an investigation was ongoing, without providing further details.The Houthis reported that the downing occurred on Thursday over their stronghold in the country's Saada province. The footage they released included what they described as the missile launch targeting the drone, with a man off-camera reciting the Houthi's slogan after it was hit: ""God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.""The footage also featured several close-ups of drone parts, including the logo of General Atomics, the drone's manufacturer, and serial numbers corresponding to known components made by the company.Since the Houthis took control of the country's north and its capital, Sanaa, in 2014, the US military has lost at least five drones to the rebel. Apart from Thursday's shootdown, US has lost drones in 2017, 2019, 2023, and one earlier this year. Reapers, which cost approximately USD 30 million each, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land.Meanwhile, since November, the Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel, and sunk another, according to the US Maritime Administration. Houthi attacks have decreased in recent weeks as the rebels have been targeted by a US-led airstrike campaign in Yemen. Shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined due to the threat. American officials have speculated that the rebels may be running out of weapons as a result of the US-led campaign against them and after firing drones and missiles steadily in recent months.

However, the driver and other people in the vehicle managed to flee to safety.Seasonal rivers, including the Bolan River and Nari Gaj-Mula River, swell with heavy floodwater as their catchment areas were also receiving rains.Northern Balochistan, including Ziarat, Quetta, Kalat, Kan Mehtarzai, and Pishin, experiences a drop in temperature, prompting residents to rely on gas heaters and warm clothing to combat the cold.Ziarat, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, Sherani, Khanozai, Harnai, Sibi, Mastung, Kalat, Khuzdar, Jhal Magsi, Dera Murad Jamali, Kharan, Chagai, Noshki, Washuk, Chaman, Mach, and many other areas also received heavy showers.Quetta, the provincial capital, experienced urban flooding once more following intense overnight rainfall. The heavy downpour resulted in widespread destruction, affecting both low-lying areas and central parts of the city, compounding the challenges faced during the previous rainfall events.Almost all roads in the main city, including Jinnah Road, Kandahari Bazaar, Liaquat Road, Prince Road, Zarghoon Road, Sirki Road, and Gawalmandi, were submerged by knee-deep rainwater.Meanwhile, the meteorological department has predicted more rains with thunderstorms and lightning in different areas of Balochistan, including Quetta.","Heavy rain, thunderstorms, and hailstorms battered the Quetta Valley, causing flooding on main roads and streets.

Foreign talent to make up for unskilled bureaucrats in Pakistan: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/foreign-talent-to-make-up-for-unskilled-bureaucrats-in-pakistan-report/articleshow/109661493.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan 's Cabinet has relaxed rules to hire foreign consultancy firms to make up for 'unskilled' bureaucrats and speed up official efforts to bring investment for various projects in the cash-strapped country from the Gulf and other nations, according to a media report. The decision was taken to support the Special Investment Facilitation Council ( SIFC ), the top civil-military body created last year to bring investment into the country.According to The Express Tribune, the Cabinet relaxed the public procurement legal framework to hire foreign consultancy firms to strengthen the SIFC to prepare various projects before offering them to foreign investors.""The foreign consultancy firms will be hired for five years as a replacement for Pakistani bureaucrats who are found lacking in project planning and execution, according to government sources,"" the paper reported.However, the decision will reflect poorly on the working of the bureaucracy, which could not provide quality assistance to the SIFC.The Cabinet has approved a summary through circulation on the advice of the SIFC, which recommended granting exemption due to the poor capacity of Pakistan's federal bureaucracy, confirmed a senior government official on Saturday.In case of circulation, the summary is approved without discussion in the regular cabinet meeting.The sources said that due to an incapacitated bureaucracy, Pakistan was struggling to prepare projects for investment by Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Kuwait.The development came a week after Pakistan offered highly lucrative returns to Saudi Arabia for getting a USD 5 billion investment.The government was jubilant over its presentation to the Saudi delegation, which appreciated Islamabad's preparedness compared to the past.However, the bureaucracy is not trained in certain skills and compared to the Pakistani delegation the Saudi Arabian delegation was far better prepared.One of the reasons for the lack of effective and efficient bureaucracy is that generalists are appointed as the secretaries of the economic ministries.These bureaucrats, mostly Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) officers, get expertise on the job and then they are moved to any other ministry.A federal secretary can at any time be appointed as secretary of finance, secretary of power, secretary of planning, secretary of the board of investment and secretary of petroleum without a requisite set of expertise.","The decision was taken to support the Special Investment Facilitation Council ( SIFC ), the top civil-military body created last year to bring investment into the country.

The case so far

Appointment of judges

(With inputs from Dawn)

NEW DELHI: Pakistan Supreme Court Justice Mansoor Ali Shah on Saturday said it was critical that a ""firewall"" be developed around the judicial system to ensure no external interference in the judiciary. The judge’s remarks come amid the situation revolving around the allegations made by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges against interference in judicial affairs by the country’s intelligence apparatus, said a report by Dawn.On March 25, six IHC judges — out of a total strength of eight — wrote a startling letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) members, regarding attempts to pressure judges through abduction and torture of their relatives as well as secret surveillance inside their homes.The letter was signed by judges Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz.Addressing the 5th Asma Jahangir Conference with the theme of ‘People’s Mandate: Safeguarding Civil Rights in South Asia’, Justice Shah said: ""Firewalling is very important. There can be no external interference in our affairs. The judiciary will stand united against any interference that comes into our system and we take it seriously.""Justice Shah said that all institutions must realise that ""if there is no justice then they cannot exist"", adding that it was better for everyone if the justice system worked independently. ""Every institution is weakening itself if you weaken the justice system,"" said the Dawn report, quoting Justice Shah.“The justice system has to be strong, robust and independent for all the other institutions to develop, grow and prosper,” he added.The Supreme Court has clubbed a set of ten petitions and applications seeking the court’s intervention in response to allegations of ""intelligence agencies meddling in judicial affairs"".Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, the bench includes Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Musarrat Hilali, and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan. They will resume the case on April 30, initiated on a suo motu.A day after the letter by IHC judges went public, calls emerged from various quarters for a probe into the investigation, amid which CJP Isa summoned a full court meeting of the Supreme Court’s (SC) judges.After a meeting between CJP Isa and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on March 28, the duo decided to form a commission to investigate the concerns of interference in judicial affairs following the cabinet’s approval. However, former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, who was appointed to head the commission, subsequently recused himself from the matter, leading to the apex court taking a suo motu notice of the issue.On April 3, CJP Isa asserted that ""any attack"" on the judiciary’s independence would not be tolerated as he hinted at forming a full court to hear a suo motu case pertaining to allegations of interference in judicial affairs.Meanwhile, Justice Shah said that the judiciary needed to revisit how the judges were appointed at all levels and look at the examination pattern followed.“The appointment process has to be state of the art,” he said, adding that judges should only be appointed on merit.Justice Shah said that the appointment of cases was another matter that needed to be addressed, adding that the best decision in the matter was the Practice and Procedure Act which regulated the bench of the Supreme Court.""We have to strengthen the Practice and Procedure Act,"" he said, adding that the institution was very ""Chief Justice-specific-centric-driven"".","Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said it was critical that a ""firewall"" be developed around the judicial system to ensure no external interference in the judiciary.

‘Prefer remaining in jail for nine more years’: Imran Khan rules out negotiations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/prefer-remaining-in-jail-for-nine-more-years-former-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-rules-out-negotiations/articleshow/109648481.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Ruling out any agreement, former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that he is ready to endure additional nine years behind bars rather than engage in any negotiations with what he termed as the forces that have ""enslaved"" the nation.In his message, Khan highlighted what he described as the imposition of the ""worst dictatorship"" on the country, warning of its detrimental effects on the economy, governance, democracy and the judiciary.Having spent the past nine months in prison due to what he claimed are ""fake and concocted cases,"" Khan affirmed his readiness to continue serving time if necessary. ""I will remain in jail if I have to for nine more years, or more, but I will never strike a deal with those who have enslaved my nation”, Khan said in a statement.Since his ouster from power through a no-confidence motion in April 2022, the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician has faced convictions in multiple cases, leading to his imprisonment at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi. Khan's political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has encountered challenges following his fall-out with the influential military, including arrests and defections, particularly after the unrest sparked by his arrest last year.Khan's statement follows remarks by PTI leader Shehryar Afridi, who asserted the party's willingness to engage in dialogue excluding certain political factions. He dismissed the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz as a ""rejected lot"" and reiterated the PTI's commitment to engaging with the army chief for Pakistan's future.Addressing speculation regarding alleged negotiations, PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan reaffirmed the party's disinterest in and denial of any talks with external entities.Independent candidates supported by the PTI secured over 90 seats in the National Assembly during the February 8 general elections. However, a post-election alliance formed by the PMN-L and the PPP sidelined the PTI, preventing it from forming a federal government.","Imran Khan says he is ready to endure additional nine years behind bars.
