MAGA calls out singers links to Diddy



Grammy-winning artist Usher took center stage at a rally in Atlanta on Sunday, endorsing Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States. He joined Harris on the campaign trail the day before.Speaking to Georgia voters, Usher highlighted Harris' commitment to inclusivity and her vision for a nation that benefits everyone.""I'm supporting Kamala Harris because she fights for everyone's rights and freedom,"" he said.He emphasized that her vision encompasses all citizens, supporting small businesses, investing in health and communities, and providing opportunities for advancement.Addressing the enthusiastic Atlanta crowd, Usher underscored the significance of the upcoming election, stating, ""With just 17 days left, we have the chance to choose a new generation of leadership. I’m here to support the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris.""When a fan shouted, ""I love you, Usher!"" the singer playfully replied, ""I love you, but I love Kamala Harris even more,"" energizing the audience further.Throughout his speech, Usher stressed the importance of voter turnout in Georgia, urging the crowd to mobilize in the final days of the campaign. ""We've got work to do, Atlanta, to get this campaign across the finish line. I’m counting on you. We can make a difference in this election.""Usher was the second artist to join Harris' campaign trail. Earlier Harris was joined by singer Lizzo in Detroit.Despite the outpouring of support for Kamala Harris, not everyone was on board with Usher's endorsement. People on the internet were quick to call out Usher's alleged ties to Diddy’s controversial ""Freak-Offs"" parties.One user wrote, ""Usher is the man who went to Diddy's ""Puffy Flavor Camp"" when he was 14 years old and then subsequently brought a child named Justin Beiber to Diddy on a silver platter.""Another said, ""Partnered up with Usher after the Diddy stuff??""One user igniting the alleged baby oil rumours wrote, ""Baby Oil user and Diddy partner Usher, managed to make Kamala’s rally more cringe than it already was.""","Grammy-winning artist Usher took center stage at a rally in Atlanta on Sunday.

NAPLES: G7 defence ministers on Saturday met against the backdrop of multiple ongoing military conflicts, expressing concern over escalation in Lebanon while pledging ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine.Italy, holding the rotating presidency of the Group of Seven countries, organised the body's first ministerial meeting dedicated to defence, staged in the southern city of Naples that is home to a Nato base.At the top of the agenda was Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine, now in its third year.""We underscore our intent to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine, including military assistance in the short and long term,"" read the G7 defence ministers' final statement that pledged ""unwavering support"".But the G7 defence ministers -- from Italy, France, Germany, Britain, Japan, Canada and the United States -- also warned of the dangers of further intensification in the Middle East, including in Lebanon where the United Nations has blamed Israel for strikes on UN peacekeepers .""We are concerned by the latest events in Lebanon and the risk of further escalation. We express concern over all threats to UNIFIL's security,"" read a final statement from the ministers, while calling for Iran to stop supporting Hamas and Hezbollah.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met a Hamas representative in Istanbul on Saturday, according to the IRNA official news agency.The many, concurrent conflicts -- including instability in sub-Saharan Africa and growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region -- ""highlight a deteriorated security framework with forecasts for the near future that cannot be positive"", said Italian Defence Minister Giudo Crosetto at the start of the one-day talks.The summit came two days after Israel announced it had killed Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel that triggered the devastating retaliatory war in Gaza.Also in attendance were Nato chief Mark Rutte and the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who echoed the words of US President Joe Biden that the death of Sinwar could mark an opportunity to bring about the end of hostilities.""Certainly after the killing of Yahya Sinwar, a new perspective is open and we have to use it in order to reach a ceasefire, to release the remaining hostages and to look for a political perspective,"" Borrell told journalists.The morning session included discussions over recent strikes on UN peacekeepers UNIFIL in Lebanon, where Israel is also at war with Hamas ally Hezbollah.Borrell suggested that the peacekeepers' mandate should be beefed up by the UN Security Council to give them more scope to act amid repeated attacks on their positions, which they blame on Israeli forces.""They cannot act by themselves, it is certainly a limited role,"" he said.Earlier on Saturday, Borrell wrote on social media that ""a more robust mandate for UNIFIL"" was needed.In Lebanon on Friday, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni slammed as ""unacceptable"" the recent strikes on UNIFIL.Italy has around 1,000 troops in the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, which has soldiers from more than 50 countries.- Ukraine prospects -The G7's pledge of continued support for Ukraine comes as the country enters its third winter at war, with battlefield losses in the east and the prospect of reduced US military support should Donald Trump be elected to the White House next month.Biden urged Nato allies during a visit to Berlin on Friday not to step down in backing Ukraine, saying that supporters of Kyiv ""cannot let up"".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, under mounting pressure from Western allies to forge a winning strategy against Russia, on Thursday presented what he called a ""victory plan"" to the European Union and Nato.Its main thrust is a call for immediate Nato membership, deemed unfeasible by alliance members.It also demands the ability to strike military targets inside Russia with long-range weapons, and an undefined ""non-nuclear strategic deterrence package"" on Ukrainian territory.Another worry for Ukraine are reports, based on South Korean intelligence, that North Korea is deploying large numbers of troops to support Moscow's war against Ukraine.Nato was not as yet able to confirm that intelligence, Rutte said on Friday.","G7 defence ministers pledge ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine. But they also warn of the dangers of further intensification in the Middle East. The ministers call for Iran to stop supporting Hamas and Hezbollah.

At least seven people died on Saturday when part of a ferry dock collapsed on Sapelo Island , Georgia, during cultural day celebrations. The event was organised by the island’s Gullah-Geechee community, descendants of Black slaves.The incident occurred at around 4:30 pm when a boat struck the dock, causing a gangway at the dock to collapse, plunging people into the water during the annual celebrations.""Several people fell into the water after the collapse,"" a McIntosh County commissioner said, as reported by CNN.Authorities said that several individuals were taken to hospitals following the collapse. The exact number of injured remains unclear, according to the Georgia department of natural resources. The US coast guard , McIntosh County fire department, and Georgia department of natural resources are searching the water for more victims.“There have been seven confirmed fatalities,” said natural resources department spokesperson Tyler Jones. “Multiple people have been transported to area hospitals, and we are continuing to search the water for individuals.”According to Jones, there were about 20 people on the dock when it collapsed. Among the fatalities was a chaplain for the state agency, Jones added.Search efforts involved helicopters and boats equipped with side-scanning sonar.Authorities are investigating the cause of the collapse.Georgia governor Brian Kemp expressed his sorrow over the incident, saying, “As state and local first responders continue to work this active scene, we ask that all Georgians join us in praying for those lost, for those still in harm’s way, and for their families.”Sapelo Island, located about 60 miles south of Savannah, is accessible only by boat. The dock collapse occurred during the island's cultural day, an annual event celebrating the Gullah-Geechee community, also known as the Hogg Hummock community. This community, consisting of descendants of former slaves from the Thomas Spalding cotton plantation, has a rich history and close-knit bonds. Hogg Hummock was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.Roger Lotson, the only Black member of the McIntosh County board of commissioners, stressed the community's unity in times of tragedy. “Everyone is family, and everyone knows each other,” he said. “In any tragedy, especially like this, they are all one. They’re all united. They all feel the same pain and the same hurt.”","At least seven people died when part of a ferry dock collapsed on Sapelo Island, Georgia, during cultural day celebrations.

"Elon Musk: No steering wheel, no pedals, no driver: Inside Elon Musk's fully self-driving Tesla Cybercab",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-steering-wheel-no-pedals-no-driver-inside-elon-musks-fully-self-driving-tesla-cybercab/articleshow/114285900.cms,"Tesla Robotaxi Ride-Along (Unedited)

When can we expect the

Robotaxi Network

?

Just when it seemed like Elon Musk had achieved the impossible after his SpaceX caught a booster rocket, we now have the a fully self-driving cab without a driver, a pedal, a steering wheel, or any other sort of manual intervention. Tesla’s much-anticipated Cybercab was unveiled in California, offering a preview of what could be the future of urban transport .The event, held at Warner Bros. Discovery studios, featured the self-driving vehicle navigating an artificial city environment, specially designed for the showcase. Although the Cybercab is not yet ready for public roads, its reveal sparked excitement and raised questions about the future of autonomous technology .The Cybercab’s design immediately stands out, with its sleek, pod-like shape and futuristic butterfly doors that open upward. The interior, completely devoid of traditional controls like a steering wheel or pedals, feels like something straight out of a science fiction film. Its spacious, minimalist cabin is controlled through a touchscreen interface, further enhancing its futuristic appeal.Despite its sci-fi aesthetic, there are practical concerns about how the vehicle will handle the unpredictability of real-world driving. In the controlled environment of the studio, the Cybercab moved effortlessly, gliding through streets that mimicked a real city.However, it’s unclear how well the vehicle would perform in a more chaotic setting with unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians or cyclists.During the demonstration, the Cybercab did show signs of situational awareness , stopping instantly when someone stepped into its path, indicating that it can detect and respond to its surroundings. This suggests that Tesla has made significant progress toward achieving full autonomy, though there is still a long way to go before such vehicles are ready for widespread use.While the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are clear, including reduced human error and greater accessibility for those unable to drive, concerns remain. Questions about how these vehicles will handle complex, split-second decisions in real-world scenarios persist. Additionally, the ethical and safety implications of allowing machines to take full control of the driving process are still being debated.Tesla’s Cybercab represents a bold step towards the future of transportation. While it offers a glimpse of what might be possible, there are still many challenges—both technical and societal—that must be addressed before fully autonomous vehicles become a part of everyday life. For now, the Cybercab serves as a compelling vision of a future where mobility is redefined, but its role in that future remains to be determined.Tasha Keeney, ARK Invest ’s Director of Investment Analysis & Institutional Strategies, has suggested that Tesla’s Robotaxi Network could launch as early as 2025 or 2026. Keeney believes that Tesla might not need to wait for the Cybercab to roll out its Robotaxi Network.Both Keeney and Cathie Wood, ARK Invest’s CEO, attended Tesla’s “We, Robot” event on 10th October, where they waited to ride in the newly revealed Tesla Cybercab , which is intended to be central to the Robotaxi Network.However, Keeney and her colleagues at ARK Invest are of the view that Tesla could launch the network without the Cybercab. She argued that Tesla already possesses a fleet of vehicles equipped with Hardware 3 and 4, which could achieve full autonomy via over-the-air software updates.Even if Tesla opts to wait until the Cybercab is ready for fully autonomous rides, ARK Invest has suggested that the company could still introduce the Robotaxi Network using human drivers. In 2020, ARK Invest released an article explaining why it would be advantageous for Tesla to launch the network with human drivers first.ARK argued that a ride-hailing network would boost Tesla’s profitability before the robotaxi service becomes operational. Furthermore, they suggested that launching the robotaxi service would not require significant engineering resources, aside from crucial tasks such as routing, payment integration, and other necessary functions.ARK also noted that a vertically integrated ride-hailing service using highly efficient electric vehicles would increase the proportion of miles driven on electric platforms, furthering","Tesla’s much-anticipated Cybercab was unveiled in California, offering a preview of what could be the future of urban transport.

The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Well, I'd be a very silly person not to take action when he comes into the same jurisdiction as me. But I think I'd be even sillier to reveal my hand prematurely,"" Simon said earlier without revealing his entire plan.Daily Mail reported that close protection experts have confirmed the Australian will be closely watched by Royal bodyguards while the King and Queen are in the country.""There is probably around 20 names on that watchlist already. And certainly anyone making a noise publicly will be of high interest. Background searches will have already been carried out on any names they have and it's standard to do psych evaluations based on any criminal conviction and social media,"" a protection expert told Daily Mail Australia.Dorante-Day posted a message on Facebook on Thursday in which he wrote: ""Hi Everyone, I have been busy for the past few weeks working on a case against the Queensland Police Service for their continued breach of duty, which was filed in the Queensland Supreme Court on Monday. As a family not only have, we had to deal with the public awareness of my adoption issue, but we have also had to deal with the abuse, harassment, threats and menacing of certain sections of society. For nearly four years now we’ve been forced to endure this treatment and its long overdue that it is legally addressed.""""The primary focus of this case can be centrally framed around one thing, the rights of the adopted person, the adoptee. These rights, legislatively established at the original adoption of the child, exist throughout the lifespan of the adoptee, and are primarily focused on the “best interests and welfare of” the adoptee. It is apparent these rights are transparent to the QPS and that they are not upholding firstly, their duty of care to my family and I, and secondly, my human rights under the Queensland Human Rights Act,"" he wrote.Dorante-Day claimed that he was adopted in August 1966 when he was about eight months old. His grandmother worked for the Royal Family and he claimed to be the love child of Camilla and Charles. In 1966, Camilla was 18 and Charles 17. He claimed to be the actual heir to the UK throne. He also claimed that after his birth, Charles was sent to Australia to study and Camilla disappeared from the public eye.“The fact that the left side of my face identically matches Charles whilst neither William nor Harry’s does, raises the obvious question, just who are Charles’s real sons?” Dorante-Day wrote in a Facebook post.King Charles and Queen Camilla touched down in Sydney on Friday night -- beginning their tour of Australia and Samoa where the King will attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting between October 21 and 26.",Simon Dorante-Day has been claiming that he is the lovechild of King Charles and Camilla who was given up for adoption soon after his birth.

I really ecstatic.” Musk clarified that the only requirement for receiving the funds is to act as a spokesperson for the petition.This initiative builds on Musk’s earlier offer of $47 for each registered voter referred to the petition. Launched by Musk's Elon's America PAC, the goal is to gather one million signatures from voters in key swing states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. “Our goal is to get 1 million registered voters to sign in support of the Constitution, especially freedom of speech and the right to bear arms,” he added.Musk, a ""mega donor"" for Trump, having donated over $75 million to the former presidents campaign has ramped up his endorsement, holding town halls across Pennsylvania. He had earlier attended rallies alongside Trump, and said that, “This will be the last election if Trump doesn’t win”.While federal law prohibits payment for registering to vote, Musk's strategy remains within legal bounds as it pertains to petition signing.With elections less than 3 weeks out, both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are mobilising their supporters in key battleground states. Harris, joined by pop stars like Lizzo, has been painting Trump as “exhausted” and out of touch, while Trump counters by t his talking about his connections with working-class voters.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced that he will award $1 million to randomly selected registered voters in Pennsylvania who sign America PAC’s petition.

'When he took showers with the other pros ...': Trump's unexpected tribute to Arnold Palmer in Pennsylvania rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-talks-about-andrew-palmers-genitalia-at-rally-in-pennsylvania-he-was-all-man-/articleshow/114387273.cms,"During the Rally Trump wore a construction hat given to him by local steelworkers who endorsed him

Donald Trump delivered an unexpected tribute to the late golfing legend Arnold Palmer. During a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania Trump spent over 12 minutes celebrating Palmer's legacy and character, even making a surprising comment about the golfer’s genitalia. He shared a anecdote regarding the reactions of fellow golfers when they showered with Palmer, saying, “They said, ‘Oh my God.That’s unbelievable,’” eliciting laughter from the crowd.“Arnold Palmer was all man, and I say that in all due respect to women,” Trump said.""This man was strong and tough. And I refuse to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there, they said, oh, my god,"" Trump quipped.While many politicians have paid tribute to Palmer in his hometown, Trump’s focus on the golfer's physique was unusual. He suggested that the evening would have been more enjoyable if Palmer could have joined him on stage.As the rally continued, Trump shifted gears to discuss his campaign strategies, suggesting that he would begin previewing his closing arguments against Vice President Kamala Harris , with the election looming in less than two weeks. His remarks veered into familiar territory as he touted his record on tax policies and military strength during his presidency.He did not hold back in his criticism of Harris, calling her “crazy” and saying, “You’re the worst vice president. Kamala, you’re fired. Get the hell out of here.” Trump also targeted Harris for her past comments on hydraulic fracking, a significant issue for Pennsylvania's economy, insisting she had changed her position.Throughout the rally, Trump maintained a connection with the enthusiastic crowd, donning a construction hat given to him by local steelworkers who endorsed him. He also made headlines by mentioning a call he received from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid ongoing conflicts in Gaza, suggesting that Netanyahu wouldn’t listen to President Biden.In closing, Trump remarked on the heightened security around him, referencing two previous assassination attempts and quipping about the armed guards, before circling back to Palmer, saying, “They look like Arnold. Can’t look better than Arnold.”","During a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania Trump spent over 12 minutes celebrating Palmer's legacy and character.

Did Hurricane Milton wash ashore a '1700s Ghost Ship' in St. Augustine?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-hurricane-milton-wash-ashore-a-1700s-ghost-ship-in-st-augustine/articleshow/114383291.cms,"Expert Debunks the myth

Can Hurricanes actually cause 'ghost ships' to wash ashore?



(Inputs taken from Pensacola news Journal)

There was a social media buzz on Wednesday with rumours of a “1700s ghost ship” that allegedly washed ashore near St. Augustine , Florida , following Hurricane Milton . Despite several inconsistencies, the story went viral, captivating thousands of users.However, it was eventually debunked as false.The rumour emerged a week after Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida.Despite the fact that the storm hit on October 9—exactly one week before the alleged sighting—and on the opposite side of the state, the ghost ship story still gained significant traction. The original post amassed over 21,000 shares, with users spreading the narrative widely.As it turns out, the ghost ship tale was a piece of satire. It originated from Casper Planet , a Facebook page known for its humorous and entirely fabricated stories, similar to The Onion.Casper Planet posted a follow-up story on Friday morning titled, “Tourists Outraged After Discovering Non-Existent 1700s Pirate Ship in Florida ‘Wasn’t Real’ All Along.” The page continued to poke fun at the viral spread of the ghost ship narrative.In its initial post, Casper Planet claimed that the ship had “emerged from the ocean’s depths as the Category 4 storm [Hurricane Milton] churned the Atlantic, sending the ancient ship onto the beach.” The dramatic description added a sense of mystery, but it was factually inaccurate. Hurricane Milton had made landfall as a Category 3 storm near Siesta Key, on Florida’s central west coast. It then crossed the state’s peninsula, exiting near Brevard and Indian River counties—over 120 miles from St. Augustine.To lend the story an air of credibility, the page included a fabricated quote from a fictional marine archaeologist named “Dr. Andrew Clarke,” who said, “This is unprecedented. To see a ship this old, in such good condition, simply appear out of the ocean during a hurricane − it’s both fascinating and chilling.”According to First Coast News report, Chuck Meide, director of the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program at the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum. Meide debunked the ghost ship claim, explaining that the depiction of the ship was unrealistic.“Most of the wood from a ship hundreds of years old would have been eaten by critters like ship worms,” Meide explained. In cases where parts of such ancient ships do survive, it’s typically the lower portion of the vessel, which gets buried beneath the seafloor.While the ghost ship story was a hoax, there is some truth to the concept of hurricanes washing abandoned ships ashore. In fact, such incidents have occurred in the past.According to Weather.com, a 45-foot ghost ship named Lady Catherine III washed ashore on Pensacola Beach on June 18 during Tropical Storm Alberto. The vessel, battered but still intact, was found with no passengers on board. It was later discovered that the boat belonged to Michael Barlow, a Texas man who had abandoned it earlier that month after encountering the storm.In another instance, a 45-foot sailboat called Cuki broke free from its mooring in Key West during Hurricane Irma in 2017. The boat drifted over 300 miles up Florida’s eastern coast before washing ashore at Spessard Holland South Beach Park. USA Today reported that the boat remained there for two years before it was demolished. Its owner, Jeffrey Sundwall of Key West, was later imprisoned at Jackson Correctional Institute in Malone, Florida, on charges including sexual battery, cocaine possession, obstruction of a criminal investigation, and possession of child pornography.","The rumour emerged a week after Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida.

Troop Movements and Evidence

Implications for the Conflict

International Reactions

Seoul and Kyiv have reported the deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia in its ongoing war in Ukraine , raising serious concerns about escalating tensions in the region. According to South Korea 's intelligence agency, approximately 1,500 special forces troops have already arrived in Russia’s Far East for training and acclimatization, with estimates suggesting that the total number could eventually reach as high as 12,000.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky further intensified these concerns, claiming that North Korea is preparing to send an additional 10,000 soldiers to bolster Moscow’s military efforts. In response to these developments, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated that he could not confirm the reports of troop movements but acknowledged that if true, it would be concerning.Both North Korea and Russia have denied allegations of troop deployments. In light of these reports, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol convened a security meeting, stressing that the international community must respond using ""all available means."" South Korean intelligence revealed that North Korean soldiers were issued Russian military uniforms, weapons, and fake IDs, suggesting an attempt to disguise their presence on the battlefield.Experts believe that this deployment marks a significant solidification of the military alliance between North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin, established during their meeting in June, which included a mutual defense clause. Analyst Hong Min from the Korea Institute for National Unification stated, ""This establishes a framework where Russia's intervention or military support will automatically occur if North Korea is attacked or faces a crisis.""As the conflict in Ukraine evolves, Ukrainian officials have warned of a significant escalation risk, with North Korean troops predicted to enhance Russia's capacity to maintain control over occupied territories. Kyiv's military intelligence chief, Kyrlo Budanov, estimated that around 2,600 North Korean soldiers are expected to be deployed in Kursk by November 1.Meanwhile Stratcom Center (The Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security of Ukraine) claimed the presence of North Korean troops in Russian. In a video released on X it said, ""Newly obtained footage from Russia's Sergievsky Training Ground showing North Korean troops being outfitted in Russian gear in preparation for deployment to Ukraine.""Recent reports indicated that video footage showed North Korean troops arriving at Russian military bases in Vladivostok and picking up military equipment. The South Korean spy agency disclosed that the initial contingent of 1,500 troops is likely to be just the beginning, with the final figure possibly reaching 12,000.Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Sybiga emphasized the ""huge threat of further escalation,"" as North Korean forces are expected to enter the battlefield within days. The South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) speculated that this effort to disguise North Korean troops as Russian soldiers is part of a broader strategy.The involvement of North Korean troops adds complexity to the conflict. While reports suggest these special operations forces are well-trained, their lack of advanced military equipment raises questions about their effectiveness. Expert Hazel Smith remarked, ""If there are soldiers, the only reason they are likely to be special operations soldiers is that North Korea can’t risk sending conscripts as they don’t trust conscripts; their priority would be to defect or disappear.""The North Korea-Russia alliance has implications not only for the current conflict but also for regional security dynamics. This deployment could facilitate Russia's ability to hold onto occupied territories or assist in further territorial advances in Ukraine.Despite denials from Russia and North Korea regarding troop movements, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recognized the seriousness of the situation but noted that definitive evidence is still lacking. Nato chief Mark Rutte added that there is currently no evidence to support claims of North Korean troop involvement.The United States has urged transparency on this issue, with Mike Turner, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, demanding a briefing from the White House about intelligence assessments related to North Korean troop movements. He expressed frustration over the administration's failure to provide sufficient information to Congress.","1,500 special forces troops have already arrived in Russia’s Far East for training and acclimatization.

A Conversation with Mia Khalifa

Mia Khalifa 's journey from adult film star to social media influencer has been marked by controversy and resilience. In a recent interview with The New York Times , she discussed her experiences in the adult industry, the ongoing Israel-Lebanon conflict, and the impact of growing up in a post-9/11 America .Khalifa's entry into the adult film industry at the age of 21 quickly made her infamous, particularly after a scene in which she wore a hijab went viral.This video led to severe backlash, including death threats and harassment. Reflecting on this tumultuous period, she stated, “I became infamous by accident.” The intensity of the reaction forced her to leave the adult industry, as she realised she could not return to a normal life. “I decided to try to be an influencer and a public person if that was the fate that I had sealed for myself,” she explained.Now boasting millions of followers across platforms like X, Instagram, and TikTok, Khalifa has shifted her focus from adult content to lifestyle and political commentary. She described her current brand as one of evolution, saying, “Where I am now mentally, emotionally, on every level, is a complete 180 from who I was.” While she engages her TikTok audience with light-hearted videos, she uses X to advocate for various social issues. Despite the adult content associated with her work onOnlyFans , Khalifa emphasises authenticity, stating, “Just because I look a certain way in a bikini does not necessarily mean it’s not for the girls.”In discussing her experience on OnlyFans, Khalifa acknowledged the complexities of sex work. “It is [sex work], and I feel like people who get insulted by that feel ashamed of being lumped in with sex workers,” she said. Despite this, she views her participation as one of agency and control, insisting that it should not be seen as a solution to financial desperation. Khalifa stressed her responsibility to represent the platform carefully, stating, “I have a responsibility to not promote it as something that any woman should join unless they’ve already been in the sex-work industry.”Khalifa also opened up about her struggles with internalized misogyny, which she attributes to cultural pressures. Growing up in Washington, DC, in a post-9/11 world exposed her to blatant racism, leading her to question her identity. “I grew up in DC in a post-9/11 world, and there was a lot of blatant racism,” she recalled, reflecting on how this experience forced her to conform to societal expectations.Amid ongoing violence in the Israel-Lebanon conflict, Khalifa has remained actively engaged in discussions about the humanitarian crisis. With friends and family in Lebanon, she expressed concern for their safety and said, “They’re able to open their doors and give them a place to stay.” Her activism extends to social media, where she addresses critical issues such as human rights and the importance of speaking out on political matters. “It’s not taboo to have an opinion,” she asserted, arguing that influencers should participate in political discourse rather than shy away from it.","Mia Khalifa is a social media influencer and former adult film star.

A recent poll conducted by the Manhattan Institute has revealed that Jewish support for the Democratic Party is at its lowest since the Reagan era, as Vice President Kamala Harris struggles to rally voters ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The survey, carried out between October 5 and 9, included a representative sample of 658 Jewish registered voters across the United States and highlighted growing concerns within the Jewish community regarding antisemitism , Israel, and other policy issues.While Jewish voters remain predominantly aligned with the Democratic Party, their support is weakening. According to the Manhattan Institute poll, Harris is poised to perform worse among Jewish voters than any Democratic candidate since the 1980s. If the election were held today, the poll indicates that Harris would secure 67% of the Jewish vote, while former President Donald Trump would receive 31%. This shift in support marks a significant departure from past election cycles.Historically, Jewish voters have shown strong support for Democratic candidates. In 1992, Bill Clinton secured 80% of the Jewish vote over George Bush Sr. However, support has gradually declined; Joe Biden received 68% of the Jewish vote in 2020, while Hillary Clinton won 71% in 2016. The trend of declining Jewish support for Democrats has accelerated since the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel by Hamas.The poll’s findings reveal that Jewish voters are increasingly uneasy about the Democratic Party’s stance on antisemitism. A significant 62% of respondents expressed concern over growing antisemitism within the party. Jesse Arm, Chief of Staff at the Manhattan Institute, noted, “Many are likely uncomfortable with the Democratic Party’s tolerance of voices that criticize Israel in extreme terms, such as labeling the country ‘genocidal.’ This is evidenced by the fact that Jews are almost universally supportive of Israel—a mere 5% of Jewish voters say they are not supporters of the Jewish state.”The survey also found that Jewish voters are largely united in their support for Israel, with 86% expressing strong support for the Jewish state. “Security, Israel, and antisemitism” were identified as Harris’s weakest issues relative to Trump among Jewish voters, indicating that these topics are pivotal in shaping Jewish voter preferences ahead of the election.Despite the overall decline in support for the Democratic Party, Jewish voters still align with Democrats on specific issues, such as abortion. A majority of Jewish Republicans also described themselves as pro-choice. In contrast, on immigration, crime, and fiscal matters, Jewish voters’ views diverge, showing a mix of moderate and conservative positions. For instance, Jewish voters want increased vetting in the immigration process but are generally supportive of expanding high-skilled immigration.On crime, Jewish voters are more in line with Republican views, feeling that the nation’s criminal justice system is not tough enough. They are also fiscally moderate, expressing concern over government spending while supporting higher taxes on middle- to upper-income brackets.The poll also shed light on Jewish voters' perspectives on free speech and university policies. Jewish respondents expressed support for laws banning people from covering their faces with the intent to conceal their identity in public places, a stance that gained traction following incidents of anti-Israel activists intimidating Jewish students on college campuses and targeting Jewish community members across the US.Additionally, Jewish voters expressed a desire for universities to be held accountable, supporting taxation on university endowments. They also showed a preference for a color-blind society over race-conscious policies, revealing divided opinions on affirmative action and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives.The poll highlighted denominational differences within the Jewish community regarding support for Harris and Trump. Harris’s strongest backing came from Reform and unaffiliated or nondenominational Jews, who are traditionally more aligned with progressive causes. However, her support was notably weaker among Conservative Jewish voters, and Orthodox Jewish voters showed a preference for Trump, leading him by 18 points.Religious observance also played a role in voter preferences. Among Jewish voters who attend religious services weekly, Harris led Trump by a narrow margin of 51% to 46%. In contrast, those who never attend services overwhelmingly supported Harris, with a 75% to 24% lead over Trump.","A recent poll conducted by the Manhattan Institute has revealed that Jewish support for the Democratic Party is at its lowest since the Reagan era.

HYDERABAD: In a public rally on Friday, leading Pakistpolitician Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari warned that if political parties in parliament do not reach a consensus on the 26th constitutional amendment , he will push the amendment through parliament using a brute, or two-thirds majority, Dawn reported. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party which is led by his father Asif Ali Zardari who is the President of Pakistan.Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ) is in coalition with PM Shehbaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N). These two parties along with Fazlur Rehman's Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) have come together to implement the 26th constitutional amendment in Pakistan's constitution.While addressing a PPP rally in Pakistan's Hyderabad city to mark the anniversary of the attack on his mother's homecoming parade in 2007, Bilawal Bhutto said, ""It is my desire to have consensus among all political parties in parliament for this amendment. The second option, which is not my preferred path, is to rely on the majority's vote to pass it,"" Dawn noted.He urged political parties to consider the future and work towards raising the dignity of parliament, adding that they operate within a certain ""political space"".Bhutto noted that while the PPP was unable to establish a constitutional court during its 2008-2013 government, he is committed to fulfilling the promise made by Benazir Bhutto.He acknowledged opposition to the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), particularly fromPTI leaders, but insisted that the new court would ensure equal representation for all provinces.PTI has been protesting across Pakistan against the implementation of the constitutional amendments as the Party alleges that the bill would undermine the powers of judiciary.PTI leaders have also alleged that bribes up to Rs 1 Billion are being offered to lawmakers to garner support for passing the amendment law.In the public rally, Bilawal Bhutto gave out historical justifications for implementation of the 26th amendment saying that even Muhammad Ali Jinnah had called for a separate court for routine justice matters at the 1930 Round Table Conference.The FCC, Bhutto claimed, would protect the rights of provinces by providing equal representation and addressing disputes between the federation and provinces.As per Dawn, Bhutto insisted that his mother and former Pakistan PM Benazir Bhutto had supported the establishment of the FCC because she understood the ""real face"" of the judiciary, which he said had repeatedly legitimised dictatorial rule.""After abolishing the 'One Unit' system in the country through parliament, my mother wanted to eliminate the concept of 'One Unit' in the judiciary as well,"" he added.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party.

NEW DELHI: Police in Pakistan used tear gas and batons to disperse student protesters on Thursday after they ransacked a college building. The protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger and demonstrations in four cities.Reports of the incident spread on social media, increasing tensions on college campuses. Students in Rawalpindi, Punjab province, burned furniture and blocked a key road before vandalizing a college building.Earlier, a security guard died during clashes between student protesters and police in Gujrat, also in Punjab province. Authorities arrested one person related to the guard's death and another for spreading misinformation about the alleged rape.In Lahore, over two dozen students were injured earlier this week while demanding justice for the alleged victim, who students claim was raped at the Punjab Group of Colleges.In response to the growing unrest, the government banned rallies in Punjab. The Federal Investigation Agency filed cases against 36 people accused of spreading misinformation on social media.Authorities, including the Punjab chief minister, and the woman’s parents denied any assault happened. However, Punjab police called on the public to share any information regarding the alleged rape.The unrest seems to have started spontaneously, as student unions in Pakistan have been banned since 1984.These protests also come after a woman reported being gang-raped during a polio vaccination drive in Sindh province last month. Police arrested three men involved, but the woman's husband expelled her from home, citing damage to the family name.","Protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger.

LAHORE: Describing foreign minister S Jaishankar ’s visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting as a positive development that should provide an opening for more substantive engagements between the 2 countries, former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi saying the latter’s decision to visit Sharif’s home in 2015 was not an ordinary gesture. Sharif sought progress in ties saying the relationship should not be held captive by the past.Sharif, a 3-time PM and elder brother of Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.“Achhe bhare talukkat ko tabah aur barbad karne waali baat ki (he worked to destroy a healthy relationship). I would have never used that kind of language. We believe in certain values that must be respected,” said Sharif, adding he had fond memories of Modi’s only visit to Pakistan on December 25, 2015, Sharif’s birthday.As then Pakistan PM, Sharif had received Modi at his home in Lahore. “I got a call from him saying he was in Kabul and wanted to visit me on his way back to India. I told him he was most welcome. He also met my mother during the visit. What he did wasn’t a chota (small) gesture,” said Sharif, in a meeting with Indian journalists in Lahore who travelled to Pakistan to cover Jaishankar’s engagements. The former PM is also the leader of the ruling PMLN party. His daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Sharif was also present in the interaction.Khan’s personal attacks against Modi after India revoked the special status of J&K only led to further deterioration of relations between the 2 countries. Sharif did not comment on India’s recent actions in the union territory as he said this wasn’t the occasion to discuss it. PM Shehbaz too had avoided raking up the Kashmir issue even in a roundabout manner at the SCO meeting.Sharif also called upon both sides to look ahead and not be held back by the past even though he didn’t make any specific commitment on resumingtrade ties or reappointing high commissioner. He did say that if there’s an opening, cheezein niklengi (things will emerge).Asked about his 2015 peace initiative with Modi that was scuttled quickly by the Pathankot terror attack, Sharif said it’s important to ensure any such effort is not disrupted. “India is our hamsaya (neighbour) mulk and we can’t change that even if we want it. We would have liked Modi to come (for SCO) but it’s good Jaishankar came. We have tried and tried again (to normalise ties). We lost the past 75 years and it’s important we don’t lose another 75 years,” said Sharif, who is known to share a close personal rapport with Modi.“Both sides have their giley-shikwe (grievances). It will be better if we can bury the past,” he added. When asked if he would play the role of building bridges, he said he was doing it.Sharif also backed SAARC, trade and cricket ties with India, saying neither country gains anything by not allowing their teams to play each other. He also recalled how former Indian PM A B Vajpayee had approached him to buy electricity from Pakistan. “I would allow my team to play. If there’s a cricket tournament on India and Pakistan and India are playing in the final, I’ll travel to India to watch it. There should be progress. SAARC or any such opportunity should not be missed. It’s important to make full use of it,” he said.“I believe we are a potential market for each other. Why should Indian and Pakistani farmers and manufacturers go outside to sell their products. Goods now go from Amritsar to Lahore via Dubai. Who is benefitting from this? What should take 2 hours takes 2 weeks,” he added.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi.

Lahore, Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday dismissed allegations of an on-campus rape incident at a Lahore college as fabricated, accusing Pakistan's jailed former premier Imran Khan's party of using the false claim to incite widespread student protests and create unrest in the province. She also demanded that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party be treated in the same way as ""banned organisations"" in the country.Maryam, daughter of former three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, claimed that the rape incident was fabricated to create unrest in Punjab. She accused political opponents, particularly PTI, of using students and the media to propagate false information for political gains.On Wednesday, a large number of students held demonstrations in Jehlum, Faisalabad, and Gujrat, demanding justice for the alleged rape victim.However, the chief minister stated that no incident of rape took place at the Punjab College for Women in Lahore. She alleged that PTI and its media supporters spread the fake news to destabilise the province by manipulating innocent students.On Monday, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured during clashes with police over the alleged rape incident. Protesters claimed that the college administration had deleted CCTV footage to cover up the case.Maryam accused PTI of attempting to destabilise the government by spreading false narratives, particularly during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which portrayed Pakistan positively on the global stage. The two-day SCO summit concluded on Wednesday.She warned of strict action against those spreading fake news, including media personnel. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said, adding that the girl in question had suffered a back injury, not a rape, and was in the hospital ICU since October 2, contradicting the circulated claims.Addressing PTI founder Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail for the last 15 months, she remarked, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are.""The chief minister also accused certain individuals from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and abroad of fuelling the controversy through fake news.""The issue isn't social media, but rather PTI, which needs to be controlled...and everything will be fine.

ISLAMABAD: External affairs minister S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days even though there was no formal bilateral meeting between the foreign ministers on the margins of the SCO heads of government summit in Islamabad, diplomatic sources said. The fact that the first visit by an Indian foreign minister to Pakistan in almost 9 years went off without a hitch was seen as a positive development by the Indian government.As he departed after a 24-hour stay in Islamabad from the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, Jaishankar, who had said recently India isn’t passive on Pakistan and will react to positive and negative developments accordingly, thanked Shehbaz and Dar in a post on X for the hospitality and courtesies.While Indian government sources described the talks as casual conversations, Pakistan officials said there was a brief pull aside, which lasted for 5 to 7 minutes, between Jaishankar and Dar on the sidelines of the dinner hosted by Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday evening. Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), is learnt to have joined Jaishankar and Dar.A source speaking on condition of anonymity said Pakistan suggested resumption of bilateral cricketing ties as a way of “breaking the ice”. Naqvi was later quoted as saying that Jaishankar’s visit was an ice-breaker even though neither side proposed a bilateral meeting. Pakistan is looking to host the Champions Trophy next year and would like India to participate.The relationship between the 2 countries has remained in deep-freeze since the abortive bid to resume the dialogue process in 2015 under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. Things only worsened after Pakistan recalled its high commissioner in August 2019, following India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K.Indian government sources appreciated the fact that Shehbaz didn’t rake up any bilateral issue in his remarks as the host of the summit.While Jaishankar’s remarks on terrorism were seen as a message for Pakistan, Indian sources said the minister had only spoken about issues that the SCO has identified as key challenges and that other member-states can also relate to.Jaishankar is learnt to have had another extended conversation with Dar at the SCO lunch table on Wednesday where both were seated next to each other. “It wasn’t initially planned that way but later they sat together and spoke over lunch in the presence of other delegates,’’ said.Both sides denied that there was any proposal for resumption of dialogue. Shehbaz and Indian PM Narendra Modi are expected to come face to face next month at COP29 in Azerbaijan but for any substantive engagement, India will want Pakistan to first reappoint high commissioner.After his return from Pakistan, Jaishankar said in another post on X that India made a positive and constructive contribution to the talks in Islamabad and identified 8 takeaways from India’s perspective from the documents that were signed. These included upholding fair and balanced connectivity projects in accordance with international law, the goals and principles of the UN Charter and SCO Charter and a fair, open, inclusive and transparent multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.Significantly, another Pakistan minister, Ahsan Iqbal, had told visiting Indian journalists on Tuesday that Pakistan wants the 2 countries to return to the 1999 Lahore Declaration that called upon both sides to refrain from intervening and interfering in each other’s internal affairs. Shehbaz’s brother Nawaz Sharif, who reached the agreement with then Indian PM A B Vajpayee, has repeatedly accused former president Pervez Musharraf of scuttling the Declaration through his Kargil adventurism.","S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days.

He said attaining these original SCO objectives was even more important in an uncertain world marred by conflicts and debt.“It is axiomatic that development and growth requires peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the three evils,’’ said the minister.In a message to both China and Pakistan, the minister also said SCO cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and connectivity must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. “It should recognize territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas,’’ said the minister, adding cooperation can’t progress if global practices are cherry-picked, especially of trade and transit.India was again the only country in SCO to not endorse China’s BRI in the SCO joint statement. BRI’s flagship China Pakistan Economic Project ( CPEC ) passes through PoK, which India sees as under illegal occupation of Pakistan. Since it became a full member of SCO in 2017, India has repeatedly reminded member-states that it’s important for them to respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. China was represented by Premier Li Qiang in the meeting.The minister also spoke about the need to make the UN Security Council more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable. “The SCO must be in the lead of advocating such change, not hold back on a matter of such importance,’’ said the minister. China is the only P5 country not to publicly declare support for India’s UNSC permanent membership bid.“While we each make our contribution, the world order is more than the sum of its parts.

Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party

Senior directors of a Pakistan college stated on Wednesday that there was no evidence to support claims of a student being raped on campus, despite reports circulating online that led to several days of protests. The allegations, which spread through social media posts, claimed that a woman was raped in the basement of a Punjab College for Women campus in Lahore .In response to the posts, hundreds of students, mostly male, engaged in protests that involved smashing windows and burning school buses. These demonstrations reflect a growing concern in Pakistan regarding safety, harassment, and sexual violence.Arif Chaudry, the Lahore director of the private Punjab Group of Colleges , which operates the women's college, was quoted by AFP during a press conference saying, ""The incident does not exist. I will resign and I will leave this profession and stand with the students if the incident took place.""Another director of the group, Agha Tahir Ijaz, urged students not to believe misinformation during the same news conference.As the anger grew over the alleged incident, police arrested a security guard who was identified in the online posts. However, they reported that no victim had come forward and that they were unable to verify the incident.The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has initiated an investigation targeting individuals responsible for disseminating the information via social media channels which is now claimed to be false.The protests, which began at two of the college's campuses on Monday afternoon, quickly spread to several other colleges throughout the city and continued for three days and resulted in injuries to at least 28 people.As the college denied the claims, Maryam Nawaz , the chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab also addressed the alleged rape incident, asserting that the accusations were 'fabricated'.Nawaz further claimed that the political party led by Imran Khan , Pakistan's former prime minister who is currently imprisoned, exploited the false allegation to provoke extensive student demonstrations and cause instability throughout the province.The Punjab government has closed the college campus where the alleged rape was said to have occurred until further notice. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said while warning that those responsible for spreading the false posts would face punishment. Addressing PTI founder Imran Khan, the CM added, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are."" She then claimed that the girl in question had suffered a back injury and had been receiving treatment in the hospital's intensive care unit since October 2 and was not raped.","Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party for 'fabricated' rape claims.
