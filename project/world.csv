China's grip faces strain amid strengthened Russia-North Korea relations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-grip-faces-strain-amid-strengthened-russia-north-korea-relations/articleshow/111180544.cms,"China appears to be maintaining its distance as Russia and North Korea solidify their relationship through a new defence pact, raising concerns over a potential shift in the power dynamics among these three authoritarian states.This development, marked by the agreement between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin , has left China in a challenging position. China's conflicting goals of maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula while countering US influence complicate its response.China has yet to publicly comment on the pact, which mandates mutual defence assistance between Russia and North Korea in case either is attacked. Instead, it has emphasised its commitment to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and a political resolution to the North-South divide. This muted reaction, according to experts, may indicate China's uncertainty on how to respond.“The Chinese response has been ‘very weak,’” noted Victor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Every option is a bad option,"" he elaborated, suggesting Beijing might be struggling due to internal disagreements or an inability to evaluate the situation effectively.Some viewpoints in China might see the Russia-North Korea alignment as a counterbalance to US dominance. Still, Cha believes there is considerable discomfort in China: ""There is also a great deal of discomfort."" China values its influence over North Korea, fears the rise of a destabilising nuclear power nearby, and is wary of drawing the European conflict into Asia. By not voicing these concerns openly, China hopes to avoid driving Kim Jong Un closer to Vladimir Putin.Victor Cha added, ""They don’t want to push Kim Jong Un further into the arms of Vladimir Putin.""John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, addressed the pact, stating, ""The pact between Russia and North Korea ‘should be of concern to any country that believes that the UN Security Council resolutions ought to be abided by.'” The Security Council has sanctioned North Korea to halt its nuclear weapon development. Kirby further noted, ""It should be of concern to anybody who thinks that supporting the people of Ukraine is an important thing to do. And we would think that that concern would be shared by the People's Republic of China.""Another area of concern for China could be the potential for Russia to aid North Korea's weapons program with advanced technology.The meeting between Putin and Kim is another event in the complex political and military landscape of East Asia, where China's influence has grown significantly in recent decades. This development has prompted concerns in the US that China could form alliances with countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran to challenge the US-led international order. Beijing, however, disputes this notion.Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, stated that China does not aim to form a three-way alliance with North Korea and Russia: ""Beijing doesn't want to form a three-way alliance with North Korea and Russia because it ‘needs to keep its options open.’”A coalition could point toward a new Cold War, which Beijing seeks to avoid. Such an alliance would also conflict with China's goals of maintaining positive relationships with Europe and improving ties with Japan and South Korea. Sun added, ""The rapprochement between North Korea and Moscow ‘opens up possibilities and potentials of uncertainty, but based on what has happened so far, I don't think that China's national interests have been undercut by this.'”Closer ties between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin potentially weaken Beijing's influence and could make it ""the biggest loser,"" according to Danny Russel, who served as the top US diplomat for Asia during the Obama administration.","China has yet to publicly comment on the pact, which mandates mutual defence assistance between Russia and North Korea.

"'Ukrainian soldiers turn to yoga on frontline, speed up recovery & rehabilitation'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukrainian-soldiers-turn-to-yoga-on-frontline-speed-up-recovery-rehabilitation/articleshow/111177236.cms,"Ukrainian soldiers are rolling out their yoga mats on the frontlines of the Ukraine war. At the command post of the 225th Separate Assault Brigade , their 37-year-old commander says yoga transformed his life. ""Before the beginning of the full-scale war, back in 2014, I was drafted into infantry operations and I hurt my spine. I started practising yoga regularly in 2016. All my problems disappeared,"" says the young commander. Yoga now helps him with his responsibilities in the war. ""I always try to do asanas, nauli and pranayama, and I read the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. It helps me have better control over my emotions and plan things in my duty.""In conflict-hit Ukraine, yoga is witnessing a rise in popularity for wellness, recovery and healing. There are projects to support Ukrainian yoga teachers and provide them with tools to deal with trauma and PTSD . Some special forces units of the Ukrainian army, like the Falcon Force, are even integrating yoga into their training.The 'Healthy Ukraine' programme, an initiative of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that started in 2021, gave yoga a serious boost. Active Parks, a project under the programme, transformed public parks into weekend fitness clubs, with instructors holding free classes. ""The response for yoga was overwhelming,"" says Elena Siderska, responsible for developing yoga in the project. ""Active Parks now supports studios and clubs that work with trauma, PTSD and rehabilitation of soldiers,"" Siderska adds.Siderska's father, Andrii Siderskyi, the doyen of yoga in Ukraine, says the roots of the Indic practice are long in his country. ""Actually, people in Ukraine came in contact with yoga as far back as the 19th century. Following World War II, Kyiv, Odessa and Kharkiv became some of the main centres of yoga in the Soviet era,"" says Siderskyi.Today yoga has travelled across the world and looped back to Ukraine. Yuliia Denisova works with the charity Fierce Calm. She has been using yoga to help injured Ukrainian soldiers at four rehabilitation centres. ""Yoga nidra and pranayama have had huge benefits for war veterans dealing with sleep disorder, PTSD, and amputation-related challenges,"" affirms Denisova. Valeria Samborskaya, who is running a project to promote trauma-sensitive yoga for Ukraine, concurs. ""We have seen affected soldiers being fearful of going near parks because they were injured in forested areas on the frontline . But after a few sessions of yoga, especially pranayama, they are able to overcome their mental trauma,"" she says. Denisova adds, ""I as a Ukrainian can't thank India enough for giving the world and keeping this wonderful ancient knowledge.""","In conflict-hit Ukraine, yoga is witnessing a rise in popularity for wellness, recovery and healing.

Trump's campaign officials clarify there would be an 'aggressive vetting process' for green cards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-campaign-officials-clarify-there-would-be-an-aggressive-vetting-process-for-green-cards/articleshow/111177001.cms,"In a surprising turnaround from policies he had pursued as the US president, Donald Trump on Thursday promised green cards to all foreign students graduating from US universities. During a podcast, Trump said he would institute policies where ""you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country, and that includes junior colleges"".But hours after Trump's unscripted remarks, his campaign officials tempered the comments, saying there would be an ""aggressive vetting process"" that would ""exclude all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges"", and that the policy would apply only to the ""most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America"".That would still open the doors to tens of thousands of skilled immigrants, mainly from India and China, who come to the US for higher education. By some estimates, more than a million foreign students come to the US every year; and at any given time nearly 300,000 students from India - now said to be the largest contingent of foreign students - are studying at US universities and colleges.In the ""All-In"" podcast hosted by David Sacks, a Silicon Valley investor who backs the former president's 2024 campaign, Trump appeared to be courting - at the risk of angering his voting base - the tech business community which has long sought to streamline the immigration process to get more high-skilled workers who come to America as students and graduate into H1-B visas that allow limited stay in the US. But Trump's nativist MAGA (Make American Great Again) base sees this as a betrayal of American workers.During the Trump presidency, his advisor Stephen Miller fashioned an immigration policy that restricted among other things a work-visa programme for foreign students even though the then president often spoke of giving permanent residency to immigrants who are wealthy and/or highly educated, at the expense of family-based immigration that also allows non-skilled or low-skilled immigrants to get a green card on the basis of family ties.","During a podcast, Trump said he would institute policies where ""you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card"" But hours after Trump's unscripted remarks, his campaign officials tempered the comments, saying there would be an ""aggressive vetting process""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111177174,imgsize-1540454,width-400,resizemode-4/111177174.jpg"

China threatens death penalty for 'diehard' Taiwan separatists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-threatens-death-penalty-for-diehard-taiwan-separatists/articleshow/111176612.cms,"China on Friday threatened to impose the death penalty in extreme cases for ""diehard"" Taiwan independence separatists, a ratcheting up of pressure even though Chinese courts have no jurisdiction on the democratically governed island.China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has made no secret of its dislike of President Lai Ching-te who took office last month, saying he is a ""separatist"", and staged war games shortly after his inauguration.Taiwan has complained of a pattern of ramped up Chinese pressure since Lai won the election in January, including ongoing military actions, trade sanctions and coast guard patrols around Taiwan-controlled islands next to China.The new guidelines say China's courts, prosecutors, public and state security bodies should ""severely punish Taiwan independence diehards for splitting the country and inciting secession crimes in accordance with the law, and resolutely defend national sovereignty , unity and territorial integrity "", according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency.The guidelines are being issued in accordance with laws already on the books, including the 2005 anti-succession law , Xinhua said.That law gives China the legal basis for military action against Taiwan if it secedes or seems about to.Sun Ping，an official from China's Ministry of Public Security, told reporters in Beijing the maximum penalty for the ""crime of secession"" was the death penalty.""The sharp sword of legal action will always hang high,"" she said.There was no immediate response from Taiwan's government. One official told Reuters they were still digesting the contents of the new guidelines.The guidelines detail what is considered a crime worthy of punishment, including promoting Taiwan's entry to international organisations where statehood is a condition, having ""external official exchanges"" and ""suppressing"" parties, groups and people that promote ""reunification"".The guidelines add a further clause to what could be considered a crime - ""other acts that seek to separate Taiwan from China"" - meaning the rules can be broadly interpreted.Lai has repeatedly offered to hold talks with China but has been rebuffed. He says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.China has taken legal measures against Taiwanese officials before, including imposing sanctions on Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan's former de facto ambassador to the United States and now the island's vice president.Such punishments have little practical effect as Chinese courts do not have jurisdiction in Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.Senior Taiwanese officials, including its president, also do not visit China.","Taiwan has complained of a pattern of ramped up Chinese pressure since Lai won the election in January.

Breakthrough in MH370 search: Researchers detect promising new signal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/breakthrough-in-mh370-search-researchers-detect-promising-new-signal/articleshow/111118450.cms,"Initial search and early efforts (2014-2015)

A newly detected signal might finally provide answers to the long-standing mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 , which vanished nearly ten years ago. British researchers from Cardiff University have identified a fresh clue that could help pinpoint the final resting place of the ill-fated jet.The signal, detected recently, is being hailed as a significant development in the search for MH370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board. Despite extensive searches over the years, the plane's exact location has remained elusive.Richard Godfrey, a British engineer who has been heavily involved in the search efforts, said, ""We have detected a weak signal that could potentially be from the aircraft. This is the first time we have such a lead in years.""The researchers believe the new signal could help narrow down the search area in the southern Indian Ocean, where the aircraft is believed to have ended its flight. The signal's detection comes after years of using advanced technology and simulations to trace the plane's final moments.Experts involved in the search are cautiously optimistic about this development. ""This signal could be the breakthrough we have been waiting for. We hope it will bring closure to the families of those on board,"" said another member of the research team.The disappearance of MH370 has been one of aviation's greatest mysteries, leading to numerous theories and extensive international search efforts. The search for MH370 has been one of the most challenging and complex in aviation history, involving multiple countries, advanced technology, and extensive resources.Following the disappearance, a massive international search operation was launched. Initial efforts focused on the South China Sea but later shifted to the southern Indian Ocean based on satellite data.The first phase involved surface searches by ships and aircraft, covering thousands of square kilometers. Despite the vast efforts, no debris was found in the initial stages.In April 2014, Australia's Ocean Shield vessel, equipped with advanced underwater search technology, was deployed. It searched for acoustic signals from the aircraft's black boxes but found no conclusive evidence.Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) like Bluefin-21 and GO Phoenix were deployed to conduct detailed seafloor searches in the Indian Ocean's search zones, covering areas with depths of up to 6,000 meters.In July 2015, a flaperon from MH370 was discovered on Réunion Island, confirming the aircraft had ended in the Indian Ocean. This discovery spurred new hope and directed the focus on the southern Indian Ocean.Over the next year, more debris washed ashore on islands in the Indian Ocean and African east coast, including parts of the wing, stabilizers, and cabin interior.After covering over 120,000 square kilometers of seafloor without locating the main wreckage, the official search was suspended in January 2017. The challenging underwater terrain, including deep trenches and volcanic activity, hindered efforts.Ocean Infinity Search: In early 2018, private company Ocean Infinity conducted a renewed search using advanced AUVs, covering an additional 112,000 square kilometers. Despite their efforts, no new debris was located.","The signal detected recently is being hailed as a significant development in the search for MH370.

'Doesn't look too great': CIA analyst sparks concerns over Kim Jong Un health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/doesnt-look-too-great-cia-analyst-sparks-concerns-over-kim-jong-un-health/articleshow/111145041.cms,"NEW DELHI: Concerns regarding the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un have emerged following his latest public appearance alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin . Speculation about Kim's well-being intensified after a former CIA analyst remarked, ""Oof, he doesn't look too great,"" referencing Kim's appearance during their recent meeting.During the highly anticipated summit, Kim Jong-Un and Vladimir Putin signed a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty aimed at strengthening the bilateral ties between their countries. The agreement emphasizes mutual military support in times of conflict and seeks to enhance trade and security cooperation. This development marks a significant step in the geopolitical landscape , underscoring the alliance between North Korea and Russia against Western powers.However, amid the formalities and strategic discussions, Kim Jong-Un's physical condition became a focal point. The North Korean leader appeared noticeably less vigorous, prompting speculations about his health. This isn't the first time Kim's health has come under scrutiny; past reports have suggested issues ranging from obesity to potential cardiovascular problems, a Daily Mail report said.""There was a time when he lost a little weight and he looked better. So my initial reaction was that he didn’t look, in terms of being healthy, because his health is something that we always track anyway,"" Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA analyst, told CNN.International observers and analysts are now closely monitoring Kim Jong-Un's health, as his ability to lead North Korea remains a critical issue. The health of a nation's leader can significantly impact political stability and policy direction, making Kim's condition a matter of global interest.Meanwhile, North Korea and Russia have agreed to provide all available military assistance if the other side faces armed aggression, under an agreement signed by their leaders, the North's KCNA news agency reported on Thursday.According to KCNA, the two countries will not sign any treaty with a third country that infringes on the interests of the other and will not allow their territories to be used by any country to harm the other's security and sovereignty.(With inputs from agencies)","Concerns regarding the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un have emerged following his latest public appearance alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Jeff Landry on Tuesday.While the punishment of surgical castration is used in other countries that are known for harsher criminal sanctions - including the Czech Republic and Nigeria - it will be new in the US The governor's office confirmed to The Associated Press on Friday that Landry had signed the bill earlier in the week.Proponents of the Louisiana law, which takes effect Aug. 1, hope the new possible punishment will deter people from committing sex crimes against children. Opponents argue that it is ""cruel and unusual"" punishment in violation of the US Constitution. They say it is sure to face legal challenges.The legislation gives Louisiana judges the option to sentence someone to surgical castration after the person has been convicted of certain aggravated sex crimes - including rape, incest and molestation - against a child under 13. The punishment is not automatic and would be by individual cases and at the discretion of the judge.Louisiana has 2,224 people in prison for such crimes. The law can be applied only to those who have convicted a crime on or after Aug. 1 of this year.A handful of states, including Louisiana, California, Florida and Texas, have laws allowing for chemical castration for those guilty of certain sex crimes. In some of those states, offenders can opt for the surgical procedure if they prefer. But no other state allows judges to impose surgical castration outright, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.In Louisiana, which for 16 years has allowed judges to order chemical castration of people convicted of certain sex crimes against children, that punishment is rarely issued. Chemical castration uses medications that block testosterone production to decrease sex drive. Surgical castration is a much more invasive procedure that involves the removal of both testicles or ovaries.An offender who ""fails to appear or refuses to undergo"" surgical castration after a judge orders the procedure could be hit with a ""failure to comply"" charge and face an additional three to five years in prison, based on the bill's language.The bill received overwhelming approval in both of the GOP-dominated chambers. State Sen. Regina Barrow, a Democrat, authored the legislation, but votes against it mainly came from Democrats.""We are talking about babies who are being violated by somebody,"" Barrow said during an April committee meeting. ""That is inexcusable.""Proponents of the measure argue that the punishment is just for horrific crimes against children. Critics argue that the state should focus on the rehabilitation of those guilty of such crimes in an effort to lower recidivism rates.Others wonder if more states may look at adopting a similar law to Louisiana's and question the constitutionality of such measures. The US has decided that retributive punishment - ""an eye for an eye"" - is cruel and unusual, said Katrina Sifferd, a philosophy professor at Elmhurst University.""We don't rape rapists,"" she said. ""We don't cut off the hands of thieves.""The legislation is one of several controversial bills signed by Landry this week, including a measure allowing law enforcement to jail people who enter the US illegally, similar to a Texas law and others facing legal challenges.Republican states and Democratic President Joe Biden have been fighting over US-Mexico border security. If the Supreme Court upholds the Texas law, Louisiana's law will expand enforcement of immigration law to local, not just federal, authorities. It also creates the crime of ""illegal entry or reentry"" into the state and establishes punishments that include prison time and thousands of dollars in fines.","Louisiana is the first state where judges can order offenders guilty of certain sex crimes against children to undergo surgical castration.

US slaps sanctions on leaders of Russia software firm Kaspersky,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-slaps-sanctions-on-leaders-of-russia-software-firm-kaspersky/articleshow/111179965.cms,"- 'Unacceptable' risk -

The United States unveiled sanctions Friday against 12 top leaders of the Russia-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab , a day after banning the sale of its popular antivirus software on national security grounds.The widespread sanctions target many of Kaspersky Lab's most senior leaders, including its chief operating officer, while sparing the chief executive and the company itself, the Treasury Department said in a statement announcing the designation.""Today's action against the leadership of Kaspersky Lab underscores our commitment to ensure the integrity of our cyber domain and to protect our citizens against malicious cyber threats,"" said the US Treasury 's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Brian Nelson.""The United States will take action where necessary to hold accountable those who would seek to facilitate or otherwise enable these activities,"" he added.The Treasury sanctions come a day after the Commerce Department said it was banning the Moscow-headquartered cybersecurity firm from providing its popular antivirus products in the United States.That announcement came after a lengthy investigation which, the Commerce Department said, found that Kaspersky's ""continued operations in the United States presented a national security risk due to the Russian government's offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence or direct Kaspersky's operations.""The move is the first such action taken since an executive order issued during Donald Trump's presidency gave the Commerce Department the power to investigate whether certain companies pose a national security risk.Kaspersky, in a statement to AFP, said the Treasury's sanctions were ""unjustified and baseless,"" adding that they were based on geopolitical concerns rather than a ""comprehensive evaluation"" of the integrity of its products and operations.""Neither Kaspersky nor its management team has any ties to any government,"" it continued, calling the Treasury's allegations ""pure speculation, which lacks concrete evidence of a threat posed to US national security.""Moscow hit out at the decision to ban the sale of Kaspersky's antivirus software.""Kaspersky Lab is a company which is very, very competitive on the international level,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday.""This is a favorite method of unfair competition from the part of the United States. They resort to such tactics every time.""US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Friday that the company was subject to the ""jurisdiction, control, or direction of the Russian government, which could exploit the privileged access to obtain sensitive data.""This poses ""an unacceptable risk to US national security or the safety and security of US persons,"" he added in a statement.While Kaspersky is headquartered in Moscow, it has offices in 31 countries around the world, serving more than 400 million users and 270,000 corporate clients in more than 200 countries, according to the Commerce Department.The latest sanctions target many senior leaders at Kaspersky, including long-serving chief operating officer Andrei Tikhonov and chief legal officer Igor Chekunov, the Treasury Department said.Other individuals sanctioned include the firm's deputy CEO Daniil Borshchev, chief business development officer and board member Andrei Efremov, and its head of corporate communications, Denis Zenkin.","Kaspersky Lab says the Treasury's sanctions are ""unjustified and baseless"" The sanctions target 12 top leaders of the Russia-based cybersecurity firm.

Attacker of Nancy Pelosi's husband also found guilty of kidnapping and faces life in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/attacker-of-nancy-pelosis-husband-also-found-guilty-of-kidnapping-and-faces-life-in-prison/articleshow/111179946.cms,"A man sentenced to 30 years in federal prison in the attack against former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's husband was convicted Friday by a San Francisco jury of aggravated kidnapping , a conviction that mandates life behind bars without the possibility of paroleA San Francisco jury found David DePape also guilty of first-degree burglary, false imprisonment of an elder, threatening a family member of a public official and dissuading a witness.The convictions on the additional charges come weeks after a federal judge sentenced DePape for the 2022 attack against Paul Pelosi .""Speaker Pelosi and her family remain in awe of their Pop's bravery, which shone through again on the witness stand in this trial just as it did when he saved his own life on the night of the attack,"" Pelosi's office wrote in an emailed statement Friday. ""For nearly 20 grueling months, Mr. Pelosi has demonstrated extraordinary courage and fortitude every day of his recovery.""DePape's public defender Adam Lipson said he was disappointed with the verdict and plans to appeal it. He called the prosecutors' decision to file a kidnapping for ransom charge ""vindictive.""""It's really unfortunate that it was charged this way. It was sort of a textbook vindictive prosecution,"" Lipson said. ""As soon as they found that the attempted murder charge was going to be dismissed, they added this charge.""Lipson said that the verdict means that after DePape serves 30 years in federal prison, he will be transferred to a California ""to spend the rest of his life in a California prison.""Lipson told the jury during closing arguments this week that DePape was guilty of three of the charges but that prosecutors had not presented evidence to convict him of threatening a family member of a public official and aggravated kidnapping.Previously, a federal jury convicted DePape of assaulting a federal official's family member and attempting to kidnap a federal official. On May 28, he was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison during an unusual resentencing hearing that resulted from judicial error.Lipson earlier argued that the state trial represents double jeopardy following the federal conviction. Even though the criminal counts are not the same, the two cases stem from the same act, he told the judge.San Francisco Superior Court Judge Harry Dorfman agreed and dismissed the state charges of attempted murder, elder abuse and assault with a deadly weapon. Another judge upheld the decision on appeal.Lipson focused his closing arguments on explaining to the jury that prosecutors did not prove DePape kidnapped Paul Pelosi, who was 82 at the time, with the intent ""to exact from another person money or something valuable,"" which is integral to the charge.Assistant District Attorney Phoebe Maffei told the jury in her closing arguments that DePape had planned to record a video of his interrogation of Nancy Pelosi.Lipson argued the video didn't exist and if it did, it wouldn't have had any value.""When he broke into the Pelosis' home his intent was to confront and potentially hurt and assault Nancy Pelosi. That was his intent at that time, that has nothing to do with Mr. Pelosi,"" he said.In her rebuttal, Maffei pointed out DePape told a detective and testified in federal court that he planned to get a video of Nancy Pelosi confessing to what he believed to be crimes and post it on the internet.""There is inherent value in a video of the Speaker of the House confessing to crimes in her own home,"" Maffei said.The attack on Paul Pelosi was captured on police body camera video just days before the 2022 midterm elections and shocked the political world. He suffered two head wounds including a skull fracture that was mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. His right arm and hand were also injured.On Monday, Maffei told the jury DePape unleashed a ""reign of terror"" on Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning him with a hammer as part of a plan he put together over months.""The plain facts of this case are terrifying by themselves without embellishment,"" Maffei said. ""David DePape broke into the home of an 82-year-old man while he slept, entered his bedroom, held him hostage with a hammer, threatened him, threatened his wife and attempted to kill him.""DePape admitted during his federal trial testimony that he planned to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage, record his interrogation of her, and ""break her kneecaps"" if she did not admit to the lies he said she told about ""Russiagate,"" a reference to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.Lipson told the jury during closing arguments that before the attack, DePape was living an isolated, lonely life and ""went down the rabbit hole of propaganda and conspiracy theories.""This week the judge expelled DePape's former partner from the public gallery and the second floor of the San Francisco courthouse because the judge said she was trying to tamper with the jury.On Monday and Tuesday, Gypsy Taub, a well-known activist in the Bay Area, handed out pieces of paper outside the courtroom with the address of a website she runs that promotes conspiracy theories. The cards were also found in a women's bathroom near the courtroom, where the website's address was scrawled in marker on a wall.""You have been trying to corruptly influence one or more jury members,"" Dorfman said sternly before asking two bailiffs to escort Taub out of the courtroom.DePape's federal public defender said during his federal sentencing that DePape was first exposed to extreme beliefs by Taub, who has two sons with DePape.Taub met DePape in Hawaii when he was 20 years old and she was in her 30s and pregnant, DePape's twin sister, Joanne Robinson, said in a letter to the federal judge seeking leniency.Robinson wrote that Taub isolated DePape from his family and inflicted ""extreme psychological damage"" on her brother.","David DePape was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison in May. A San Francisco jury found him guilty Friday of aggravated kidnapping. He was also found guilty of burglary, false imprisonment of an elder, threatening a family member of a public official. The convictions come weeks after a federal judge sentenced him for the 2022 attack.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111179963,imgsize-693922,width-400,resizemode-4/111179963.jpg"

Joke about antisemitism

What This Comedian Said Will Shock You

Stand-up comedian and famous host Bill Maher has been fact-checked by the Internet after a video of him saying that Narendra Modi 'lost elections big time' in India surfaced. He was speaking on the issue of immigration and how the incumbent party's indifference over the issue impacted the election in Europe. It was in this context that he dragged India and third-time Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Social media users, mostly from India, reminded him that Modi became the PM of India for the third time after winning the election.Bill Maher is an American, writer, producer, political commentator, actor and television host.In the discussion over immigration, Maher said the Democrats are f***** on the election day because of the immigration issue.Maher said there is a clear distinction between ignorance and stupidity. The young anti-Israel protesters at US colleges are not dumb, they are ignorant, he said. ""They let them out of school that way. The ignorance is a part of the people, the adults and the educators, who don't do their job anymore. They let you out of school, they will sign that diploma and you don't know a f------ thing,"" he said. ""Certainly not about this issue.""Bill Maher said it's a zombie lie that Blacks have to work five times harder than the rest of America to achieve the same results. President Joe Biden recently said, ""What is democracy if you have to be 10 times better than anyone else to get a fair shot?""Maher asked Charlamagne that God whether he agreed with what Biden said. ""I don’t know if it’s ten times better, but maybe five,"" Charlamagne said.It was in the same debate that Maher challenged Charlamagne tha God's take on Caitlin Clark's popularity in the WNBA and said: ""Why was Serena Williams such a big star? Because people like that. They didn't watch her because she was Black, right?"" Maher said. ""I think that’s a zombie lie.""Bill Maher appeared on a show to promote his new book. And true to the name of the book, as he was explaining the word 'woke', the hosts were shocked. “I mean, I think we agree about the danger of the super far right, and I can’t say it enough, I think they’re the bigger threat. But, don’t tell me that the left hasn’t changed. I mean, I’m old enough to remember when it was the conservatives who hated the Jews, ok?"" As there was silence, Bill Maher clarified that it was a joke.","Maher was speaking on the issue of immigration and how the incumbent party's indifference over the issue impacted the election in Europe.

The FDA based its decision on data provided by Altria, which showed that NJOY e-cigarettes helped smokers reduce their exposure to harmful chemicals found in traditional cigarettes. The agency emphasized that these products are neither safe nor ""FDA approved"" and that non-smokers should not use them.This action is part of a comprehensive FDA review aimed at bringing scientific scrutiny to the multibillion-dollar vaping market after years of regulatory delays. The US market currently includes thousands of fruit and candy-flavored vapes that are technically illegal but have gone unregulated.The FDA faces a court deadline at the end of this month to complete its long-standing review of major vaping brands, including competitors like Juul and Vuse.","The FDA authorized the first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers.

"Donald Trump Green Card: Trump's Green Card promise not for communists, Hamas supporters: 5 things to know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-green-card-promise-not-for-communists-hamas-supporters-5-things-to-know/articleshow/111173493.cms,"What is Donald Trump's

automatic green card

: 5 things to know

Donald Trump's automatic green card proposal is to retain high-skilled workers in the country. In a podcast, Trump said it's said when the US loses people from Harvard and MIT. This automatic Green Card will be given to all foreign students as part of their diploma and this would include students attending junior colleges in the US too. ""...people graduated from a top college or from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here, they had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can't -- they go back to India, they go back to China, they do the same basic company in those places...and they become multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people, and it could have been done here,"" Trump said. But will all foreign graduates get Green Cards if Donald Trump becomes the president? In a statement Friday morning, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the former president's proposal would apply to ""the most skilled graduates"" who are ""the most thoroughly vetted."" Communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters will not get automatic Green Cards, Leavitt said. ""He believes, only after such vetting has taken place, we ought to keep the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America. This would only apply to the most thoroughly vetted college graduates who would never undercut American wages or workers.” Donald Trump did not set a good precedent on immigration earlier. He began his presidency by banning travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries and later embraced a proposal to cut legal immigration by half. Throughout his presidency, Trump assailed the H-1B visa program, favored by tech companies as a way to hire foreign skilled workers, as a ""theft of American prosperity.""

Republican presidential presumptive candidate Donald Trump suggested automatic green cards for foreign graduates if he becomes the president. This means all those who graduate from US colleges will automatically become US citizens. Chasing the Green Card Dream looks lucrative in Trump's US, but he said the same thing during his 2016 campaign and then limited legal migration when he was in office.A Green Card is a Permanent Resident Card in the US. Joe Biden recently unveiled a new immigration program offering legal status to spouses of US citizens.","Donald Trump's proposal is to retain high-skilled workers in the country.

Trump stuns immigration world by promising green cards to all foreign students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-stuns-immigration-world-by-promising-green-cards-to-all-foreign-students/articleshow/111173490.cms,"WASHINGTON: Former US President Donald Trump convulsed the immigration eco-system on Thursday by promising automatic green cards to all foreign students in America , including undergraduates, in what would be a repudiation of the strong anti-immigration sentiment of his political base.In a podcast with Silicon Valley investors and business leaders, Trump spoke of “stories where people graduated from a top college or from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here, they had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can’t — they go back to India, they go back to China, they do the same basic company in those places. And they become multibillionaires.”Pledging to change this, the former President said he would institute policies where ""you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country, and that includes junior colleges.”There was immediate blowback to the Trump announcement, with his supporters questioning ""is this America First?"" and what happened to “buy American, hire American?”But hours after the former President's unscripted remarks, his campaign officials tempered the comments, saying there would be an “aggressive vetting process” that would “exclude all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges” and that the policy would apply only to the “most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America.”That would still open the doors to tens of thousands of skilled immigrants, mainly from India and China, who come to the US for higher education. By some estimates, more than a million foreign students come to the US every year; and at any given time nearly 300,000 students from India -- now said to be the largest contingent of foreign students -- are studying at American universities and colleges. More than a million Indian college graduates already in the US, going back 10 to 15 years, have been in line for a green card, which typically paves the way for citizenship.In the ""All-In"" podcast hosted by David Sacks, a Silicon Valley investor who backs the former president’s 2024 campaign, Trump appeared to be courting -- at the risk of angering his voting base -- the tech business community which has long sought to streamline the immigration process to get more high-skilled workers who come to America as students and graduate into H1-B visas that allows limited stay in the US. But Trump's nativist MAGA (Make American Great Again) base sees this as a betrayal of American workers.During Trump presidency, his advisor Stephen Miller, fashioned an immigration policy that restricted among other things work-visa program for foreign students even though the then President often spoke of giving permanent residency to immigrants who are wealthy and/or highly educated, at the expense of family-based immigration that also allows non-skilled or low-skilled immigrants to get a green card on the basis of family ties.","Former US President Donald Trump promised automatic green cards to all foreign students in America, including undergraduates.

Akhter, a resident, expresses the struggles faced by daily wage workers and labourers, highlighting the impact of soaring prices not only on milk but also on related products such as Ghee (clarified butter).""We can't sustain our households in such inflationary times,"" he laments, urging the government to consider the plight of its citizens amidst these challenging circumstances.Faizan echoes similar sentiments, explaining that milk prices have escalated due to the rising costs faced by dairy farm owners for essentials like fodder, high rents, and water.""They have no choice but to pass on these expenses to consumers,"" he observes, urging the government to prioritise the welfare of the common people regardless of how they came into power.In Karachi, and across Pakistan, the struggle against inflation is not just about economic numbers but about the daily realities faced by the citizens.According to local media reports, the cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers, in collaboration with commissioner Karachi , settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.The decision came after an extensive consultation session that lasted several hours, where the commissioner met with stakeholders from the dairy farming, wholesaling, and retail sectors to discuss and finalise the price adjustment.Following thorough deliberations, all parties reached a consensus to implement the PKR 20 per litre hike, setting the new price of milk at PKR 220 per litre, which represents a significant increase compared to previous rates.","The cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.

Pakistan: Report highlights alarming trends of religious persecution against Christians,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-report-highlights-alarming-trends-of-religious-persecution-against-christians/articleshow/111082577.cms,"FAISALABAD: Human Rights Focus Pakistan ( HRFP ) has published a detailed fact-finding report uncovering disturbing incidents of religious persecution against Christians , particularly in Sargodha.HRFP is a group that raises the voices of minorities , women, and marginalized communities in Pakistan.This comes in the wake of a mob attack last month, where Nazir Masih's family was attacked on the accusations of blasphemy. The incident unfolded on May 25 in Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, where Nazir and other Christians were accused of blasphemy , sparking violent outrage among locals.After fighting for his life for eight days, Masih succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.The incident showed a troubling pattern in Pakistan where blasphemy accusations lead to violence against Christian communities.HRFP has expressed deep concern over the swift post-arrest bail granted to 52 attackers involved in the Sargodha incident.Despite the First Information Report (FIR) being filed against 44 identified and 400 unidentified suspects under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), progress in police investigations and court proceedings has been slow and inadequate.Compounding the community's apprehensions are threatening videos released by Islamic groups following the incident, exacerbating fears among the Christian community.Drawing parallels with the August 16, 2023, attack in Jaranwala, the HRFP report highlighted similar incidents of mob violence and property destruction against minorities. It underscores a recurring pattern involving provocation, and subsequent violence, often followed by the expedient release of perpetrators.HRFP has called for decisive action, citing intelligence reports linking extremist groups to multiple blasphemy allegations. The organization has also urged stringent measures to address these threats.The report also documented individual cases of violence and harassment against Christians across Pakistan.Farooq Masih's family in Jaranwala continues to face threats. Despite the FIR filed in February, the perpetrators are still at large.Similarly, the case of Saima Bibi, who suffered an assault in April, was downplayed as an 'accident' despite clear evidence of the attack.The plight of Rawal Masih, Romeo Masih, Waqas Masih, Rakhsana Bibi, Asifa Bibi, Shazia Zaulfiqar, and Ahsan Masih, who all were abducted and murdered, also underscores the ongoing oppression faced by PakistChristians.Naveed Walter, president of HRFP, emphasized the ""dire circumstances"" for minorities in Pakistan and urged increased protection and support for the Christian community.

Massive protests threatening to send the government packing used to be held across the country.""Oh, how the times have changed. Days after dropping tax bombs that will further eviscerate the struggling masses, the authorities have announced that not only will they be taking more money out of the pay cheques of salaried individuals, they will also be squeezing whatever is left through significantly jacked-up electricity bills ,"" the editorial read.Citing news reports, it said that Nepra (National Electric Power Regulatory Authority) has hiked the uniform national tariff for the base price of electricity by almost 20 per cent to hand over electricity distribution companies almost half a trillion rupees more over the next fiscal year.The average base tariff for a single unit of electricity, which was PakistRupees (PKR) 27.78 in the outgoing year, will be PKR 35.50 from July 1.On top of this, various duties, taxes, and surcharges, as well as fuel and tariff adjustments, will be levied, forcing ordinary citizens to pay through their noses, not just for the fuel and operation and maintenance costs involved in generating electricity, but also for capacity charges that past governments have promised power generation companies, as well as the theft and transmission losses that distribution companies have shown a complete unwillingness to mitigate for many years.The average middle-class bill-paying customer will be forking out between PKR 65-72 for each unit of electricity they use in a month. Meanwhile, the federal government will present this as an 'achievement' in front of the IMF to ask for even more loans to keep a clearly failing system running for a few years longer, the editorial added.However, at the same time, the government has announced a PKR 10.69 per unit 'relief' for the industrial sector to 'make it competitive'. There can probably be no better example of crony capitalism.While the average salaried individual is finding it difficult to meet their ends on a shrinking real wage amidst month after month of unceasing, unchecked inflation, it is the big industries who get a break in the form of cheaper electricity so that they can pad up their profits while paying little back to the country in the form of taxes.""That the government is failing the people seems like an understatement. It is clearly least bothered by their plight. Its financial planning shows that it has no interest in going after those who dodge their dues; it just wants to take the easy route and enjoy the ride for however long it is in power,"" the Dawn editorial stated.","The average base tariff for a single unit of electricity, which was PakistRupees (PKR) 27.78 in the outgoing year, will be PKR 35.50 from July 1.

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching display of their persistent sorrow and discontent, families affected by enforced disappearances in the Balochistan region of Pakistan decided to abandon customary Eid festivities. Instead, they planned to stage a protest to voice their outrage against state agencies alleged to have perpetrated atrocities against the Baloch people.

Mama Qadir Baloch , a key member of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), declared the protest in a video statement, asserting, ""For the past 15 years, the atrocities committed by the Army and intelligence agencies of Pakistan have led the Baloch to boycott Eid celebrations. While Muslims across the world celebrate this occasion, the Baloch mourn.""

Coinciding with this, families of the missing persons organized a sit-in protest at Shaheed Fida Chowk on Eid day, following a similar demonstration in front of the DC office just days prior. The earlier protest concluded after the district administration provided assurances to the families.

The decision to protest on Eid emphasizes the profound impact of enforced disappearances on the Baloch community, who have been tirelessly seeking justice and answers regarding the fate of their loved ones, allegedly taken by state forces.
