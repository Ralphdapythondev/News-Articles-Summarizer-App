Zelenskyy at the United Nations

On Tuesday, Donald Trump commended Russia 's military history while criticizing US aid to Ukraine, asserting that he would swiftly end the war if elected president. Speaking in Savannah, Georgia, Trump ridiculed President Joe Biden 's pledge to support Ukraine until victory, citing Russia's past successes against Hitler's Nazi regime in World War II and Napoleon Bonaparte's failed invasion.Trump insisted on the US ""getting out"" of the conflict, though he did not provide specifics on how he would negotiate an end to US involvement. He mimicked Biden's statement, ""We will not leave until we win,"" and questioned the outcome if Ukraine were to emerge victorious, emphasizing Russia's reputation for engaging in wars.A Trump campaign official confirmed that the Republican nominee will not be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his US visit to attend the UN General Assembly opening, despite previous statements from Ukrainian officials suggesting a planned meeting. Trump reiterated his portrayal of Zelenskyy as ""the greatest salesman on Earth"" for securing US aid, erroneously claiming that Zelenskyy receives ""$100 billion"" with each visit to the United States.Trump and Zelenskyy's history dates back to the former president's time in the White House, during which Trump pressured Zelenskyy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, as well as a cybersecurity firm falsely linked to Ukraine by Trump. This call and the White House's hold on $400 million in military aid led to Trump's first impeachment.In a recent interview with the New Yorker, Zelenskyy suggested that Trump oversimplifies the conflict and that his running mate, JD Vance, advocates for Ukraine to ""make a sacrifice"" by relinquishing territories. Donald Trump Jr criticized Zelenskyy on X, questioning the Ukrainian leader's criticism of the GOP ticket despite receiving substantial US taxpayer funding.While Trump criticized US involvement in the war, Zelenskyy delivered a strong message at the United Nations, arguing that Russia must be forced into a peace settlement. ""Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what's needed,"" Zelenskyy said, addressing the UN Security Council. He firmly rejected any negotiations on Moscow’s terms, calling such proposals “insanity.”Zelenskyy’s speech followed reports of increased military support for Russia from Iran and North Korea. Zelenskyy, along with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urged global powers to address these alliances, accusing Tehran and Pyongyang of assisting Russia’s continued aggression in Ukraine.(With inputs from agencies)","Donald Trump will not meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his US visit to the UN General Assembly opening.

Pressure for a deal

Aviva Siegel one of the 251 hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on October 7, remains haunted by her time in captivity in Gaza, where she was held by Hamas for weeks. Although it has been nearly 10 months since her release, her thoughts are still consumed by the fate of her husband, Keith Siegel, who remains in captivity. The Israeli military reported that 33 hostages are believed to be dead.Aviva and her husband were captured from their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza . Aviva was released as part of a truce in November last year, which saw 105 hostages freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Despite her release, Aviva remains overwhelmed by the memories of her ordeal. ""I wanted to die so many times,"" she admitted, describing the physical toll of her captivity. ""When I got out, I had lost 10 kilos. I could barely walk, eat or drink. I don’t want to imagine the situation Keith is in.""""I’m still in Gaza, I haven’t left yet,"" she told reporters. ""I’m with Keith in spirit at all times. I can’t bear to imagine that he and the other hostages are 40 metres below ground, without air to breathe, without food to eat, without anything nice,"" she told AFP.Since her return, Aviva has actively participated in protests in Tel Aviv, demanding a resolution for the remaining hostages. ""Keith is still there,"" she shared during a recent demonstration. ""We have to get them out. It’s too cruel... It’s unbearable and unforgivable.""The urgency has increased since the Israeli military discovered the bodies of six hostages in a Gaza tunnel in August. Like Aviva, other family members of captives, including Raz Ben Ami, who was also freed in the November truce, continue to pressure the government for action. ""I’m sick of burying hostages, returned in coffins,"" Ben Ami said.","Aviva Siegel was one of 251 hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on October 7.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday addressed the UN Security Council , rejecting the idea of peace talks with Russia. Instead, he called for unspecified global ""action"" to compel Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine and adhere to the UN Charter's principle of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations. Zelenskyy argued that Russian President Vladimir Putin has violated numerous international rules and will not stop on his own.""And that's why this war can't simply fade away. That's why this war can't be calmed by talks,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what's needed - forcing Russia into peace as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the UN Charter,"" he added.The high-level meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the annual UN General Assembly, was attended by ministers from 14 of the council's 15 member nations, with Russia sending a lower-level UN ambassador. Russian representative Vassily Nebenzia criticised the meeting, expressing frustration with Zelenskyy's repeated appearances at the UN and the support he receives from European Union and NATO members.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres reiterated the United Nations ' strong support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, stating that Russia's actions since 2014 have been a clear violation of these principles. Zelenskyy questioned the effectiveness of engaging in talks with Putin, emphasising that Russia must be compelled to end the war and terror.US secretary of state Antony Blinken accused China, Iran, and North Korea of providing Russia with various forms of support for its war effort.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, while stressing China's belief in respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, did not directly respond to Blinken's accusations. Blinken also highlighted the increasing reliance of Russia on Iran and North Korea, arguing that this exacerbates threats to peace and security.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the UN Security Council on Tuesday.

In a recent study conducted by WalletHub, the personal-finance outlet assessed the happiness levels across all 50 states in the U.S. by examining various factors contributing to emotional and physical well-being. While happiness can be subjective, WalletHub's research aimed to quantify it using three main categories: emotional and physical well-being, work environment, and community and environment.This comprehensive analysis utilized a total of 30 metrics, including life expectancy, rates of adult depression, commute times, unemployment figures, and divorce rates, drawing data from credible sources like the U.S.Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The findings revealed a stark reality: many of the unhappiest states are primarily rural, low-income regions, particularly in the Deep South. WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo noted that these states tend to rank poorly not just in happiness but across various economic and socioeconomic metrics. Here’s a look at the 10 unhappiest states in the U.S.Kentucky ranked as the 10th unhappiest state, with low scores in both emotional and physical well-being and work environment. The CDC reports that 25.8% of adults in Kentucky have been diagnosed with a depressive disorder, exceeding the national average. Additionally, the state's life expectancy is notably low at 73.5 years, and its employment rate sits at 57.4%, below the national average.Despite these challenges, Kentucky fared better in community and environment, finishing 16th in this category.Mississippi ranks as the 9th unhappiest state, finishing 41st for emotional and physical well-being and 40th for work environment. The state has the lowest life expectancy in the nation at just 71.9 years and a significant employment rate of only 54.3%.The state's residents also work longer hours on average than the national norm. In terms of community and environment, Mississippi ranked 35th, with low volunteer rates and high divorce rates.In Oklahoma, the emotional and physical well-being index is particularly low, with a ranking of 48th. Approximately 27% of adults report being diagnosed with depression. Nevertheless, the state performs surprisingly well in community and environment, finishing 5th overall, which helps mitigate its lower rankings in other areas.Alabama ranks 7th, performing poorly in both emotional and physical well-being and community and environment. With a life expectancy of just 73.2 years and a depression rate of 24%, Alabama faces significant challenges. The state does show better performance in work environment metrics, where it ranked 33rd overall.Alaska's lowest score of 48th comes from its work environment, with the longest work hours and minimal income growth. While the state's emotional and physical well-being is relatively better, ranking 33rd, it still faces challenges due to high depression rates and a lower life expectancy of 76.6 years.New Mexico is the fifth unhappiest state, particularly struggling with emotional and physical well-being and work environment metrics. Although it ranks 24th in community and environment, it has a low employment rate of 55% and high divorce rates, indicating significant societal challenges.Tennessee has mixed rankings, finishing 24th for work environment but plummeting to 46th for emotional and physical well-being. High rates of adult depression and a low life expectancy contribute to its unhappy status, despite economic growth in urban areas like Nashville.Ranking third, West Virginia has the lowest score for workplace environment and a very low employment rate of 51.7%. The state's economic struggles are compounded by high depression rates and lower life expectancy. Interestingly, it does score well in community and environment metrics, suggesting residents find some solace in their local environments.Arkansas is the second unhappiest state, particularly noted for its low emotional and physical well-being scores. The state has high rates of depression and low life expectancy. Despite these challenges, its community and environment rank is relatively moderate.Finally, Louisiana is ranked as the unhappiest state in the U.S., with concerning statistics for emotional and physical well-being and work environment. The state has high rates of depression and low life expectancy, alongside low employment figures. With significant challenges in community and environment as well, Louisiana's position as the unhappiest state reflects deep-rooted socio economic issues.","Kentucky ranked as the 10th unhappiest state, with low scores in both emotional and physical well-being and work environment.

The Israeli airstrikes injured over 1,600 people and forced thousands to flee their homes in the south. Israel claimed that it had struck approximately 1,600 targets in its operation, which aimed to dismantle Hezbollah 's weaponry. However, Lebanon's health minister reported that hospitals, medical centres, and ambulances were also hit in the attacks.In retaliation, Hezbollah announced that it had fired dozens of rockets into Israel, targeting military bases and prompting a series of air-raid sirens to sound in northern Israel.On Friday, an Israeli airstrike demolished a high-rise building in Beirut’s southern suburbs, killing Ibrahim Akil, the commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit, along with other key leaders. Israel alleged that Akil was responsible for orchestrating attacks on northern Israel. This strike resulted in at least 45 deaths and over 60 injuries.These airstrikes followed a wave of electronic device bombings earlier in the week, which triggered the detonation of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, killing at least 37 people, including two children, and injuring around 3,000. Israel has not confirmed or denied its involvement in those bombings.","Fadi Boudaya, Director General of Maraya International Network, was hit by a missile while live on air.

356 killed as Israeli air strikes hammer Lebanon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/356-killed-as-israeli-air-strikes-hammer-lebanon/articleshow/113610127.cms,"US is sending more troops to West Asia

Israel said it had launched air strikes against hundreds of Hezbollah targets on Monday, killing 356 people in Lebanon's deadliest day in decades according to authorities, as it ramped up a nearly year-long conflict with its Iran-backed enemy. After some of the heaviest cross-border exchanges of fire since the hostilities flared last Oct, Israel warned people in Lebanon to evacuate areas where it said the armed movement was storing weapons.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu sent a short video statement addressed to the Lebanese people. ""Israel's war is not with you, it's with Hezbollah. For too long Hezbollah has been using you as human shields,"" he said. After almost a year of war against Hamas in Gaza on its southern border, Israel is shifting its focus to the northern frontier, where Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas, also backed by Iran. Israel's military said it had struck Hezbollah in Lebanon's south, east and north.Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad said the strikes hit hospitals, medical centres and ambulances. He said 356 people had been killed, including 24 children and 42 women, and 1,246 wounded. One official said it was Lebanon's highest daily death toll from violence since the 1975-1990 civil war. It was also the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war.Tens of thousands are fleeing southern Lebanon ""due to Israeli atrocities"", Lebanese minister coordinating the crisis response, Nasser Yassin, said. He said 89 temporary shelters in schools and the like had been activated, with capacity for more than 26,000 people so far.On Monday evening an Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs targeted Hezbollah commander Ali Karaki, the head of the southern front, but his fate was unclear, a security source told Reuters. Earlier, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said the campaign would continue until ""we achieve our goal to return the northern residents safely to their homes"". Hezbollah has vowed to fight on until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.The Israeli military said it had struck about 1,300 targets connected to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and Bekaa valley. ""Among the targets struck were buildings where Hezbollah hid rockets, missiles, launchers, UAVs and additional terrorist infrastructure,"" it said. Hezbollah has not commented on Israeli claims that it hid weapons in houses, but it has said in past that it doesn't place military infrastructure near civilians.In response to the strikes, Hezbollah said it had launched missiles at a military base in northern Israel. Sirens warning of Hezbollah rocket fire sounded across northern Israel, including in the port city of Haifa, and in the northern part of the occupied West Bank. It also targeted for a second day the facilities of the Rafael defence firm in Haifa. Approximately 180 projectiles crossed into Israeli airspace, an AFP report said.Israel's military spokesperson said Israeli aircraft were preparing to attack strategic Hezbollah weapons stashed in houses in the Bekaa valley and urged civilians to evacuate immediately. The strikes have redoubled the pressure on Hezbollah, which last week suffered heavy losses when thousands of pagers and radios used by its members exploded. In another major blow, an Israelistrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday struck senior Hezbollah commanders, killing 45 people.The fighting has raised fears that the US, Israel's ally, and Iran will be sucked into a wider war. Suffering from a financial meltdown, Lebanon can ill afford a war like the one in 2006, when Israel pounded it during a month-long conflict with Hezbollah, inflicting heavy damage to infrastructure.The US is sending additional troops to West Asia during a sharp spike in violence between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, Pentagon said Monday. Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder would provide no details on how many additional forces or what they would be tasked to do. The US currently has about 40,000 troops in the region. As Israel is preparing to conduct further operations, the state department is warning Americans to leave Lebanon as the risk of a regional war increases.","Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad said the strikes hit hospitals, medical centres and ambulances.

US Intel says Moscow pumping for Trump as Ukraine brings Russia war to battleground Pennsylvania,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-intel-says-moscow-pumping-for-trump-as-ukraine-brings-russia-war-to-battleground-pennsylvania/articleshow/113642661.cms,"WASHINGTON: Far from being a ruse, Moscow 's interference in US elections, mocked by MAGA supremo Donald Trump as the ""Russia Russia Russia hoax,"" is real and current, US intelligence agencies said on Monday.The agencies, trashed by Trumpists as a war-mongering ""Deep State,"" said while Russia is attempting to boost Trump's candidacy by denigrating his opponent Kamala Harris , China and Iran are also sowing discord in the US using artificial intelligence.A one-page summary of the intelligence assessment released by the Directorate of National Intelligence (DNI) cited a specific instance where Russian influencers purportedly staged a video in which a woman claims she was the victim of a hit-and-run car accident by Vice President Harris, and altered videos of her speeches. Social media abounds in slowed down videos of Kamala Harris to make her appear drunk.""Russia has generated the most AI content related to the election and has done so across all four mediums—text, images, audio, and video... consistent with Russia’s broader efforts to boost the former President’s candidacy and denigrate the Vice President and the Democratic Party,"" the summary said.The assessment said China is also using AI in broader influence operations seeking to shape global views of China and amplify divisive U.S. political issues, but not for any specific operations targeting U.S. election outcomes.Trump has repeatedly ridiculed claims that Russia put its thumb on the election scale in his favor in 2016, when he won three states narrowly to clinch the Presidency, while suggesting that an entrenched Deep State in Washington wants an unnecessary confrontation with Moscow. Democrats see him as a Russian stooge who will throwUkraine under the bus if he returns to the White House, which is why they say Moscow is backing him.In fact, the Russia-Ukraine war reared up in the battleground state of Pennsylvania this weekend when Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky visited an arms factory in Scranton -- which happens to be President Biden's home turf -- that is churning out munitions for Ukraine. The Scranton Army Ammunition Plant has ramped up production over the past year to supply more than 3 million 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine, and Zelensky, who is set to meet Biden at the White House on Wednesday, is asking for more arms to beat back Russia.“It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail. Thanks to people like these — in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries — who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected,"" he wrote on X after the visit to the munitions plant, where he and Pennsylvania's Democratic governor Josh Shapiro signed on artillery shells.The visit outraged Trump and his MAGA principals who fumed on social media that ""a foreign leader is essentially campaigning for Harris on American soil"" and bilking billions of US taxpayer dollars to wage a futile war. ""I think Zelenskiy is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with 60 billion dollars,"" Trump said at a rally in western Pennsylvania. ""He wants them to win this election so badly, but I would do differently - I will work out peace.Democrats in turn claimed Putin has ""bought control of Trump's party"" by paying millions to MAGA influencers, a reference to recent disclosures of lavish funding by Russia-backed companies for pro-MAGA commentators. ""Vice President Harris understands that if America walks away from Ukraine, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe and our NATO allies,"" the Harris campaign shot back.Democrats are eyeing a large Polish-American vote in Pennsylvania invoking Russian threats to Poland similar to its invasion of Ukraine. “Why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch?” Harris asked Trump during their debate earlier this month.",Russia is attempting to boost Trump's candidacy by denigrating his opponent Kamala Harris.

Arizona: Biden's narrow win in 2020 is complicated by immigration and abortion being dominant issues. Harris, the Schrodinger's ‘Border Czar,’ is visiting the state today – her first trip since becoming the Democratic nominee. It could be a sticky wicket for the Dems. Georgia: Trump faced legal battles over “election interference” here, but the state is crucial. African-American voters backed Biden in 2020, and Harris hopes they’ll support her as well. Michigan: The state’s significant Arab-American population is unhappy with Biden’s Middle East policy. Recently, the mayor of Hamtramck, the only city with an all-Muslim government, endorsed Donald Trump . Nevada: Though the state has voted Democrat since 2008, it’s still considered a swing state despite offering only six electoral votes. The economy and immigration issues make it a battleground for both candidates. North Carolina: The state has been in the news for its lieutenant governor’s controversial comments on a black porn forum, raising concerns that Mark Robinson could jeopardise Trump’s chances. Robinson, heavily backed by Trump for governor, was ignored when Trump recently visited the state. Pennsylvania: Trump is known for his successes here. Democrats had won this state since 1992 until Trump flipped it in 2016. He also survived an assassination attempt, effectively ending Biden’s bid for a second term. Wisconsin: Harris has a slight edge over Trump, but the economy, healthcare, abortion, and crime could create challenges. She leads for now, but can she maintain it?

Game of Thrones

In the Harry Potter universe – whose creator is now defined by her gender-bender takes – the number seven is pivotal. That’s why Lord Voldemort decided to create seven Horcruxes that would have made him immortal, if his sidekick hadn’t fancied the mother of a scrawny git. Seven is a number that frequently recurs in fiction and non-fiction. There are seven kingdoms inseven colours in the rainbow, seven musical notes (), and the number seven graces the backs of iconic sportsmen like MS Dhoni and Eric Cantona.The number seven is equally significant in US elections, where seven swing states can determine the outcome. While swing states may change, for the purposes of this piece, the seven are: Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Nevada (6), North Carolina (16), Pennsylvania (19), and Wisconsin (10).A candidate needs a majority while battling for 538 electoral college votes. Regardless of the margin of victory, whoever wins a state takes the full electoral college vote count. For example, in Arizona in 2020, Joe Biden won by just 10,457 votes but secured all 11 electoral college votes from the state. It’s possible to win more votes overall, as Clinton did in 2016, and still receive fewer electoral college votes. As NPR ’s Domenico Montanaro noted, “44,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin” separated Trump and Biden from a tie in the electoral college. Hillary Clinton famously won the popular vote in 2016 but lost in the electoral college.Essentially, these seven states could decide the fate of the realm.Since 1988, 20 states and Washington, DC have consistently voted for the same party in every presidential election, with only a few seeing close battles. Trump’s unexpected victory in 2016 was due to his ability to swing several key states that had previously voted for Democrats, earning him 304 electoral votes to Hillary's 227. Meanwhile, Biden’s ability to reclaim some of these states was crucial to his victory, where he defeated Trump 306-232.Now a disclaimer: given the unprecedented nature of this election – with a candidate shoehorned in at the last moment after her predecessor lost his bearings, and a former POTUS who has survived two assassination attempts – all bets are off.With fluctuating polls, any state with less than a 5% gap could be in play. A recent NYT-Sienna College poll suggested Trump’s fortunes were looking up in the so-called Sun Belt swing states of Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia. However, these polls were taken before the revelations about Trump’s ‘black Nazi’ Mark Robinson’s candid thoughts on a porn forum, which could reverse Trump’s gains in North Carolina.Here's a quick look at each key state:Overall, Trump and Harris are neck-and-neck in several polls. According to 538, Harris is nationally leading by 2.7 BPS. In the, to sit on the Iron Throne, you had to wade through eight seasons of incest, bloodletting, politically chicanery and lots of speeches. It was a rather messy affair at times. Hopefully, it won't get that messy on November 5.The Top 10 Stories:","Since 1988, 20 states and Washington, DC have consistently voted for the same party in every presidential election.

Why Diddy settled his $18.8 million mortgage before sex trial arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-diddy-settled-his-18-8-million-mortgage-before-sex-trial-arrest/articleshow/113637461.cms,"Anticipating a federal sex-trafficking indictment, the hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs settled the $18.8 million mortgage on his opulent $48.5 million Star Island mansion just before charges were brought against him.This strategic move, anticipating criminal proceedings, emerged during a recent bond hearing where prosecutors claimed Combs hosted ""Freak Offs""—wild, drug-infused parties involving female victims and male sex workers.Federal agents raided his Star Island estate in March, uncovering substances like drugs, baby oil, and lubricant, all reportedly used during these gatherings. Shortly after, a grand jury indicted him on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and illegal transportation for sexual activities, to which Combs pleaded not guilty.In an attempt to secure bail, Combs’ legal team, led by Marc Agnifilo, proposed a $50 million bond package, using the Star Island home as collateral and backed by six passports from Combs and his family to demonstrate that he wasn’t a flight risk. Despite this, the judge denied bail, citing concerns of potential violence, flight, or interference in the ongoing investigation.Combs’ decision to clear the mortgage was likely a tactic to leverage Florida's Homestead Act, a law that safeguards homeowners from losing the equity in their primary residence regardless of legal troubles. This same law allowed O.J. Simpson to retain his Florida home despite a $100 million judgment against him. By settling his mortgage, Combs ensured the protection of his main asset against any legal ramifications.The bond hearing shed light on Combs’ extravagant lifestyle. His Star Island mansion, purchased for $14.5 million in 2003, has since transformed into a sprawling 14,800-square-foot estate, complete with multiple pools, a spa, and cabana-style pool houses, now valued at $48.5 million.Combs cleared the mansion’s mortgage in August, in anticipation of legal complications. Although this was acknowledged as a poor business decision, it was a calculated effort to gain the court’s trust.Star Island, a 55-acre exclusive enclave inhabited by billionaires and celebrities, is no stranger to high-profile residents. Combs, who acquired another mansion next door for $35 million in 2021, chose only his primary residence for the bail proposal, which ultimately failed.Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, a prominent figure in the music and entertainment industry, also known by aliases like Puff Daddy and P. Diddy , faces serious allegations that could tarnish his legacy. Born in Harlem in 1969, Combs rose to fame as a music producer and entrepreneur in the 1990s, establishing Bad Boy Records and launching the careers of artists such as The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, and Mase. He later expanded into fashion with his Sean John clothing line, spirits through Ciroc Vodka, and media with REVOLT TV, amassing a multi-million dollar empire.Combs is now embroiled in a federal case that alleges involvement in "" freak-offs ,"" described as sexually charged gatherings held in luxury hotels. Prosecutors claim he engaged in coercive, abusive, and criminal sexual activities at these events. The indictment details charges of sex trafficking, racketeering, arson, bribery, kidnapping, and obstruction of justice. It describes these ""freak-offs"" as involving prostitutes, excessive drug use, and substantial amounts of baby oil, all recorded on video by Combs, who allegedly used the footage to maintain control over participants. Some individuals were reportedly so physically drained from these events that they required intravenous fluids to recover, with a clean-up crew later restoring the hotel rooms.Central to the case is Cassie Ventura , a singer and Combs' former girlfriend, who filed a civil lawsuit alleging years of abuse and forced participation in the ""freak-offs."" Her lawsuit detailed how Combs directed her to use excessive oil, engage with prostitutes, and filmed the encounters as ""personal art projects,"" even adjusting lighting for effect. Ventura settled her lawsuit a day after filing, but her claims prompted a broader investigation, encouraging others to come forward with similar allegations.These accusations coincide with heightened discussions on power, consent, and gender equality, especially in the wake of the #MeToo movement. The case has provoked debates on how powerful figures exploit their influence and how society addresses allegations involving wealthy, high-profile individuals. Some politicians have used this case to advocate for stricter laws on sex trafficking and better support for survivors, while others stress the importance of accountability regardless of status or wealth.Combs' legal team denies all allegations, asserting that the ""freak-offs"" were consensual. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, claims interviews with men identified as sex workers in the indictment revealed no evidence of coercion. Nevertheless, the allegations have subjected Combs to intense public scrutiny, with many expressing disappointment in him, given his status as a cultural icon and social justice advocate. His business ventures have also felt the impact, with some partners distancing themselves.As the case progresses, it remains a significant topic in discussions about power dynamics, racial stereotyping, and the criminal justice system, especially amidst ongoing social and political debates.","Hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs cleared the mortgage on his $48.5 million Star Island mansion just before charges were brought against him. Combs' decision to clear the mortgage was likely a tactic to leverage Florida's Homestead Act, a law that safeguards homeowners from losing the equity in their primary residence regardless of legal troubles. The bond hearing shed light on Combs’ extravagant lifestyle.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113637804,imgsize-25856,width-400,resizemode-4/113637804.jpg"
Prince Harry Visa Case: Prince Harry wins big in visa case; records will not be made public despite drug revelations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prince-harry-wins-big-in-visa-case-records-will-not-be-made-public-despite-drug-revelations/articleshow/113639071.cms,"Prince Harry's visa records will not be made public, a US court ruled.

What was the visa case against Prince Harry?

Prince Harry's US visa application will remain private despite his admission of taking drugs in his memoir Spare, a judge has ruled in a big win for the Duke of Sussex. Harry in his memoir admitted that he took cocaine and psychedelic mushrooms triggering the case as to whether he should have been allowed into US in 2020. His drug admission became public in 2023 when his memoir was published.US judge Carl Nichols rules that his visa details will not be disclosed publicly as it was not in public interest. ""Like any foreign national, the Duke has a legitimate privacy interest in his immigration status,"" the judge ruled.The judge said Harry revealed intimate details of his life in the book with numerous instances of his drug use. But he concluded that public interest in the Duke's move to America was ""outweighed by the Duke's privacy interest"".The ruling comes as the Duke is in New York with a series of high-profile solo engagements scheduled in the city.In 2020, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle quit their royal duties and left the UK to settle in the US where Meghan had her Hollywood career before her marriage to Harry. In 2023, Harry published his memoir 'Spare' in which he admitted drug use. The Duke said cocaine ""didn't do anything for me"", adding: ""Marijuana is different, that actually really did help me.""A Washington DC-based think tank said application forms for US visas specifically ask about current and past drug abuses. If Harry got US visa, was his visa form not properly vetted, the think-tank asked.Drug use can lead to the rejection of the visa applications though immigration officers have the final say on it. The Heritage Foundation's lawsuit argued that US law ""generally renders such a person inadmissible for entry"" to the country.","US judge Carl Nichols rules that his visa details will not be disclosed publicly as it was not in public interest.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.

(General) Yahya Khan conducted an operation against the country's largest political party.

Even the other day, the judge was given instructions for three hours before he gave the verdict against Bushra (Khan),"" he added.Yahya Khan was a Pakistarmy officer, who served as the third president of Pakistan from 1969 to 1971. He also served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army from 1966 to 1971.Notably, it was under his tenure that Bangladesh (East Pakistan then) liberated from Pakistan.Yahya Khan refused to accept the results of the elections in which Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Awami League emerged as the single-largest party, which led to a massive uprising against West Pakistan, with people also opposing the imposition of Urdu langauge and economci discrimination.A severe crackdown from Pakistan was followed by 1971 Liberation War between India and Pakistan, which concluded with 93,000 Pak soldiers surrendering and the liberation of Bangladesh.Imran Khan, in his post, further alleged that Qazi Faez Isa has been given an extension because he is giving them ""protection from accountability"" for their role in human rights violations and election rigging.Stepping up his attack, Imran Khan said there is ""no point"" in calling Shehbaz Sharif the Prime Minister, as he is merely a ""tout"" and his decisions are subject of approval from the 'establishment.'""There is no point in calling Shehbaz Sharif the Prime Minister.

The posts were aimed at inciting people against two major state institutions, an action he described as highly condemnable.Imran's social media team had posted a video on his X account comparing past and present military leaderships, along with a statement urging people to review a judicial commission report on Pakistan's breakup.“Every Pakistani should study the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and get to know who was the true traitor, General Yahya Khan or Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” said a quote attributed to Imran.The posts also featured images of the current civilian and military leaders, alleging that they had stolen the mandate of Imran’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the February general elections.","Imran Khan has been booked for inciting government officer to mutiny, and committing'sedition,' through his social media posts.
