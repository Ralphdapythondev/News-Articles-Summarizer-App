"Time not just to call each other names, but also to give names",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/time-not-just-to-call-each-other-names-but-also-to-give-names/articleshow/109205631.cms,"season isn’t just about rival politicians getting to call each other names . In Tamil Nadu , there is a longstanding tradition that if mom and dad can’t agree on a proper name for their newborn, the baton usually passes to a politician.DMK minister Udhayanidhi Stalin sidestepped one such request during a rally in Dharmapuri recently, but possibly only because the baby already had what he thought was a timeless name: Rolex.Udhayanidhi’s party colleague Kanimozhi, seeking re-election from Thoothukudi, strategically picked the name Thamizachi for a baby whose parents had approached her while she was campaigning for DMK’s South Chennai candidate Thamizachi Thangapandian.AIADMK leaders, too, continue to embrace this tradition. In honour of former chief minister M G Ramachandran, leaders such as Dindigul Sreenivasan and Kancheepuram MP candidate E Rajasekar recently named newborns Ramachandran at different rallies.DMDK’s Premalatha Vijayakanth, who has allied with AIADMK, is known to be an active advocate of the custom.At a rally in Erode, she named her two babies Vijaya Jaya and Vijaya Ramachandran, seemingly a combination of the alliance leadership’s names.The late J Jayalalithaa was known to have expanded this tradition, extending it to even animals. In 2011, she famously named a male white tiger cub Rama, and its female sibling Chandra.Other parties, including PMK and BJP, have since joined the name game. As the Rolex ticks on elections, it’s apparently time to be a tad innovative as well. PMK’s Sowmya Anbumani and BJP’s K Annamalai have opted for unique names for babies like Ilam Mugil, Megasri, and Rudran.","In Tamil Nadu, there is a longstanding tradition that if mom and dad can’t agree on a proper name for their newborn, the baton usually passes to a politician.

Russia puts more Kremlin critics on a wanted list as its crackdown on dissent reaches new levels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-puts-more-kremlin-critics-on-a-wanted-list-as-its-crackdown-on-dissent-reaches-new-levels/articleshow/109210236.cms,"MOSCOW: Russian authorities have put more Kremlin critics on a wanted list as its crackdown against dissent reaches unprecedented levels since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine more than two years ago.Independent Russian news outlet Mediazona reported Tuesday that it found women's rights activist Darya Serenko and prominent journalist and author Mikhail Zygar in the Interior Ministry's database of individuals wanted on criminal charges.The entries don't specify the charges or when they were added to the list.Both Serenko and Zygar have long left Russia .The Kremlin's crackdown against opposition activists, independent journalists and government critics has intensified during the war.

"China tried to meddle in Canadian elections, PM Justin Trudeau tells inquiry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/china-tried-to-meddle-in-canadian-elections-pm-justin-trudeau-tells-inquiry/articleshow/109209945.cms,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , addressing a commission on Wednesday, vehemently defended the legitimacy of Canada's last two elections amidst allegations of foreign interference, particularly from China. ""Those elections held in their integrity, (they) were decided by Canadians,"" Trudeau asserted, referring to the 2019 and 2021 elections, both of which saw his Liberal Party emerge victorious.The independent commission, established to investigate the extent of foreign meddling in Canada's democratic processes and Ottawa's response, heard lengthy testimonies from Trudeau.This inquiry comes in response to a political scandal that has stirred significant concern across Canada for over a year, with the opposition Conservatives accusing the government of neglecting foreign interference efforts, especially by China. Beijing has, however, denied these allegations.An intelligence report presented to the commission outlined China's interference as ""sophisticated, pervasive, persistent,"" targeting various levels of government and civil society. Despite this, Trudeau and his ministers sought to minimize these findings, suggesting the intelligence was often inconclusive. Trudeau pointedly criticized the credibility of claims related to foreign influence, stating, ""Bragging is not doing,"" in reference to a foreign diplomat's claim of influencing Canadian elections.Throughout his three and a half hours of testimony, Trudeau emphasized the nascent state of Canada's preparedness to counter foreign disinformation in elections upon his taking office in 2015. Despite establishing several protective measures since, he acknowledged, ""There is always more to do.""Erin O'Toole, Trudeau's main opponent in the last election, contended that his Conservative Party lost up to eight seats due to foreign meddling, criticizing the government's stance towards China, especially in light of human rights concerns and the security crackdown in Hong Kong.Trudeau, however, disputed the likelihood of a Chinese preference in the election outcome, labeling such assertions as ""very improbable,"" despite acknowledging attempts by foreign entities to interfere. This testimony aligns with the narrative that, despite efforts by nations like China to meddle, the integrity of Canadian elections remained intact, led and decided by Canadians themselves.This stance comes amidst ongoing scrutiny over Trudeau's handling of foreign interference allegations, fueled by leaked intelligence reports and media stories suggesting targeted efforts by China to influence Canadian electoral outcomes. Trudeau's administration has faced criticism for its response to these allegations, prompting the establishment of the public inquiry to thoroughly examine and address these concerns.(With inputs from agencies)","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed an independent commission on Wednesday.

96 shots in 41 secs: Video shows US cops firing at man at traffic stop for 'not wearing seatbelt',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/96-shots-in-41-secs-video-shows-us-cops-firing-at-man-at-traffic-stop-for-not-wearing-seatbelt/articleshow/109208668.cms,"CHICAGO: Plainclothes Chicago police officers fired nearly 100 gunshots over 41 seconds during a traffic stop that left one man dead and one officer injured, according to graphic video footage a police oversight agency released Tuesday.Five officers from a tactical unit who were in an unmarked police vehicle surrounded an SUV last month driven by Dexter Reed , allegedly for failing to wear a seatbelt.Video shows the 26-year-old black man briefly lowering a window and then raising it and refusing to exit the vehicle as more officers arrived, yelled commands and drew weapons.The Civilian Office of Police Accountability said preliminary evidence showed Reed fired first, injuring an officer. Then four officers returned fire, shooting 96 rounds.The gunshots continued even after ""Reed exited his vehicle and fell to the ground,"" COPA said in releasing the body-worn camera footage , 911 calls and police reports.

Police superintendent Larry Snelling previously said the shooting on March 21 began with a traffic stop and described it as an ""exchange of gunfire.""Family members have questioned authorities' account of the shooting, looking for answers about why Reed was pulled over. Andrew M Stroth, an attorney for the family, said Reed's mother, sister, uncle and father saw the video Tuesday and were emotionally distraught. He said they remember the young man as a talented high school basketball player with ambitions of being a sports broadcaster. ""I really can't explain the pain that me and my family is going through, but I just hope there are people out there who understand he was a son, he was a brother, he was an uncle, he had loved ones,"" Reed's sister, Porscha Banks, told reporters. Banks and other family members joined a demonstration Tuesday night outside the 11th district police station, where protestors demanded the firing of the officers who shot Reed.Stroth called it an unconstitutional police stop with plainclothes officers who did not announce they were police.

Xi stressed on the importance of dialogue, stating that all issues can be discussed.This meeting holds significance as it marks a rare interaction between leaders from Taiwan and China since the establishment of the Republic of China government in Taiwan in 1949.Ma, who served as Taiwan's president from 2008 to 2016, made history last year by becoming the first former Taiwanese leader to visit China. During his current visit, it was anticipated that Ma would meet with Xi, as they had previously held a landmark summit in 2015.Xi reaffirmed the shared identity of both sides of the strait as Chinese and spoke against the futility of external interference, particularly from Western countries like the United States.

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh's three sons killed in Israeli airstrike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyehs-three-sons-killed-in-israeli-airstrike/articleshow/109203257.cms,"(With inputs from agency)

NEW DELHI: In an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh 's three sons were killed as confirmed by the Palestinian Islamist group and Haniyeh's family Haniyeh, based abroad in Qatar , has been a prominent figure of Hamas' international diplomacy amidst the ongoing conflict with Israel in Gaza. His family home in Gaza was previously destroyed in an Israeli airstrike last November.The three sons - Hazem, Amir, and Mohammad - lost their lives while they were traveling in the car that was targeted in Gaza's Al-Shati camp, according to Hamas.Hamas media also revealed that two of Haniyeh's grandchildren were also killed in the attack, with one more injured.""The blood of my sons is not dearer than the blood of our people,"" said Haniyeh, who reportedly has 13 sons and daughters according to pan-Arab Al Jazeera TV citing Hamas sources.Haniyeh's eldest son confirmed the deaths of his three brothers in a Facebook post. ""Thanks to God who honored us with the martyrdom of my brothers, Hazem, Amir, and Mohammad, and their children,"" wrote Abdel-Salam Haniyeh.According to their relatives,the victims were visiting family during the first day of the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday in Shati, their home refugee camp in Gaza City, when they were attacked.On Tuesday, Hamas stated it was evaluating an Israeli ceasefire proposal in the ongoing Gaza conflict, dismissing it as ""intransigent"" and failing to meet Palestinian demands.""Our demands are clear and specific, and we will not compromise on them. The enemy would be mistaken to believe that targeting my sons, amidst ongoing negotiations and before the movement responds, would alter Hamas' stance,"" Haniyeh emphasized.Amidst the seventh month of the devastating conflict, Hamas seeks an end to Israeli military actions, withdrawal from Gaza, and the right for displaced Palestinians to return home.Haniyeh, appointed to the top position within the militant group in 2017, has navigated between Turkey and Qatar's capital Doha, evading Israeli travel restrictions imposed on blockaded Gaza. This has facilitated his involvement in ceasefire negotiations and communication with Hamas' primary ally, Iran.Israel categorizes the entire Hamas leadership as terrorists, accusing Haniyeh and others of directing the Hamas organization.However, the extent of Haniyeh's prior knowledge regarding the October 7 cross-border attack on Israel by Gaza-based militants remains unclear. The attack plan, devised by Hamas' military council in Gaza, was kept so confidential that some Hamas officials abroad appeared surprised by its timing and magnitude.","Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh's three sons were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday.

'Try-hard bid': UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faces online backlash over shoe choice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/try-hard-bid-uk-prime-minister-rishi-sunak-faces-online-backlash-over-shoe-choice/articleshow/109185328.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently faced backlash for his choice of footwear—Adidas Samba sneakers—in a video discussing his Conservative government’s policies. The video, aimed at explaining the latest tax and childcare policies, sparked a discussion not about its content but about Sunak’s attempt to appear relatable through his ""everyman"" shoes.Comments ranged from jests about belonging to the populace to sarcastic appreciation for making the video relatable.The sneakers, which have been sported by celebrities like Harry Styles and Rihanna, lost their ""eternally cool"" status, according to British GQ, the moment Sunak appeared in them. The Guardian echoed this sentiment, describing Sunak's attempt to seem relatable as a ""try-hard bid"" that ultimately fell flat, a CNN report said. This response starkly contrasts with the acclaim that other politicians, such as Barack Obama and Kamala Harris, have received for their sneaker choices. Obama's Stan Smiths and Harris's Converse were celebrated as tasteful and appropriate, underscoring how political figures can successfully use fashion to enhance their public image when the context is right.Meanwhile, the Conservative Party, led by Sunak, is anticipated to face a significant defeat in the upcoming national election slated for later this year. A seat projection released by YouGov on Wednesday indicates a landslide victory for the opposition Labour Party , which is expected to secure over 400 seats.According to the YouGov model, which forecasts outcomes in individual parliamentary constituencies based on vote share estimations, the Conservatives are projected to secure merely 155 seats, while Labour is poised to win 403 out of the 650 total seats in Britain's parliament.Labour has consistently led the Conservatives by a double-digit margin in polls leading up to the election, which Sunak has hinted could be called in the latter half of the year.Since 2010, the Conservative Party has been at the helm of the UK government, navigating through the complexities of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the party has seen five different leaders during this period due to ongoing political upheaval.The recent poll suggests a challenging path ahead for Sunak, who has struggled to rally support following a budget announcement last month that included tax cuts. This struggle comes as the country prepares for local elections in May. The latest YouGov projection even suggests the Conservatives might perform worse than in 1997, when they won only 165 seats in a devastating defeat to Labour under Tony Blair's leadership.Notably, high-profile Conservative members such as finance minister Jeremy Hunt and former leadership contender Penny Mordaunt are among those potentially at risk of losing their parliamentary seats, according to YouGov.","UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently faced backlash for his choice of footwear.

Musk echoes Ramaswamy's warning of 9/11-type terror in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-echoes-ramaswamys-warning-of-9/11-type-terror-in-us/articleshow/109202757.cms,"NEW DELHI: Elon Musk , the billionaire behind Tesla and SpaceX, has issued a stark warning that the United States could face a terrorist attack comparable to the tragedy of September 11 , 2001, if the ongoing crisis at the southern border and the uncontrolled influx of migrants are not adequately addressed. Musk 's cautionary words came in response to a post by Vivek Ramaswamy , a former Republican presidential candidate and businessman, who advocated for mass deportations and the sealing of the US-Mexico border.Ramaswamy highlighted the potential security threat posed by the sheer volume of undocumented migrants crossing into the US, saying, “Even if only 0.1% of illegal aliens who’ve crossed our border have hostile intentions, that’s tens of thousands of would-be attackers.” He further warned that ignoring this issue could pave the way for a catastrophe on the scale of the September 11 attacks.Musk echoed Ramaswamy's concerns, indicating that it is “only a matter of time” before such a disaster could unfold. The tech mogul has previously voiced his apprehensions about the southern border situation, arguing that the policy allowing illegal migrants to claim asylum without any identification has transformed the US into a haven for international criminals. This assertion followed reports suggesting a significant drop in Venezuela's homicide rate, purportedly due to Venezuelan criminals relocating to the US.Amid these discussions, a Politico report last month revealed that US President Joe Biden might be considering granting permanent residency to millions of undocumented immigrants. Musk criticized this potential move, accusing the Democratic party of deliberately opening the southern border to “import voters.”The debate over the US-Mexico border has intensified in recent American politics, especially with the record-breaking influx of migrants in the past year. Republican legislators have called for stricter border controls and increased funding to manage the crisis, even leveraging a multi-billion-dollar aid package for Ukraine to press their demands.The controversy surrounding the border and immigration policies continues to be a focal point of national discourse, with Musk's latest comments adding a layer of urgency to the discussions on national security and immigration reform.","Elon Musk has warned that the US could face a terrorist attack comparable to the tragedy of September 11, 2001.

'It doesn’t seem right': Muslim Americans observe muted Eid amid Gaza war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/it-doesnt-seem-right-muslim-americans-observe-muted-eid-amid-gaza-war/articleshow/109202555.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: This year, Muslims around the world are celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr under a cloud of somberness, deeply influenced by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza. Traditionally a time for joy, reflection, and community, Ramzan and Eid spirit has been significantly muted as Muslim communities worldwide grapple with the dire humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip , where over two million people face the threat of famine.The conflict, which has claimed more than 33,000 Palestinian lives, has imbued the act of fasting with a profound significance, intertwining the spiritual practice with a broader quest for justice and peace.In southeast Michigan, a region renowned for its vibrant Arab and Muslim demographic, the usually anticipated Suhoor Festival was conspicuously absent this year. Organizers decided against holding the joyous event, saying that celebration was unjustifiable amidst the suffering in Gaza. Reflecting on the subdued nature of Ramzan this year, Amad Elzayat, founder of the Amity Foundation, noted a palpable shift in the community's mood, emphasizing a significant increase in charitable efforts directed towards Gaza. Imam Mohammad Ali Elahi, leading the Islamic House of Wisdom in Dearborn Heights, highlighted that religious sermons and Ramzan programming have predominantly focused on Gaza, critiquing US. political leadership for its support of Israel and advocating for a modest Eid celebration centered on solidarity with Gaza and the Palestinian struggle, an Aljazeera report said.In southeast Michigan, a decision was made by at least ten mosques to forgo the traditional Eid-ul-Fitr festivities, which mark the conclusion of Ramzan, in a gesture of solidarity with Gaza. Heeding the call from the Imam’s Council of Michigan, these mosques plan to limit their observance to morning prayers and will dedicate collections to support Gaza during the two-day celebration commencing this week, the Aljazeera report said.“It doesn’t seem right that they’re suffering and we’re celebrating,” Qasim Abdullah, one of the imams at the American Muslim Center, told Aljazeera.Amad Elzayat, the founder of the Amity Foundation, a charitable organization, reflected on the observance of Ramzan this year among Arab and Muslim Americans in Michigan, describing it as notably more subdued. “This year's holy month has felt distinct,” Elzayat shared with Al Jazeera. “Witnessing the plight of children in Palestine facing hunger, along with the challenges endured by those in south Lebanon, made our traditional Ramadan meals feel unusually burdensome.”Earlier, amidst this atmosphere of contemplation and activism, a significant demonstration outside the White House marked a focal point of protest in the United States. Mohamad Habehh, deeply immersed in a moment of spiritual reflection, recited the Muslim call to prayer, signaling the end of a day of fasting. This act of devotion coincided with a gathering to protest President Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s military actions in Gaza, aligning with an iftar hosted by the White House for government employees. Despite the gloomy weather, protesters held their own iftar, a simple yet symbolic meal, as their chants of ""End the siege on Gaza now. Free, free Palestine,"" echoed amidst the rain. “This is the least we could do for the people of Gaza at a time where some of these people can’t break their fast; some of these people are starving,” said Habehh, emphasizing the collective resolve of Muslim Americans to prioritize Gaza activism during this period.As per the Aljazeera report, the meeting between President Biden and Muslim Americans inside the White House, intended to address concerns regarding the Israel-Gaza war, became a venue for protest. Palestinian American doctor Thaer Ahmad made headlines by walking out of the meeting, presenting the president with a letter from an orphaned 8-year-old girl in Rafah and expressing frustration over the continued US military support for Israel. “There’s a change in the rhetoric,"" Ahmad noted, ""But concrete actions, we have not seen a significant change.”Internationally, the mood remained reflective and supportive of the Palestinian cause. From the throngs of worshippers gathering at Istanbul's Aya Sofya Mosque, many carrying Palestinian flags, to the prayers at Nairobi's Rahma Mosque, the global Muslim community echoed a unified message of solidarity with Gaza. Celebrations of Eid-ul-Fitr, marking the end of Ramzan, were overshadowed by the conflict, with prayers and messages of support for Palestine marking the holiday across the world. Leaders and citizens alike called for peace, tranquility, and well-being, not just for their own nations but for all humanity, highlighting the conflict in Gaza as a ""bleeding wound on the conscience of humanity.""","Ramzan and Eid spirit has been significantly muted as Muslim communities worldwide grapple with humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. In southeast Michigan, a decision was made by at least ten mosques to forgo the traditional Eid-ul-Fitr festivities, which mark the conclusion of Ramzan, in a gesture of solidarity with Gaza.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109202550,imgsize-1409148,width-400,resizemode-4/109202550.jpg"
Why US lawmakers want strict visa rules for Chinese nationals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-lawmakers-for-strict-visa-rules-to-protect-us-military-secrets-from-chinese-espionage/articleshow/109201689.cms,"NEW DELHI: US legislators have voiced concerns regarding visa loopholes that permit Chinese nationals to enter Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) without stringent checks, potentially jeopardizing military security. A bipartisan group of 32 senators and representatives, including Iowa Senator Joni Ernst and Florida Representative Neal Dunn, criticized the Biden administration for its inaction on this matter.They fear these loopholes might enable Chinese espionage activities close to critical US military installations.As per a Newsweek report, concern centers around the Visa Waiver Program sponsored by US Customs and Border Protection, allowing Chinese individuals to enter Guam via the CNMI without a conventional B-1 (business) or B-2 (tourism) visa. ""The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has already proven they will stop at nothing to infiltrate the United States, and that threat is increasing every day as Chinese nationals use a visa loophole to gain access to our critical military installations in Guam,"" said Senator Ernst, highlighting the urgency of the situation.After a wait of over four months for a response, lawmakers received an explanation from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that didn't address their security concerns. DHS explained that the Consolidated Natural Resources Act 2008 (CNRA) necessitates identifying countries that provide ""significant economic benefit"" to the CNMI through tourism. The People's Republic of China was deemed to meet this criterion in 2009.Despite the DHS's assurance of vigilant screening and vetting duties to identify high-risk travelers, lawmakers remain unconvinced of the policy's adequacy in preventing potential threats. Representative Dunn criticized the government's stance as ""willful ignorance,"" emphasizing the need for stricter visa requirements for Chinese nationals entering the CNMI to deter CCP aggression effectively, the Newsweek report said.The issue has garnered attention amid increasing flights between Hong Kong and Saipan, signaling a potential rise in visitors from China to the region. This development comes as national security experts warn of the risks posed by unauthorized access to military bases, referencing a recent incident where a Chinese national was taken into custody after driving onto the 29 Palms Marine Base in California without authorization.As tensions between the US and China continue to escalate, the debate over the visa waiver program and its implications for national security and regional stability is expected to intensify. Lawmakers are calling for immediate action to close these visa loopholes and safeguard US military secrets and installations from potential espionage activities.","US legislators have voiced concerns regarding visa loopholes that permit Chinese nationals to enter Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

'Hunter Biden-linked Ukrainian firm connected to terror attacks in Russia',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hunter-biden-linked-ukrainian-firm-connected-to-terror-attacks-in-russia/articleshow/109184433.cms,"NEW DELHI: Russia has launched a ""financing terrorism"" investigation, implicating Western countries and specifically targeting funds received by US firms in Ukraine. Among these is Burisma Holdings , an oil and gas company that notably employed Hunter Biden , son of US President Joe Biden. The probe underscores Moscow 's ongoing narrative that blames the West and Ukraine for a deadly attack on a concert hall last month, which resulted in 144 fatalities.The Crocus City Hall attack, claimed by the Islamic State group, has been a focal point of controversy, especially after US officials disclosed they had preemptively warned Moscow about the impending threat. Nonetheless, Russia's Investigative Committee is delving into the ""sources of income"" involving millions of dollars and the ""involvement of specific individuals"" from Western nations.""It has been established that financial funds received through commercial organisations, including Burisma Holding, working in Ukraine over recent years were used to carry out terrorist acts inside Russia,"" said the committee. This assertion aims to trace the financing back to its origins, seeking to identify the connections between the perpetrators of these terrorist acts and their international backers.In response, the White House has dismissed the allegations as unfounded. US national security advisor Jake Sullivan labeled the Russian claims as ""nonsense"".""Russia knows that it was ISIS who committed the attack in Moscow, we know it was ISIS who committed the attack in Moscow,"" Sullivan said, referring to the so-called Islamic State group, ""we warned Russia of an impending terrorist attack in Moscow, and all of the rest of this is noise.""The investigation into Burisma Holdings not only revives concerns over the company's connections to the Biden family but also rekindles debate over the complex interplay of political influence, international business dealings, and security issues. Hunter Biden's role at Burisma, particularly after the 2014 US-supported political upheaval in Ukraine, has been a point of contention, complicating US-Ukraine relations and fueling political discourse in the US.This inquiry emerges amidst a politically charged atmosphere in the US, where Republicans seek to leverage Hunter Biden's business engagements in Ukraine against President Biden. Both Joe and Hunter Biden maintain their innocence regarding any allegations of illegal activity.As the investigation progresses, it accentuates the intricate web of geopolitics, commerce, and accusations of illicit financing, shining a light on the shadowy intersections of international relations and domestic political battles.(With inputs from agencies)","Russia's Investigative Committee is delving into the ""sources of income"" involving millions of dollars and the ""involvement of specific individuals"" from Western nations.

He attributed the resurgence of terrorism in Pakistan to the Sharif family and their ""facilitators,"" asserting that PML-N, PPP, MQM, and other members of the PDM intended to overthrow a stable PTI government, thereby creating a political vacuum exploited by terrorists.Hasan said that terrorism wasn't a recent occurrence, tracing its roots back to Nawaz Sharif's tenure when, backed by the military, terrorism was ""imported"" into Pakistan. His remarks came in response to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz's criticism of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for failing to adequately control its corridors, which she claimed were exploited by terrorists and smugglers.Regarding PTI's approach towards the Centre despite differences with the PML-N mindset, Hasan mentioned Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur's recent visit to Islamabad, where he met Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Despite criticism from party members, Hasan explained PTI's rationale for maintaining a positive working relationship with the Centre.Despite efforts by the provincial government, Hasan lamented the Centre's failure to fulfill its obligations, including the appointment of requested officers and the release of long-awaited funds for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Critiquing political rivals advocating for governor rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Hasan highlighted the disregard for the rule of law and constitutional principles.

He said the Sharifs and their 'facilitators' were responsible for the resurgence of terrorism in Pakistan, adding that PML-N, PPP, MQM and other components of the PDM planned to ""topple a stable PTI government to create a political vacuum that was then filled by terrorists.""Hasan stressed that terrorism was not a new phenomenon and the issue dated back to the time when Nawaz Sharif was part of the government with the backing of military that ""imported terrorism"" in Pakistan.PTI leader's remarks came after Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz criticised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for not taking enough measures to check its corridors that were open to terrorists and smugglers.In her remarks at her maiden Punjab apex committee meeting on Friday, Maryam Nawaz claimed that the metal strong that slit open the throat of a youth in Faisalabad was also brought from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. She said, ""Punjab has decided to set up posts at its provincial border to stop terrorism and smuggling,"" Dawn reported.He recalled that PTI despite the PML-N mindset adopted a positive attitude towards the Centre. He spoke about Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur recent visit to Islamabad, where he met Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.PTI leader said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM met Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi during a visit to Peshawar because of which he said the PTI faced a backlash and criticism from party cadres and supporters.He said they informed the PTI workers and activists about party's rationale to convince them that being a federating unit, it was a constitutional obligation to keep a healthy working relationship with the Centre despite differences.Hasan further said that despite all the good efforts made by the provincial government, Centre failed to honour its responsibilities as it neither appointed officers sought by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government nor release the long-pending funds of the province, Dawn reported.He criticised Amir Muqam and other political rivals who were openly supporting implementing a governor rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa despite the move being against assembly's resolution and thus unconstitutional. He said that the rule of law remained non-existent, constitution was being disregarded and morality has been ruined in Pakistan during the past two years.Raoof Hasan said political parties who said that PTI was responsible for resurgence of terrorism had publicly spoken bad about judges and generals. He said people have not forgotten Nawaz Sharif's Gujranwala speech, where he said that Sharifs had a history of ""attacking state institutions as Nawaz's goons attacked Supreme Court and bought judges"".PTI leader called all provincial governments, except Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ""fake and unlawful"", adding that the reason of their frustration was that people of Pakistan rejected them in the elections held on February 8, as none of the members of Sharif family including Nawaz Sharif could actually win their seats.He announced that tribunals would expose their ""polls fraud"" before people of Pakistan, according to Dawn report. Hasan vowed that PTI will continue their struggle against ""mandate theft"" until reclaiming their mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan and Centre. He said that people would not let the ""criminals to escape"" Pakistan.Speaking on the occasion, Shaukat Mahmood Basra said the Sharif family and the Punjab CM were taking revenge of the ""humiliating defeat"" in the polls. He said placing all the economic burden of government policies on farmers was highly condemnable.","Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz criticised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for not taking enough measures to check its corridors that were open to terrorists and smugglers.

Why the green onion has become a contentious poll issue in the South Korean elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/why-the-green-onion-has-become-a-contentious-poll-issue-in-the-south-korean-elections/articleshow/109105265.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Ahead of South Korea's crucial parliamentary election on April 10, green onions have unexpectedly taken center stage, overshadowing traditional hot topics like foreign policy and the economy. So contentious is the humble allium that it has been banned from polling stations due to concerns of electoral interference, sparking a wave of discussions among voters and election officials.The green onion frenzy began on March 18 when current president Yoon Suk Yeol visited a grocery store in Seoul to check consumer prices.His comment on the reasonable price of green onions, at 875 won ($0.65), stirred controversy as local media revealed the store had discounted the vegetable for his visit.This incident led to online backlash and opposition parties using green onions as a symbol of the president being out of touch with the people.As early voting commenced, photos of voters holding green onions at polling stations flooded social media, accompanied by hashtags like #earlyvotedone and #greenonions875won. Despite the high early voting turnout, reaching 13.8 million out of 44.2 million eligible voters, the National Election Commission (NEC) intervened by prohibiting green onions from polling stations to prevent any potential election interference .The NEC's decision faced ridicule online, with more onion memes circulating on social media platforms. This ban prompted a rush for green onion-themed memorabilia to circumvent the restrictions. Some voters expressed defiance by planning to wear green onion headbands on election day, criticizing the NEC's ban as arbitrary and condescending.One voter, Hyun Jung, voiced her disapproval, questioning the ban's logic and suggesting other items like colored clothing or luxury bags could also be restricted. Despite the ban on green onions, election officials will decide on-site whether green onion-themed items are acceptable, according to an NEC official.Political analyst Yum Seung-yul criticized the NEC's decision, deeming it too hastily implemented. While the ban is within the NEC's discretion, it has raised questions about the reasoning behind prohibiting green onions and the potential impact on voters' freedom of expression .As the election day approaches, the green onion controversy continues to stir debate and creativity among voters. The unexpected focus on this humble vegetable has become a symbol of political discourse and resistance against perceived restrictions on electoral participation.The green onion saga highlights the intersection of political symbolism and everyday life, illustrating how a seemingly mundane item can spark a nationwide conversation during a crucial electoral period. The outcome of the parliamentary election remains uncertain, but one thing is clear – green onions have secured their place in South Korea's political landscape, serving as a reminder of the power of everyday objects in shaping public discourse.",Green onions have taken center stage ahead of South Korea's crucial parliamentary election.

Flesh-rotting 'Zombie drug' tranq raises alarm in UK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/flesh-rotting-zombie-drug-tranq-raises-alarm-in-uk/articleshow/109185020.cms,"NEW DELHI: Experts are sounding an alarm over the spread of Xylazine , a potent animal tranquiliser known as ' tranq ', which has been linked to 11 deaths in the UK . This drug, powerful enough to sedate elephants, has been found in cocaine , heroin , fentanyl, and even some cannabis vapes, posing a grave threat to public health. Originally developed in the 60s for large animals, its misuse among humans is causing severe health issues, including flesh-rotting effects on users, a Daily Mail report said.The situation in the UK mirrors the crisis in the US, where cities like Philadelphia and New York have seen their streets turn into 'zombielands' due to the rampant use of tranq. Its addition to cocaine and other drugs makes them more potent and extends their supply, creating a dangerous cycle of dependency and harm. With the UK having the highest cocaine usage rate in Europe, the presence of tranq in these supplies is particularly concerning.Researchers from King's College London have detected tranq in various illegal substances, revealing the extent of its penetration into Britain's drug market. This discovery is alarming due to the severe side effects associated with the drug, including ulcers and necrosis, particularly in individuals who inject it directly into their bloodstream.Dr Caroline Copeland, a senior author and expert in toxicology, emphasizes the need for immediate action to prevent a tranq epidemic similar to that in the US. Proposed measures include making cheap xylazine test strips available, educating healthcare providers on the signs of xylazine-related skin ulcers, and urging pathologists and coroners to test specifically for xylazine to grasp the true prevalence of the drug in the UK.The drug's rise in the US, where it is often mixed with stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, has been linked to creating a state of zombie-like immobility in users. This combination of a sedative and stimulant prevents users from completely passing out, trapping them in a dangerous limbo. The flesh-rotting quality of tranq, while not fully understood, is thought to be due to its constriction of blood vessels, which hampers the body's ability to heal wounds and increases the risk of severe infections, the Daily Mail report said.As the UK grapples with this emerging threat, the situation calls for heightened awareness and swift intervention to mitigate the spread of tranq and its devastating effects on individuals and communities.","Xylazine is a potent animal tranquiliser known as'tranq ', which has been linked to 11 deaths in the UK.

NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old man identified as Nicholas Metson , from Shuttleworth House in Lincoln, stabbed his wife, Holly Bramley to death, cut her body into more than 200 pieces and dumps her remains in a river days later, with the help of a friend, Joshua Hancock .Nicholas pleaded guilty to the murder of his wife, whose body was found dismembered in the River Witham in March 2023.He confessed to a UK court that he paid his friend, Joshua, to dispose of the remains, which were kept hidden in their flat for almost a week.During the court hearing at the UK court on Friday, Nicholas remained silent and didn't gave a reason for how and why he had killed his wife.Victim impact statements presented in court by Holly's mother and siblings revealed the ""coercive control and manipulation"" she endured at the hands of the ""evil monster"". The couple, who had tied the knot in 2021, was reportedly on the brink of separation when the heinous crime took place.Prosecutor Gordon Aspden KC, informed court that concerns were raised about Holly's well-being, leading Lincolnshire Policeto visit the couple's residence on 24th March 2023.The investigators discovered disturbing evidence inside the flat, including a pungent smell of ammonia and bleach, bloodstained sheets in the bathtub, and suspicious cleaning activities, Aspden said.Nicholas informed officers that his wife had been abusive towards him, displaying a bite mark on his forearm as evidence. He claimed she had left their home to join a local mental health support group on March 19.""At one point Nicholas joked she might be hiding under the bed,"" Aspden said. The bite mark on Nicholas arm ""suggests she was being restrained in a headlock"", he added.Police later discovered that Nicholas had deceived them, prompting them to return and search the apartment.After murdering his wife, Nicholas withdrew £50 from her bank account and searched on the internet with questions such as ""What benefits do I get if my wife has died"" and ""Can someone haunt me after they die"".A passerby made a ""made a grim discovery"" in the River Witham, when he noticed plastic bags floating in the River Witham, one of which contained a human hand, he said.Despite the recovery of 224 remains, some parts were never found, leaving the family with unimaginable pain and grief.As per Aspden, the 26-year-old was likely stabbed in the bedroom and then dismembered in the bathroom, with her remains stored in the kitchen larder.CCTV footage presented in court captured the last moments of Holly before her disappearance returning to her flat on 17 March, further the footage showed Nicholas's suspicious activities involving moving bags from 14th floor to the ground floor in the early hours of 25 March.In court, Holly's mother, Annette Bramley, addressed Nicholas directly, telling him he had condemned her family ""to a life sentence of grief"". ""The heinous way in which she was murdered and dismembered has left us in such unimaginable pain,"" she said.Bramley stated that Nicholas controlling and coercive behavior had prevented the family from seeing Holly in the years leading up to her death.

'Russia hiding Ukraine war deaths to avoid compensation payments',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-hiding-ukraine-war-deaths-to-avoid-compensation-payments/articleshow/109201619.cms,"A recent revelation from Ukraine 's Military Intelligence (HUR) has cast a shadow over Moscow's handling of its military casualties in the ongoing war with Ukraine. According to an intercepted phone call shared by HUR on Telegram, a Russian soldier has claimed that the Kremlin is deliberately misreporting the status of deceased soldiers as ""missing"" rather than acknowledging their deaths, in an apparent effort to avoid compensating the bereaved families.During the conversation, the soldier expressed frustration over the lack of transparency , suggesting that by not officially declaring soldiers as deceased, the government evades the financial obligations owed to the soldiers' next of kin. ""I say, it's beneficial for you to tell me he is not missing, so you don't have to pay for him ... You know, we haven't heard from him for a month and a half,"" the soldier remarked, according to a translation by the Kyiv Post.This claim aligns with previous reports indicating that Russia has been looking for ways to circumvent its commitments to families of soldiers killed in action. A decree signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in January 2023 promised 5 million rubles (approximately $53,800) to the beneficiaries of deceased servicemen, with injured troops eligible for 3 million rubles ($32,280), a Newsweek report said.Further compounding these allegations, the mother of Russian soldier Mikhail Cherkasov disclosed to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that although her son's comrades informed her of his death in battle, the military allegedly deemed it ""unprofitable"" to retrieve his body from the battlefield.Another distressing account from Mozhem Obyasnit (We Can Explain) revealed the story of a severely injured Russian soldier who, instead of receiving the promised monetary aid, was given two buckets of carrots and a bag of onions by the government. His wife, Irina Rybkina, detailed the dire situation, stating her husband was in extreme pain and in need of knee surgery, yet was ordered back to battle without undergoing the necessary medical procedure. ""What vegetables, what gifts, do I need to replace my husband's joint and get him discharged!"" Rybkina lamented.The HUR underscored its commitment to seeking justice for every war crime committed against Ukraine, vowing, ""There will be just retribution for every war crime committed against Ukraine.""As the international community continues to scrutinize the conduct of Russian military operations, these allegations underscore the profound human cost of the conflict and the lengths to which some claim Moscow will go to mask the true toll of the war on its forces.","A Russian soldier has claimed that the Kremlin is deliberately misreporting the status of deceased soldiers as ""missing"" rather than acknowledging their deaths.

However, it remained ambiguous regarding specific measures or binding targets.Germany has increasingly become cautious about tethering itself to a nation it has labeled both a partner and a systemic rival, especially after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 highlighted Europe's dependence on Russian gas supplies.Accompanying Scholz on the trip will be chief executives from prominent companies like Siemens and Mercedes, alongside cabinet ministers, underscoring Beijing's sustained significance.","The German Economic Institute revealed on Tuesday that the economy of Germany maintains a significant reliance on China.

The Cosmodrome is what can be said as a milestone for President Vladimir Putin 's space ambitions and also a symbol of Russia's space power aspirations. It cost billions of dollars but the construction was mired by repeated delays and corruption scandals.Situated in the forested Amur area of Russia's Far East, the Cosmodrome is roughly 1,500 km (930 miles) away from the port of Vladivostok and not far from the Russian border with China.Almost ten years after its initial test flight, the Angara A5 rocket successfully completed its fourth launch. All of the earlier launches were coordinated from the northern Russian Plesetsk Cosmodrome.Russia is developing the 42.7-meter Angara launch vehicle to replace the Proton M, which has been the country's heavy-lift rocket since the mid-1960s and can take payloads weighing more than 20 tonnes into orbit. But the project, which Putin had described as having huge significance for national security, has also been dogged by manufacturing delays and technical issues.In September, Putin met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un - cast by former U.S. President Donald Trump as the ""rocket man"" - at the Vostochny Cosmodrome. Putin said afterwards that Kim had shown a ""great interest in rocket engineering.""(With inputs from agency)",The launch of a Russian Angara-A5 rocket was aborted on Tuesday minutes before it was scheduled to lift off from Vostochny cosmodrome.
