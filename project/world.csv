"111-year-old grandma defies heat, boycott calls to cast ballot",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/111-yr-old-grandma-defies-heat-boycott-calls-to-cast-ballot-/articleshow/109467363.cms,"Fulamati, 111, had the option of a home vote, but chose to trudge to the booth in Gadchiroli

MULCHERA (GADCHIROLI): As poll officials and paramilitary troopers battled blistering heat a little after Friday noon at Mulchera's Govindpur booth in Maoist-infested Gadchiroli, 111-year-old Fulamati Binod Sarkar turned up, taking everyone by surprise. Though there was an option of home voting for the elderly, Fulamati preferred to trudge 300m to the booth from home with grandson Haridas (45).Fulamati is probably one of India's seniormost citizens who voted in the first phase, defying the heat and Maoist boycott calls in this remote village, 240km off Nagpur.Born on Jan 1, 1913 - as mentioned on her Aadhaar card - Fulamati migrated from Bangladesh's Khulna and settled in Gadchiroli in the sixties. Having lost her husband six decades ago, Fulamati raised her two daughters on her own in Gadchiroli. Though Haridas doesn't recall much about her early days, he said his granny was a fighter all through life. While one daughter died young, Haridas was born to the second, who currently looks after her.This LS election has seen several citizens above 85 vote from home and Fulamati, too, thought someone would approach her. But when no official came, she decided to head to the booth herself. ""It feels wonderful to press the EVM button. I have voted in the past, too,"" an elated Fulamati said, adding she has no medical complications.According to Haridas, poll officials ensured Fulamati didn't have to queue up. ""Our family believes every vote counts and my grandma signified citizen's empowerment through voting,"" said Haridas. ""My grandmother votes in every election,"" said Haridas.He recalled her grandmother's struggle with Bangladeshi refugees, who were first moved to a camp in Chandrapur in 1968 and then to Gadchiroli two years later.","Fulamati Binod Sarkar, 111, voted in Gadchiroli, a Maoist-infested village.

Israel-Iran attacks show India needs greater thrust on multi-layered air & missile defence systems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-iran-attacks-show-india-needs-stronger-air-and-missile-defence-systems/articleshow/109448246.cms,"NEW DELHI: Missile defence is technically complex and very expensive. It’s virtually like firing a bullet to stop an incoming bullet. But with the sheer operational criticality of air and missile defence systems being reinforced by the tit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Iran, India needs to majorly crank up efforts to make its airspace as impregnable as possible.India has taken some strides in the arena but much more clearly needs to be done for an effective multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, reliable command and control posts, land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles.Unlike India, Israel of course has only a small territory to defend. And it did so effectively on April 13, thwarting Iran’s mass missile and kamikaze drone attack with its wide array of defence systems, from the short-range Iron Dome to long-range Arrow, as well as help from some others like the US.India’s air defence systems are geared towards protecting only some vital areas and installations. “India is simply too vast to be effectively protected from all kinds of aerial threats. But yes, apart from buying bullets, we need to invest much more in bulletproof jackets as well. Missile defence is now an overwhelming tactical necessity rather than a strategic one,” a senior officer said.For one, India needs to get cracking on operationally deploying its indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy nuclear and other ballistic missiles both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 15-25 km to 80-100 km for “a higher kill probability”.After “successfully completing” a series of tests for Phase-1 of the land-based BMD system quite a while ago, the DRDO also conducted the maiden flight-trial of a sea-based interceptor missile in April last year.The government, however, has so far not sanctioned full-scale deployment of the BMD system at any vital location. This could be due to the exorbitant costs involved or a few technological gaps, or even strategic calculations that it may provoke Pakistan to go in for a larger nuclear arsenal and countermeasures to defeat the BMD system, as reported by TOI earlier.IAF, of course, now has three squadrons of Russian S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems, which can detect, track and destroy incoming strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, drones and even some intermediate-range ballistic missiles at a range of 380-km. They are deployed in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan.Delivery of the remaining two S-400 squadrons, under the $5.43 billion contract inked in 2018, has been delayed to 2025-26 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.Parallelly, India is developing its own long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system under the ambitious Project Kusha. With an interception range of around 350-km, this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29.Then, there is the Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile (MR-SAM) systems, with an over 70-km range, jointly developed with Israel. After the Navy and IAF, Army in Feb last year operationalized its first `Abhra’ MR-SAM regiment in the 33 Corps, which defends the frontier with China in Sikkim and the Siliguri Corridor.Army and IAF have also inducted the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, with an interception range of 25-km, while a new-generation sleeker version is also now ready for user trials.The armed forces also have a variety of shorter range air defence weapons. These range from the older Russian Igla-1M (5-km), OSA-AK-M (10-km) and Pechora missiles and upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5-km) to the newer Israeli low-level Spyder quick-reaction anti-aircraft missiles (15-km range) and Russian man-portable Igla-S (6-km) systems. DRDO is also testing the indigenous very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS) missiles, which has a range of up to 6-km.","India needs to majorly crank up efforts to make its airspace as impregnable as possible.

Other videos showcase ambulances entering the camp after the IDF withdraws from there.According to residents, Israeli forces have left the immediate area. However, they continue to remain present in the nearby city of Tulkarm.Earlier on Saturday, the IDF said its forces killed 10 'terrorists' and arrested eight wanted suspects during the operation that began on Thursday.According to Palestinian health ministry and news agency Wafa, at least one child and one teenager are among those killed. It said that the IDF has arrested young people en masse and destroyed key infrastructure.Meanwhile, the Palestinian Ministry of Health condemned two separate incidents involving emergency medical crews operating in the West Bank on Saturday.According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health and the Palestine Red Crescent Society, an ambulance driver was killed by Israeli settlers as he attempted to take injured Palestinians to safety, and another ambulance crew was detained and questioned by the IDF outside a hospital in the West Bank.The ministry identified the driver as Mohammed Awad Allah Mohammed Musa (50). It said that Musa worked with the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS). Speaking to CNN, PRCS said that settlers killed him by firing on his ambulance.In a statement, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said, ""The Ministry urgently calls on international health organisations, human rights institutions, and the International Committee of the Red Cross to urgently act to curb the escalating practices of the occupation and settlers against treatment centers and medical crews and to allow them to perform their humanitarian duty.""The Palestinian Ministry of Health called the targeting of medics, ambulances, and medical staff a ""blatant and clear violation of international humanitarian law, according to CNN report.""The targeting of medics, ambulances, treatment centres, and medical staff, obstructing their movement, and preventing them from reaching the wounded, constitutes a blatant and clear violation of international humanitarian law and international norms and treaties,"" the ministry said.On Friday, the Israeli military said that several Palestinian gunmen were killed and four soldiers were wounded during a counter-terrorism raid in the West Bank's Nur Shams refugee camp, close to Tulkarem, The Times of Israel reported.The IDF said its troops and Border Police officers conducted a raid at Nur Shams overnight, during which several wanted Palestinians were detained, explosive devices were discovered, and several gunmen were killed in clashes throughout the morning.",At least 14 people have been killed during the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) operation at the Nur al-Shams refugee camp in the West Bank.

Blinken will be the latest top US official to visit China in a bid to keep ties on an even keel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-will-be-the-latest-top-us-official-to-visit-china-in-a-bid-to-keep-ties-on-an-even-keel/articleshow/109468949.cms,"WASHINGTON: Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to China this coming week as Washington and Beijing try to keep ties on an even keel despite major differences on issues from the path to peace in the Middle East to the supply of synthetic opioids that have heightened fears over global stability.The rivals are at odds on numerous fronts, including Russia's war in Ukraine, Taiwan and the South China Sea, North Korea, Hong Kong, human rights and the detention of American citizens.The United States and China also are battling over trade and commerce issues , with President Joe Biden announcing new tariffs on imports of Chinese steel this past week.The State Department said Saturday that Blinken, on his second visit to China in less than a year, will travel to Shanghai and Beijing starting Wednesday for three days of meetings with senior Chinese officials, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Talks between Blinken and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected, although neither side will confirm such a meeting is happening until shortly before it takes place.The department said in a statement that Blinken would ""discuss a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues,"" including the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.He will also talk about progress made in ""resuming counternarcotics cooperation, military-to-military communication, artificial intelligence, and strengthening people-to-people ties"" and will reaffirm how important it is for the US and China to be ""responsibly managing competition, even in areas where our two countries disagree,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.The trip follows a phone call this month between Biden and Xi in which they pledged to keep high-level contacts open, something they had agreed to last year at a face-to-face summit in California. Since that call, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has visited China and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has spoken by phone with his Chinese counterpart. Meetings at lower levels also have taken place.Despite those encounters, relations are rocky. The US has recently become more vocal in its calls for China to stop supporting Russia's military-industrial sector, which Washington says has allowed Moscow to boost weapons production to support the war against Ukraine.""We see China sharing machine tools, semiconductors, other dual-use items that have helped Russia rebuild the defense industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade,"" Blinken said Friday. ""Now, if China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fueling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War.""Blinken also has pushed for China to take a more active stance in pressing Iran not to escalate tensions in the Middle East. He has spoken to his Chinese counterpart several times since the Israel-Hamas war began six months ago as he has sought China's help in getting Iran to restrain proxy groups it has supported, armed and funded in the region.That topic has taken on new urgency since direct back-and-forth attacks by Iran and Israel on each other's soil in the past week.Also high on the agenda for Blinken will be Taiwan and the South China Sea.The US has strongly condemned Chinese military exercises threatening Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province and vowed to reunify with the mainland by force if necessary. Successive US administrations have steadily ramped up military support and sales for Taipei, much to the anger of Chinese officials.In the South China Sea, the US and others have become increasingly concerned by provocative Chinese actions in and around disputed areas. In particular, the US has voiced objections to what it says are Chinese attempts to thwart legitimate activities by others in the waterway, notably the Philippines and Vietnam.That was a major topic of concern earlier this month when Biden held a three-way summit with the prime minister of Japan and the president of the Philippines.","Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Shanghai and Beijing starting Wednesday.

58 die after boat capsizes in Central Africa: Rescuers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/58-die-after-boat-capsizes-in-central-africa-rescuers/articleshow/109468923.cms,"Unrest and poverty

BANGUI: At least 58 people going to a funeral died after their overloaded river boat capsized in the Central African Republic's capital Bangui, the head of civil protection said on Saturday.""We were able to extract 58 lifeless bodies ,"" Thomas Djimasse told Radio Guira. ""We don't know the total number of people who are underwater.According to witnesses and videos on social media, the wooden boat was carrying more than 300 people -- some standing and others perched on wooden structures - when it sank on the Mpoko river on Friday.The vessel was heading to the funeral of a village chief in Makolo, some 45 kilometres (28 miles) from Bangui, but got into difficulty shortly after setting off from the pier.Rescue services arrived 40 minutes after the disaster.The government did not respond on Saturday but in a speech recorded on Friday and broadcast a day later, government spokesman Maxime Balalou had reported a ""provisional toll of at least 30 dead"".The government sent its condolences to the bereaved families, he said, announcing the opening of an investigation and the setting up of a support system for families of the victims.Maurice Kapenya, who was following the boat in a canoe because there was no space on board , said his own sister was among the bodies of the victims he had recovered.He was helped by local fisherman and residents. Motorbike taxis meanwhile evacuated some of the injured.Driver Francis Maka told AFP he had ""taken more than 10 people to the community hospital ... free of charge, in the face of the tragedy"".With civil protection teams no longer on the scene Saturday, desperate families searching for missing loved ones near the river helped canoe operators they had hired, an AFP journalist observed.Several opposition parties expressed solidarity with the families and called for national mourning.The Central African Republic is ranked by the United Nations as the second least-developed country in the world.A civil war has plagued the former French colony since a Muslim-dominated armed coalition called the Seleka ousted former president Francois Bozize in 2013.The conflict lost intensity from 2018 but the country still suffers bouts of violence by rebel groups or over its resources, which include gold and diamonds.French intervention and deployment of UN peacekeepers paved the way for elections in 2016, which President Faustin Archange Touadera won.Two years later, Touadera brought in fighters from Russia's Wagner mercenary group to help train his armed forces.The country still suffers bouts of violence by rebel groups or over its resources, which include gold and diamonds.In 2020, CAR brought in more Russian operatives as rebel groups advanced on the capital and repelled a siege of Bangui.However, some areas of the country remain outside government control.","Boat carrying more than 300 people capsizes in capital Bangui.

Senate passes reauthorization of key US surveillance program just after midnight deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senate-passes-reauthorization-of-key-us-surveillance-program-just-after-a-midnight-deadline/articleshow/109468862.cms,"WASHINGTON: Barely missing its midnight deadline , the Senate voted early Saturday to reauthorize a key US surveillance law after divisions over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans' data nearly forced the statute to lapse.The legislation approved 60-34 with bipartisan support would extend for two years the program known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.It now goes to President Joe Biden's desk to become law. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden ""will swiftly sign the bill.""""In the nick of time, we are reauthorizing FISA right before it expires at midnight,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said when voting on final passage began 15 minutes before the deadline. ""All day long, we persisted and we persisted in trying to reach a breakthrough and in the end, we have succeeded.""US officials have said the surveillance tool, first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since then, is crucial in disrupting terror attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage and has also produced intelligence that the US has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri.""If you miss a key piece of intelligence, you may miss some event overseas or put troops in harm's way,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said. ""You may miss a plot to harm the country here, domestically, or somewhere else. So in this particular case, there's real-life implications.""The proposal would renew the program, which permits the US government to collect without a warrant the communications of non-Americans located outside the country to gather foreign intelligence. The reauthorization faced a long and bumpy road to final passage Friday after months of clashes between privacy advocates and national security hawks pushed consideration of the legislation to the brink of expiration.Though the spy program was technically set to expire at midnight, the Biden administration had said it expected its authority to collect intelligence to remain operational for at least another year, thanks to an opinion earlier this month from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which receives surveillance applications.Still, officials had said that court approval shouldn't be a substitute for congressional authorization, especially since communications companies could cease cooperation with the government if the program is allowed to lapse.Hours before the law was set to expire, US officials were already scrambling after two major US communication providers said they would stop complying with orders through the surveillance program, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.Attorney General Merrick Garland praised the reauthorization and reiterated how ""indispensable"" the tool is to the Justice Department.""This reauthorization of Section 702 gives the United States the authority to continue to collect foreign intelligence information about non-US persons located outside the United States, while at the same time codifying important reforms the Justice Department has adopted to ensure the protection of Americans' privacy and civil liberties,"" Garland said in a statement Saturday.But despite the Biden administration's urging and classified briefings to senators this week on the crucial role they say the spy program plays in protecting national security, a group of progressive and conservative lawmakers who were agitating for further changes had refused to accept the version of the bill the House sent over last week.The lawmakers had demanded that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer allow votes on amendments to the legislation that would seek to address what they see as civil liberty loopholes in the bill. In the end, Schumer was able to cut a deal that would allow critics to receive floor votes on their amendments in exchange for speeding up the process for passage.The six amendments ultimately failed to garner the necessary support on the floor to be included in the final passage.One of the major changes detractors had proposed centered around restricting the FBI's access to information about Americans through the program. Though the surveillance tool only targets non-Americans in other countries, it also collects communications of Americans when they are in contact with those targeted foreigners. Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, had been pushing a proposal that would require US officials to get a warrant before accessing American communications.""If the government wants to spy on my private communications or the private communications of any American, they should be required to get approval from a judge, just as our Founding Fathers intended in writing the Constitution,"" Durbin said.In the past year, US officials have revealed a series of abuses and mistakes by FBI analysts in improperly querying the intelligence repository for information about Americans or others in the US, including a member of Congress and participants in the racial justice protests of 2020 and the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol.But members on both the House and Senate intelligence committees as well as the Justice Department warned requiring a warrant would severely handicap officials from quickly responding to imminent national security threats.""I think that is a risk that we cannot afford to take with the vast array of challenges our nation faces around the world,"" Democratic Senator Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Friday.","White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan says Biden ""will swiftly sign the bill"" The legislation approved 60-34 with bipartisan support would extend for two years the program.

NEW DELHI: One person died while seven others were reported missing on Sunday following a presumed accident overnight involving two Japanese military helicopters at sea, according to officials.A spokesperson for Japan 's Self-Defense Force (SDF) confirmed the incident late Saturday, confirming that one person was initially rescued but later confirmed deceased.Defense minister Minoru Kihara said that rescuers identified potential remnants of the aircraft in the sea, indicating a probable collision between the two helicopters. Kihara emphasized the current lack of clarity regarding the cause but underscored the priority of life-saving efforts.The helicopters were engaged in nighttime drills targeting submarine threats, Kihara informed. However, he later updated that the rescued crew member was tragically confirmed dead.Flight recorders were recovered by the ministry for analysis, including the possibility of a collision as a contributing factor to the incident.The helicopters are believed to have crashed during training off the Izu Islands in the Pacific Ocean, as reported by NHK. Communication with one helicopter was severed at 10:38 pm (1338 GMT) near Torishima Island, followed by an emergency signal one minute later. Approximately 25 minutes later, communication with the other aircraft was also lost in the same vicinity.The Mitsubishi SH-60K helicopters from the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) primarily operate from naval destroyers. NHK reported that given the absence of other aircraft or vessels nearby, the involvement of another nation in the incident seems improbable.Japan's bolstered defense spending and increased cooperation with the United States and other Asian countries come in response to escalating Chinese assertiveness and the unpredictable North Korean situation in the region.Last April, a Japanese army helicopter carrying 10 individuals crashed off Miyako Island in southern Okinawa, resulting in no survivors. Similarly, in January 2022, a Japanese fighter jet crashed off the central Ishikawa region, claiming the lives of two pilots.In a previous incident in 2019, an F-35A stealth jet crashed into the sea post-takeoff from northeastern Japan during a training mission, resulting in the pilot's death due to apparent spatial disorientation.Moreover, in November of the same year, a US military Osprey aircraft crashed off Japan, claiming the lives of all eight individuals on board, marking another tragic episode in a series of fatal accidents. Subsequently, the United States and Japan decided to ground their fleets of the same aircraft.","Two Japanese military helicopters are believed to have crashed during training off the Izu Islands in the Pacific Ocean.

'Our tax dollars': Elon Musk on irony of US and Israel-Iran conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/our-tax-dollars-elon-musk-on-irony-of-us-and-israel-iran-conflict/articleshow/109461598.cms,"History of F-14 Tomcats in Iran

Impact of the 1979 Islamic Revolution

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has commented on Israel 's strike on an Iranian airbase, critiquing the irony of US funds being used to attack American-made aircraft in Iran. These aircraft, F-14 Tomcats , were sold to Iran during the Shah's regime before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Last Friday's strike targeted Isfahan Airbase, home to the F-14 fleet, amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.This military action follows a week after Iran's extensive assault on Israel using drones and missiles, a retaliation for what Tehran claims was an Israeli attack on its consulate in Damascus.The F-14s, discontinued in the US in 2006, have been a significant part of Iran's military history , notably during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. Despite their age, these jets have struggled with maintenance issues due to the unavailability of spare parts.Musk highlighted the paradox of the situation on social media, saying, ""our tax dollars somehow also blowing up our tax dollars."" He also expressed a broader concern about global conflicts, suggesting a more peaceful and exploratory use of technology: ""we should send rockets not at each other, but rather to the stars.""Israel, a major recipient of US military aid, continues to be a pivotal American ally in the Middle East. This relationship includes significant financial assistance and collaborative defense projects like the Iron Dome and the F-35 fighter program. The US Congress is currently deliberating a foreign aid package that includes substantial aid for Israel, alongside aid for Ukraine and humanitarian efforts in Gaza.The F-14 Tomcat, a supersonic, twin-engine, two-seat, variable-sweep wing fighter aircraft, was introduced by the US Navy in the 1970s and became one of the most iconic jet fighters due to its advanced technology and unique capabilities. Iran's acquisition and use of the F-14 Tomcats is a unique chapter in military aviation history.Iran purchased F-14 Tomcats from the United States during the 1970s when the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was seeking to modernize the country's armed forces. The deal was part of the Shah's broader military expansion strategy, supported by the US, aimed at making Iran the dominant military power in the Gulf region. Iran received its first F-14s in 1976 and became the only country other than the United States to operate them.The 1979 Islamic Revolution marked a significant turning point for Iran's F-14 fleet. The overthrow of the Shah led to a new Islamic Republic government that was immediately subjected to international sanctions and embargoes. These restrictions severely impacted the maintenance and operational capability of the F-14s, as the US cut off military support and spare parts.Despite these challenges, Iran used its F-14s extensively during the Iran-Iraq War from 1980 to 1988. The aircraft were crucial in defending Iranian airspace against Iraqi air strikes and in conducting reconnaissance missions. The Tomcats achieved a number of aerial victories during the war. However, the lack of spare parts and maintenance support gradually eroded the operational effectiveness of the fleet.After the war, Iran faced ongoing challenges in keeping its F-14s airworthy due to the embargo on military parts. Ingeniously, Iran resorted to reverse engineering and domestic production of parts to maintain its fleet. Over the years, there have been reports of various upgrades to their avionics and armaments, integrating domestic and possibly foreign technology not originally part of the F-14s.Today, the F-14 remains a symbol of Iran's resilience in maintaining a complex weapons system under sanctions. Although their numbers have dwindled and their original capabilities might be degraded, the F-14s continue to be a significant part of Iran's air defense strategy.","Musk highlighted the paradox of the situation on social media, saying, ""our tax dollars somehow also blowing up our tax dollars."" He also expressed a broader concern about global conflicts, suggesting a more peaceful and exploratory use of technology. Iran's acquisition and use of the F-14 Tomcats is a unique chapter in military aviation history.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109461711,imgsize-15680,width-400,resizemode-4/109461711.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A WZ-7 Soaring Dragon drone belonging to the Chinese People's Liberation Army was spotted flying in close proximity to the Philippines, ahead of preparations by the Southeast Asian country to receive the delivery of Indian BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, The Eurasian Times reported.The drone's distinctive joined-wing shape caught the attention of Raffy Tima , a correspondent for Philippine news organization GMA News, as it traversed the skies over the West Philippine Sea.This sighting comes amidst escalating tensions between China and the Philippines over territorial disputes in the South China Sea , notably at the Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal. The timing is particularly significant as the Philippines prepares to receive the delivery of Indian BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, perceived as a strategic move to bolster defensive capabilities against China's assertiveness in the region.Procured under the 'Horizon 2' Priority Projects aimed at modernizing the Philippine armed forces, the BrahMos missile system arrived in Manila on April 19. The delivery, facilitated through a government-to-government (G2G) deal, includes three missile batteries, operator and maintainer training, and an Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package.The coincidence of the WZ-7 drone sighting with the arrival of Indian transport planes carrying the BrahMos missiles raises eyebrows. This occurrence precedes the commencement of the 'Balikatan 2024' drills between the Philippines and the US.The WZ-7, operated by the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), boasts a service ceiling of over 60,000 feet and a range of about 4,350 miles. Its sighting near the Philippines echoes previous instances of its presence near Taiwan amid tensions between China and the island.As military exercises loom, with activities including target ship sinking and island reclamation, the deployment of the new Typhon ground-based missile system by the US on the northern Philippine island of Luzon raises concerns for China.",A WZ-7 Soaring Dragon drone belonging to the Chinese People's Liberation Army was spotted flying in close proximity to the Philippines.

H5N1 bird flu strain detected in milk: WHO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h5n1-bird-flu-strain-detected-in-milk-who/articleshow/109438308.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday announced that the H5N1 bird flu virus strain had been found in significant quantities in raw milk from infected animals , though the duration of the virus's survival in milk remains unknown.Earlier in 1996, Avian influenza A(H5N1) initially surfaced, but since 2020, there has been a remarkable surge in outbreaks among birds, with an increasing number of mammals also falling victim to the disease.This has resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, along with infections in wild birds, as well as land and marine mammals.Last month, cows and goats were added to the list of affected animals, surprising experts who previously didn't consider them susceptible to this strain of influenza. The outbreak of bird flu in cow has affected at least 13 herds in six states, as per the New York Times.The reports of sick cows began to emerge in Texas and New Mexico. Dead birds were also found on some of these farms, and laboratory testing confirmed that some cows were infected with bird flu.Earlier this month, US authorities reported a case of a person recovering from bird flu after exposure to infected cattle on a Texas dairy farm.""The case in Texas is the first case of a human infected by avian influenza by a cow,"" said Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health Organization.""Bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow and cow-to-bird transmission have also been registered during these current outbreaks, which suggest that the virus may have found other routes of transition than we previously understood,"" she told a media briefing in Geneva.This incident marks only the second case of human infection with bird flu in the United States, following illnesses in herds apparently exposed to wild birds.""Now we see multiple herds of cows affected in an increasing number of US states, which shows a further step of the virus spillover to mammals,"" Zhang said.""The virus has also been detected in milk from infected animals.""Zhang said there was a ""very high virus concentration in raw milk"", but experts were still investigating exactly how long the virus is able to survive in milk.The Texas health department assured that infected cattle do not pose a threat to the commercial milk supply since dairies are mandated to discard milk from sick cows, and pasteurization effectively kills the virus.""It is important for people to ensure safe food practices, including consuming only pasteurised milk and milk products,"" said Zhang.(With inputs from agency)","The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday announced that the H5N1 bird flu virus strain had been found in significant quantities in raw milk from infected animals.

Israel

Taiwan, TikTok

WASHINGTON: The US House of Representatives on Saturday approved a giant aid package for Ukraine , Israel and Taiwan and a bill threatening to ban TikTok.Here is a breakdown of the $95 billion package, which now moves to the Senate, where it could be taken up as early as Tuesday.The majority of funds in the package, nearly $61 billion, are earmarked for Ukraine's war effort against the Russian invasion.President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pleading for this money for months, warning that ""if Congress does not help Ukraine, Ukraine will lose the war.""Washington is Kyiv's main military supporter, but Congress has not passed a major aid package for its ally since December 2022 due to partisan squabbling.The bill passed Saturday would provide nearly $14 billion to train, equip and finance the needs of the Ukrainian army.Ukraine would also receive $10 billion in ""forgivable loans"" for vital economic and budgetary support, including for the energy and infrastructure sectors.The idea of a loan, rather than a grant, was suggested by former president Donald Trump, who believes the United States should stop handing out money without any payback. A ""forgivable loan"" can be partly or fully forgiven or deferred under certain conditions.A large chunk of this money will also go to replenishing US military stockpiles.The bill also authorizes the US president to confiscate and sell Russian assets in order to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine, an idea that is also gaining traction with other G7 countries.The United States' historic ally Israel will receive $13 billion in military assistance as it fights Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.These funds will be used in particular to strengthen Israel's Iron Dome air defense system.More than $9 billion will be spent to address ""the dire need for humanitarian assistance for Gaza as well as other vulnerable populations around the world.""The measure, however, would prohibit any direct US funding of the UN crisis-hit Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA). Israel has accused some of the agency employees in Gaza of involvement in the shocking October 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas, which triggered the war.The bill would provide some $8 billion to counter China through investment in submarine infrastructure and boosting competition with Chinese projects in developing countries.The bill also earmarks several billion dollars in weapons funding for Taiwan, a self-ruled island that is claimed by China.Another bill passed Saturday would force TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company ByteDance or face a nationwide ban in the United States.American officials have voiced alarm over the popularity of TikTok with young people, alleging that it is subservient to Beijing and a conduit to spread propaganda, claims denied by the company and Beijing.","US House approves $95 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

NEW DELHI: The House of Representatives has approved legislation that would ban TikTok in the United States unless its Chinese owner sells its stake in the company within a year. The inclusion of TikTok in a broader foreign aid package by House Republicans, which is a priority for President Joe Biden and has widespread congressional support for countries like Ukraine and Israel, accelerated the process of the ban.The initial version of the bill had faced a roadblock in the Senate before this move.Earlier, a standalone bill with a six-month deadline for selling TikTok had received overwhelming bipartisan support in the House back in March. Both Democrats and Republicans had expressed concerns about national security due to the app's ownership by the Chinese tech company ByteDance Ltd. The revised legislation will now head to the Senate.Even if the bill is enacted into law, ByteDance would still have up to a year to find a buyer and is likely to challenge the law in court, arguing that it infringes on the First Amendment rights of its millions of users.ByteDance has vehemently opposed the legislation and urged its 170 million US users, many of whom are young, to contact Congress and voice their opposition. However, this pushback has not been well-received by lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who are deeply concerned about Chinese threats to the United States and have limited presence on the platform themselves.The House also passed provisions to support Ukraine, strengthen Taiwan, and approved a significant amount of military aid to Israel. These bills received strong bipartisan backing during a rare Saturday session, although they have raised questions about the future of House Speaker Mike Johnson as he faces challenges from right-wing critics.The aid for Israel comes as the country is engaged in a conflict with Hamas despite international concerns for civilian well-being in Gaza. The bill, set to be taken up by the Senate soon, primarily focuses on bolstering Israel's Iron Dome air defense system.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the long-awaited aid package, emphasizing the lifesaving impact it would have. The bills are the result of contentious negotiations, pressure from US allies, and repeated appeals for assistance from Zelenskyy. The funding for Ukraine has been a point of contention in Congress, with disagreements between parties delaying approval for over a year.President Biden and Democratic lawmakers have been advocating for substantial military support for Ukraine, while Republicans, influenced by former President Donald Trump, have been hesitant to allocate funds for the conflict. The recent $61 billion package for Ukraine, which includes economic aid and weapons support, has finally garnered support from Speaker Johnson after much deliberation.The bill also enables the confiscation and sale of Russian assets to provide further financial assistance to Ukraine for reconstruction, a move endorsed by other G7 nations. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer indicated that the bill could be taken up for consideration as early as Tuesday.",The House of Representatives has approved legislation that would ban TikTok in the United States unless its Chinese owner sells its stake in the company within a year.

The move, Washington stressed, is intended not to punish but to bring about a “positive change in behaviour”.According to a US State Department announcement on Friday, the four firms are Belarus’s Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant, and China’s Xi’an Longde Technology Development Company Ltd, Tianjin Creative Source International Trade Co Ltd, and Granpect Company Ltd.“All property of the designated entities in the US or under the control of US persons are now blocked. Furthermore, any individuals or entities with ownership, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more by the designated persons are also subject to these sanctions,” read a statement by the State Department, adding these entities supplied items even for Pakistan’s long-range missiles.Islamabad appeared to shrug off the action, saying such “listings of commercial entities have taken place in the past as well on allegations of links to its missile programme without sharing any evidence whatsoever”.“While we are not aware of the specifics of the latest measures by the US, in the past we have come across many instances where listings have been made on mere suspicion or even when the involved items were not on any control lists but were deemed sensitive under catch-all provisions,” read a statement issued by Pakistan’s foreign office.The US State Department statement detailed the alleged inputs from the four firms. Belarus’s Minsk plant supplied special vehicle chassis. Such chassis, the US claimed, are used as launch-support equipment by Pakistan’s National Development Complex (NDC), which develops Missile Technology Control Regime Category (MTCR) I ballistic missiles.China’s Xi’an Longde Technology allegedly supplied a filament-winding machine, adding these can be used to produce rocket motor cases, the US said. Tianjin Creative Trade Co. Ltd. shipped stir-welding equipment. The supplies were likely destined for Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), which develops and produces Pakistan’s MTCR Category I ballistic missiles, the US said.Granpect Company worked with SUPARCO to supply equipment for the testing of large-diameter rocket motors to NDC, the State Department added.Islamabad defended such procurements. “Such items have legitimate civil commercial uses. Pakistan has always been ready to discuss end-use and end-user verification mechanisms so that legitimate commercial users are not hurt by discriminatory application of export controls,” the foreign office said in its statement.Pakistan also insinuated double standards in such sanctions. “The same jurisdictions, which claim to exercise strict non-proliferation controls, have waived licensing requirements for advanced military technologies for some countries... leading to arms build-up,” the statement added.","US imposes sanctions on three Chinese and one Belarus company over alleged supply of inputs for Pakistan’s ballistic missile programme.

NEW DELHI: A van carry five Japanese autoworkers was targeted in a suicide attack in Karachi . The bomber was wearing an explosive-laden vest and the blast injured three by-standers.The spokesperson, Abrar Hussain Baloch, announced that the Japanese individuals have been relocated to a secure location under police protection, despite injuries sustained by bystanders and a guard accompanying the visitors.Baloch stated, ""The police mobile unit, which was nearby, responded to the attackers quickly and the security guards of the foreign guests responded immediately.""According to Pakistani counter-terrorism official Raja Umar Khatab, one of the two attackers on motorcycles detonated explosives strapped to his body as soon as the vehicle slowed down, but failed to hit the intended target.Khatab reported, ""I think he fired some 15 or 16 shots,"" and added that the attackers were killed by the foreigners ' private security guards and a nearby police patrol who returned fire. He also mentioned that the assailants had trailed the Japanese group's vehicle for a while before the attack, leading authorities to believe they had conducted reconnaissance to identify the target and the location of the attack.According to local police chief Arshad Awan, the five Japanese nationals were employed at Pakistan Suzuki Motors in an industrial region, where the vehicle was headed. He noted that the assault also led to the deaths of twoterrorists involved in the attack and caused damage to another vehicle nearby.“All the Japanese who were the target of the attack are safe,” he said.Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, informed the press in Tokyo that one Japanese citizen was verified to have been injured, and the government was gathering more information while cautioning other Japanese nationals in Pakistan about potential risks.Both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan condemned the attack on the Japanese nationals. They complimented the police in different statements for their prompt action in stopping the attack. They also prayed for the quick recovery of those injured in the incident and pledged to eradicate terrorism.Although no one took credit for the incident right away, suspicions will probably point to the Pakistani Taliban or a minor separatist organization that has increased its attacks on security personnel in recent years. Chinese workers in Pakistan engaged in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which encompasses numerous megaprojects including building roads, power plants, and agricultural fields, have also been targeted by insurgents.In March, five Chinese nationals along with their Pakistani driver were killed after a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle into their convoy in northwest Pakistan.Their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine off the mountainous Karakoram Highway after the bomber rammed his car into them and detonated his explosives, police said.",A van carry five Japanese autoworkers was targeted in a suicide attack in Karachi.

Pakistan's anti-corruption agency clears Nawaz Sharif in Toshakhana vehicle case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-anti-corruption-agency-clears-nawaz-sharif-in-toshakhana-vehicle-case/articleshow/109370202.cms,"KARACHI: The National Accountability Bureau ( NAB ) has granted a clean chit to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the Toshakhana vehicle reference, Dawn reported.The Toshakhana is a government department tasked with storing gifts bestowed upon rulers, parliamentarians, bureaucrats, and officials by foreign heads of state and dignitaries.According to NAB's allegations, then-Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilpurportedly facilitated the retention of vehicles gifted to Nawaz Sharif and then-President Asif Ali Zardari by foreign states and dignitaries.This allegedly occurred through the relaxation of procedures related to gift submission to Toshakhana, aiming to confer illegal benefits to Nawaz and Zardari, as reported by Dawn.The accused purportedly retained these vehicles ""through dishonest and illegal means for their personal benefit and interest,"" the reference stated, allowing them to keep the vehicles by paying a nominal fee of 15 per cent of the total value.In June 2020, an accountability court issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Nawaz Sharif, who was abroad at the time. He challenged the warrants in the Islamabad High Court but withdrew the petition shortly after.Subsequently, in September 2020, Nawaz Sharif was declared a proclaimed offender in the case, prompting an accountability court to initiate processes for the confiscation of his properties and directing NAB to pursue his arrest through Interpol.However, prior to his return to Pakistan in October of the same year, an accountability court suspended the perpetual arrest warrants against Nawaz Sharif, granting him bail shortly afterward.In November, NAB informed a Lahore accountability court that it had recorded Nawaz Sharif's statement in the reference, according to Dawn.Today, NAB submitted a report to an Islamabad accountability court following orders to have Nawaz Sharif join the investigation. The report indicated that the vehicle in question, gifted to Nawaz by the government of Saudi Arabia in 1997, was initially submitted to Toshakhana. However, it was later included in the federal transport pool.The report clarified that Nawaz Sharif purchased the vehicle from the federal transport pool, not Toshakhana, in 2008. Therefore, NAB concluded that the case lacked relevance to Toshakhana benefits since the vehicle was not part of Toshakhana when Nawaz acquired it.Consequently, NAB urged the accountability court to acquit or discharge Nawaz Sharif from the reference, Dawn reported.","The National Accountability Bureau ( NAB ) has granted a clean chit to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the Toshakhana vehicle reference.

He added that convicted leaders of the group and veteran fighters in Afghanistan were recruiting and training new members.Jemaah Islamiyah is responsible for several attacks inside Indonesia, namely, the 2002 bombings on the resort island of Bali that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists.

Suu Kyi moved to house arrest due to heat: Military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/suu-kyi-moved-to-house-arrest-due-to-heat-military/articleshow/109384503.cms,"BANGKOK: Myanmar 's jailed former leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been moved from prison to house arrest as a health measure due to a heat wave, the military govt said as it freed more than 3,000 prisoners under an amnesty to mark this week's New Year holiday.Suu Kyi, 78, and Win Myint, the 72-year-old former prez of her ousted govt, were among the elderly and infirm prisoners moved to house arrest because of the severe heat, military spokesperson Maj Gen Zaw Min Tun told foreign media representatives late Tuesday.Suu Kyi's transfer comes as the army has suffered a string of major defeats at the hands of pro-democracy resistance fighters and their allies in ethnic minority guerrilla forces.Suu Kyi has been serving a 27-year prison term in a specially built annex of the main prison in Naypyitaw, where Myanmar's meteorological department said temperatures reached 39C on Tuesday and is expected to hit 41C on Wednesday, with even hotter weather forecast for the coming week.It was not immediately clear how long Suu Kyi would be allowed to remain under house arrest beyond the heatwave, or whether the move represented an official reduction in her sentence.Local media reported that during her months-long trial, Suu Kyi had suffered dizzy spells, vomiting and at times had been unable to eat because of a tooth infection. Her son Kim Aris said in Feb that she was still being held at the special compound in Naypyidaw. The compound had no air conditioning in searing heat and the concrete cells leaked during the monsoon, according to Australian economist Sean Turnell, a former advisor to Suu Kyi's govt who was also detained there.","Suu Kyi, 78, and Win Myint, 72, among the elderly and infirm prisoners moved to house arrest.
