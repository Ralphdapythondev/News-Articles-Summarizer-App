How Texas abortion ban in fact led to rise in infant mortality and birth defects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-texas-abortion-ban-in-fact-led-to-rise-in-infant-mortality-and-birth-defects/articleshow/111245303.cms,"A recent study from Johns Hopkins University reveals that Texas has experienced a rise in infant mortality and birth defects following the implementation of its abortion ban in September 2021.The research, which was published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found that Texas saw an 8% increase in its infant mortality rate in 2022, compared to a 2% increase in the rest of the United States. This amounted to 216 more infant deaths than expected from March to December of the following year.The study compared infant deaths in Texas with those in 28 other states, some of which also have abortion restrictions. Specifically, Texas saw a 23% increase in the number of deaths caused by birth defects, while the rest of the US experienced a 3% decrease. The Texas law prohibits abortions after detecting cardiac activity, usually at around five to six weeks into pregnancy, before most tests for fetal abnormalities can be conducted.Alison Gemmill, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, author of the study, told USA Today about the negative of abortion ban. She said, “It just points to some of the devastating consequences of abortion bans that maybe people weren't thinking about when they passed these laws.” She also referred to the fatalities that occurred after the implementation of the Texas heartbeat law as the ""spillover effects on moms and babies.""“I think these findings make clear the potentially devastating consequences that abortion bans can have,” said Suzanne Bell, a fertility researcher and co-author of the study, quoted by AP.Bell noted that infant deaths are relatively rare, so the team was somewhat surprised by the findings. Due to the small number of cases, the researchers could not analyze the data to see if the rates were higher among certain races or socioeconomic groups.The research team also indicated an unexpected factor due to limited data preventing them from breaking down the rates for different population groups, such as racial or socioeconomic demographics. However, this was not a surprise for experts like Tiffany Green, who have extensively studied racial inequities in reproductive health.Although the findings are significant, Bell mentioned that the small numbers involved made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions for specific subpopulations. This complexity underscores the necessity for further research and resources to understand and address the broader impacts of such policies.Green emphasized the vulnerability of individuals who typically seek abortions, pointing out that restrictive abortion laws could compound existing health disparities.Texas governor Greg Abbott's spokesperson, Andrew Mahaleris, responded to the study's conclusions by standing by Texas's anti-abortion legislation in a statement to USA Today. He highlighted the 2021 heartbeat law, stating its purpose was ""to save the innocent unborn, and now thousands of children have been given a chance at life.""","The study compared infant deaths in Texas with those in 28 other states, some of which also have abortion restrictions.

Israel PM Netanyahu faces anger from hostage families over ceasefire dismissal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-pm-netanyahu-faces-anger-from-hostage-families-over-ceasefire-dismissal/articleshow/111244956.cms,"NEW DELHI: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is still committed to the ceasefire and hostage release plan as the families released a new video on Monday showing the condition of three Israeli hostages , who were shoved, bloodied, and terrified.""We are committed to the Israeli proposal that President Biden welcomed. Our position has not changed. The second thing, which does not contradict the first, we will not end the war until we eliminate Hamas ,"" Netanyahu said in a speech to parliament.His statement came after facing an angry backlash from Israeli politicians and a group representing Israel’s hostages and their families who felt that the PM will make a partial deal with Hamas to return only some hostages from Gaza.On a local channel, Netanyahu expressed his willingness to strike ""a partial deal"" with Hamas, which would only involve the repatriation of a few hostages from Gaza. This stance contradicts the proposal that had been endorsed by his own war cabinet, according to CNN.US President Joe Biden presented a plan last month that delineates prerequisites aimed at securing the freedom of all remaining captives in exchange for a lasting truce and the pullout of Israeli troops from Gaza.The families, together with the hostages and missing families forum released a video on Monday where all three hostages, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eliya Cohen, 26, and Or Levy, 33, who were abducted on October 7, were being driven along a tree-lined road in southern Israel by militants wielding assault weapons.The families of the young men, desperate for PM Netanyahu to agree to a hostage deal with Islamist group Hamas, approved its publication in the media.Levy, Cohen, and Goldberg-Polin were among the attendees of the Nova music festival in southern Israel when the Hamas-led assault occurred. Tragically, Levy's wife was killed during the attack, while Cohen's girlfriend survived despite being buried under a pile of bodies.In the video, Goldberg-Polin, having lost part of his left arm earlier, sits in the back of the pickup truck, covered in blood. The footage alternates between the wounded hostages and their cheering captors as the truck speeds along a narrow road under a clear blue sky.The attack on October 7 triggered the war in Gaza, which has been ongoing for nearly nine months. Attempts to establish a ceasefire and secure the release of approximately 120 hostages still in captivity have been unsuccessful.Jon Polin, Goldberg-Polin's father, stated that they first viewed this latest video of his abduction a week ago, and its release was intended to remind the world about the captives whose lives hang in the balance. He expressed the desire to urge world leaders to take action and secure the release of the hostages.Netanyahu responded to the video, acknowledging the heartbreak it causes and emphasizing the cruelty of the enemy they have vowed to defeat. He pledged not to end the war until all 120 loved ones are brought home safely.After Israeli's PM statement, Israel's military also issued a statement from a situational assessment by its chief of staff in the area of Rafah, where Israeli forces have been fighting Hamas' remaining battalions.""We are clearly approaching the point where we can say we have dismantled the Rafah Brigade, that it is defeated not in the sense that there are no more terrorists, but in the sense that it can no longer function as a fighting unit,"" said Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi.Hamas's deputy chief in Gaza, Khalil Al-Hayya, said: ""We are a people on its land and a resistance (group) defending its land. If the occupation (Israel) announces it is achieving its goals, let it do so and let it say what it wants and the field can validate and falsify.""He added: ""If Israel wants to convince itself that it is done, it should exit the strip,"" in response to a question about the Israeli army's remarks on dismantling Hamas during an interview with the Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV on Monday.(With inputs from agency)","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is still committed to the ceasefire and hostage release plan.

Luxury yacht crew sparks devastating wildfire on one of Jeff Bezos’ favourite islands; over 70 acres of forest destroyed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/luxury-yacht-crew-sparks-devastating-wildfire-on-one-of-jeff-bezos-favourite-islands-over-70-acres-of-forest-destroyed/articleshow/111245222.cms,"This is an AI-generated image (Pic credit: Copilot)

A group of workers and passengers on a luxurious yacht called the Persefoni I was taken into custody for allegedly triggering a devastating wildfire on the Greek island of Hydra.

The incident occurred on Friday night, just days after Jeff Bezos , his fiancee Lauren Sanchez, and his son Preston had celebrated Father's Day on the island, which is known to be one of Bezos' preferred destinations, according to a report from New York Post.

According to local reports, the crew members had set off fireworks to amuse the guests onboard, despite the US Embassy and Consulate in Greece issuing a Natural Disaster Alert earlier that day, cautioning the public about the high risk of wildfires due to the extreme temperatures in the region. The resulting blaze destroyed over 70 acres of forest on the island.

The accused individuals were arrested when they docked near Athens on Saturday. They have denied any involvement in the incident. Greece has recently strengthened its laws and penalties related to arson, with offenders facing up to 20 years in prison and a substantial fine exceeding $200,000.

Hydra Island has long been a favoured destination for celebrities, known for its ability to inspire various artists and musicians, including the likes of Leonard Cohen and Picasso.

Hajj deaths put spotlight on underworld of illicit tour operators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hajj-deaths-put-spotlight-on-underworld-of-illicit-tour-operators/articleshow/111244710.cms,"CAIRO: More than 1,300 people died making the Islamic pilgrimage of haj in Saudi Arabia this month, the vast majority of whom the Saudi govt said did not have permits. Many walked for miles in scorching heat as high as 51.8 degrees Celsius after paying thousands of dollars to illicit tour operators.The fatalities included 660 Egyptians, 165 from Indonesia, 98 from India and dozens more from Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and Malaysia, according to an AP tally. Two US citizens also died.While pilgrims with permits are transported around Mecca in air-conditioned buses and rest in air-conditioned tents, unregistered ones are often exposed to the elements.On Sunday, Saudi health minister Fahd bin Abdurrahman Al-Jalajel said 83% of the 1,301 reported deaths involved pilgrims who lacked permits.With nearly 2 million participating each year, it is not unusual for pilgrims to die from heat stress, illness or chronic disease. But it is unclear if the number of deaths this year was higher than usual, because Saudi does not regularly report those statistics.But as so many of those who died had no permits, this year's toll exposed an underworld of illicit tour operators and smugglers who profit off Muslims desperate to make the journey. An estimated 400,000 undocumented people tried to perform haj this year, a senior Saudi official told AFP.Haj tour operators, pilgrims and relatives of the dead described easily exploited loopholes that allow people to travel to the kingdom with a tourist or visitor visa before haj. Once they arrive, they find illegal brokers and smugglers who offer their services, take their money and sometimes abandon them to fend for themselves, they said.The number of unregistered pilgrims appeared to have been driven up this year by rising economic desperation in countries such as Egypt and Jordan. An official haj package can cost more than $5,000 or $10,000, depending on a pilgrim's country of origin - far beyond the means of many.One unregistered pilgrim who died was Safaa al-Tawab from the Egyptian city of Luxor. Al-Tawab, 55, had not been able to obtain a haj permit but found an Egyptian tour company to take her for around $3,000, her brother Ahmed said. After she arrived, she told relatives she had been put in inadequate housing and prevented from going outside. Although the tour operator had promised air-conditioned buses, she found herself walking for miles in the heat, her brother said. She died midway through the pilgrimage, but when her brother contacted a representative from the tour company, he assured him she was fine, then turned off his phone. Even for the young and fit, haj is a physically challenging event, and many pilgrims are elderly or ailing by the time they can make the journey. Some believe the hajj might be their final rite, and that dying in Mecca will confer great blessings.","More than 1,300 people died making the Islamic pilgrimage of haj in Saudi Arabia this month.

Netanyahu also signalled that there is no end in sight for the grinding war in Gaza. The current phase of the war ""is about to end,"" Netanyahu said. ""That doesn't mean the war is about to end.""Netanyahu said in a lengthy interview that while the army is close to completing its ground offensive in Rafah, that would not mean the war against Hamas is over. But he said fewer troops would be needed in Gaza, freeing up forces to battle Hezbollah.The Iranian-backed Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct 7 attack that triggered the Gaza war. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire nearly every day since then, but the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears of a full-blown war.Netanyahu said he hoped a diplomatic solution to the crisis could be found but vowed to solve the problem ""in a different way"" if needed. ""We can fight on several fronts and we are prepared to do that.""Hezbollah warned Israel last week against launching war on Lebanon's front, saying it has new weapons and intelligence capabilities that could help it target critical positions deeper inside Israel.Hezbollah already has unveiled new weapons during the low-level fighting, including hard-to-defend attack drones that strike with little warning.

Where is Melania Trump? Former first lady's elusive presence on US 2024 campaign trail sparks curiosity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/where-is-melania-trump-former-first-ladys-elusive-presence-on-us-2024-campaign-trail-sparks-curiosity/articleshow/111216727.cms,"Following her conspicuous absence from pivotal events in her husband's presidential bid , former First Lady Melania Trump has become the center of media speculation. Her minimal public appearances this year have fueled curiosity about her role in Donald Trump 's 2024 campaign.Earlier in the year, Melania missed key events such as the campaign kickoff in Iowa and the Super Tuesday victory party. When asked in March about her future involvement, she coyly responded, “Stay tuned.” Since then, she has kept a low profile, only attending a few fundraisers in April and her son Barron's high school graduation.Significantly, Melania was absent during Donald Trump’s hush money trial in New York. She did not accompany him on any of the trial days, was absent for the guilty verdict, his subsequent remarks at Trump Tower, his 78th birthday celebration, and several campaign rallies.Katherine Jellison, a history professor at Ohio University specializing in first ladies, remarked that Melania's behavior, while unusual, is not entirely surprising. “As First Lady, she kept a low profile and was not very active in his 2020 campaign,” Jellison noted. She highlighted that the Trumps often deviate from traditional political norms.Unlike Melania, other political spouses have been active in supporting their partners' campaigns. Casey DeSantis, wife of Florida Gov Ron DeSantis, was heavily involved in his primary bid, and Dr Apoorva Ramaswamy, wife of Vivek Ramaswamy, often appeared on the campaign trail with their children.Efforts to reach Melania Trump for comments have been unsuccessful. She has made only one recent public statement regarding her son's selection as a delegate for the Republican National Convention, citing his prior commitments as the reason he could not attend.During Donald Trump’s trial, reporters repeatedly questioned his wife’s absence. Trump’s attorney, Todd Blanche, avoided the topic, focusing instead on the challenging nature of the case. Testimony during the trial included sensitive details about Trump's alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, which reportedly concerned him more for its potential impact on his 2016 campaign than on his marriage.Despite her absence, Trump frequently mentions Melania in his speeches, portraying her as an active, albeit behind-the-scenes, supporter. Larry Snowden, president of the “Club 47” fan group, recounted his brief interaction with Melania at a February gala, describing her as “charming” and “accommodating.”Snowden expressed optimism about Melania's future involvement in the campaign, anticipating that she will make key appearances and speeches while remaining protected by the former president.As the campaign progresses, Melania Trump's enigmatic presence continues to intrigue both supporters and critics, leaving many wondering if she will step into a more public role or continue to support her husband from the shadows.","The former First Lady has kept a low profile this year, only attending a few fundraisers in April and her son Barron's high school graduation.

Billionaire Hinduja family members sentenced to jail for exploiting staff at Geneva villa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/billionaire-hinduja-family-members-sentenced-to-jail-for-exploiting-staff-at-geneva-villa/articleshow/111173810.cms,"'Family spent more on pet dog than they paid a help'

NEW DELHI: A Swiss court sentenced four members of the Hinduja family to up to four and a half years in jail on Friday for exploiting domestic workers at their Geneva villa .The criminal court, however, cleared the members of a billionaire family of charges that they engaged in illegal human trafficking of their servants, who were employed at their luxurious lakeside villa in Geneva. The court said that the staff understood the conditions they were agreeing to. There was no effective detention for any members of the family.""Our clients have been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. We are appalled and disappointed by the rest of the decision made in this court of first instance, and we have of course filed an appeal to the higher court thereby making this part of the judgement not effective. Under Swiss law, the presumption of innocence is paramount till a final judgement by the highest adjudicating authority is enforced"", lawyers representing Hinduja family said in a statement.The counsels also said that the plaintiffs in this case had withdrawn their respective complaints after declaring to the court that they had never intended to be involved in such proceedings.The Switzerland court found Indian-born businessman Prakash Hinduja, his wife, son, and daughter-in-law guilty of exploiting workers and providing unauthorised employment.The Hinduja family, who have been residing in Switzerland for decades, were accused of confiscating workers' passports, paying them in rupees instead of Swiss francs, restricting their movement, and forcing them to work excessively long hours for meager wages. Prakash Hinduja had previously been convicted on similar, albeit lesser charges in 2007, but prosecutors allege that he continued to employ people without proper documentation.Last week, it was revealed that the family had reached an undisclosed settlement with the plaintiffs. Swiss authorities have already seized various assets, including diamonds, rubies, and a platinum necklace, which could be used to cover legal fees and potential penalties.According to prosecutors, employees, including cooks and house help, were sometimes forced to work up to 18 hours a day with little or no vacation time. They were paid less than one-tenth of the amount required under Swiss law. Some staff members allegedly slept in the basement of the villa in the upscale Cologny neighborhood, occasionally on a mattress on the floor. Prosecutors described a ""climate of fear"" instituted by Kamal Hinduja.Certain employees reportedly spoke only Hindi and were paid their wages in Indian rupees in banks back home that they couldn't access. A separate tax case brought by Swiss authorities is pending against Prakash Hinduja, who obtained Swiss citizenship in 2000. The Hinduja family, consisting of Prakash and his three brothers, leads an industrial conglomerate spanning various sectors, with Forbes magazine estimating their net worth at approximately $20 billion.According to Swiss prosecutor Yves Bertossa, the family allegedly spent more money on their pet dog than they paid one of their servants. Bertossa presented this information during a trial concerning the alleged trafficking and exploitation of the Indian employees.On Monday, the prosecutor had delivered a scathing critique of the Hinduja family's actions recommending jail sentences ranging up to five and a half years for those involved. Bertossa's arguments were based on testimonies provided by the staff and the Hindujas themselves, as well as evidence gathered during his investigation into the matter.""They spent more for one dog than one of their servants,"" he said. The woman, he said, was paid at one point as little as 7 Swiss francs ($7.84) for a working day that lasted as long as 18 hours, seven days a week. He pointed to a budget document headlined ""Pets"", which he said demonstrated that the family spent 8,584 Swiss francs in a year on their family dog.Staff contracts didn't specify working hours or days off, but rather that they be available as needed by their employers, Bertossa continued. Given their passports had been confiscated, they had no Swiss francs to spend as wages were paid in India and couldn't leave the house without their employer's permission, they had little to no freedom, he argued.","A Swiss court sentenced four members of the Hinduja family to up to four and a half years in jail on Friday for exploiting domestic workers at their Geneva villa.

However, the woman somehow ended up in the restricted safari zone, where she was attacked by the wolves. Caillibotte stated that it was unclear ""whether she made a mistake or the trail wasn't clearly marked.""First responders arrived at the scene quickly, and the wolves were moved away from the area before being returned to their designated space. The source familiar with the case mentioned that the woman must have breached ""security systems, a trench and an electric fence supposed to keep the animals in.""

Lawsuit challenges new Louisiana law requiring classrooms to display the Ten Commandments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lawsuit-challenges-new-louisiana-law-requiring-classrooms-to-display-the-ten-commandments/articleshow/111245547.cms,"BATON ROUGE: Civil liberties groups filed a lawsuit Monday to block Louisiana's new law that requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom, a measure they contend is unconstitutional.Plaintiffs in the suit include parents of Louisiana public school children with various religious backgrounds, who are represented by attorneys with the American civil liberties union foundation , Americans United for separation of church and state , the freedom from religion foundation and the New York City law firm Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett.""This display sends a message to my children and other students that people of some religious dominations are superior to others,"" said the Rev. Jeff Simms, a Presbyterian pastor who is a plaintiff in the suit and father of three children in Louisiana public schools. ""This is religious favouritism.""Under the legislation signed into law by Republican gov. Jeff Landry last week, all public K-12 classrooms and state-funded universities will be required to display a poster-sized version of the Ten Commandments in ""large, easily readable font"" next year.Opponents argue that the law is a violation of separation of church and state and that the display will isolate students, especially those who are not Christian. Proponents say the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are ""foundational documents of our state and national government.""Plaintiff Joshua Herlands has two young children in New Orleans public schools who, like their father, are Jewish. There are multiple versions of the Ten Commandments, and Herlands said the specific version mandated for classroom walls does not align with the version from his faith. He worries the display will send a troubling message to his kids and others that ""they may be lesser in the eyes of the government.""""Politicians have absolutely no business forcing their religious beliefs on my kids or any kids, or attempting to indoctrinate them with what they think is the right version of a particular piece of religious text,"" Herlands said.The lawsuit filed Monday seeks a court declaration that the new law, referred to in the lawsuit as HB 71, violates First Amendment clauses forbidding government establishment of religion and guaranteeing religious liberty. It also seeks an order prohibiting the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms.""The state's main interest in passing H.B. 71 was to impose religious beliefs on public-school children, regardless of the harm to students and families,"" the lawsuit says. ""The law's primary sponsor and author, representative Dodie Horton, proclaimed during debate over the bill that it 'seeks to have a display of God's law in the classroom for children to see what He says is right and what He says is wrong.'""Defendants include state superintendent of education Cade Brumley, members of the state education board and some local school boards.Landry and Louisiana attorney general Elizabeth Murrill support the new law, and Murrill has said she is looking forward to defending it. She issued a statement saying she couldn't comment directly on the lawsuit because she had not yet seen it.""It seems the ACLU only selectively cares about the First Amendment - it doesn't care when the Biden administration censors speech or arrests pro-life protesters, but apparently it will fight to prevent posters that discuss our own legal history,"" Murrill said in the emailed statement.The Ten Commandments have long been at the center of lawsuits across the nation.In 1980, the US supreme court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the establishment clause of the US constitution, which says Congress can ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion."" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose, but rather served a plainly religious purpose.In a more recent ruling, the Supreme Court held in 2005 that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin. Those were 5–4 decisions, but the court's makeup has changed, with a 6-3 conservative majority now.Although some people think this case may rise to the level of the US supreme court and test the conservative members, lawyers for the plaintiffs say that they think this is a clear-cut case""We think this is already covered by clear supreme court precedent,"" said Patrick Elliott, the legal director for the freedom from religion foundation. ""We think under current law that we will prevail, and it would not be necessary for the supreme court to review it.""Other states, including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah, have attempted to pass requirements that the schools display the Ten Commandments. However, with threats of legal battles, none has the mandate in place except for Louisiana.The posters in Louisiana, which will be paired with a four-paragraph ""context statement"" describing how the Ten Commandments ""were a prominent part of public education for almost three centuries,"" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.The controversial law comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term democratic gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the legislature, and republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda.The case was allotted to US district judge John deGravelles, nominated to the federal bench by former president Barack Obama.","Civil liberties groups file lawsuit to block Louisiana's new law.

'Requires finding': Judge talks tough on plea seeking gag order against Trump in secret document case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/requires-finding-judge-talks-tough-on-plea-seeking-gag-order-against-trump-in-secret-document-case/articleshow/111245140.cms,"'Attacks are against Biden'

A Flordia court judge snubbed prosecutors seeking to frame former US President Donald Trump over his repeated comments on FBI , which the lawyers said had led to a threat against law enforcement officers.During the hearing in the classified document case, Jack Smith 's special counsel argued that Trump's comments mandated a gag order as he ""repeatedly and misleadingly"" alleged that FIB agents who searched his Flordia estate Mar-a-Lago had orders to murder him.Judge Aileen Cannon didn't appear to take the prosecutors' argument at face value as she asked them to show any facts linking what Trump said and the threats the prosecutors warned about.The judge noted that the rules cited by the prosecutors to seek a gag order ""still requires a finding"" related to the potential risks to others. However, she held that prosecutors didn't need a direct cause.""There still needs to be a factual connection between A and B,"" Cannon was quoted as saying by CNN.Prosecutor David Harbach further argued that Trump's other comments ""ultimately result in all types of terrible things"".Batting for the safety of FBI agents involved in the case, David said there should be a cap on Trump's campaign.Defending Trump over his comments, his attorney Todd Blanche said there were no threats to FBI agents as cited by the prosecutors and argued that the government was trying to punish Trump for other people's remarks.""The attacks, very clearly, are against President Biden,"" Blanche was quoted as saying by CNN.Blanche also acknowledged that the Department of Justice's ""deadly force"" policy during the Mar-a-Lago search was standard for executing search warrants but argued that it may not have been appropriate for agents to be armed.The defense attorney also expressed concern that prosecutors are setting a ""dangerous precedent"" by attempting to alter the former president’s conditions of release.He stated that prosecutors are too vaguely defining what constitutes a threat, which complicates adherence to potential new rules and risks making him liable for others’ comments.""Steve Bannon making a comment is potentially the kind of thing that could send President Trump to jail,"" Blanche said on CNN.Trump faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, classified documents that he took with him after he left the White House in 2021, and then obstructing the FBI's efforts to get them back. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.Trump faces four criminal cases as he seeks to reclaim the White House, but outside of the ongoing New York hush money prosecution, it's not clear that any of the other three will reach trial before the election.",Judge Aileen Cannon didn't appear to take the prosecutors' argument at face value as she asked them to show any facts linking what Trump said and the threats the prosecutors warned about.

"Puerto Rico power company suspends $65M worth of maintenance projects, sparking outcry amid outages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/puerto-rico-power-company-suspends-65m-worth-of-maintenance-projects-sparking-outcry-amid-outages/articleshow/111245080.cms,"SAN JUAN: The private operator of Puerto Rico's power grid confirmed Monday the deferral of $65 million worth of maintenance and improvement projects in the US territory, with some repairs postponed for at least a year because of budget constraints, putting at risk the already troubled grid and sparking a widespread outcry. Some of the deferred projects include maintenance of more than 100,000 light posts, fire mitigation and repairs on underground circuits, among other improvements.Luma Energy 's head of regulatory affairs, Mario Hurtado, told The Associated Press on Monday that the suspended projects he aims to bring back next year risk more outages across the island.""The risk is always that there will be more failures in terms of public lighting,"" Hurtado said.At a budget hearing on Friday, Hurtado said Luma Energy prioritized other tasks based on ""professional judgment,"" which they consider calculated risks. The lack of fire mitigation puts the grid at risk as hotter temperatures seize Puerto Rico, increasing the chances of wildfires disrupting power lines.""We make judgments based on what we have available and what our goals are,"" Hurtado said Friday. ""Although it entails a risk, it's an acceptable risk.""Luma's budget, proposed to Puerto Rico's energy bureau, includes $1.3 billion for the entire electrical sector , with 65% allocated to Luma, which is in charge of transmission and distribution, 32% to Genera PR, which operates and maintains the grid, and 3% to the Puerto Rico electric power authority.The budget aims to inject funds into Luma's customer service, personnel safety and renewable energy projects.Luma's announcement to defer millions of dollars' worth of projects amid chronic power outages has angered many.""It is unacceptable that Luma Energy can unilaterally decide to suspend crucial tasks,"" Jesus Manuel Ortiz, a member of the house of representatives who's also running for governor, said in a statement Monday. ""It is evident that Luma continues to fail in its responsibilities, and that no one in the Government of Puerto Rico is responsible.""The company confirmed a delay in funds disbursement from the federal emergency management agency on Friday. Luma has submitted about 400 projects for approval to upgrade the energy grid, and about 100 have been approved, Hurtado said.The budget hearing comes as the island of 3.2 million people contends with frequent power outages more than six years after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm. The combination of storms, earthquakes and underinvestment has hindered recovery efforts.A massive blackout in mid-June left over 340,000 customers in the capital, San Juan, and nearby cities without power during a heat wave . Prior to the blackout, towns in central and southern Puerto Rico were left without power for about five days after a transformer collapsed early June. The company restored the service on June 9, with some residents still experiencing sporadic outages last week.Over the weekend, Luma shipped a transformer via boat from San Juan to the southern coastal city of Ponce and then transported it to the nearby town of Santa Isabel.Governor Pedro Pierluisi activated the national guard to help with the energy crisis and ordered an investigation into the June 13 blackout. The energy bureau is also investigating and has directed Luma and Genera PR to submit a plan to stabilize the island's electrical network.","Luma Energy's head of regulatory affairs, Mario Hurtado, said the suspended projects he aims to bring back next year risk more outages across the island.

"'Julian Assange is free', has left Britain: WikiLeaks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-to-plead-guilty-in-deal-with-us-authorities/articleshow/111243655.cms,"What led to Julian Assange's release?

What are the next steps for Julian Assange?

What has been the reaction to Assange's release?

How has Assange's imprisonment affected him?

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been released from Belmarsh high-security prison in southeast London after five years in British custody. His wife, Stella Assange, expressed her gratitude to campaigners for their support, sharing the news on the social media platform X. ""Julian is free!!!!"" she wrote, adding, ""Words cannot express our immense gratitude"" to everyone who supported the global push for his release.Assange's release marks a significant turn in a prolonged legal battle that began with his detention for skipping bail related to Swedish sexual assault charges, which were later dropped. Assange, who was accused of disclosing US military secrets, had been fighting extradition to the United States.Assange's mother said his ""ordeal is finally coming to an end"", in a statement to Australian media following news of a plea deal for his release.""I am grateful that my son's ordeal is finally coming to an end. This shows the importance and power of quiet diplomacy,"" Christine Assange said in a statementHere is all you need to know Assange, his impriosnment and release:Assange was released after the UK High Court granted him bail. WikiLeaks announced, ""Julian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of June 24, after having spent 1,901 days there."" This decision followed a successful appeal against his extradition to the US.Assange was granted bail by the UK High Court and left Belmarsh prison on the morning of June 24. He was released at Stansted airport in the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK.WikiLeaks emphasized the impact of sustained global campaigns: ""This is the result of a global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum, all the way to the United Nations."" These efforts created the space for negotiations with the US Department of Justice, leading to a deal.While the deal has not been formally finalized, it allows Assange to plead guilty to a single count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defense documents. He is expected to be sentenced to 62 months of time already served.In 2010, WikiLeaks published a vast collection of classified US military documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, marking the most significant security breaches in US military history. The release also included a substantial number of diplomatic cables.The indictment against Assange was brought forth during the administration of former President Donald Trump, stemming from WikiLeaks' extensive disclosure of confidential US documents. These documents were originally leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. military intelligence analyst who faced prosecution under the Espionage Act.The released documents, numbering over 700,000, encompassed diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts. Among them was a 2007 video depicting a U.S. Apache helicopter opening fire on suspected insurgents in Iraq, resulting in the deaths of twelve individuals, including two Reuters news staff. The video was made public in 2010.Assange is due to plead guilty to violating US espionage law, specifically conspiring to obtain and disseminate classified national defense information. The charges stem from WikiLeaks' 2010 release of classified US military documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.Assange spent 1,901 days in Belmarsh prison. He married his wife Stella while in custody and will now be reunited with her and their two children. Stella Assange thanked supporters, saying, ""Julian paid severely for these principles, and for the people's right to know.""Assange will appear in US federal court in the Northern Mariana Islands to plead guilty. Following his plea and sentencing, he is expected to return to Australia.WikiLeaks has expressed immense gratitude for the support from various quarters, including grassroots organizers, press freedom advocates, and political leaders. The Australian government, which has been advocating for Assange's release, had no immediate comment. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has previously stated, ""Mr. Assange’s case has dragged on for too long and there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration.""Assange's family and supporters have noted that his physical and mental health have suffered during his legal battles and years in confinement.

The bridge connecting North Sioux City, South Dakota , with Sioux City, Iowa, collapsed into the Big Sioux River late Sunday, an emergency manager said. Local media images showed a large span of the steel bridge partially underwater as floodwaters rushed over it.South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said at a news briefing Monday that the bridge was the main rail link from her state into Iowa. Some of its trusses collapsed, Jason Westcott, an emergency manager in Union County, South Dakota, told KCAU-TV.There were no reports of injuries from the collapse, which occurred around 11pm. The bridge's owner, BNSF Railway, had stopped operating it as a precaution during the flooding, spokesperson Kendall Sloan said. Trains are being rerouted.""We have damaged roads. We have damaged bridges,"" Noem said. ""That will impact us for many, many months to come.""The South Dakota Department of Transportation built a berm Sunday night across Interstate 29 in North Sioux City, temporarily blocking it.Floodwaters have risen over days of heavy rain where South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska meet around Sioux City, as well as along the Iowa-Minnesota border.

Rescuers broke a window in a stairwell on the second floor, and almost 70 people crawled out, volunteers ferrying them away by boat in fours and fives.Engelkes and his girlfriend left with a bag of clothes, three cats in a carrier, and a kitten his girlfriend carried in her shirt. They expect their apartment to be ruined by about 4 feet of water but hope to still reclaim electronics they placed higher.

The war has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.

The team is scheduled to visit various dam sites in the region over the next few days. This visit marks is a step towards bilateral efforts to address and manage water resources shared by India and Pakistan under the treaty, which governs the use of the Indus River and its tributaries. The delegation's itinerary includes inspections of key dam projects to facilitate discussions on water management and treaty compliance.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed by then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and former Pakistan President Ayub Khan in 1960, establishes a framework for cooperation and information exchange on the use of the Indus River system. The treaty is overseen by the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), a bilateral body with commissioners from both countries tasked with implementing and managing treaty provisions, and resolving any questions, differences, or disputes that may arise.The PIC, which includes Indus Commissioners from India and Pakistan, has been a crucial platform for technical discussions and treaty compliance. Despite the treaty's framework, India and Pakistan have faced ongoing disagreements over hydroelectric projects. Pakistan has raised objections to India's construction of the Kishanganga (330 megawatts) and Ratle (850 megawatts) hydroelectric plants, arguing they violate treaty provisions. India, however, maintains that the projects are compliant with the treaty's guidelines and asserts its right to develop them.Efforts to resolve these disputes have been ongoing, with the World Bank encouraging both nations to explore alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. In 2015, Pakistan requested the appointment of a Neutral Expert to review its technical objections to India's projects but later sought arbitration in 2016. Despite five meetings of the PIC from 2017 to 2022, Pakistan has refrained from discussing the issue, complicating efforts to reach a consensus.The arrival of the Pakistani delegation signals a continued commitment to dialogue and cooperation under the Indus Waters Treaty, with the upcoming site visits expected to further discussions on water management and treaty implementation.",Pakistani delegation arrives in Jammu as part of ongoing discussions concerning Indus Water Treaty.

Chinese 'ultra set' telecom gear devices used by Pakistan's army seized from terrorists in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/chinese-ultra-set-telecom-gear-devices-used-by-pakistans-army-seized-from-terrorists-in-jk/articleshow/111206076.cms,"NEW DELHI: Encounters with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir led to the seizure of highly encrypted Chinese telecom equipment , known as ' Ultra Set ,' which were used by terror groups, officials said. This sophisticated gear, initially meant for the Pakistan army, has found its way into the hands of terrorists, raising serious concerns over undetected infiltrations from across the Line of Control (LoC). Authorities believe these terrorists might be residing in the outskirts of cities and villages in the region.The 'Ultra Set' devices, found during a gunfight in the Sindarah top area of Surankote in Poonch district and in Sopore's Check Mohalla Nowpora in Baramulla district, were seized after confrontations last year and earlier this year. Four foreign terrorists were killed in Surankote, while two were eliminated in Sopore. These specialized handsets, customized by Chinese companies for the Pakistan army, combine cell-phone capabilities with unique radio equipment that bypasses traditional mobile technologies like GSM or CDMA.Officials indicated that the 'Ultra Set' devices operate on radio waves for message transmission and reception, each linked to a control station across the border. The messages are compressed and transmitted via Chinese satellites to a master server in Pakistan. The discovery of such advanced communication tools has heightened fears of state-sponsored support for terrorism.“This is yet another help being extended by China to its key ally Pakistan,” officials said, noting that China has been actively enhancing Pakistan's defense capabilities along the LoC. This support includes the construction of steelhead bunkers, the provision of unmanned aerial vehicles, and the installation of encrypted communication towers, alongside laying underground fiber cables.Additionally, Chinese radar systems, such as those of the ""JY"" and ""HGR"" series, have been deployed to improve target detection along the LoC. Advanced weaponry like the SH-15 truck-mounted howitzer has also been observed in the region. These developments are seen as part of China’s strategic interests in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), particularly in connection with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).While there has been no direct sighting of senior People's Liberation Army (PLA) officials at forward posts, intercepted communications suggest that Chinese troops and engineers have been involved in infrastructure development in PoK. This includes the construction of underground bunkers and tunnels in the Leepa Valley, supporting a direct route between Gwadar Port in Pakistan and China's Xinjiang province through the Karakoram Highway.(With agency inputs)","Encounters with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir led to the seizure of highly encrypted Chinese telecom equipment.

"Eye on China, India to help Bangladesh conserve Teesta river",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/eye-on-china-india-to-help-bangladesh-conserve-teesta-river/articleshow/111196168.cms,"Top Picks For You Hasina's visit reflects deep ties: President Droupadi Murmu

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives - spanning across areas like connectivity, health, trade, energy, defence and maritime cooperation - as PM Narendra Modi hosted his counterpart Sheikh Hasina for the first state visit after the formation of the new NDA government. Among the new initiatives was an announcement by Modi after the meeting that India will soon send a technical team to Bangladesh for management and conservation of the Teesta river inside Bangladesh.The announcement is significant as it comes amid efforts by China to convince Dhaka to allow it to develop the Teesta basin. Aware of India’s reservations about China’s role, Bangladesh has maintained it will consider “geopolitical issues” before going ahead with the project, which will apparently cost $ 1 billion.Hasina is expected to soon visit China, a country Dhaka - in a fine balancing act - continues to have strong economic ties with for its development needs. “As part of our development cooperation, we will also undertake conservation and management of Teesta River inside Bangladesh with Indian assistance within a mutually agreed timeframe,” said a joint statement, in which the leaders announced a shared vision for commerce, connectivity and collaboration.Sharing of Teesta waters has remained a long outstanding issue between the countries, after opposition from West Bengal prevented them from signing a water-sharing agreement finalised during the UPA government. India’s technical team is expected to first examine if there’s any need for a reservoir to be built, something which the Chinese have reportedly suggested. For India, it’s important that Bangladesh remains mindful of Indian security concerns while pursuing economic projects with Beijing.The leaders also welcomed formation of a Joint Technical Committee to initiate discussions for the renewal of the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty of 1996. They pledged to intensify cooperation in border management, counterterrorism and against radicalisation, while agreeing to start talks for a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA).“We have prepared a futuristic vision for cooperation in new areas. We have managed to restore in the past 10 years connectivity that was there before 1965. We will now focus on energy and digital connectivity. We will soon launch CEPA negotiations to take our economic cooperation to new heights,” said Modi.There was focus on long-term defence cooperation as well as India and Bangladesh signed an MoU for cooperation concerning military education in the field of strategic and operational studies. For modernization of the Bangladesh Armed Forces, the leaders said they will explore defence industrial cooperation, while ramping up military engagements in the form of exercises, training and capability development.The 2 countries announced signing of agreements for digital and green partnerships, as also a significant initiative by India to provide e- visa for medical patients from Bangladesh. “To facilitate easier cross-border travel and as a supportive gesture to the friendly people of Bangladesh, India will extend e-Medical Visa facility to people from Bangladesh travelling to India for medical treatment,” said the joint statement, adding India will also help Dhaka with supply of essential commodities.Other major announcements included new Assistant High Commission of India in Rangpur in Bangladesh, train service between Rajshahi and Kolkata and bus service between Chittagong and Kolkata. To promote sub-regional connectivity, government said India will extend transit facilities for movement of Bangladesh goods to Nepal and Bhutan through railway network.India is also looking at early operationalization of two Special Economic Zones (SEZs) offered by Bangladesh to India in Mongla and Mirsharai and to opening of new border-haats. The 2 countries also signed an MoU to enhance railway connectivity. The joint statement also said they will pursue collaboration in frontier technologies, including civil nuclear, oceanography and space technology. “To this end, we will partner in joint development of a small satellite for Bangladesh and its launch using Indian launch vehicle,” it said.",India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives.
