Israel-Iran attacks show India needs greater thrust on multi-layered air & missile defence systems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-iran-attacks-show-india-needs-stronger-air-and-missile-defence-systems/articleshow/109448246.cms,"NEW DELHI: Missile defence is technically complex and very expensive. It’s virtually like firing a bullet to stop an incoming bullet. But with the sheer operational criticality of air and missile defence systems being reinforced by the tit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Iran, India needs to majorly crank up efforts to make its airspace as impregnable as possible.India has taken some strides in the arena but much more clearly needs to be done for an effective multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, reliable command and control posts, land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles.Unlike India, Israel of course has only a small territory to defend. And it did so effectively on April 13, thwarting Iran’s mass missile and kamikaze drone attack with its wide array of defence systems, from the short-range Iron Dome to long-range Arrow, as well as help from some others like the US.India’s air defence systems are geared towards protecting only some vital areas and installations. “India is simply too vast to be effectively protected from all kinds of aerial threats. But yes, apart from buying bullets, we need to invest much more in bulletproof jackets as well. Missile defence is now an overwhelming tactical necessity rather than a strategic one,” a senior officer said.For one, India needs to get cracking on operationally deploying its indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy nuclear and other ballistic missiles both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 15-25 km to 80-100 km for “a higher kill probability”.After “successfully completing” a series of tests for Phase-1 of the land-based BMD system quite a while ago, the DRDO also conducted the maiden flight-trial of a sea-based interceptor missile in April last year.The government, however, has so far not sanctioned full-scale deployment of the BMD system at any vital location. This could be due to the exorbitant costs involved or a few technological gaps, or even strategic calculations that it may provoke Pakistan to go in for a larger nuclear arsenal and countermeasures to defeat the BMD system, as reported by TOI earlier.IAF, of course, now has three squadrons of Russian S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems, which can detect, track and destroy incoming strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, drones and even some intermediate-range ballistic missiles at a range of 380-km. They are deployed in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan.Delivery of the remaining two S-400 squadrons, under the $5.43 billion contract inked in 2018, has been delayed to 2025-26 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.Parallelly, India is developing its own long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system under the ambitious Project Kusha. With an interception range of around 350-km, this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29.Then, there is the Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile (MR-SAM) systems, with an over 70-km range, jointly developed with Israel. After the Navy and IAF, Army in Feb last year operationalized its first `Abhra’ MR-SAM regiment in the 33 Corps, which defends the frontier with China in Sikkim and the Siliguri Corridor.Army and IAF have also inducted the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, with an interception range of 25-km, while a new-generation sleeker version is also now ready for user trials.The armed forces also have a variety of shorter range air defence weapons. These range from the older Russian Igla-1M (5-km), OSA-AK-M (10-km) and Pechora missiles and upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5-km) to the newer Israeli low-level Spyder quick-reaction anti-aircraft missiles (15-km range) and Russian man-portable Igla-S (6-km) systems. DRDO is also testing the indigenous very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS) missiles, which has a range of up to 6-km.","India needs to majorly crank up efforts to make its airspace as impregnable as possible.

"111-year-old grandma defies heat, boycott calls to cast ballot",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/111-yr-old-grandma-defies-heat-boycott-calls-to-cast-ballot-/articleshow/109467363.cms,"Fulamati, 111, had the option of a home vote, but chose to trudge to the booth in Gadchiroli

MULCHERA (GADCHIROLI): As poll officials and paramilitary troopers battled blistering heat a little after Friday noon at Mulchera's Govindpur booth in Maoist-infested Gadchiroli, 111-year-old Fulamati Binod Sarkar turned up, taking everyone by surprise. Though there was an option of home voting for the elderly, Fulamati preferred to trudge 300m to the booth from home with grandson Haridas (45).Fulamati is probably one of India's seniormost citizens who voted in the first phase, defying the heat and Maoist boycott calls in this remote village, 240km off Nagpur.Born on Jan 1, 1913 - as mentioned on her Aadhaar card - Fulamati migrated from Bangladesh's Khulna and settled in Gadchiroli in the sixties. Having lost her husband six decades ago, Fulamati raised her two daughters on her own in Gadchiroli. Though Haridas doesn't recall much about her early days, he said his granny was a fighter all through life. While one daughter died young, Haridas was born to the second, who currently looks after her.This LS election has seen several citizens above 85 vote from home and Fulamati, too, thought someone would approach her. But when no official came, she decided to head to the booth herself. ""It feels wonderful to press the EVM button. I have voted in the past, too,"" an elated Fulamati said, adding she has no medical complications.According to Haridas, poll officials ensured Fulamati didn't have to queue up. ""Our family believes every vote counts and my grandma signified citizen's empowerment through voting,"" said Haridas. ""My grandmother votes in every election,"" said Haridas.He recalled her grandmother's struggle with Bangladeshi refugees, who were first moved to a camp in Chandrapur in 1968 and then to Gadchiroli two years later.","Fulamati Binod Sarkar, 111, voted in Gadchiroli, a Maoist-infested village.

Bondi beach candlelight memorial honors victims of shopping mall knife attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/bondi-beach-candlelight-memorial-honors-victims-of-shopping-mall-knife-attack/articleshow/109475226.cms,"NEW DELHI: A candlelight memorial was held at Sydney 's famous Bondi Beach on Sunday to honor the six people who lost their lives in a knife attack at the nearby Westfield Bondi Junction shopping complex.The victims included five women and a male security guard. The attack left many Australians in shock, as they are not accustomed to such violent crimes.Daniela Pontidas, a 56-year-old local cafe owner, expressed her grief and told AFP, ""When I heard this I cried.Because it is new to us. We don't have this happen often. It's a shock.""Paul Inggall, 50, who had been at Bondi Junction hours before the attack also talked to AFP and said, ""these things don't happen often in Australia but when they do I think they have a profound impact.""The mentally ill knifeman, 40-year-old Joel Cauchi, was tracked down, shot, and killed by police inspector Amy Scott, who attended the memorial service. As the sun set, a choir sang ""Keep Your Loving Arms Around Me,"" and an Indigenous didgeridoo was played as people lit candles. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns emphasized the strength and resilience of the Bondi community.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese offered the nation's condolences for the six lives ""snatched away on that hardest of Saturday afternoons."" Cauchi's parents revealed that he had been diagnosed withschizophrenia at 17 but had stopped taking medication and dropped out of treatment.The shopping mall reopened on Friday with a somber atmosphere, as floral tributes were piled up inside and shoppers signed a book of condolence. Australian leaders praised the ""heroes"" of the Bondi attack, including the police, emergency responders, and individuals like Frenchman Damien Guerot, who fended off the attacker with a bollard. The government has granted Guerot permanent citizenship and is expected to do the same for the wounded Pakistani security guard, Muhammad Taha.Just two days after the mall attack, an Assyrian Christian bishop was brutally stabbed during a livestreamed service in western Sydney. The bishop is recovering in hospital, and a 16-year-old suspect has been charged with committing ""a terrorist act.""","A candlelight memorial was held at Sydney's famous Bondi Beach on Sunday to honor the six people who lost their lives in a knife attack.

"Massive river flooding expected in China's Guangdong, threatening millions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/massive-river-flooding-expected-in-chinas-guangdong-threatening-millions/articleshow/109477862.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Severe flooding threats loom over China's Guangdong province as major rivers and waterways reach alarming levels, prompting the government to implement emergency measures to safeguard the lives of over 127 million residents . Local weather authorities have described the situation as dire, noting that certain sections of rivers and tributaries in the Xijiang and Beijiang river basins are experiencing rare water level spikes with a one-in-50-year likelihood, as reported by state broadcaster CCTV news on Sunday.The Ministry of Water Resources in China issued an emergency advisory in response to the escalating situation.Guangdong officials have called for urgent action across all localities and municipalities to prepare for potential natural disasters , ensuring prompt distribution of relief funds and resources to provide essential provisions such as food, clothing, water, and shelter to those affected. The province, known for its significant economic activities and trade, has been battered by heavy rainfall and strong winds for several days, impacting various parts of China. A continuous downpour lasting 12 hours from Saturday night onwards has particularly affected central and northern areas of Guangdong, including cities like Zhaoqing, Shaoguan, Qingyuan, and Jiangmen, leading to rescue operations being launched in these regions.The ongoing adverse weather conditions have resulted in the evacuation of over 45,000 individuals in Qingyuan, with reports of damaged power facilities in Zhaoqing causing power outages in certain areas. State-backed media revealed that approximately 1.16 million households in Guangdong have lost electricity due to the torrential rains. As a result, 1,103 schools in Zhaoqing, Shaoguan, and Qingyuan have decided to suspend classes on Monday to ensure the safety of students and staff.Residents have taken to social media platforms like Weibo to share their experiences, with one user highlighting the challenges faced by communities in Huaiji county, which has been inundated with floodwaters. Videos circulating online depict the impact of the heavy rainfall, including vehicles being swept away in Zhaoqing and rescuers assisting individuals stranded in floodwaters. Authorities in Qingyuan and Shaoguan have restricted ship movements on several rivers, deploying emergency response teams to manage the situation.Hydrological stations throughout Guangdong are witnessing rising water levels, with Guangzhou, the provincial capital with a population of 18 million, announcing that reservoirs have reached flood capacity. Similarly, neighboring Guangxi has been hit by violent winds, causing destruction and flooding in various areas. Weather forecasts predict continued heavy rainfall in Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces until Monday, raising concerns about the potential impact of the ongoing extreme weather conditions.","Severe flooding threats loom over China's Guangdong province as major rivers and waterways reach alarming levels.

"2 Japanese navy helicopters crash in the Pacific Ocean during training, leaving 1 dead and 7 missing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/2-japanese-navy-helicopters-crash-in-the-pacific-ocean-during-training-leaving-1-dead-and-7-missing/articleshow/109477081.cms,"TOKYO: Two Japanese navy helicopters carrying eight crew members crashed in the Pacific Ocean south of Tokyo during nighttime training in a possible collision, leaving one dead while rescuers on Sunday searched for seven others missing, the defense minister said.The two SH-60K choppers from the Maritime Self-Defense Force were carrying four crew each and lost contact late Saturday near Torishima island, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) south of Tokyo, Defense Minister Minoru Kihara told reporters.The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but officials believe the two helicopters ""highly likely"" collided before crashing into the water, Kihara said.The navy chief of staff, Adm. Ryo Sakai, said training involving the SH-60s will be suspended until the cause of the crash is determined and preventive measures are adopted.Rescuers recovered a flight data recorder, a blade from each helicopter, and fragments believed to be from both choppers in the same area, signs that the two SH-60Ks were flying close to each other, Kihara said.Search and rescue efforts for the missing crew were expanded Sunday with the deployment of 12 warships and seven aircraft. Japan coast guard patrol boats and planes also joined the operation.US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel offered his country's to help with the search and rescue.""We will stand together, side by side, with our friend and ally, Japan. My thoughts are with the crew members, and their families and friends during this challenging time,"" he wrote on the social platform X.The twin-engine, multi-mission helicopters developed by Sikorsky and known as Seahawks were modified and produced in Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. They were on nighttime anti-submarine training, Kihara said. One lost contact at 10:38 p.m. and sent an automatic emergency signal a minute later.Only one distress signal, called an emergency locator transmitter, was heard - another sign the helicopters were near the same place, because their signals use the same frequency and could not be differentiated, Kihara said.One helicopter belonged to an air base in Nagasaki, and the other to a base in Tokushima prefecture. Officials were interviewing the pilot of a third aircraft that also participated in Saturday's training, Kihara said.The SH-60K aircraft is usually deployed on destroyers for anti-submarine warfare, but is also used for search and rescue and other missions. Japan has about 70 of the modified helicopters.Saturday's training only involved the Japanese navy and was not part of a multinational exercise, defense officials said.Japan, under its 2022 security strategy, has been accelerating its military buildup and fortifying deterrence in the southwestern Japanese islands in the Pacific and East China Sea to counter threats from China's increasingly assertive military activities. Japan in recent years has conducted its own extensive naval exercises as well as joint drills with its ally the United States and other partners.Saturday's training was part of routine drills involving warships, submarines and Seahawk helicopters, the Japanese navy chief of staff said. During training, a number of helicopters hover together as they lower sonars into the water to detect submarines.In 2017, a Japanese navy SH-60J, an earlier generation Seahawk, crashed during nighttime training due to human error, killing three crew. In July 2021, two SH-60s had a minor collision off the southern island of Amamioshima, both suffering blade damage, but causing no injuries.Following the 2021 collision, the navy introduced a set of preventive measures to ensure enough distance between aircraft. Sakai said Saturday's crash could have been prevented if all safety measures were adequately followed.In the US, the fatal crash of a MH-60S Seahawk during training off California in 2021 was attributed to mechanical failure from unsuspected damage during maintenance, according to the Navy.The crash in Japan also comes a year after a Ground Self-Defense Force UH-60 Blackhawk crashed off the southwestern island of Miyako due to an engine output problem known as ""rollback,"" leaving all 10 crew members dead.Japan's NHK public television said no weather advisories were issued in the area at the time of Saturday's crash.","The two SH-60K choppers from the Maritime Self-Defense Force were carrying four crew each.

These incidents have ignited a fierce determination among member countries to strengthen their joint anti-terrorism strategies.The most recent and severe of these attacks occurred at Crocus City Hall in Moscow, where gunmen killed at least 140 people, marking the deadliest assault in Russia in two decades.Islamic State Khorasan ( ISIS-K ), an Afghanistan-based affiliate of the militant group Islamic State, claimed responsibility for this attack.Days later, a suicide bomber killed five Chinese workers in northwest Pakistan, an attack that appeared to target Chinese interests, though no group has claimed responsibility. Separatist ethnic Baloch insurgent groups in the mineral-rich region have been fighting for decades against the state, saying it denies them their share of regional resources. Beijing has invested heavily in regional development projects as part of its $65 billion pledge under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.According to a South China Morning Post, the recent violence has prompted suggestions within the SCO to intensify cooperation through joint training exercises, enhanced intelligence sharing, and coordinated actions against armed groups like ISIS-K. However, amid these ambitions, Ian Hall from Griffith University expressed skepticism about China and Russia’s willingness to engage in risky interventions in regions like Afghanistan or Pakistan, where the threat from militant groups is profound.David Arase, a resident professor of international politics, noted, “ISIS-K epitomizes China’s nightmare, the ‘three evils’ of terrorism, separatism and religious extremism because [it] seeks an Islamic state under radical theocratic rule.”“The SCO already has a regional anti-terrorism structure for information sharing, and resources had been activated in response to the Moscow attacks,” said Thomas Wilkins, an associate professor at the University of Sydney, highlighting the organization's readiness to respond to such threats.Moreover, in the backdrop of these terror attacks, there is a growing concern among SCO members about external influences destabilizing their regions, with Chinese President Xi Jinping urging vigilance against the West's potential to incite disturbances, the SCMP report said.The SCO’s evolving focus reflects a geopolitical shift where Moscow and Beijing are keen on maintaining security and stability while keeping Western influences at bay, especially in their Central Asian sphere of influence.(With inputs from agencies)","Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is refocusing its counterterrorism efforts.

The doctors managed to save the baby. The second strike killed eight children and two women, all from the same family, according to hospital records. An airstrike in Rafah the night before killed nine people, including six children.Meanwhile, United States' House of Representatives approved a $26 billion aid package on Saturday that includes around $9 billion in humanitarian assistance for Gaza.The Israel-Hamas war has claimed the lives of over 34,000 Palestinians , according to local health officials, and has devastated Gaza's two largest cities, leaving a swath of destruction across the territory. Approximately 80% of the population have fled their homes to other parts of the besieged coastal enclave, which experts say is on the brink of famine.The conflict, now in its seventh month, has triggered regional unrest, pitting Israel and the US against Iran and allied militant groups across the Middle East. Earlier this month, Israel and Iran exchanged fire directly, heightening concerns of an all-out war between the long-time adversaries.According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, at least 469 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza. Most have been killed during Israeli military arrest raids, which often trigger gunbattles, or in violent protests.The war in Gaza was triggered by an unprecedented Oct. 7 raid into southern Israel, in which Hamas and other militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 hostages. Israel claims that militants are still holding around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others.According to the Gaza Health Ministry, the war has killed at least 34,049 Palestinians and wounded another 76,901. The ministry does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count but says at least two-thirds have been children and women. It also says the real toll is likely higher as many bodies are stuck beneath the rubble left by airstrikes or are in areas that are unreachable for medics.","The first airstrike killed a man, his pregnant wife, and their 3-year-old child.

'Our tax dollars': Elon Musk on irony of US and Israel-Iran conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/our-tax-dollars-elon-musk-on-irony-of-us-and-israel-iran-conflict/articleshow/109461598.cms,"History of F-14 Tomcats in Iran

Impact of the 1979 Islamic Revolution

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has commented on Israel 's strike on an Iranian airbase, critiquing the irony of US funds being used to attack American-made aircraft in Iran. These aircraft, F-14 Tomcats , were sold to Iran during the Shah's regime before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Last Friday's strike targeted Isfahan Airbase, home to the F-14 fleet, amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.This military action follows a week after Iran's extensive assault on Israel using drones and missiles, a retaliation for what Tehran claims was an Israeli attack on its consulate in Damascus.The F-14s, discontinued in the US in 2006, have been a significant part of Iran's military history , notably during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. Despite their age, these jets have struggled with maintenance issues due to the unavailability of spare parts.Musk highlighted the paradox of the situation on social media, saying, ""our tax dollars somehow also blowing up our tax dollars."" He also expressed a broader concern about global conflicts, suggesting a more peaceful and exploratory use of technology: ""we should send rockets not at each other, but rather to the stars.""Israel, a major recipient of US military aid, continues to be a pivotal American ally in the Middle East. This relationship includes significant financial assistance and collaborative defense projects like the Iron Dome and the F-35 fighter program. The US Congress is currently deliberating a foreign aid package that includes substantial aid for Israel, alongside aid for Ukraine and humanitarian efforts in Gaza.The F-14 Tomcat, a supersonic, twin-engine, two-seat, variable-sweep wing fighter aircraft, was introduced by the US Navy in the 1970s and became one of the most iconic jet fighters due to its advanced technology and unique capabilities. Iran's acquisition and use of the F-14 Tomcats is a unique chapter in military aviation history.Iran purchased F-14 Tomcats from the United States during the 1970s when the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was seeking to modernize the country's armed forces. The deal was part of the Shah's broader military expansion strategy, supported by the US, aimed at making Iran the dominant military power in the Gulf region. Iran received its first F-14s in 1976 and became the only country other than the United States to operate them.The 1979 Islamic Revolution marked a significant turning point for Iran's F-14 fleet. The overthrow of the Shah led to a new Islamic Republic government that was immediately subjected to international sanctions and embargoes. These restrictions severely impacted the maintenance and operational capability of the F-14s, as the US cut off military support and spare parts.Despite these challenges, Iran used its F-14s extensively during the Iran-Iraq War from 1980 to 1988. The aircraft were crucial in defending Iranian airspace against Iraqi air strikes and in conducting reconnaissance missions. The Tomcats achieved a number of aerial victories during the war. However, the lack of spare parts and maintenance support gradually eroded the operational effectiveness of the fleet.After the war, Iran faced ongoing challenges in keeping its F-14s airworthy due to the embargo on military parts. Ingeniously, Iran resorted to reverse engineering and domestic production of parts to maintain its fleet. Over the years, there have been reports of various upgrades to their avionics and armaments, integrating domestic and possibly foreign technology not originally part of the F-14s.Today, the F-14 remains a symbol of Iran's resilience in maintaining a complex weapons system under sanctions. Although their numbers have dwindled and their original capabilities might be degraded, the F-14s continue to be a significant part of Iran's air defense strategy.","Musk highlighted the paradox of the situation on social media, saying, ""our tax dollars somehow also blowing up our tax dollars."" He also expressed a broader concern about global conflicts, suggesting a more peaceful and exploratory use of technology.

Chinese military drone spotted flying close to the Philippines ahead of BrahMos delivery from India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-military-drone-spotted-flying-close-to-the-philippines-ahead-of-brahmos-delivery-from-india/articleshow/109461199.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A WZ-7 Soaring Dragon drone belonging to the Chinese People's Liberation Army was spotted flying in close proximity to the Philippines, ahead of preparations by the Southeast Asian country to receive the delivery of Indian BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, The Eurasian Times reported.The drone's distinctive joined-wing shape caught the attention of Raffy Tima , a correspondent for Philippine news organization GMA News, as it traversed the skies over the West Philippine Sea.This sighting comes amidst escalating tensions between China and the Philippines over territorial disputes in the South China Sea , notably at the Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal. The timing is particularly significant as the Philippines prepares to receive the delivery of Indian BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, perceived as a strategic move to bolster defensive capabilities against China's assertiveness in the region.Procured under the 'Horizon 2' Priority Projects aimed at modernizing the Philippine armed forces, the BrahMos missile system arrived in Manila on April 19. The delivery, facilitated through a government-to-government (G2G) deal, includes three missile batteries, operator and maintainer training, and an Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package.The coincidence of the WZ-7 drone sighting with the arrival of Indian transport planes carrying the BrahMos missiles raises eyebrows. This occurrence precedes the commencement of the 'Balikatan 2024' drills between the Philippines and the US.The WZ-7, operated by the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), boasts a service ceiling of over 60,000 feet and a range of about 4,350 miles. Its sighting near the Philippines echoes previous instances of its presence near Taiwan amid tensions between China and the island.As military exercises loom, with activities including target ship sinking and island reclamation, the deployment of the new Typhon ground-based missile system by the US on the northern Philippine island of Luzon raises concerns for China.",A WZ-7 Soaring Dragon drone belonging to the Chinese People's Liberation Army was spotted flying in close proximity to the Philippines.

"Trump cancels rally because of weather, proving the difficulty of balancing a trial and campaign",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-cancels-rally-because-of-weather-proving-the-difficulty-of-balancing-a-trial-and-campaign/articleshow/109469080.cms,"WILMINGTON, NC: Donald Trump had to cancel his first planned rally since the start of his criminal hush money trial because of a storm Saturday evening in North Carolina , an added complication that highlights the difficulty the former president faces in juggling his legal troubles with his rematch against President Joe Biden.Trump called into the rally site near the Wilmington airport less than an hour before he was scheduled to take the stage and apologized to a few thousand supporters who had gathered throughout the afternoon under initially sunny skies that later darkened with storm clouds.Speaking from his private plane, Trump cited lightning and the incoming storm in explaining that he would not be landing. He pledged to reschedule a ""bigger and better"" event at the same location ""as quick as possible.""The planned rally in the critical battleground of North Carolina was to cap a week in which Trump spent four days in a Manhattan courtroom sitting silent during jury selection while Biden was able to hold multiple campaign events in Pennsylvania, another key state in the November election.The cancellation denied Trump a fresh chance to amplify claims that his multiple pending indictments are an establishment conspiracy to take him down - and, by extension, squelch the voters who first elected him eight years ago.Now, instead of commanding attention on his own terms at one of his signature mass rallies, his next public appearance is almost certainly going to be Monday, back at the defendant's table for opening arguments in the first felony trial ever for an American president. And his campaign is left to decide when he next can be Trump the candidate instead of Trump the defendant.""I'm devastated that this could happen but we want to keep everybody safe,"" Trump said.The assembled voters expressed frustrations with the turn of events but made clear they understood. Many of them had spent hours ahead of the rally holding prime seats, patronizing food trucks and perusing a row of tents selling Trump memorabilia, including T-shirts featuring the former president's mug shot taken in Atlanta after his indictment on charges that he led a criminal conspiracy to overturn Biden's 2020 victory.""I've been with Donald Trump and I'm still with Donald Trump, but I'm disappointed he didn't show up,"" said Cheryl Lynn Johnson, who drove about two hours from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to attend what would have been her fourth Trump rally. ""I'm mad at Mother Nature, but I stand behind Trump.""Indeed, the audience was primed to validate Trump's strategy to use his mandated court time to his advantage by folding the proceedings into the same populist, anti-establishment arguments that first fueled his rise eight years ago.""It's political persecution, and if it were anybody else he wouldn't have to be dealing with it,"" said Christian Armstrong, a 28-year-old firefighter who lives in Wilmington and was attending his first Trump rally.LeeAnn Coleman, a 42-year-old who is in a family restaurant business, said, ""It's ludicrous that he's having to do this at all,"" rather than spend time focusing on ""all the problems he wants to fix.""Those arguments could have come from Trump himself.""They want to keep me off the campaign trail,"" the candidate-turned-defendant insisted earlier this week in Harlem, where he visited a neighborhood convenience store and addressed a throng of media outside after spending the day at his own jury selection. Rather than pursue violent criminals, he alleged, ""They go after Trump.""It is not clear when Trump's next campaign appearance will be. His New York trial could last more than a month, severely curtailing his freedom to see voters, fundraise and make calls, and additional court proceedings could follow later in the year. Trump aides have promised weekend rallies and events on Wednesdays, the one weekday that Trump's hush money trial is expected to be in recess. The former president's campaign also has promised additional weeknight appearances around New York, like his trip to Harlem.But there is no accounting for weather . The closest Trump came to assigning responsibility for the cancellation was to mention ""weather officials,"" but he did not question the decision during his brief remarks.Even with the cancellation, Trump's choice of venue underscored the importance of North Carolina as a presidential battleground. Trump won here by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Saturday would have been the second time in as many months that Trump visited the state. Biden has traveled to North Carolina twice this year; Vice President Kamala Harris has been four times.""The presidential race is going to run through North Carolina,"" said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, in a recent interview.North Carolina is one of seven states that both the Trump and Biden campaigns have said they will dedicate significant campaign resources to winning. Trump has insisted he will widen the map, even into his native New York, which is heavily Democratic. Most Republicans, though, agree that Trump will have a difficult path to an Electoral College majority if Biden were to win North Carolina's 16 electoral votes. Trump tacitly acknowledged North Carolina's status by tapping then-state Republican Chairman Michael Whatley to lead his effective takeover of the Republican National Committee.Biden's campaign has hired statewide North Carolina leadership and field organizers for offices across the state. That's on top of state party staff that began an organizing program last year ahead of municipal races and looking to this year's statewide contests, which include an open governor's race. Cooper is legally barred from seeking a third term.""We needed to build energy on the ground early,"" said state Democratic Chairwoman Anderson Clayton, noting that the last Democratic presidential nominee to win North Carolina - Barack Obama in 2008 - had organized the state in a hotly contested primary campaign that ramped up the previous year.Matt Mercer, spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, countered that Republicans have had veteran staffers on the ground since 2020, and now have a ticket with Trump and Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, that excites the GOP base. Trump has endorsed Robinson, the state's first Black lieutenant governor, calling him ""Martin Luther King on steroids.""Robinson was set to be on stage with Trump in Wilmington.Ahead of the scheduled rally, Democrats hammered the pairing for their opposition to abortion rights, calling them too extreme for North Carolina.Cooper predicted Biden's record - low unemployment, rising wages, stabilized inflation, infrastructure and green energy investments - and his support for abortion rights will resonate with a geographically and demographically diverse state.""Joe Biden did more in his first two years than most presidents hope to do in two terms,"" Cooper argued.Mercer said Republicans will answer with a family-first message around the economy and public safety.""Whether it's with sky-high inflation, the open southern border or the migrant crime crisis,"" he said, voters are ""fed up"" with Biden.Trump lost an opportunity Saturday to make that case himself. But for voters like Matt Mazak, a 32-year-old who described himself as an independent, the verdict already is in.""I want someone who is not going to go with the flow of D.C.,"" Mazak said. ""I'm not even saying Trump is the right answer. But he's the best we've got.""","Donald Trump cancels his first planned rally since the start of his criminal hush money trial.

Blinken will be the latest top US official to visit China in a bid to keep ties on an even keel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-will-be-the-latest-top-us-official-to-visit-china-in-a-bid-to-keep-ties-on-an-even-keel/articleshow/109468949.cms,"WASHINGTON: Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to China this coming week as Washington and Beijing try to keep ties on an even keel despite major differences on issues from the path to peace in the Middle East to the supply of synthetic opioids that have heightened fears over global stability.The rivals are at odds on numerous fronts, including Russia's war in Ukraine, Taiwan and the South China Sea, North Korea, Hong Kong, human rights and the detention of American citizens.The United States and China also are battling over trade and commerce issues , with President Joe Biden announcing new tariffs on imports of Chinese steel this past week.The State Department said Saturday that Blinken, on his second visit to China in less than a year, will travel to Shanghai and Beijing starting Wednesday for three days of meetings with senior Chinese officials, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Talks between Blinken and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected, although neither side will confirm such a meeting is happening until shortly before it takes place.The department said in a statement that Blinken would ""discuss a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues,"" including the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.He will also talk about progress made in ""resuming counternarcotics cooperation, military-to-military communication, artificial intelligence, and strengthening people-to-people ties"" and will reaffirm how important it is for the US and China to be ""responsibly managing competition, even in areas where our two countries disagree,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.The trip follows a phone call this month between Biden and Xi in which they pledged to keep high-level contacts open, something they had agreed to last year at a face-to-face summit in California. Since that call, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has visited China and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has spoken by phone with his Chinese counterpart. Meetings at lower levels also have taken place.Despite those encounters, relations are rocky. The US has recently become more vocal in its calls for China to stop supporting Russia's military-industrial sector, which Washington says has allowed Moscow to boost weapons production to support the war against Ukraine.""We see China sharing machine tools, semiconductors, other dual-use items that have helped Russia rebuild the defense industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade,"" Blinken said Friday. ""Now, if China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fueling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War.""Blinken also has pushed for China to take a more active stance in pressing Iran not to escalate tensions in the Middle East. He has spoken to his Chinese counterpart several times since the Israel-Hamas war began six months ago as he has sought China's help in getting Iran to restrain proxy groups it has supported, armed and funded in the region.That topic has taken on new urgency since direct back-and-forth attacks by Iran and Israel on each other's soil in the past week.Also high on the agenda for Blinken will be Taiwan and the South China Sea.The US has strongly condemned Chinese military exercises threatening Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province and vowed to reunify with the mainland by force if necessary. Successive US administrations have steadily ramped up military support and sales for Taipei, much to the anger of Chinese officials.In the South China Sea, the US and others have become increasingly concerned by provocative Chinese actions in and around disputed areas. In particular, the US has voiced objections to what it says are Chinese attempts to thwart legitimate activities by others in the waterway, notably the Philippines and Vietnam.That was a major topic of concern earlier this month when Biden held a three-way summit with the prime minister of Japan and the president of the Philippines.","Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Shanghai and Beijing starting Wednesday.

Senate passes reauthorization of key US surveillance program just after midnight deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senate-passes-reauthorization-of-key-us-surveillance-program-just-after-a-midnight-deadline/articleshow/109468862.cms,"WASHINGTON: Barely missing its midnight deadline , the Senate voted early Saturday to reauthorize a key US surveillance law after divisions over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans' data nearly forced the statute to lapse.The legislation approved 60-34 with bipartisan support would extend for two years the program known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.It now goes to President Joe Biden's desk to become law. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden ""will swiftly sign the bill.""""In the nick of time, we are reauthorizing FISA right before it expires at midnight,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said when voting on final passage began 15 minutes before the deadline. ""All day long, we persisted and we persisted in trying to reach a breakthrough and in the end, we have succeeded.""US officials have said the surveillance tool, first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since then, is crucial in disrupting terror attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage and has also produced intelligence that the US has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri.""If you miss a key piece of intelligence, you may miss some event overseas or put troops in harm's way,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said. ""You may miss a plot to harm the country here, domestically, or somewhere else. So in this particular case, there's real-life implications.""The proposal would renew the program, which permits the US government to collect without a warrant the communications of non-Americans located outside the country to gather foreign intelligence. The reauthorization faced a long and bumpy road to final passage Friday after months of clashes between privacy advocates and national security hawks pushed consideration of the legislation to the brink of expiration.Though the spy program was technically set to expire at midnight, the Biden administration had said it expected its authority to collect intelligence to remain operational for at least another year, thanks to an opinion earlier this month from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which receives surveillance applications.Still, officials had said that court approval shouldn't be a substitute for congressional authorization, especially since communications companies could cease cooperation with the government if the program is allowed to lapse.Hours before the law was set to expire, US officials were already scrambling after two major US communication providers said they would stop complying with orders through the surveillance program, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.Attorney General Merrick Garland praised the reauthorization and reiterated how ""indispensable"" the tool is to the Justice Department.""This reauthorization of Section 702 gives the United States the authority to continue to collect foreign intelligence information about non-US persons located outside the United States, while at the same time codifying important reforms the Justice Department has adopted to ensure the protection of Americans' privacy and civil liberties,"" Garland said in a statement Saturday.But despite the Biden administration's urging and classified briefings to senators this week on the crucial role they say the spy program plays in protecting national security, a group of progressive and conservative lawmakers who were agitating for further changes had refused to accept the version of the bill the House sent over last week.The lawmakers had demanded that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer allow votes on amendments to the legislation that would seek to address what they see as civil liberty loopholes in the bill. In the end, Schumer was able to cut a deal that would allow critics to receive floor votes on their amendments in exchange for speeding up the process for passage.The six amendments ultimately failed to garner the necessary support on the floor to be included in the final passage.One of the major changes detractors had proposed centered around restricting the FBI's access to information about Americans through the program. Though the surveillance tool only targets non-Americans in other countries, it also collects communications of Americans when they are in contact with those targeted foreigners. Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, had been pushing a proposal that would require US officials to get a warrant before accessing American communications.""If the government wants to spy on my private communications or the private communications of any American, they should be required to get approval from a judge, just as our Founding Fathers intended in writing the Constitution,"" Durbin said.In the past year, US officials have revealed a series of abuses and mistakes by FBI analysts in improperly querying the intelligence repository for information about Americans or others in the US, including a member of Congress and participants in the racial justice protests of 2020 and the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol.But members on both the House and Senate intelligence committees as well as the Justice Department warned requiring a warrant would severely handicap officials from quickly responding to imminent national security threats.""I think that is a risk that we cannot afford to take with the vast array of challenges our nation faces around the world,"" Democratic Senator Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Friday.","White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan says Biden ""will swiftly sign the bill"" The legislation approved 60-34 with bipartisan support would extend for two years the program. It now goes to President Joe Biden's desk to become law.

Taiwan, TikTok

WASHINGTON: The US House of Representatives on Saturday approved a giant aid package for Ukraine , Israel and Taiwan and a bill threatening to ban TikTok.Here is a breakdown of the $95 billion package, which now moves to the Senate, where it could be taken up as early as Tuesday.The majority of funds in the package, nearly $61 billion, are earmarked for Ukraine's war effort against the Russian invasion.President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pleading for this money for months, warning that ""if Congress does not help Ukraine, Ukraine will lose the war.""Washington is Kyiv's main military supporter, but Congress has not passed a major aid package for its ally since December 2022 due to partisan squabbling.The bill passed Saturday would provide nearly $14 billion to train, equip and finance the needs of the Ukrainian army.Ukraine would also receive $10 billion in ""forgivable loans"" for vital economic and budgetary support, including for the energy and infrastructure sectors.The idea of a loan, rather than a grant, was suggested by former president Donald Trump, who believes the United States should stop handing out money without any payback. A ""forgivable loan"" can be partly or fully forgiven or deferred under certain conditions.A large chunk of this money will also go to replenishing US military stockpiles.The bill also authorizes the US president to confiscate and sell Russian assets in order to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine, an idea that is also gaining traction with other G7 countries.The United States' historic ally Israel will receive $13 billion in military assistance as it fights Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.These funds will be used in particular to strengthen Israel's Iron Dome air defense system.More than $9 billion will be spent to address ""the dire need for humanitarian assistance for Gaza as well as other vulnerable populations around the world.""The measure, however, would prohibit any direct US funding of the UN crisis-hit Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA). Israel has accused some of the agency employees in Gaza of involvement in the shocking October 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas, which triggered the war.The bill would provide some $8 billion to counter China through investment in submarine infrastructure and boosting competition with Chinese projects in developing countries.The bill also earmarks several billion dollars in weapons funding for Taiwan, a self-ruled island that is claimed by China.Another bill passed Saturday would force TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company ByteDance or face a nationwide ban in the United States.American officials have voiced alarm over the popularity of TikTok with young people, alleging that it is subservient to Beijing and a conduit to spread propaganda, claims denied by the company and Beijing.","US House approves $95 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

NEW DELHI: The House of Representatives has approved legislation that would ban TikTok in the United States unless its Chinese owner sells its stake in the company within a year. The inclusion of TikTok in a broader foreign aid package by House Republicans, which is a priority for President Joe Biden and has widespread congressional support for countries like Ukraine and Israel, accelerated the process of the ban.The initial version of the bill had faced a roadblock in the Senate before this move.Earlier, a standalone bill with a six-month deadline for selling TikTok had received overwhelming bipartisan support in the House back in March. Both Democrats and Republicans had expressed concerns about national security due to the app's ownership by the Chinese tech company ByteDance Ltd. The revised legislation will now head to the Senate.Even if the bill is enacted into law, ByteDance would still have up to a year to find a buyer and is likely to challenge the law in court, arguing that it infringes on the First Amendment rights of its millions of users.ByteDance has vehemently opposed the legislation and urged its 170 million US users, many of whom are young, to contact Congress and voice their opposition. However, this pushback has not been well-received by lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who are deeply concerned about Chinese threats to the United States and have limited presence on the platform themselves.The House also passed provisions to support Ukraine, strengthen Taiwan, and approved a significant amount of military aid to Israel. These bills received strong bipartisan backing during a rare Saturday session, although they have raised questions about the future of House Speaker Mike Johnson as he faces challenges from right-wing critics.The aid for Israel comes as the country is engaged in a conflict with Hamas despite international concerns for civilian well-being in Gaza. The bill, set to be taken up by the Senate soon, primarily focuses on bolstering Israel's Iron Dome air defense system.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the long-awaited aid package, emphasizing the lifesaving impact it would have. The bills are the result of contentious negotiations, pressure from US allies, and repeated appeals for assistance from Zelenskyy. The funding for Ukraine has been a point of contention in Congress, with disagreements between parties delaying approval for over a year.President Biden and Democratic lawmakers have been advocating for substantial military support for Ukraine, while Republicans, influenced by former President Donald Trump, have been hesitant to allocate funds for the conflict. The recent $61 billion package for Ukraine, which includes economic aid and weapons support, has finally garnered support from Speaker Johnson after much deliberation.The bill also enables the confiscation and sale of Russian assets to provide further financial assistance to Ukraine for reconstruction, a move endorsed by other G7 nations. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer indicated that the bill could be taken up for consideration as early as Tuesday.",The House of Representatives has approved legislation that would ban TikTok in the United States unless its Chinese owner sells its stake in the company within a year.

Furthermore, any individuals or entities with ownership, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more by the designated persons are also subject to these sanctions,” read a statement by the State Department, adding these entities supplied items even for Pakistan’s long-range missiles.Islamabad appeared to shrug off the action, saying such “listings of commercial entities have taken place in the past as well on allegations of links to its missile programme without sharing any evidence whatsoever”.“While we are not aware of the specifics of the latest measures by the US, in the past we have come across many instances where listings have been made on mere suspicion or even when the involved items were not on any control lists but were deemed sensitive under catch-all provisions,” read a statement issued by Pakistan’s foreign office.The US State Department statement detailed the alleged inputs from the four firms. Belarus’s Minsk plant supplied special vehicle chassis. Such chassis, the US claimed, are used as launch-support equipment by Pakistan’s National Development Complex (NDC), which develops Missile Technology Control Regime Category (MTCR) I ballistic missiles.China’s Xi’an Longde Technology allegedly supplied a filament-winding machine, adding these can be used to produce rocket motor cases, the US said. Tianjin Creative Trade Co. Ltd. shipped stir-welding equipment. The supplies were likely destined for Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), which develops and produces Pakistan’s MTCR Category I ballistic missiles, the US said.Granpect Company worked with SUPARCO to supply equipment for the testing of large-diameter rocket motors to NDC, the State Department added.Islamabad defended such procurements. “Such items have legitimate civil commercial uses. Pakistan has always been ready to discuss end-use and end-user verification mechanisms so that legitimate commercial users are not hurt by discriminatory application of export controls,” the foreign office said in its statement.Pakistan also insinuated double standards in such sanctions. “The same jurisdictions, which claim to exercise strict non-proliferation controls, have waived licensing requirements for advanced military technologies for some countries... leading to arms build-up,” the statement added.","US imposes sanctions on three Chinese and one Belarus company over alleged supply of inputs for Pakistan’s ballistic missile programme.

They also prayed for the quick recovery of those injured in the incident and pledged to eradicate terrorism.Although no one took credit for the incident right away, suspicions will probably point to the Pakistani Taliban or a minor separatist organization that has increased its attacks on security personnel in recent years. Chinese workers in Pakistan engaged in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which encompasses numerous megaprojects including building roads, power plants, and agricultural fields, have also been targeted by insurgents.In March, five Chinese nationals along with their Pakistani driver were killed after a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle into their convoy in northwest Pakistan.Their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine off the mountainous Karakoram Highway after the bomber rammed his car into them and detonated his explosives, police said.",A van carry five Japanese autoworkers was targeted in a suicide attack in Karachi. The bomber was wearing an explosive-laden vest and the blast injured three by-standers. The Japanese individuals have been relocated to a secure location under police protection.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109425562,imgsize-1413645,width-400,resizemode-4/109425562.jpg"

Despite the conflict's international ramifications, it has not garnered widespread attention.In recent months, resistance fighters in Myanmar's remote areas have been consistently defeating the ruling military junta , surprising analysts and raising the possibility of the junta's collapse.The war has become a human rights disaster , with Myanmar's economy in shambles since the 2021 military coup, plunging millions into extreme poverty. The country's reputation as a center for drugs, online scams, and money laundering is growing, and its instability has created strategic challenges for China, India, the United States, and other nations.The civil war has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 3 million others. The country is riddled with land mines, and extreme inflation has contributed to a significant reduction in the middle class, according to the United Nations . The health sector is in crisis, with childhood vaccinations essentially halted and a substantial increase in malaria cases. Experts are concerned about the spread of HIV and tuberculosis.The conflict has regional and international implications. According to the United Nations, Russia and other countries have sold the Myanmar army at least $1 billion in weapons since the 2021 coup. China sees threats to its infrastructure projects across the country, while India, which has long feared chaos in its borderlands, is deporting Myanmar refugees.Thailand is similarly concerned about the estimated 40,000 or more refugees that the United Nations predicts will cross the border this year. Bangladesh sees obstacles to its efforts to repatriate the Rohingya , and the United States has begun providing nonlethal aid to armed resistance groups.","The civil war has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 3 million others.

Police conducted raids in Central Sulawesi province between Tuesday and Thursday, said Agus Nugroho, the provincial police chief, adding that five suspects were arrested in the city of Palu , two in Sigi, and one in Poso which is a known extremist hotbed.Two laptops, several cellular phones and documents, including jihadist books were seized and suspects were being interrogated, Nugroho said.National Police spokesperson Trunoyudo Wisnu Andiko said the arrests were the result of information obtained from 59 suspected militants detained in October 2023.""(The eight) all actively participate in organisation activities, particularly in military-style training and collecting funds for alleged plans of terror acts,"" Andiko told reporters at the National Police headquarters in the capital, Jakarta. He added that convicted leaders of the group and veteran fighters in Afghanistan were recruiting and training new members.Jemaah Islamiyah is responsible for several attacks inside Indonesia, namely, the 2002 bombings on the resort island of Bali that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. A court banned the group in 2008 and constant counterterrorism crackdowns, supported by the United States and Australia, have weakened it further.Last year, police arrested a total of 142 suspected militants, including four women, and fatally shot two others on southern Sumatra island.Militant attacks on foreigners in Indonesia have been largely replaced in recent years by smaller, less deadly strikes targeting the government, mainly police and anti-terrorism forces, and people militants consider to be infidels, inspired by Islamic State group tactics abroad.","Police conducted raids in Central Sulawesi province between Tuesday and Thursday.

Her son Kim Aris said in Feb that she was still being held at the special compound in Naypyidaw.
