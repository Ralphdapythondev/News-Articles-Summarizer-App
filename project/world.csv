Democratic Presidential nominee and US Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday took a jibe at her rival, former US President and Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump and shared a montage of Trump discussing the ' enemies within ' the country.In a rally held in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, Harris cautioned the people about the potential consequences of Trump regaining power, stating, ""We know who Trump is, he'll stop at nothing to claim power for himself"".She urged people to pay attention to Trump's rally speeches to comprehend his intentions.During the rally, Harris played a montage of Trump's speeches and interviews, where he discusses the internal enemies of the country and how he plans to deal with them, including the possibility of using military force . In an approximately 40-second clip, Trump can be heard saying, ""The worst people are the enemies within. Those people are more dangerous than Russia and China"". He further suggests that these individuals are mentally ill and ""should be put in jail"".The clip also showed Trump's proposed methods for handling these individuals, advocating for ""one rough hour, very rough hour"", where ""sick, radical left people and lunatics"" can be dealt with using ""national guards or even military if necessary"".Harris then warns the public that, in Trump's view, these 'enemies within' are those ""who don't support him or bend to his will"". She specifically highlights that "" Journalists , election officials and judges"" will be his primary targets, and he will deploy the military to confront them.In Harris's opinion, ""a second term for Trump would be a very huge risk for America and will be dangerous.""

The music mogul is facing new allegations related to his infamous “White Parties,” a Manhattan hotel, and a Macy’s stockroom. According to the Daily Beast, lawyers for the sexual assault victims filed six more lawsuits against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs on Monday.The complaints filed on Monday involve allegations of victims who were assaulted in New York, where Diddy established his East Coast hip-hop empire.The victims will remain unidentified and unnamed in the lawsuits and will be referred to as John Doe and Jane Doe.The six victims are represented by Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee, who has previously indicated plans to file lawsuits for as many as 120 people accusing the Bad Boy Records founder of various crimes, including sexual assault and the abuse of minors.In a statement, Buzbee’s office said they would “let the allegations in the filed complaints speak for themselves.” The attorney also said they “expect to be filing many more cases over the next several weeks naming Mr. Combs and others as defendants as we continue to gather evidence and prepare the filings.”In a series of lawsuits, multiple accusers have come forward with allegations against Diddy, detailing incidents from various events.A woman claimed that during a 1995 promotional party for Biggie Smalls’ “One More Chance” video, Diddy raped her after isolating her under the threat of harm if she reported it.After the rape , the victim claimed that Diddy told her: “you better not tell anyone about this, or you will disappear.”An accuser who was a minor when he was assaulted, identified only as John Doe, claims Diddy invited him to a White Party in the Hamptons in 1998. During the event, Diddy allegedly took an interest in the teen, leading him to a secluded area near portable restrooms to discuss his music career.However, the conversation took a disturbing turn when Diddy allegedly demanded he drop his pants and then groped him before returning to the party.In a separate lawsuit , a security guard at a 2006 White Party claims Diddy provided him with drinks, the second drink caused him to feel “extremely ill and [the victim] leaned against his truck for support.” Lawyers for the plaintiff believe that the drink was spiked with GHB—a dangerous date rape drug .The suit alleges Diddy then raped him after pushing him into a van.In 2004, a woman claimed she was invited to an afterparty at a Marriott hotel after a photoshoot for Diddy’s group Da Band.Once there, a security guard allegedly locked her and a friend in a room with Diddy, who forced them to drink and do cocaine before assaulting them.Marriott Hotels has been named as a co-defendant in the lawsuit. In a statement to the Daily Beast, the hotel chain stated that they have not yet reviewed the complaint and have no comment at this time.Another suit involves an Ecko Clothing advisor who met Diddy in a Macy’s stockroom in 2008.The victim alleges Diddy assaulted him, yelling obscenities, and left as if nothing had happened. The lawsuit claims that Macy’s “pressured Ecko executives to terminate the Plaintiff’s employment after Macy’s signed a multi-million-dollar deal with Sean John Clothing.” As a result, the victim was fired, and no further actions were pursued.Macy’s was also named as a co-defendant.A recent lawsuit details an incident involving a brand management employee at a party in October 2021.Despite limiting himself to one drink, he reported feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed in a bedroom, where he was sexually assaulted by multiple men, including Diddy.“Even though Plaintiff only consumed one alcoholic drink, the effects of the drink were immediate and overwhelming,” the suit claims.Diddy has been held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center since his arrest on September 16. He faces charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution, with over 120 alleged victims, including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. Diddy has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is set for May 5, 2025.","The music mogul is facing new allegations related to his infamous “White Parties,” a Manhattan hotel, and a Macy’s stockroom.

King Charles has decided to temporarily pause his cancer treatment as he and Queen Camilla prepare for an 11-day tour of Australia. The 75-year-old monarch has been receiving regular treatment for most of the year, making him the first British king to publicly battle such a serious illness while still on the throne.According to sources, the King’s doctors have cleared him for the tour, but his schedule has been significantly reduced to accommodate rest days, as the New York Post reported.The decision to move forward with the visit reflects the King’s determination to maintain his duties, even as his health visibly deteriorates.Reports indicate that King Charles has lost a considerable amount of weight and looks aged noticeably since he was diagnosed back in February.Yet, the upcoming tour is seen as essential for preserving ties with Australia, one of the 14 realms still recognizing the British monarch as head of state.With republican sentiments growing in the Australian region, the King’s presence is seen as critical to reinforcing these connections.Meanwhile, there are signs of a power shift within the royal family . Prince William and Princess Kate have been increasingly stepping into the spotlight.Last month, Kate shared a video celebrating the end of her chemotherapy, notably excluding any mention of King Charles.Analysts suggest this move, which was not approved by the King, reflects a growing independence for the Waleses.As Charles continues his battle with cancer, questions arise over how much longer he can maintain his role as monarch, especially with Prince William gradually assuming more influence.","King Charles has decided to temporarily pause his cancer treatment as he and Queen Camilla prepare for an 11-day tour of Australia.

Forgivable loans

Marijuana legalisation

Addressing voter concerns

Protecting

investors and expanding education

Health equity initiative

In a bid to strengthen her appeal among Black men in the upcoming November election, US vice president Kamala Harris announced an extensive set of economic policies on Monday. This initiative, called the "" Opportunity Agenda for Black men,"" aims to solidify a crucial voting bloc aheadof the presidential election , where recent polls show a decline in support for Democrats, according to USA Today.Harris' proposals include offering one million ""fully forgivable"" loans to Black business owners, designed to help those who lack the necessary resources and connections to launch their enterprises. The loans, which can reach up to $20,000, will be administered through a new partnership with the Small Business Administration.Additionally, Harris called for national legalisation of marijuana for recreational use, aiming to ensure that Black entrepreneurs gain access to the cannabis industry. Her campaign said, ""Kamala Harris will fight to ensure, as the national cannabis industry takes shape, Black men – who have, for years, been over-policed for marijuana use – are able to access wealth and jobs in this new market."" This move is very different from how the previous administration handled things. President Joe Biden 's team has recently worked to change marijuana's classification from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug.The unveiling of these policies comes as the Harris campaign faces pressure from within, particularly as former President Donald Trump gains traction among Black male voters . Recent polls indicate that Harris leads Trump by a margin of 78%-15% among Black voters, a significant drop from the 90% support Biden received in 2020.Harris will discuss her economic agenda at a Black-owned business in Erie, Pennsylvania, before a campaign rally later in the evening. Former President Barack Obama also weighed in, urging Black men to rally behind Harris, noting that some hesitation comes from her being a woman.Harris' agenda includes regulations for cryptocurrency to safeguard investors. The campaign highlighted that more than 20% of Black Americans own or have owned cryptocurrency assets, signalling the importance of this measure.Harris also aims to expand education and mentorship opportunities for Black men. Key initiatives include increasing the number of Black male teachers, promoting registered apprenticeships, and enhancing the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Programme to attract and retain Black male educators.Furthermore, Harris plans to launch a health equity initiative focused on addressing health issues disproportionately affecting African Americans, including sickle cell disease, diabetes, and mental health challenges.","US vice president Kamala Harris announced an extensive set of economic policies on Monday.

President Biden: 'Honestly kind of shocking': GOP leader Anna Paulina Luna surprised by Biden's Hurricane response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/honestly-kind-of-shocking-gop-leader-anna-paulina-luna-surprised-by-bidens-hurricane-response/articleshow/114228222.cms,"US President Joe Biden and GOP member Anna Paulina Luna

In a rare moment of working together across party lines, Anna Paulina Luna , a Republican from Florida and member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has praised US President Joe Biden for his response to recent natural disasters. Luna, whose district was hit hard by Hurricane Milton, said she was surprised to receive a call from the president last week, asking how she and her constituents were doing.""I did not expect that,"" Luna told Fox News Digital. ""I talked to him on the phone for about 10 minutes. The first thing he asked me was what I needed for my constituents, and we discussed the issues with FEMA .""Luna, a first-term congresswoman known for her strong criticism of the Biden administration, met with the president in person when he visited Florida to assess the storm damage. She described their discussion as ""extensive,"" focusing on disaster aid reforms and the response from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).Luna acknowledged the Biden administration and its efforts in handling the situation. ""I have obviously been very critical of President Biden in the past, but him stepping in and taking control to assist for the right reasons was honestly kind of shocking for me,"" she said.Their conversations covered Florida’s recovery and the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Georgia and North Carolina. Luna advocated for changes to the National Flood Insurance Program and pushed for improvements in FEMA's response, particularly regarding debris clearance. She also criticised FEMA's $750 payment to disaster survivors as insufficient. ""Biden agreed and said it was a ‘bunch of malarkey,’ which is 100% true,"" Luna said.Despite her praise for the federal response, Luna remains committed to holding FEMA accountable, while joining a bipartisan group of lawmakers calling for an early emergency session of Congress to address disaster relief funding. However, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has indicated that Congress will not reconvene until after Election Day.","Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, has praised US President Joe Biden for his response to recent natural disasters.

Kamala Harris: JD Vance slams Kamala Harris for allegedly using Wikipedia to write her book,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-slams-kamala-harris-for-allegedly-using-wikipedia-to-write-her-book/articleshow/114227900.cms,"US vice president Kamala Harris and senator JD Vance

US vice president Kamala Harris is facing allegations of plagiarism in her 2009 book 'Smart on Crime', according to a recent report by conservative writer Christopher Rufo . The claims suggest that Harris, who co-authored the book with Joan O’C. Hamilton, lifted multiple sections from uncited sources, including Wikipedia , press releases, and news reports.Adding to the argument, senator JD Vance posted on X, ""Hi, I'm JD Vance.I wrote my own book, unlike Kamala Harris, who copied hers from Wikipedia,"" further sparking discussion on social media.The accusations stem from a review conducted by Stefan Weber, a well-known Austrian expert on plagiarism. He identified more than a dozen instances of what he termed “vicious plagiarism fragments” in the book, with some instances involving minor paraphrasing issues, while others amounted to more serious infractions. These findings have drawn comparisons to other high-profile cases of plagiarism, such as that of Harvard University president Claudine Gay.In one example, Harris is accused of copying a passage about high school graduation rates almost copied from an NBC News report. Another section discussing the High Point crime-reduction strategy was allegedly lifted from a John Jay College of Criminal Justice press release. According to Rufo, the reproduction of material extends to Wikipedia, where Harris reportedly took long sections without attribution. These instances, he argues, raise concerns about the accuracy and integrity of her work.Though Harris may have used a ghostwriter, Rufo argues this doesn’t absolve her of responsibility, emphasising that by putting her name on the cover, she remains accountable for the content.","US vice president Kamala Harris is facing allegations of plagiarism in her 2009 book 'Smart on Crime', according to a recent report by conservative writer Christopher Rufo.

A man armed with guns and fake passes was arrested on Saturday outside Donald Trump 's Coachella rally site at the last minute, reports said citing the local sheriff. The suspect was caught about a mile from the rally venue with a phony-entry pass, according to police. He was also carrying a loaded shotgun, handgun and high capacity magazine. “We probably stopped another assassination attempt,” Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said, as quoted by New York Post.The suspect has been identified as Vem Miller who was carrying a fake press card and entry pass.He is believed to be a member of a rightwing anti-government organization and was plotting to kill Trump, the Sheriff said. ""They were different enough to cause the deputies alarm,"" Bianco said.Miller is believed to be a member of a rightwing anti-government organization. A 49-year-old resident of Las Vegas, Miller was arrested at a checkpoint driving a black SUV. There have been two attempts on Trump's life and at the Coachella rally, Trump was speaking from behind the bulletproof glass.Miller is a registered Republican who holds a master’s degree from UCLA, and who ran for state assembly in Nevada in 2022, a report said.Bianco said Miller considers himself a so-called sovereign citizen, a group of people who do not believe they are subject to any government statutes unless they consent to them.He was released Saturday on $5,000 bail and is scheduled to appear at the Indio Larson Justice Center on Jan. 2, 2025, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department inmate database.The Secret Service put out a brief statement saying it was aware of the arrest. “The incident did not impact protective operations. The Secret Service extends its gratitude to the deputies and local partners who assisted in safeguarding last night’s events,” the agency said.On July 13, Trump was shot at by Matthew Crooks in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks was killed by the Secret Service. In September, Ryan Wesley Routh was arrested for attempting to kill trump at a golf course.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Iran halts indirect talks with US amid Middle East crisis

The White House announced on Monday that the United States has been monitoring threats from Iran against former President Donald Trump for years. It issued a stern warning to Tehran, stating that any attack on a US citizen would result in severe consequences.Calling it a security matter, the White House released a statement.""We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats.Should Iran attack any of our citizens, including those who continue to serve the United States or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences,"" said White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett.Iran announced on Monday that it has paused its indirect discussions with the US, mediated by Oman, due to ongoing tensions in the Middle East.

NEW DELHI: Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, general counsel of the outlawed Sikhs For Justice , issued a public threat against Canadian MP Chandra Arya following the latter's continued condemnation of growing Khalistani extremism in Canada. Pannun's audio message accused Arya of being a ""mouthpiece"" of the Indian govt and called for him to face charges of treason.Pannun ominously added, ""Let's all wait for the final fate of MP Arya.""The threat is part of an escalating series of incidents tied to Khalistani extremists. In another widely circulated video on Monday, Indian high commissioner to Canada Sanjay Verma was depicted as target practice, and his effigy being burned, as extremists accused him of orchestrating the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , whom they labelled a ""shaheed"". The video has fuelled further tensions, underscoring the volatile situation.Former Indian high commissioner to Canada Ajay Bisaria expressed disappointment at the developments and said the geopolitical alignment between India and Canada was being undermined by the Canadian govt's stance.

This will be Kamala Harris's first formal interview with Fox News. Donald Trump wanted a debate with Kamala Harris on this network on September 4 but Kamala campaign did not agree to that. The interview will take place near Philadelphia on Wednesday shortly before it gets aired at 6 PM Eastern Time at Baier's ""Special Report"".The vice president will sit for 25 to 30 minutes.The Kamala Harris-Tim Walz campaign has stepped up their media presence in the last phase of the campaign after it faced flak for avoiding traditional media for the larger part of their campaign. Now Kamala Harris has given may interviews -- but mostly with friendly outlets. She recently gave an interview to CBS 60 Minutes, ABC's The View, Stephen Colbert, Howard Stern, Call Her Daddy podcast etc.New York Times said Kamala Harris will have a chance to deliver her message to a viewership that may be skeptical of her candidacy. Her willingness to appear on Fox News may aid the perception that she is open to facing tough questions. And she can reach a swath of independent voters, more of whom watch Fox News than CNN or MSNBC, according to research by Nielsen.Kamala Harris' running mate Tim Walz has already been interviewed on Fox News Sunday the past two weekends. In recent months, the network has also welcomed a string of Harris supporters, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.At a rally in North Carolina Sunday, Kamala Harris taunted Donald Trump for declining a 60 Minutes interview and for rejecting a second presidential debate turning the table on Trump who questioned Biden's age and Kamala Harris' shying away from interviews. “It makes you wonder — why does his staff want him to hide away?” Harris said. “One must question — are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America?

American icon Lilly Ledbetter , the activist who championed equal pay legislation in the US, has died at the age of 86. Her children reported that she passed away peacefully on Saturday, surrounded by family and loved ones, according to BBC.""Our mother lived an extraordinary life,"" the family said. Ledbetter’s activism led to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, the first bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009.This legislation made it easier for workers to sue for pay discrimination , sending a strong message that “there are no second-class citizens in our workplaces,” according to Obama.For nearly two decades, Ledbetter worked as a supervisor at Goodyear in Alabama before discovering that her male counterparts were earning more for the same role. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that she could not sue, as her complaint was not filed within six months of the discrimination. Her law ultimately overturned that ruling.In a heartfelt tribute on X, Obama remarked that Ledbetter “never set out to be a trailblazer or a household name. She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work.” Just last week, Ledbetter received the Future Is Female Lifetime Achievement Award from Advertising Week, and a film about her life, titled 'Lilly', starring Patricia Clarkson, premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival.","Lilly Ledbetter's activism led to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, the first bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009.

'Don't you want to break into business?'

A fresh new wave of lawsuits against embattled rapper Sean Diddy claimed that the rapper 'raped and threatened to kill' a college student at his party between 1995 through 2021. At least six fresh lawsuits have been filed against Diddy revealing sensational details of what they faced at a Diddy party. One woman said she was a 19-year-old college freshman in 2004 when she was invited to a photoshoot event following which she and her female friend -- also a freshman -- were invited by Diddy to a ""more exclusive party"".According to the court papers, they were whisked to another room by a security guard who locked them and said: ""You know what you are here for.""Then Diddy came into the locked room and pushed drinks and cocaine on the women before ordering his pal to perform oral sex on him, warning that otherwise he would have them both killed.He then forced himself on the plaintiff and “fondled, molested and ultimately raped” her “all while she was begging him to stop,” the suit said.Then the woman who filed the complaint was left in a dark room alone for an hour-and-a-half before another guard told her she could leave.John Does, a man living in North Carolina, alleged that Diddy fondled his genitals when he was 16 at one of the rapper's famous white parties in Long Island's Hamptons in 1998. Diddy explained to him that it was a rite of passage to becoming a music star, at one point asking him: ""Don't you want to break into the business?"" The man said he complied out of fear, anxiety and power imbalance he felt with Combs, only realizing later that what had happened was sexual assault.The 54-year-old music mogul has pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges alleging he coerced and abused women for years with help from a network of associates and employees while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.",At least six fresh lawsuits have been filed against Diddy revealing sensational details of what they faced at a Diddy party.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring a developing weather system in the Atlantic . While the 2024 hurricane season is still ongoing, there are currently no active named storms. The next potential storm , likely to be named Nadine , has yet to form but is being monitored closely.The NHC has identified an area of disturbed weather located several hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands, with a 50 per cent chance of strengthening into a tropical depression within the next week.Meteorologists have not released an official forecast for the potential storm but preliminary tracks suggest it could head towards southeast Florida after passing through Puerto Rico. As of Monday morning, the NHC reported that the system consists of a ""well-defined area of low pressure"" producing ""disorganised showers and thunderstorms.""""This system is currently embedded in a dry environment, and development is unlikely over the next couple of days,"" the NHC said. However, it is expected to move westward towards warmer waters, creating more favourable conditions for storm development later in the week.WFLA-TV chief meteorologist Jeff Berardelli informed Newsweek that while there are no immediate tropical threats, weather models indicate ""lots of tropical waves and moisture festering for the next few weeks.""Additionally, AccuWeather meteorologists are tracking a gyre in the Western Caribbean that may develop into a stronger storm by the week's end. A gyre is a large system of rotating ocean currents that can influence local weather patterns by concentrating moisture and energy in the atmosphere. Jeff Berardelli noted that while ""the models are lukewarm on development,"" warm ocean temperatures associated with this gyre could accelerate tropical storm formation.","The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring a developing weather system in the Atlantic.

How China is lessening its reliance on helium sourced from US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-china-is-lessening-its-reliance-on-helium-sourced-from-us/articleshow/114226212.cms,"In recent years, China has quietly worked to lessen its reliance on helium sourced from the US, a rare and strategically important resource used extensively in industries like healthcare, semiconductors, and quantum computing.This effort has included a range of actions, such as diversifying its international supply sources and boosting domestic production through advancements in science and technology.The strategy appears to be working, according to experts.China used to depend on the US for most of its helium. “If China faces a shortage of helium, the impact on technology would be significant because, in many areas, helium is hard to replace,” said Jost Wuebbeke , managing partner of Sinolytics, a research-based consultancy with offices in Berlin and Beijing.But now, if the US attempts to use helium as leverage in a tech war with China, the potential impact would be “marginal”, said Wuebbeke , whose research focuses on China’s economy and industrial policy.Today the US accounts for less than 5 per cent of China’s helium imports, while Qatar accounts for almost 90 per cent, with an increasing amount of helium also coming from Russia, which is expanding its capacity, he said.The US could restrict Qatar’s access to helium extraction technology as a way of sanctioning China, but “the political costs of damaging relations with Qatar would be greater than the benefits for Washington”, Wuebbeke said.From a supply availability perspective, while the US supplies a little less than half of the world’s helium, there are other major suppliers, notably Russia, which will become the world’s third major supplier when the Amur project – launched by Russia’s largest natural gas company – reaches full capacity in a few years, according to Phil Kornbluth , president of US-based Kornbluth Helium Consulting, which has ties to some Chinese clients, wrote SCMP.As societies become more technology-driven, demand for the valuable gas is soaring.Helium can be chilled to near absolute zero, making it essential for cooling cutting-edge equipment such as quantum computers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, fusion reactors and particle accelerators.Helium is also extremely stable, making it useful in the manufacture of sensitive products such as computer chips and laser light.Driven by rapid growth in the semiconductor industry, among others, China has become the world’s second-largest user of helium; consumption grew by 7.2 per cent between 2020 and 2023.Helium is a by-product of natural gas production, and while China has natural gas, it contains only trace amounts of helium, making direct extraction too expensive for mass production, wrote SCMP.In an article published in late 2022 in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Science, several researchers from PetroChina’s Beijing-based Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development stressed that once the US imposed a “stranglehold” blockade on helium exports to China, the country’s helium supply would be “greatly restricted”.The US has a global monopoly on helium reserves and the most advanced helium extraction technology, they added.But the dynamics have shifted significantly. Last month, achievements in helium extraction and related equipment development were nominated for an annual scientific award by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).These scientific and engineering accomplishments “break the long-standing monopoly of the US and ensure the security of China’s helium resources”, according to the nomination document.In an interview last year with Liaowang, a publication under the state news agency Xinhua, Zhang Suojiang , director of the Institute of Process Engineering, which is also under the CAS, said that to address the low grade and extraction challenges of China’s helium reserves, his institute developed helium separation membrane materials and components, which have shown excellent performance in trials.In 2020, China opened its first large-scale helium plant capable of producing the material at a commercial scale.The Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry under the CAS, which backed the project, said it had successfully extracted helium from natural gas at the plant, located in China’s northwest.China has achieved other significant breakthroughs, particularly in extracting helium from coal bed methane. In 2021, a joint project led by the China Coal Research Institute began, and within two years, the team announced they had successfully overcome the technical challenges and mastered the extraction process.In 2023, China commissioned the world’s first high-purity helium extraction plant from coal bed methane, paving a new path to increase domestic helium production.Meanwhile, scientists are also exploring alternatives to helium for achieving the ultra-low temperatures required in advanced industries. For instance, an international research team, which included physicists from a Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) institute, discovered a cobalt-based quantum magnetic material that could theoretically generate ultra-low temperatures without the need for helium. Their findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature in January.An article published in February by the China National Chemical Information Centre (CNCIC), a prominent consulting firm in the petroleum and chemical sectors, noted that China’s pure helium production capacity remained relatively low until 2020.However, between 2020 and 2023, the country experienced a significant increase in production capacity, driven by advancements in helium extraction technology.Despite these efforts, Wuebbeke pointed out that China’s push to expand domestic capacity has had limited impact so far. While helium production grew fivefold between 2018 and 2022, 92 per cent of the helium consumed in China was still imported.CNCIC projected that by 2028, China would still depend on imports for around 60 per cent of its helium supply. Nonetheless, the organization emphasized that China’s growing domestic production could serve as a valuable bargaining tool, helping to prevent foreign suppliers from arbitrarily raising prices or cutting off supplies, wrote SCMP.","China used to depend on the US for most of its helium. Today the US accounts for less than 5 per cent of China’s helium imports. Qatar accounts for almost 90 per cent, with an increasing amount of helium also coming from Russia, which is expanding its capacity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114226210,imgsize-16714,width-400,resizemode-4/114226210.jpg"

Li is likely to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-funded airport in the southwestern province, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.Neither side commented on the reason for a virtual inauguration, but sources cited heightened security concerns following the recent Karachi attack for Li being advised against travelling to a restive region.Islamabad, too, has sought to temporarily curb the movements of Chinese nationals in the country, citing fears of violence from armed groups. Officials said the Karachi blast is likely to figure in talks between Li and his Pakistani counterpart.“We will review progress on existing initiatives, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), and also explore new avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation. The Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership is the cornerstone of regional stability and prosperity,” Shehbaz wrote on X.According to the foreign office, Li will also call on President Asif Ali Zardari and hold meetings with parliamentary members and the senior military leadership.The two-day SCO meeting starts Tuesday in Islamabad.

"Pakistan to repay over $30 billion debt in FY25, says central bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-repay-over-30-billion-debt-in-fy25-says-central-bank/articleshow/114208042.cms,"Representative Image

Cash-strapped Pakistan 's central bank has revealed the country is scheduled to repay a total of USD 30.35 billion in maturing foreign debt and interest payments in 12 months (August 2024 to July 2025) including those significant loans which bilateral creditors roll over every year.The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, cited by a JS Global report, showed that the payments from August 2024 to July 2025 include significant loans that bilateral creditors roll over annually.The Express Tribune reported that Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.Under the latest USD 7 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Pakistan's repayments and interest payments are fully secured for the 37-month loan period. Despite the rising repayments and interest payments, the foreign debt-to-GDP ratio has decreased from 27.6 per cent in August of the previous year to 20.2 per cent in August 2024, due to the expansion of Pakistan's economy in FY24 compared to the contraction in FY23.The data highlights the increasing foreign debt repayments and interest payments each year, emphasizing the need for economic managers, planners, and parliamentarians to explore ways to boost foreign income and reduce external expenditures. Compared to the USD 21.2 billion (including rollovers) paid by Pakistan over the past 12 months (August 2023 to July 2024), the current 12-month period's repayment and interest payment sum of USD 30 billion is significantly higher, according to JS Global.The increase in repayments and interest payments for the ongoing 12 months can be attributed to fresh loans provided by Saudi Arabia, UAE, and IMF in late June and July 2023, amounting to around USD 4 billion, as well as an additional USD 2 billion lent by IMF between August 2023 and April 2024. These loans have increased the repayment pressure (including significant rollover) in the coming years.Topline Research, citing the latest IMF documents, reported that Pakistan's gross external financing requirement has dropped to a 9-year low of USD 18.8 billion (excluding expected rollovers and contained current account deficit) for the ongoing fiscal year (July 2024 to June 2025). However, another researcher mentioned that Pakistan is also expected to add fresh foreign loans amounting to USD 3 billion to USD 4 billion in the current fiscal year (FY25).A third researcher emphasized the need for Pakistan to reduce its external expenditures through import substitution. Implementing such measures would help improve the country's ability to make external payments and increase foreign exchange reserves, as reported by The Express Tribune.","Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.

"IMF asks Pakistan to end preferential treatment to agriculture, textile sectors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-asks-pakistan-to-end-preferential-treatment-to-agriculture-textile-sectors/articleshow/114205816.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund has asked Pakistan to swiftly end preferential treatment, tax exemptions and other protections for the agriculture and textile sectors, which it says, have stifled the country's growth potential for decades, a media report said here on Monday. The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ), in its staff report on the diagnosis of the factors behind Pakistan's struggling economy, blamed these two sectors not only for failing to contribute adequately to the national revenue but also for consuming large portions of public funds while remaining inefficient and uncompetitive, The Dawn newspaper said.As part of the recently approved USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the IMF stressed that Pakistan must break from its economic practices of the past 75 years to escape its recurrent boom-bust cycles.The IMF report released on October 10 highlighted the country's significant lag behind similar nations, a stagnation that has compromised living standards and pushed over 40.5 per cent of the population below the poverty line.It said Pakistan had struggled to develop more sophisticated export goods, and the share of knowledge-intensive exports remains low as it failed to innovate. As of 2022, Pakistan ranked 85th in the Economic Complexity Index, the same rank it held in 2000.""With an export basket strongly biased towards agriculture and textiles (cotton yarn, rice, woven fabrics, beef, and leather apparel), the country has struggled to reallocate resources towards more technologically complex products,"" it said.The current focus on agriculture has limited Pakistan's ability to diversify into more technologically complex goods. While Pakistan does export some high-value products, such as medicines, medical instruments and plastic products, these sectors operate in a heavily distorted economic environment, it said.The report highlighted tariffs on intermediate and final goods as barriers to competitiveness and domestic market growth, inhibiting the country's transition towards more advanced manufacturing.""Reallocation, however, is held back by existing microeconomic distortions, including public procurement of agricultural goods, price controls on raw inputs, and fiscal and financial incentives for low productivity sectors,"" it observed.The report identified the textile sector as having the highest tax gap relative to its value added, noting that between 2007 and 2022, the sector benefited from subsidies, favourable pricing on inputs, concessional financing schemes and preferential tax treatment.Earlier, the IMF on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to certain conditions. This USD 1 billion tranche came under an agreement to receive USD 7 billion over 39 months.The latest IMF report pointed out that as of May 2024, 70 per cent of the outstanding concessional central bank loans were tied to the textile sector.The IMF recommended that the government focus on simplifying trade policies under the upcoming National Tariff Policy (2025-29) and urged Pakistan to avoid using tariffs to promote industrialisation or protect inefficient sectors, arguing that such policies weaken exports, hinder participation in global value chains, and incentivise rent-seeking.The report also warned that ""trade policies aimed at promoting specific domestic sectors, including export subsidies and local content requirements, should be discontinued as they are likely to promote resource misallocation and may violate international obligations"".Compared to other regional peers, Pakistan's export growth has been weak, with sales to the world particularly stagnant during the 2010s.It said several complex goods were within likely technological proximity to Pakistan's current export basket, including glassware, paints, chemicals, fabrics for industrial use, paper, cosmetics and rubber products.However, to facilitate the development of such new industries, the country needed a level playing field for business, avoiding targeted policies aimed at picking winners.This includes greater integration into global trade and easier access to imports, both as intermediate inputs for production and as final goods to promote domestic competition, the IMF said, adding, the removal of fiscal incentives would reduce the existing misallocation of resources and promote price discovery across firms.","The International Monetary Fund has asked Pakistan to end preferential treatment, tax exemptions and other protections for the agriculture and textile sectors. The IMF stressed that Pakistan must break from its economic practices of the past 75 years to escape its recurrent boom-bust cycles. As of 2022, Pakistan ranked 85th in the Economic Complexity Index.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114205914,imgsize-21518,width-400,resizemode-4/114205914.jpg"

NEW DELHI: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting, well in time for a welcome dinner that will be hosted by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif for the delegates.While both sides have ruled out any formal bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the SCO event, the minister as of now is expected to participate in the dinner and exchange pleasantries with host Shehbaz and counterpart Ishaq Dar, before the main summit on Wednesday.Even though it won’t be a fleeting visit as was previously thought, Jaishankar will likely spend not more than 24 hours in Pakistan before flying back to India.The minister will be in Pakistan on October 15-16 for what will be the first visit by any Indian foreign minister to the country in nearly a decade. However, a day after India confirmed his visit to Pakistan, Jaishankar said he wasn’t going to Islamabad to discuss India’s ties with Pakistan but to be a ``good member’’ of the SCO, which counts India and Pakistan apart from Russia, China, Iran and 4 Central Asian countries as member-states.India hasn’t allowed its differences with Pakistan on the issue of cross-border terrorism , or even the border tensions with China, to come in the way of its participation in the Eurasian bloc that is seen as playing an important role in ensuring regional security. Russia’s presence in the group has also been a motivating factor for India.While a structured bilateral meeting is ruled out, a quick pull aside, possibly behind the scenes, on the margins could still take place but India will expect Islamabad to propose any such meeting. India has continued to maintain that the onus for any forward movement in the relationship, which has not seen any substantive engagement between the 2 countries for the past 9 years, is on Pakistan. For any rapprochement, India sees as essential verifiable and irreversible action by Pakistan against terrorism, and also a review of its decision to downgrade ties after the Indian government revoked the special status of J&K.Pakistan, however, has remained focused on the issue of Kashmir with Dar saying Sunday Islamabad under Shehbaz hasn’t lost an opportunity to raise it along with the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza.Chinese Premier Li Qiang will also be present at the event but there’s no confirmation yet of any bilateral meeting between him and Jaishankar.In his SCO address, Jaishankar is expected to underscore India’s concerns about terrorism, the need to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity while undertaking connectivity and infrastructure initiatives and also to take up concerns of the Global South. The SCO Charter doesn’t allow any member-state to raise bilateral issues and it’s unlikely he will name Pakistan. The minister will represent PM Narendra Modi who had been invited by Shehbaz to participate in the meeting. However, Modi only participates in the heads of state summit and normally deputes the foreign minister to stand in for him at the heads of government meetings.",India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: At least 11 people have been killed and eight more have sustained injuries in a clash between two tribes in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday, Al Jazeera reported.Tensions rose in the Kurram district of the province after two people were critically injured in a shooting incident between rival tribes in the northwestern part of the country.However, the reason for the clashes is not known.As the violence spread, vehicles were targeted in different areas of the district which led to many more casualties, as noted by senior official Javedullah Khan.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is known to be home to over 40 million people who come from various tribal groups and identities.Khan said the injured were taken to a hospital, and efforts were being made to secure travel routes and restore normalcy. The injured were taken to a hospital.Pir Haider Ali Shah, a former parliamentarian and member of a tribal council, said elders had arrived in Kurram to mediate a peace agreement between the tribes.""The recent firing incidents are regrettable and have hampered efforts for lasting peace,"" he said.Notably, tribal group meetings also known as 'Jirgas' are routinely held to ensure peace and stability in the region, as reported by Al Jazeera.In another incident last month, at least 25 people were killed in days of clashes between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both communities live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, according to Al Jazeera.Clashes in the area have seen an uptick as last month alone over 20 people were killed between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, Al Jazeera noted.Meanwhile, on Saturday, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for attacks at a coal mine in Balochistan which saw the death of over 20 individuals including Pakistani as well as Afghan nationals. The attack had involved the use of heavy weapons, rocket launchers and grenades.Such attacks have become common in Balochistan, the southern part of the country known to be home to key natural resources but whose benefits do not translate to uplifting the citizens' quality of life there.The outfits operating from Balochistan accuse the central government in Islamabad of exploiting the province's rich oil and mineral resources to the detriment of the local population in the country's largest and least-populated province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.These groups have also expressed their anger against foreign nationals coming in for resource extraction but deriving profits without benefiting the locals. Attacks on international convoys have thus become a key way for citizens to register protests.BLA gave a higher casualty figure of 30 dead and 18 injured in the incident. It also said that Pakistani security personnel were disguised as workers, without giving evidence.It threatened more assaults unless the military withdrew from the province.Balochistan has been a hotbed of armed movements, with the BLA most prominent among them.Last week, the BLA - designated a ""terrorist group"" by Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States - claimed responsibility for an attack targeting Chinese nationals near Pakistan's largest airport, Al Jazeera reported.The Chinese embassy in Pakistan said at least two of its citizens were killed and a third injured after their convoy was targeted with an improvised explosive device believed to have been detonated by a suicide bomber.At least 10 people were injured in total, with four cars destroyed in the explosion and 10 more vehicles damaged in the resulting fire, local media reported.",Tensions rose in the Kurram district of the province after two people were critically injured in a shooting incident.

Over 100 children die in Pakistan from diphtheria amid shortage of life-saving Antitoxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/over-100-children-die-in-pakistan-from-diphtheria-amid-shortage-of-life-saving-antitoxin/articleshow/114185488.cms,"Pakistan: Over 100 children die due to Diphtheria in Karachi amid lack of facilities

More than 100 children have died in Karachi , Pakistan , this year due to diphtheria, a preventable disease, largely because of the unavailability of Diphtheria Anti-Toxin (DAT), according to a report by Geo News. Despite the availability of vaccines, the shortage of the crucial antitoxin has led to these tragic deaths.Sindh health officials confirmed that 140 cases of diphtheria were recorded last year at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital, with 52 fatalities.Experts say that the lifesaving antitoxin needed to treat the disease is unavailable across Sindh, including Karachi, with treatment costs estimated at 250,000 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) per child.Diphtheria, caused by a bacterium that affects the respiratory tract and skin, produces a toxin that can damage the heart and nerves, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease is vaccine-preventable, but requires multiple doses and boosters to maintain immunity. Those who are unvaccinated or under-immunized are at the highest risk.Health experts in Pakistan have raised concerns about the lack of vaccine coverage and the dire need for intervention. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Director of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI), Muhammad Arif Khan, stressed the importance of timely vaccination to prevent diphtheria outbreaks, emphasizing that the disease can cause severe complications, including difficulty breathing and swallowing.WHO data shows that symptoms of diphtheria, such as sore throat, fever, and swollen neck glands, typically appear 2-5 days after exposure. Without proper treatment, the disease can be fatal in 30% of cases, with young children especially at risk.Global immunization rates have been disrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, further exacerbating the issue. In Pakistan, immunization coverage remains uneven, with some areas like Balochistan reporting rates as low as 38%, well below global standards. The World Bank notes that Pakistan’s immunization coverage ranks among the lowest compared to similarly wealthy countries in Eastern and Southern Asia.Efforts to improve vaccination rates and provide adequate medical resources remain critical to preventing more deaths from this preventable disease.","Sindh health officials confirmed that 140 cases of diphtheria were recorded last year at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital, with 52 fatalities.

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government on Saturday warned to use force if jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's party went ahead to hold a protest in Islamabad on the occasion of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) politic committee, comprising of its key members, decided to hold a protest at D-Chowk in the capital on Tuesday if the government failed to meet its demand to give the 72-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician access to his legal team and a physician, spokesman Zulfiqar Bukhari said.The authorities due to security concerns stopped all meetings with Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail , after the protest by the party over the last weekend.Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that the government would use ""full force"" to stop the PTI's planned protest on the occasion of the SCO summit .""The call for protest on October 15 is an attack on the integrity of the country. We will not allow [anyone] to damage the honour and reputation of the country. The state will use all of its power and resources to prevent the invasion of Islamabad,"" said Asif while speaking to the media in Sialkot.The politician also called for the courts to intervene and take notice of the matter. ""Do the courts not see what the PTI founder is doing with the integrity of the country? The actions of the judiciary today will determine their role in history,"" he said.Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal condemned the protest call by terming it "" political terrorism "" which is aimed at maligning the country. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, he expressed disappointment at the timing of the protest.""Now there is no doubt that terrorism in Karachi and political terrorism protest calls are similar,"" the minister said, adding that both aimed to destabilise the country.Iqbal said the PTI was destroying the economy of the country and urged the party supporters to see the harm caused by their actions.""The PTI is attempting to undermine the government's economic recovery efforts. It's crucial to acknowledge the damage caused by these actions and consider the consequences of supporting policies that hinder Pakistan's growth and development,"" he said.The minister also stated that the country cannot afford destructive politics. ""Just because the PTI's leader is jailed, doesn't justify chaos,"" he said.Separately, federal minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit Baltistan Amir Muqam also strongly rejected the PTI's protest call. ""It is proof of anti-nationalism.

The new on the list is a ban on news media from publishing images of all living things.The Taliban's morality ministry in Afghanistan has announced its intention to enforce a law prohibiting news media from publishing images of all living things. The implementation will be gradual, and officials will focus on persuading people that such images are against Islamic law.Saiful Islam Khyber, the spokesman for the ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice (PVPV), stated, ""Coercion has no place in the implementation of the law.""The new legislation outlines several rules for news media, including the ban on publishing images of living things and the requirement not to mock or humiliate Islam or contradict Islamic law, according to a report by news agency AFP. While some aspects of the law have not yet been strictly enforced, such as advising the public not to take or view images of living things on their devices, the implementation has begun in certain provinces like Kandahar, Helmand, and Takhar.In Ghazni and Maidan Wardak provinces, local journalists were summoned by PVPV officials and informed about the gradual implementation of the law. Visual journalists were advised to adapt their practices, such as taking photos from a distance and filming fewer events. Under the previous Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001, television and pictures of living things were banned nationwide, but a similar edict has not been widely imposed since their return to power in 2021.However, officials have sporadically enforced censorship rules on business owners, such as crossing out faces on advertisements, covering mannequin heads, and blurring the eyes of fish on restaurant menus. The media industry in Afghanistan has suffered since the Taliban takeover, with the number of media employees dropping from 8,400 to 5,100, including only 560 women who have faced severe restrictions dubbed ""gender apartheid"" by the United Nations.","The Taliban's morality ministry in Afghanistan has announced its intention to enforce a law prohibiting news media from publishing images of all living things.

Climber Sandy Irvine’s remains found on Mount Everest after 100 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/climber-sandy-irvines-remains-found-on-mount-everest-after-100-years/articleshow/114188063.cms,"British Climber Sandy Irvine (Left) and apparently his foot (Right) (AP Images)

The mystery of Irvine , who vanished into clouds as mist swept over the Himalayan Summit, was finally solved after 100 years when the National Geographic team spotted a boot melting out of the ice on Mount Everest in September.Andrew ""Sandy"" Ivrine disappeared on Everest on June 8 1924 along with his partner George Mallory while attempting to become the first people to climb the world’s highest peak, the National Geographic said in a report.The team of National Geographic, in September, stumbled on a preserved boot, revealed by melting ice on a glacier. After examining the boot closely, they discovered a sock with ""a red label that has A.C. IRVINE stitched into it.""This discovery could provide further clues about the location of the team's personal effects and may help resolve the mystery of whether Irvine and Mallory ever reached the summit, nearly three decades before the first recognised summit by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.His partner Mallory’s remains were located in 1999, while the whereabouts of Irvine’s were unknown.“It's the first real evidence of where Sandy ended up,” National Geographic documentary director Jimmy Chin said. “A lot of theories have been put out there.” He hopes the discovery helps explain what happened on the mountain in 1924, and brings some closure to Irvine’s relatives who revere him still.“When someone disappears and there’s no evidence of what happened to them, it can be really challenging for families. And just having some definitive information of where Sandy might’ve ended up is certainly [helpful], and also a big clue for the climbing community as to what happened,” he added.Irvine's great-niece, Julie Summers, was moved to tears upon learning of the discovery, stating, ""It tells the whole story about what probably happened.""The Irvine family has offered to share DNA samples to confirm the identity of the remains. Irvine was only 22 years old when he went missing on June 8, 1924, during the final ascent to the summit with Mallory, according to National Geographic .Earlier this year, Mallory's final letter to his wife was digitized and published online by Cambridge University, revealing his doubts about their chances of reaching the summit.Irvine is believed to have been carrying a vest camera, the discovery of which could rewrite mountaineering history. Climb team member and National Geographic explorer Jimmy Chin did not disclose the exact location of the remains to discourage trophy hunters but “it certainly reduces the search area.”","Andrew ""Sandy"" Ivrine disappeared on Everest on June 8 1924 along with his partner George Mallory.
