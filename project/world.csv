Deforestation exacerbated deadly Brazil floods: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/deforestation-exacerbated-deadly-brazil-floods-experts/articleshow/110317946.cms,"PORTO ALEGRE: The floods devastating southern Brazil have been exacerbated by deforestation , much of it driven by soybean farming , according to experts, who urge the country to restore its forests and their vast water-retaining root systems.The key agricultural state of Rio Grande do Sul has been hit by an unprecedented climate disaster for the past three weeks, with cities and rural areas alike inundated by torrential rains that have left more than 150 people dead and some 100 missing.It is the region's fourth extreme weather event in less than a year, a phenomenon scientists say is driven by climate change -- and also deforestation.""There's a global component to climate change, and also a regional one, which is the loss of native vegetation. That increased the intensity of the floods,"" says biologist Eduardo Velez of MapBiomas, an organization that uses satellite images to track deforestation.According to the group, Rio Grande do Sul lost 22 percent of its native vegetation, or 3.6 million hectares (8.9 million acres), from 1985 to 2022.Those wildlands have largely been replaced by fields of rice, eucalyptus and especially soybeans, of which Brazil is the world's biggest producer and exporter.- Vicious cycle -Native forests help ensure water permeates the soil, preventing it from accumulating on the surface, says Jaqueline Sordi, a biologist and journalist based in the region who specializes in climate issues.Vegetation also holds soil in place, helping to prevent erosion and landslides.The deep brown color of the water that has flooded the state capital, Porto Alegre, along with 90 percent of Rio Grande do Sul's towns, ""shows just how many tons and tons of soil were washed away"" in the rains, Velez told AFP.In a vicious cycle, that mud has now accumulated in the beds of rivers, making them shallower -- and therefore more likely to flood next time.""Beyond relocating people (from high-risk areas) and rebuilding infrastructure, it's extremely important to have policies on restoring native vegetation,"" said Velez.Rio Grande do Sul ""urgently"" needs to restore more than a million hectares of forests in order for them to adequately perform their proper environmental role, according to a 2023 study by the sustainable development group Instituto Escolhas.But Velez says there is still no ""heavyweight"" plan to do that in Rio Grande do Sul, despite a deal it signed last year with other states in southern and southeastern Brazil to reforest 90,000 hectares by 2026.- 'Open people's eyes' -At the national level, deforestation surged under the government of far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, a climate-change skeptic and ally of the powerful agribusiness sector who was in office from 2019 to 2022.""It became easier to get permits (to clear vegetation), and Rio Grande do Sul played a big role"" in benefitting from those permits, said Sordi.A local municipal council member from Bolsonaro's Liberal Party, Sandro Fantinel, caused controversy last week by saying the region should clear more trees around roads, arguing their weight and water-swollen roots had caused landslides during the floods.Sordi says disasters like the current one have the potential to ""open people's eyes"" to the scientific evidence of climate change and its ""warning signs.""""Sometimes we only pay attention when the problem arrives.""","Rio Grande do Sul has been hit by an unprecedented climate disaster for the past three weeks.

It's so hot in Mexico that howler monkeys are falling dead from the trees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/its-so-hot-in-mexico-that-howler-monkeys-are-falling-dead-from-the-trees/articleshow/110317552.cms,"MEXICO CITY: It's so hot in Mexico that howler monkeys are falling dead from the trees.At least 83 of the midsize primates, who are known for their roaring vocal calls, were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco . Others were rescued by residents, including five that were rushed to a local veterinarian who battled to save them.""They arrived in critical condition, with dehydration and fever,"" said Dr Sergio Valenzuela.""They were as limp as rags. It was heatstroke.""While Mexico's brutal heatwave has been linked to the deaths of at least 26 people since March, veterinarians and rescuers say it has killed dozens and perhaps hundreds of howler monkeys.In the town of Tecolutilla, Tabasco, the dead monkeys started appearing on Friday, when a local volunteer fire-and-rescue squad showed up with five of the creatures in the bed of the truck.Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and can be around 2 feet (60 centimeters) tall, with tails as long again. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly, their lion-like roars, which bely their size, are what they're known for.""They (the volunteers) asked for help, they asked if I could examine some of the animals they had in their truck,"" Valenzuela said Monday. ""They said they didn't have any money, and asked if I could do it for free.""The veterinarian put ice on their limp little hands and feet, and hook them up to IV drips with electrolytes.So far, the monkeys appear to be on the mend. Once listless and easily handled, they are now in cages at Valenzuela's office. ""They're recovering. They're aggressive ... they're biting again,"" he said, noting that's a healthy sign for the usually furtive creatures.Most aren't so lucky. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo counted about 83 of the animals dead or dying on the ground under trees. The die-off started around May 5 and hit its peak over the weekend.""They were falling out of the trees like apples,"" Pozo said. ""They were in a state of severe dehydration, and they died within a matter of minutes."" Already weakened, Pozo says the falls from dozens of yards (meters) up inflict additional damage that often finishes the monkeys off.Pozo attributes the deaths to a ""synergy"" of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat.For people in the steamy, swampy, jungle-covered state of Tabasco, the howler monkey is a cherished, emblematic species; local people say the monkeys tell them the time of day, by howling at dawn and dusk.Pozo said the local people - who he knows through his work with the Biodiversity Conservation of The Usumacinta group - have tried to help the monkeys they see around their farms. But he notes that could be a double-edged sword.""They were falling out of the trees, and the people were moved, and they went to help the animals, they set out water and fruit for them,"" Pozo said. ""They want to care for them, mainly the baby monkeys, adopt them.""""But no, the truth is that babies are very delicate, they can't be in a house where there are dogs or cats, because they have pathogens that can potentially be fatal for howler monkeys,"" he said, stressing they must be rehabilitated and released into the wild.Pozo's group has set up a special recovery stations for monkeys - it currently holds five monkeys, but birds and reptiles have also been affected - and is trying to organize a team of specialized veterinarians to give the primates the care they need.Belatedly, the federal government acknowledged the problem Monday, with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador saying he had heard about it on social media. He congratulated Valenzuela on his efforts and said the government would seek to support the work.Lopez Obrador acknowledged the heat problem - ""I have never felt it as bad as this"" - but he has a lot of human problems to deal with as well.By May 9 at least nine cities in Mexico had set temperature records, with Ciudad Victoria, in the border state of Tamaulipas, clocking a broiling 117 F (47 C).With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up, water supplies are running out and authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.Consumers are feeling the heat as well. On Monday, the nationwide chain of OXXO convenience stores - the nation's largest - said it was limiting purchases of ice to just two or three bags per customer in some places.""In a period of high temperatures, OXXO is taking measures to ensure supplies of products for our customers,"" parent company FEMSA said in a statement. ""Limits on the sale of bagged ice seek to ensure that a larger number of customers can buy this product.""But for the monkeys, it's not a question of comfort, but of life or death.""This is a sentinel species,"" Pozo said, referring to the canary-in-a-coal mine effect where one species can say a lot about an ecosystem. ""It is telling us something about what is happening with climate change.""","At least 83 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco.

Donald Trump opts not to testify as defense rests in hush-money trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-opts-not-to-testify-as-defense-rests-in-hush-money-trial/articleshow/110317107.cms,"NEW DELHI: The defense rested their case in Donald Trump ’s criminal trial on Tuesday, without calling the former president to testify.Despite Trump’s earlier complaints about being silenced and his false claims that he was not permitted to testify, he ultimately chose not to take the stand in his own defense.Trump’s decision to refrain from testifying came without fanfare.While not surprising, as defendants in criminal cases often opt not to testify to avoid potentially harming their defense during cross-examination, it followed several instances of Trump claiming he was prohibited from doing so.Judge Juan Merchan addressed Trump's claims directly, emphasizing, “I want to stress, Mr Trump, that you have an absolute right to testify at trial.” He also clarified that the gag order preventing Trump from verbally attacking witnesses did not impact his right to take the stand.After the defense rested, Judge Merchan instructed jurors to return on Tuesday, May 28, for closing arguments. He also mentioned that he would provide instructions to the jurors the following day and anticipated that deliberations would commence thereafter.The trial resumed on Monday with the continued cross-examination of Robert Costello, who the defense has relied on to challenge the credibility of Michael Cohen, the former president’s one-time fixer.Trump arrived in the courtroom just before 9:30 am. The former president, widely expected to be the Republican presidential nominee, faces charges of falsifying business records concerning the payment of $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep silent about an alleged sexual encounter.Manhattan prosecutors assert that in the summer of 2015, Trump collaborated with his then-consigliere Michael Cohen and former tabloid executive David Pecker to conceal any damaging information, aiming to safeguard his candidacy in the 2016 election.Cohen informed jurors that he coordinated the payment to Daniels weeks before Election Day and personally covered the cost. He testified that the campaign was deeply worried that Daniels's story could severely damage Trump's chances in the presidential race, especially following the emergence of a highly embarrassing hot mic recording where Trump boasted about non-consensual groping.During his four-day testimony, Cohen recounted a moment when a furious Trump directed him to silence Daniels's story, instructing him to ""just take care of it.""“This was a disaster, a fucking disaster,” Cohen recalled Trump saying. “Women will hate me.”Cohen also revealed to the jury that he had worked to keep Daniels's story under wraps back in 2011, collaborating with her then-lawyer to remove a piece about their alleged encounter from a gossip website.During cross-examination, Trump's legal team struggled to land significant blows. The closest they came was when Blanche managed to get Cohen to effectively admit to over-billing the Trump Organization for reimbursement for a payment made to a tech company called Red Finch, aimed at skewing a poll about famous business figures in favor of Donald Trump.Cohen acknowledged paying the tech company $50,000 but revealed the actual payment was $20,000. Blanche questioned whether Cohen had pocketed the $30,000 difference. “So you stole from the Trump Organization?” Blanche asked. “Yes, sir,” Cohen replied.On Monday, the prosecution concluded its case, and Trump’s defense began theirs. The day concluded with testimony from Costello, a lawyer Cohen had mentioned during his four days on the stand. Cohen stated that he met with Costello after law enforcement raided his hotel room and home in April 2018 but was hesitant about retaining him as legal representation due to his association with Rudy Giuliani.","The defense rested their case in Donald Trump ’s criminal trial on Tuesday, without calling the former president to testify.

Russia begins nuclear drills in an apparent warning to West over Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-begins-nuclear-drills-in-an-apparent-warning-to-west-over-ukraine/articleshow/110314141.cms,"Russia 's military on Tuesday began drills involving tactical nuclear weapons that were announced by Russian authorities earlier this month in an apparent warning to senior Western officials who had spoken about the possibility of deeper involvement in the war in Ukraine .It was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises.According to a statement by the Defense Ministry released Tuesday, the first stage of the new drills envisioned ""practical training in the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,"" including nuclear-capable Kinzhal and Iskander missiles.The maneuvers are taking place in the Southern Military District, which consists of Russian regions in the south, including on the border with Ukraine; Crimea, illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014; and four Ukrainian regions that Russia illegally annexed in 2022 and partially occupies.The drills were announced on May 6, with the Defense Ministry saying in a statement that they would come in response to ""provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation.""Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons - massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.The announcement came after French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. The Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on May 6 that Macron's statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills , calling the remarks ""a new round of escalation.""","Russia's military begins drills involving tactical nuclear weapons.

Israel takes back order to cut AP live Gaza video feed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-takes-back-order-to-cut-ap-live-gaza-video-feed/articleshow/110313389.cms,"NEW DELHI: Israel has reversed its decision to shut down an Associated Press ( AP ) live video feed from Gaza , following protests from the US news agency and concerns raised by the White House .Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi had initially ordered the confiscation of AP's equipment, accusing the agency of breaching a new ban on providing rolling footage of Gaza to Al Jazeera .However, after Washington called on Israel to reverse the move, Karhi revoked the order and instructed the return of the equipment to AP.The White House spokesperson said, ""We've been engaging directly with the government of Israel to express our concerns over this action and to ask them to reverse it.""AP, in its statement, said it 'decries in the strongest terms' the move by the Israeli government and expressed concern about the use of the foreign broadcaster law and the ability of independent journalists to operate freely in Israel.Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid criticised the government's decision, emphasising that AP is an American media outlet that has won numerous Pulitzer Prizes.The United Nations also condemned the move as 'shocking,' with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, stating that AP should be allowed to work freely without harassment.The incident occurred after Israel took Al Jazeera off the air earlier this month, shutting down its Jerusalem offices, confiscating its equipment, and revoking its team's accreditations. The communications ministry claimed that AP had been warned about violating the law by broadcasting images of Gaza, including focusing on the activities and location of Israeli soldiers, but continued to do so.Press freedom organisations and media watchdogs have expressed alarm over Israel's actions, with the Foreign Press Association in Israel calling the move against AP 'outrageous censorship' and highlighting Israel's 'dismal' record on press freedom during the Gaza war.In the 2024 press freedom index by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Israel ranked 101st out of 180 countries, dropping four positions from the previous year.The Gaza war, which broke out after Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 Israelis, mostly civilians. Hamas also took 252 hostages, with 124 remaining in Gaza, including 37 whom the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,647 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.","Israel has reversed its decision to shut down an Associated Press ( AP ) live video feed from Gaza.

"Baltimore bridge collapse: 20 Indians on board facing ‘tough’ time on Dali, say 'situation getting worse'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-20-indians-on-board-facing-tough-time-on-dali-say-situation-getting-worse/articleshow/110286969.cms,"Dali refloated, moved back to port

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Twenty-one sailors aboard the Dali ship are enduring severe hardships as they remain stranded at sea. The vessel, which has been immobilized for an extended period due to mechanical issues , has left the crew in a precarious situation without access to essential resources.One of the sailors, speaking on the condition of anonymity, shed light on the dire conditions they are facing: “Life is tough.We don’t have access to proper food, water, or medical supplies. The situation is getting worse every day.” The sailor’s account highlights the urgent need for relief and assistance, as the crew’s basic needs are not being met, a New York Post report said.The ordeal began when the Dali ship encountered mechanical problems that halted its journey, leaving it adrift and unable to reach a safe harbor. Despite efforts to secure assistance, the response has been sluggish, compounding the crew's struggles. The lack of immediate aid has left the sailors feeling isolated and abandoned.Another sailor shared the emotional toll of their situation: “We are trying to stay hopeful, but it’s hard. We need help soon.” The prolonged uncertainty and harsh living conditions have taken a significant toll on the crew's morale and well-being. The sailors are confined to the ship with limited communication with the outside world, adding to their sense of isolation.The update came following reports that the 20 Indian crew stuck in Baltimore can not pay bills for their families in India as their phones have been confiscated by the probe agencies.Authorities are reportedly working on a solution to rescue the stranded sailors, but the timeline for such efforts remains unclear. The delay in providing assistance has raised concerns about the welfare of the crew, as their situation grows increasingly desperate with each passing day.Family members of the stranded sailors have also expressed their anxiety and frustration. One relative, who wished to remain unnamed, said, “We are worried sick. It’s been too long, and we need answers. Our loved ones are out there suffering, and it feels like nothing is being done.”Maritime experts have pointed out the importance of swift action in such situations. Prolonged delays not only jeopardize the physical health of the crew but also pose psychological risks. “In cases like this, immediate intervention is crucial to prevent a humanitarian crisis,” said a maritime safety expert.As the world watches and waits, the stranded sailors aboard the Dali ship continue to hope for a timely rescue. Their story is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities faced by those who work at sea and the critical need for efficient emergency response mechanisms in maritime operations.Meanwhile, recovery teams refloated Dali in the Port of Baltimore early on Monday and pulled it free of the main channel, two months after the boat crashed into the Francis Scott Key bridge and caused the span to collapse.Tugboats led the Dali to a local marine terminal after a successful effort to make the container ship buoyant at about 6:40am EDT (1040 GMT), the US Army Corps of Engineers said on social media platform X.The removal of the Dali marked a significant step in the Port of Baltimore's recovery from the boat's March 26 collision with one of the bridge's support pillars. The bridge's collapse killed six road workers and hindered traffic through the busiest port for car shipments in the US.President Joe Biden praised the team that freed the ship from its weeks-long imprisonment under the bridge's wreckage in a post on X on Monday.""It took the grit of workers and officials coming together to get this done,"" Biden said. ""That's Baltimore Strong.""",Twenty-one sailors aboard the Dali ship are enduring severe hardships as they remain stranded at sea.

"Andhra-born Gopi Thotakura makes history, becomes first Indian to go to space as tourist",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/andhra-born-gopi-thotakura-makes-history-becomes-first-indian-to-go-to-space-as-tourist/articleshow/110255096.cms,"India-born Gopi Thotakura made history on Sunday evening as he became the first Indian citizen to venture into space as a tourist. He was part of the elite crew for Blue Origin ’s New Shepard-25 (NS-25) mission, which took off from the company’s West Texas launch site in the US around 8:05 pm (IST), an hour late from its scheduled launch time of 9:35 am (local US time).Born in Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh), Gopi, an entrepreneur and a pilot, journeyed to the edge of space beyond the Earth’s atmosphere along with five others — Ed Dwight, Mason Angel, Sylvain Chiron, Kenneth L Hess and Carol Schaller. Ed Dwight (90) is now the oldest man on Earth to go to space.Gopi has retained his Indian passport despite working in the US. Although he became the first Indian citizen to go to space as a tourist, he is officially the second astronaut from the country after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma, who flew as a professional cosmonaut to space on board Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984, as part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme. Astronauts Kalpana Chawla, Sunita Williams, Raja Chari, and Sirisha Bandla were all US citizens of Indian origin who also went to space as professional astronauts. TOI had earlier reported on Gopi’s probable entry to the elite astronaut club.Following takeoff, the NS-25 vehicle reached beyond the boundary of space smoothly. The rocket and capsule then returned to Earth, with the rocket landing upright a few minutes after takeoff. The capsule successfully touched down, using two of its three parachutes, roughly 15 minutes after takeoff. It was Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin’s first crew launch in nearly two years. “Capsule touchdown. Welcome back, NS25 crew!” Blue Origin said in a post on X.Introducing the Indian space tourist , a Blue Origin statement said, “Gopi Thotakura is a lifelong pilot and aviator who learned how to fly before he could drive. He flies jets commercially, in addition to piloting bush, aerobatic, and seaplanes. Gopi is a co-founder of Preserve Life Corp, a global center for holistic wellness and applied health located near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.”He studied for a BSc in aeronautical science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, US. A trained pilot, Gopi had worked in medical air evacuation services in India in the past. “A lifelong traveller, his most recent adventure took him to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro,” the statement said.In another first, America’s first Black astronaut candidate, Ed Dwight, finally rocketed into space 60 years later. Dwight, a former Air Force captain who was selected in 1961 but never got to fly to space with NASA, finally reached the edge of space — at 90 years, 8 months, and 10 days. He thus became the oldest person to go to space, narrowly surpassing Star Trek actor William Shatner, who was almost two months younger when he launched with Blue Origin in 2021.This flight is Blue Origin’s first tourist mission on New Shepard since August 2022. The company was forced to halt flights of the rocket after a New Shepard vehicle suffered an engine failure mid-flight during an uncrewed mission in Sep 2022. Blue Origin spent most of 2023 investigating the failure and making design corrections, and the company successfully returned to flight with another uncrewed mission in Dec.This mission was the seventh human flight for the New Shepard programme and the 25th in its history. Earlier, Blue Origin launched six tourist missions, flying celebrities like William Shatner, Michael Strahan, and Bezos himself to space. In all, New Shepard has flown 31 humans above the internationally recognized boundary of space, the company said.The company, seen as a future key strategic rival to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, plans to debut a much larger and more powerful New Glenn rocket later this year, capable of launching cargo to orbit. Blue Origin also aims to send humans to the moon later this decade for NASA.","India-born Gopi Thotakura made history on Sunday evening as he became the first Indian citizen to venture into space as a tourist.

NEW DELHI: The International Criminal Court (ICC) is pursuing arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant, and two other top Hamas leaders, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (also known as Mohammed Deif) and Ismail Haniyeh, according to a statement released by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan on Monday.The charges are related to the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, which Khan alleges constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity .The charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh, and al-Masri include ""extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention"", while the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include ""causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,"" said Khan in his statement.The ICC's decision to target Netanyahu marks the first time the court has sought an arrest warrant for the top leader of a close US ally, placing him in the same category as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is also facing an ICC arrest warrant over the war in Ukraine.A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan's application for the arrest warrants.Israel's top leaders slammed the development as a ""historical disgrace"".A furious Netanyahu lashed out at the ICC and the prosecutor, stating that the ""absurd"" move was ""exactly what new anti-Semitism looks like"".Vowing to bring down Hamas and achieve total victory, Netanyahu said Israel was fighting a ""just war"".Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz also hit out at the ICC chief prosecutor, stating: ""The Attorney General in the same breath mentions the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel alongside the abominable Nazi monsters of Hamas -- a historical disgrace that will be remembered forever.""Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz slammed the move which he said draws ""parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation (Hamas)"". ""It is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,"" he added.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri also panned the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that the decision ""equates the victim with the executioner"" and encourages Israel to continue its ""war of extermination"" in Gaza.Wasel Abu Youssef, member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee, said: ""The Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves ... The ICC is required to issue arrest warrants against Israeli officials who are pursuing crimes of genocide in the Gaza Strip.""When reports of the potential ICC action surfaced last month, Netanyahu called it ""an outrage of historic proportions"" and asserted that Israel has an independent legal system that thoroughly investigates all violations of the law. In response to Netanyahu's comments, Khan stated, ""Nobody is above the law,"" and advised Israel to raise a challenge before the court's judges if they disagree with the ICC's jurisdiction.Although Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, the court claims jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court's founding principles in 2015.The US also slammed the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that such a ""shameful"" decision puts ""truce talks at risk"".""We reject the prosecutor's equivalence of Israel with Hamas ... The ICC arrest decisions could jeopardise efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement, hostage deal and to increase humanitarian aid in Gaza,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.","ICC pursuing arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant.

Raisi helicopter crash: Who is Mohammad Mokhber? Iran’s interim president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-is-mohammad-mokhber-irans-first-vice-president-likely-to-be-president/articleshow/110260974.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Mohammad Mokhber who was Iran's first vice president, has been appointed as the interim president following Mohammad Raisi's death in a chopper crash on May 19. Born on September 1, 1955, in Dezful, Khuzestan Province, he has a background in business administration and management. Known for his close ties to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , Mokhber assumed the role of first vice president in 2021 following Ebrahim Raisi 's election as president.In his capacity as interim president, Mokhber is part of a three-person council, along with the Speaker of Parliament and the head of the judiciary, responsible for organizing a new presidential election within 50 days if the president dies.Mokhber held several significant positions in Iran's economic and industrial sectors, notably serving as the head of Setad, an investment fund linked to the Supreme Leader. Setad, officially the Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam, was established by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to manage and sell properties abandoned after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, with proceeds primarily directed to charity.Mokhber was also involved in international dealings and was part of a delegation that visited Moscow in October, agreeing to supply surface-to-surface missiles and drones to Russia's military. This delegation included senior officials from Iran's Revolutionary Guards and an official from the Supreme National Security Council.His activities have led to international scrutiny. In 2010, the European Union sanctioned Mokhber for alleged involvement in nuclear or ballistic missile activities, though he was removed from the list two years later. In 2013, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Setad and 37 associated companies.Mokhber was previously the head of Setad, an investment fund linked to the Supreme Leader.

Throughout the hearing, protesters repeatedly interrupted Blinken, accusing him of being a war criminal and responsible for a genocide against the Palestinian people.Blinken condemned the ICC prosecutor's move to seek arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, stating that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction and that equating Israeli officials with Hamas leaders was 'extremely wrong-headed.' He assured senators that the administration would work with them to formulate an appropriate response if necessary.The Secretary of State also addressed the administration's condolences for the deaths of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and others in a helicopter crash, clarifying that such gestures are typical when 'countries - adversaries, enemies or not - have lost leaders.' He emphasised that this did not change the administration's stance on Raisi's rreprehensible conduct' as a judge and President.Meanwhile, Brett McGurk, a top Middle East adviser to President Biden, engaged in indirect talks with Iran's acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, in Oman last week.

While his core conservative supporters want tougher restrictions, sweeping bans on the procedure have typically been rejected by voters at the ballot box.In March he suggested he would favor a national abortion ban after 15 or 16 weeks of pregnancy, but later backtracked to say such decisions should be left up to the states, of which 21 have total or partial abortion bans in place.Trump told Time magazine in April that he had ""pretty strong views"" on women's access to mifepristone, a medication used for abortions, and would share his views on it within a week, but never did so.The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling has cost Republicans politically.

Biden releasing 1 million barrels of gasoline from Northeast reserve in bid to lower prices at pump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-releasing-1-million-barrels-of-gasoline-from-northeast-reserve-in-bid-to-lower-prices-at-pump/articleshow/110311684.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Biden administration said Tuesday that it is releasing 1 million barrels of gasoline from a Northeast reserve established after Superstorm Sandy in a bid to lower prices at the pump this summer.The sale, from storage sites in New Jersey and Maine, will be allocated in increments of 100,000 barrels at a time. The approach will create a competitive bidding process that ensures gasoline can flow into local retailers ahead of the July 4 holiday and sold at competitive prices, the Energy Department said.The move is intended to help ""lower costs for American families and consumers,″ the department said in a statement.Gas prices average about $3.60 per gallon nationwide as of Tuesday, up 6 cents from a year ago, according to AAA. Tapping gasoline reserves is one of the few actions a president can take by himself to try to control inflation, an election year liability for the party in control of the White House.""The Biden-Harris administration is laser-focused on lowering prices at the pump for American families, especially as drivers hit the road for summer driving season,″ Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in the statement. ""By strategically releasing this reserve in between Memorial Day and July 4th, we are ensuring sufficient supply flows to the tri-state (area) and Northeast at a time hardworking Americans need it the most.""White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said release of gas from the Northeast reserve builds on actions by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, ""to lower gas and energy costs - including historic releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the largest-ever investment in clean energy.″Biden significantly drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, dropping the stockpile to its lowest level since the 1980s. The election year move helped stabilize gasoline prices that had been rising in the wake of the war in Europe but drew complaints from Republicans that the Democratic president was playing politics with a reserve meant for national emergencies.The Biden administration has since begun refilling the oil reserve, which had more than 364 million barrels of crude oil as of last month. The total is lower than levels before the Russia-Ukraine war but still the world's largest emergency crude oil supply.The Northeast sale will require that fuel is transferred or delivered no later than June 30, the Energy Department said.""While congressional Republicans fight to preserve tax breaks for Big Oil at the expense of hardworking families, President Biden is advancing a more secure, affordable, and clean energy future to lower utility bills while record American energy production helps meet our immediate needs,"" Jean-Pierre said.","The sale, from storage sites in New Jersey and Maine, will be allocated in increments of 100,000 barrels at a time.

Trump's lawyers rest case in hush money trial without calling him to testify,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-lawyers-rest-case-in-hush-money-trial-without-calling-him-to-testify/articleshow/110309376.cms,"NEW YORK: Donald Trump 's defense team rested its case in the criminal hush money trial on Tuesday without calling the former U.S. president to testify .Trump's lawyers called two witnesses in his defense. Justice Juan Merchan said jurors would return next Tuesday to hear closing arguments, with deliberations likely beginning the following day.Trump's lawyers had asked Merchan to dismiss the case before it reaches the jury, arguing that it rests on the testimony of a witness, the estranged former Trump fixer Michael Cohen, who has a well-documented history of lying.Such dismissal motions are rarely successful, and Merchan indicated on Monday that he was inclined to let jurors assess Cohen's credibility for themselves. Prosecutors say his testimony is buttressed by other evidence.Cohen, the prosecution's final witness, wrapped up his testimony on Monday, clearing the way for Trump's lawyers to present witnesses and their own evidence.Lawyer Robert Costello, the second witness called by Trump's defense, testified on Monday that Cohen told him he did not have any incriminating information on Trump.Costello's demeanor on the witness stand apparently angered Merchan on Monday, who cleared the courtroom to tell him, ""Don't roll your eyes."" Costello resumed testifying on Tuesday before the defense rested its case.Trump is accused of covering up a $130,000 payment that bought the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels, who in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential election was peddling her story of a sexual encounter with Trump.Though the hush-money payment itself is not illegal, Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide his reimbursement to Cohen, who initially paid for the transaction.Trump, 77, has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. He says he never had sex with Daniels and has cast the trial as a politically motivated attempt to hurt his effort to win back the White House as a Republican from Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.Cohen testified that he spoke repeatedly with Trump about the payment to Daniels in the final stretch of the 2016 presidential campaign when Trump was facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.Cohen said Trump worried that Daniels would hurt his appeal to women voters if she went public with her story. Trump's legal team says he made the payment to protect his family from embarrassment.Cohen admitted on the witness stand on Monday that he had stolen money from Trump's business, saying he was angry his bonus was cut after he handled the Daniels payment.","Donald Trump's defense team rested its case in the criminal hush money trial on Tuesday without calling the former U.S. president to testify.

Defense witness who angered the judge in Trump's hush money trial will return to the stand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/defense-witness-who-angered-the-judge-in-trumps-hush-money-trial-will-return-to-the-stand/articleshow/110308390.cms,"NEW YORK: A defense witness in Donald Trump 's hush money case whom the judge threatened to remove from the trial over his behavior will return to the stand Tuesday as the trial nears its end.Trump's lawyers are hoping Robert Costello 's testimony will help undermine the credibility of a key prosecution witness , Trump fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen .""They have no case,"" Trump said outside the courtroom Tuesday. ""There's no crime.""But Costello angered Judge Juan Merchan on Monday by making comments under his breath, rolling his eyes and calling the whole exercise ""ridiculous,"" prompting the judge to briefly kick reporters out of the courtroom to admonish him.The judge told Costello, a former federal prosecutor, he was being ""contemptuous,"" adding, ""If you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand,"" according to a court transcript.Costello didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday from The Associated Press.The chaotic scene unfolded after prosecutors rested their case accusing Trump of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to bury stories that he feared could hurt his 2016 campaign. Thecriminal trial , the first of a former US president, is in the final stretch, with closing arguments expected the Tuesday after Memorial Day.The charges stem from internal Trump Organization records in which payments to Cohen were marked as legal expenses. Prosecutors say they were really reimbursements for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public before the 2016 election with claims of a sexual encounter with Trump. Trump says nothing sexual happened between them.Trump has said he did nothing illegal and has slammed the case as an effort to hinder his 2024 bid to reclaim the White House. Trump, a Republican, called the judge a ""tyrant"" in remarks to reporters while leaving the courthouse Monday and called the trial a ""disaster"" for the country.After jurors left for the day Monday, defense attorneys pressed the judge to throw out the charges before jurors even begin deliberating, arguing prosecutors have failed to prove their case. The defense has suggested that Trump was trying to protect his family, not his campaign, by squelching what he says were false, scurrilous claims.Defense attorney Todd Blanche argued that there was nothing illegal about soliciting a tabloid's help to run positive stories about Trump, run negative stories about his opponents and identify potentially damaging stories before they were published. No one involved ""had any criminal intent,"" Blanche said.""How is keeping a false story from the voters criminal?"" Blanche asked.Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo shot back that ""the trial evidence overwhelmingly supports each element"" of the alleged offenses and said the case should proceed to the jury.The judge didn't immediately rule on the defense's request. Such long-shot requests are often made in criminal cases but are rarely granted.The defense called Costello because of his role as an antagonist to Cohen since their professional relationship splintered in spectacular fashion. Costello had offered to represent Cohen soon after the lawyer's hotel room, office and home were raided and as Cohen faced a decision about whether to remain defiant in the face of a criminal investigation or to cooperate with authorities in hopes of securing more lenient treatment.Costello in the years since has repeatedly maligned Cohen's credibility and was even a witness before last year's grand jury that indicted Trump, offering testimony designed to undermine Cohen's account. In a Fox News Channel interview last week, Costello accused Cohen of lying to the jury and using the case to ""monetize"" himself.Costello contradicted Cohen's testimony describing Trump as intimately involved in all aspects of the hush money scheme. Costello told jurors Monday that Cohen told him Trump ""knew nothing"" about the hush money payment to Daniels.""Michael Cohen said numerous times that President Trump knew nothing about those payments, that he did this on his own, and he repeated that numerous times,"" Costello testified.Cohen, however, testified earlier Monday that he has ""no doubt"" that Trump gave him a final sign-off to make the payments to Daniels. In total, he said he spoke with Trump more than 20 times about the matter in October 2016.Trump lawyer Emil Bove told the judge that the defense does not plan to call any other witnesses after Costello, though it may still call campaign finance expert Bradley A. Smith for limited testimony. It has not said definitively that Trump won't testify, but that's the clearest indication yet that he will waive his right to take the stand in his own defense.","Robert Costello angered Judge Juan Merchan on Monday by making comments under his breath, rolling his eyes and calling the whole exercise ""ridiculous"" The judge told Costello, a former federal prosecutor, he was being ""contemptuous,"" adding, ""If you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand,"" according to a court transcript.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110308579,imgsize-1305656,width-400,resizemode-4/110308579.jpg"

Video posted online showed police at times using what appeared to be an irritant to spray people, who were forced to retreat.The encampment had been set up in late April near the end of the school year and as families arrived for spring commencement. Posters taunting President Santa Ono and other officials were also displayed.After the camp was cleared, nearby buildings, including the undergraduate and graduate libraries, were closed, and police turned away students who showed up to study.Ono said in a statement that the encampment had become a threat to safety, with overloaded power sources and open flames. Organizers, he added, had refused to comply with requests to make changes following an inspection by a fire marshal.""The disregard for safety directives was only the latest in a series of troubling events centered on an encampment that has always violated the rules that govern the Diag - especially the rules that ensure the space is available to everyone,"" Ono said.Protesters have demanded that the school's endowment stop investing in companies with ties to Israel .

"Trump or Biden? Either way, US seems poised to preserve heavy tariffs on imports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-or-biden-either-way-us-seems-poised-to-preserve-heavy-tariffs-on-imports/articleshow/110302294.cms,"NEW DELHI: The continuity in trade policies between the Trump and Biden administrations has raised eyebrows and stirred debates among industry leaders and economists alike. Despite stark differences in other policy arenas, particularly taxes and immigration, both presidents have maintained a protectionist stance, leaving many wondering about the future trajectory of US trade relations .The story of Clips & Clamps Industries, a Michigan auto supplier, epitomizes the challenges faced by American businesses amidst these trade policies. Initially impacted by President Trump's 25% tariff on foreign steel, the company hoped for relief with Biden's presidency, only to find that the new administration largely preserved Trump's tariffs, extending them to include aluminum and various Chinese goods.Jeff Aznavorian, the company president, expressed surprise at the continuity between the two administrations, highlighting the unexpected alignment in their trade approaches. Both leaders have emphasized protecting American industries , particularly in key battleground states crucial for electoral success.Trump's tenure as president saw a brazen implementation of tariffs, aimed at reducing trade deficits and revitalizing the manufacturing sector . While some agreements were renegotiated, such as the North American trade deal, and China made commitments to purchase more American goods, the overall impact on manufacturing employment remained limited.Biden's approach, while nuanced, continues to prioritize domestic industries. Subsidizing key sectors like chipmaking and electric vehicle manufacturing underscores a strategic effort to bolster American competitiveness, especially in light of China's ascendancy as a global economic and technological powerhouse.However, the protectionist tilt comes with economic risks, including inflationary pressures, potential inefficiencies in domestic industries, and strained international relations. Critics argue that while Trump's policies were often labeled as knee-jerk and incoherent, Biden's approach appears more strategic, focusing on strengthening the US economy rather than outright protectionism.The bipartisan consensus on the need for a shift in trade policy reflects broader concerns about job losses due to globalization and China's growing influence. Trump's disruptive trade war with China may not have achieved its intended goals in terms of job creation, but it undoubtedly resonated politically in industrial heartlands.As the US grapples with its economic recovery and strategic positioning in a globalized world, the permanence of protectionist trade policies seems increasingly likely. With China's aggressive export strategies and geopolitical rivalry, American businesses like Clips & Clamps Industries brace for a future where protectionism is not just a temporary measure but a long-term reality.","The story of Clips & Clamps Industries, a Michigan auto supplier, epitomizes the challenges faced by American businesses amidst these trade policies.

NEW YORK: In perhaps the first acknowledgement of its kind on a global forum that the ""new India is a dangerous entity"", Pakistan 's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.Pakistan's permanent representative at the world body also quoted from a report in a leading US daily to say the ""new India comes into your home and kills you"".Addressing the General Assembly on May 2, Akram said, ""Pakistan's foreign minister informed the Security Council, as well as the secretary general and the president of the General Assembly of India's campaign of targeted assassinations in Pakistan. This extra-territorial state terrorism is not limited to Pakistan. It has been extended to targeted killings of political opponents in Canada and attempted in the United States and probably in other countries.""""The Washington Post reported that Prime Minister Modi last week told his cheering supporters, and I quote, ""Today, even India's enemies know this is Modi. This is the new India. This new India comes into your home and kills you"". This new India is a dangerous entity, it is a net provider of insecurity, not security,"" Pakistan's permanent representative to the UN alleged.Earlier, top British daily, The Guardian, claimed in a report that the Indian government carried out assassinations of wanted individuals deep inside Pakistan as part of a ""wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil"".It said, citing intelligence sources, that targeted assassinations increased significantly in 2023, claiming India's involvement in the suspected deaths of about 15 people, ""most of whom were shot at close range by unknown gunmen"".Earlier, some countries in the West raised concerns over what they claimed were targeted killings on their soil at the behest of the Indian government.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused 'agents' allegedly in the employ of the Indian government of killing Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan leader and a designated terrorist by the country's elite National Investigation Agency (NIA), in 2020.However, India has dismissed the claim as 'absurd' and 'motivated'.Nijjar was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A purported video clip of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March, this year, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men in what was alleged to be a 'contract killing'.In a recent development in the Nijjar case, the Canadian Police arrested four Indian nationals for their alleged involvement in the killing of the separatist Khalistleader outside a gurudwara in British Columbia last June.Reacting to the arrests, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar denied receiving any evidence implicating Indian nationals' involvement in the killing in Canada of the India-designated terrorist.Responding to media queries, Jaishankar said, ""I also read that another arrest has been made. If that person is an Indian national, then usually by consular practice, you inform the government or the embassy of the country of origin. But beyond that, we have long maintained that if anything, any event in Canada, any violence in Canada, has any evidence or information which is relevant to be investigated in India, we are open to investigating it.""He emphasised that while any Indian national's arrest would usually prompt notification to the government or embassy, no specific evidence justifying investigation by Indian agencies has been received to date.""But to date, we have never received anything, which is specific and worthy of being pursued by our investigative agencies. And I'm not aware anything has changed in the last few days in that regard,"" the External Affairs Minister said at a media interaction at a seminar on Indian Capital Markets 'Roadmap for Viksit Bharat' at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in Mumbai earlier.At a weekly media briefing, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), too, informed that Canada had not formally conveyed the arrests and India had not yet received any consular access request.On being asked about the fourth Indian arrested by Canada in connection with the Nijjar killing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have seen reports of the fourth person being arrested. We have not been formally conveyed of it. So far, we have not received any consular access request as well.""Earlier, campaigning for the ongoing general elections in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a telling remark vis-a-vis its western neighbour, saying India does not send dossiers on terrorism anymore but eliminates terrorists in their own backyard.""Today, India doesn't send dossiers.(Today India strikes back at terrorists on their own turf),"" PM Modi said at a poll rally in Maharashtra's Latur.Expanding on the difference in how his government tackles terrorism as compared to previous Congress regimes at the Centre, Prime Minister Modi said the earlier approach of handing dossiers to Pakistan has been replaced by taking out the wanted terror conspirators on their own turf.At a separate rally, PM Modi doubled down on remarks made by the INDIA bloc leader Farooq Abdullah that Pakistan was not wearing bangles and was a nuclear-amed nation, saying, """" (I was told Pakistanis don't even have bangles, we will make them wear some)"".Addressing a public meeting in Muzaffarpur, PM Modi said, ""These (Congress and INDIA alliance) people are so afraid that they see Pakistan's atom bombs even in their dreams. Can such a government and leader run the country? They (INDI alliance leaders) say, ''. (i am told Pakistanis don't even have bangles...we will make them wear some. They are desperately crying out for wheat, they don't have electricity and now they don't even have bangles to wear.) Some leaders in the Opposition are even giving clean chits to the 26/11 accused.""""Some people are doubting the surgical strikes and air strikes (after the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks). These leaders want to weaken the morale of our forces and cast aspersions on our nuclear power. It seems like 'INDI alliance ne India ke khilaf supari le li hai' (INDI partners have taken out a contract against the country),"" PM Modi added.In the US, federal prosecutors earlier alleged the involvement of two Indian nationals, including a government employee, in a plot to murder Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Canadian also holding American citizenship, on its soil.According to the indictment of the US Justice Department, an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, who is currently in custody, was charged with the murder-for-hire of Pannun. The US Justice Department claimed that an Indian government employee, who was not identified in the indictment filed, recruited Gupta to hire a hitman to allegedly assassinate Pannun, which was foiled by US authorities.India set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.","Pakistan's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.

The SIFC was established in June last year under an "" economic revival plan "" devised by civilian and military leaders to capitalise on ""untapped potential in key sectors"" and attract foreign direct investment (FDI).The hybrid government body promises to create an enabling business environment in the country and offer a one-window solution to investors.A visiting team of the Washington-based lender , which is on a sort of assessment mission, has not yet converted ongoing engagement into formal talks with the Pakistani authorities, The News International reported.Both sides expressed divergent views on the macroeconomic framework for the next fiscal budget for 2024-25, the newspaper said.The Pakistani authorities informed the International Monetary Fund's assessment team that the new investment policy was under preparation and would be announced after conducting due deliberations, the report said.The IMF asked for transparency in the working of the SIFC. The assessment team also inquired about the potential investment in different projects and especially asked for privatisation of the national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other state-owned enterprises (SOEs).Envisaging the CPI-based inflation on the higher average rate of 12.7 per cent for the next budget 2024-25, the Washington-based lender also inquired about the tax exemptions offered by the government for the upcoming Special Economic Zones (SEZs) under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The IMF wants maximisation of non-tax revenues as the proposal under consideration is to increase the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) for increasing collection up to Pakistani Rs 1.08 trillion in the next fiscal year or slap a carbon levy to compensate the zero rate of GST on petroleum products, The News International reported.The international lender has recommended imposing 18 per cent GST on petrol and diesel along with PDL.The IMF has refused to accept the macroeconomic framework of the Finance Ministry and so far pitched the macroeconomic framework for the next budget 2024-25 including a real GDP growth rate of 3.5 per cent while the CPI-based inflation was projected on the higher side at 12.7 per cent.The Ministry of Finance has prepared a macroeconomic framework whereby the GDP growth was envisaged at 3.7 to 4 per cent while inflation was kept on average in the range of 11 to 12 per cent, the report said.For the outgoing fiscal year 2023-24, the provision GDP growth figure may hover around 2 to 2.5 per cent of GDP against the official target of 3.5 per cent, it said.Pakistan has made a formal request for a fresh bailout package of USD 6 to USD 8 billion under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the possibility of being augmented through climate finance. If successful, it would be the 24th IMF bailout programme for the country.Last month, Pakistan completed a short-term USD 3 billion programme with the IMF, which bailed the country out of any default.It was unclear whether the IMF mission would end with a formal staff-level agreement for the next bailout package, according to The Express Tribune newspaper.The duration, instrument, and size of the next IMF programme were open to discussion, the report said, quoting sources.Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high of 38 per cent last May.The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall, and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around two per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","The IMF has asked Pakistan to share a draft of the under-preparation investment policy and ensure transparency in the working of the Special Investment Facilitation Council.

He added that temperatures could reach up to 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit) above the monthly average. This week could rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country, Babar said.It's the latest climate-related disaster to hit the country in recent years. Melting glaciers and growing monsoons have caused devastating floods, at one point submerging a third of the country.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual monthly rainfall, according to the national weather center. Last month's heavy rains killed scores of people while destroyed property and farmland, experts say the country witnessed heavier rains because of climate change .Pakistan is still trying to recover from $30 billion in losses caused by devastating climate-induced floods that killed 1,739 people in 2022.According to health officials, hospitals were instructed to set up emergency heatwave response centers so that those affected by the scorching temperatures could be quickly treated.Doctors say heatstroke is a serious illness that occurs when one's body temperature rises quickly because of sweltering heat, potentially causing some to fall unconscious. A severe heatstroke can cause disability or death.Some areas in Pakistan are also currently facing hours-long power outages.""We were without electricity for hours on Monday,"" said Ibrar Abbasi, who lives on the outskirts of Islamabad.Scientists have long warned that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and certain agricultural practices, will lead to more frequent and prolonged bouts of extreme weather, including hotter temperatures.Babar said another intense heat wave will hit the country in June, when the temperature is likely to reach 45 degrees (113 Fahrenheit). He said people should drink a lot of water and avoid unnecessary travel. Farmers and other livestock owners should take measures to protect their animals during extreme heat, he said.However, many people, especially laborers and construction workers in the impoverished nation, ask how they can stay indoors as their families will suffer if they don't work.""I am not feeling well because of the stifling heat, but I have to work,"" said Ghulam Farid, who owns a small general store in Sheikhupra, a city in Punjab province.Construction workers were seen sitting near a road on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, hoping to get a job.

Coated head to toe in eye-catching gold paint, they stood perfectly still, leaning on glimmering canes and tipping their top hats open. Perhaps in a different place, the emergence of mimes on the street looking to earn a few dollars might go unnoticed.But this is Pakistan , where things under the security state often are not as simple as they seem. So as the number of golden performers grew, so, too, did the intrigue around them. Could they be informants for the nation's intelligence agency? Lookouts for powerful politicians? Maybe spies for CIA ?Today, the ""golden men"" of Islamabad have been added to the ranks of the conspiracy theories sprouted, knocked down and rehashed every day across the city. In Pakistan, where the hand of the security services is seen everywhere, conspiracy theories have been embraced in the mainstream for decades. Suspicion has become so universal that wild tales take root after almost every news event. In the wake of catastrophic floods in 2010, people asserted that they had been caused by CIA weather-controlling technology. Media pundits claimed that a US ""thinktank"" was behind a failed car bombing by a Pakistani-American in Times Square that year and that Osama bin Laden was actually Jewish.In such a climate, everyone - even street performers - can be seen as potential tools of the state. For most of Pakistan's 76-year history, the surveillance was a routine facet of daily life. But in recent years, frustration with the military's role in politics has exploded. ""With the political atmosphere so polarised, we're becoming more suspicious of being watched or who is listening,"" said Ali Abas, 25, a resident of Islamabad.On the other side of the city, Mustaq Ahmed, 53, stood on a median of a busy intersection. His jacket, pants, walking cane and top hat were all spray-painted gold. Gold makeup was caked onto his face and hand. Ahmed once sold umbrellas, but became ""Golden Thakur"" three years ago after he overheard another golden man saying he made up to Pak Rs 8,000 - or nearly $30 - each day. It was more than five times what Ahmed was taking home. That cash has dwindled recently as the novelty of the golden men has waned, he said. When asked if he would ever supplement his income with a little side work for the intelligence agencies, he immediately replied: ""no, no, no."" Was there any chance that other golden men were earning a few extra dollars that way? ""Maybe,"" he said with a shrug.

As the IMF and Pakistan continue their negotiations, it is clear that the new bailout programme will require strict economic measures. However, Pakistan remains committed to the IMF loan program and has no intentions of replacing it.To be eligible for the ""new bailout programme,"" sources indicate that Pakistan will need to practice fiscal discipline by reducing spending and deficits in accordance with IMF requirements. Last week, the IMF mission ""asked"" Pakistani authorities to raise the general sales tax (GST) to 18 percent during four rounds of talks for a new loan.The IMF mission noted that Pakistan's sales tax collection system is problematic, as the centre collects sales tax on commodities while the provinces collect it on services. They suggested that the federal government should be solely responsible for collecting sales tax. Additionally, the IMF demanded an end to GST exemptions and an increase to 18 percent on both commodities and services.During the fourth round of talks, the IMF mission also called for reforms in the insurance sector and the establishment of a separate regulatory body.

Fresh corruption allegations levelled against ex-Pak PM Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fresh-corruption-allegations-levelled-against-ex-pak-pm-imran-khan/articleshow/110249925.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's accountability watchdog has levelled fresh corruption allegations against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accusing him of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts linked to the state gift repository when he was in power, media reports said on Sunday. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) launched an inquiry against the 71-year-old Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi over the alleged misuse of the Toshakhana -- the state gift repository, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.The beleaguered former first couple has been convicted in earlier Toshakhana corruption cases as well.In January, Khan and Bushra were sentenced to 14 years in jail each by an accountability court for alleged corruption in state gifts they got from the state repository. The sentence was later suspended by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The previous Toshakhana graft case was filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the charges of hiring the sale of state gifts.The NAB investigation centres on the illegal possession and sale of seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts, including diamond and gold jewellery, the report said.According to the inquiry, items such as Graff and Rolex watches and diamond jewellery were allegedly sold without being legally owned or deposited in the Toshakhana, as required by law.The Toshakhana is a department under the Cabinet Division that stores gifts given to rulers and government officials by heads of other governments and foreign dignitaries.Under the rules governing Toshakhana - a Persian word meaning ""treasure house"" - government officials can keep gifts by paying a price, but first, the gift should be deposited.The gifts were purchased/retained at ""considerably lower rates"" and were ""routinely sold"" without properly declaring them. The expensive Graff watch set was also allegedly sold without ""retention"", according to the report.The NAB's findings suggest collusion between the buyers of the Graff watches and a private appraiser, who allegedly undervalued the watches by Rs 30 million.The undervaluation, confirmed via an email from Toshakhana, meant that only Rs 20.1 million, or 20 per cent of the watches' actual value of Rs 100.9 million, was deposited into the government treasury, the report said.""During the course of the inquiry, it was revealed that the value of luxury gift items was assessed in an unscrupulous and slipshod manner by a private appraiser [...] was not even an industry expert and did not possess the required experience or expertise to make these assessments,"" Geo News said, citing the report.After the report findings, the accountability watchdog was authorised to conduct further probes against Khan and Bushra. Separate call-up notices had also been served to them, which they have challenged in the IHC.The court will hear Bushra's appeal on June 4 and Khan's appeal on June 24, the report said.The former-cricketer-turned-politician has been lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since August last year. Since his removal from power in a no-confidence motion in April 2022, Khan has been convicted in at least four cases, including the cipher (secret diplomatic communication) case.","Pakistan's accountability watchdog accuses Imran Khan of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts.

Pakistan government forecasts USD 72 bn investment needed to meet 50 pc surge in power demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forecasts-usd-72-bn-investment-needed-to-meet-50-pc-surge-in-power-demand/articleshow/110249530.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a comprehensive overview of Pakistan's energy landscape, the government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade. This forecast, outlined in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP 2024-34) submitted to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), aims to bolster the country's power infrastructure to meet escalating demand, Dawn reported.Under the proposed plan, renewable energy sources are slated to account for a significant portion, with an expected surge to 46 per cent of the total energy mix within the next decade.This surge in capacity, estimated to rise from 42,000MW to 57,000MW, underscores the government's commitment to embracing sustainable energy solutions .The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) has provided insights into the anticipated growth in electricity demand, projecting increases ranging from 46 per cent under a low-growth scenario to 74 per cent in a high-growth scenario over the next ten years. To accommodate this surge, an estimated investment of USD 62-64 billion would be required, reflecting the scale of the challenge at hand, as reported by Dawn.The Transmission System Expansion Plan (TSEP 2024-34) outlines an additional USD 8.7 billion investment imperative for enhancing the transmission network. This allocation includes funds for both ongoing projects, requiring USD 3.2 billion for completion, and new projects necessitating USD 5.5 billion in funding.Employing state-of-the-art generation planning software, PLEXOS, the least-cost, long-term generation expansion plan has been meticulously developed. This plan factors in existing and future generation projects, policy frameworks, contractual obligations, natural resource allocations, and prevailing Grid Code provisions. It adheres closely to the National Electricity Policy 2021 and incorporates a series of assumptions to guide strategic decision-making.In crafting the base case scenario, NTDC has meticulously accounted for existing contractual obligations and projected retirements of power projects as stipulated in their respective Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), with the exception of KAPCO. The plan also factors in the retirement of 8,330MW of existing power generation capacity over the planning horizon.The forecasted demand is calibrated to accommodate the intermittency of variable renewable energy resources such as wind and solar PV, critical elements in achieving the government's ambitious renewable energy targets. With an estimated 87,600 hours of energy and peak demand forecasted from FY24 to 34, the plan aims to balance the evolving energy landscape with a diversified and resilient energy mix.By 2034, the envisioned energy mix will reflect a notable shift towards indigenous fuel sources, with local coal and renewables playing a prominent role. Hydropower is expected to contribute 46 per cent of the energy mix, accompanied by 10 per cent from variable renewable energy sources. The plan minimizes reliance on imported fuels, with RFO making no contribution and imported coal and RLNG accounting for a modest share of total energy requirements, Dawn reported.","The government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade.

The upcoming election in Sri Lanka will have a major impact on the future of the island nation and human rights considerations for years to come, the global rights NGO said in a statement issued at the end of a five-day visit by its Secretary General Agnes Callamard to the country.The presidential election in Sri Lanka is scheduled to take place between mid-September and mid-October.""The visit has provided insights into many challenges that Sri Lanka is confronting 15 years after the end of the war (with the LTTE ),"" the statement said.Callamard visited the northeastern Mullaithvu district on Sunday to commemorate the fallen victims from the Tamil side to mark the 15th anniversary of the end of the final conflict.""A seemingly lack of political will, along with complacency in delivering justice prevents reconciliation,"" the statement said, calling on the international community to work with the island's authorities to secure truth and justice for all victims of the war and the ongoing human rights violations and lay the foundation for a freer and fairer Sri Lanka.Amnesty said during the visit, the focus had been centred on threats to civil society; freedom of expression; the right to peaceful protest; the use of anti-terror laws such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to suppress dissent; harassment; intimidation; surveillance and obstacles to press freedom.It said the new legislation such as the Online Security Act and the proposed non-governmental organisation law are worrying evidence of the dangers faced by civil society in the country.The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had run a military campaign for a separate Tamil homeland in the northern and eastern provinces of the island nation for nearly 30 years before its collapse in 2009.On May 18, 2009, the Sri Lankan Army declared victory with the discovery of the body of the dreaded LTTE leader Velupillai Prabakaran .Despite the passage of nearly 15 years since the end of the armed conflict and many decades since the earliest waves of enforced disappearances, Sri Lankan authorities are still failing to ensure accountability for these violations. Tamil groups claimed a large number of civilians had perished during the final battle.A report issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) on Friday said the Sri Lankan government must take meaningful action to determine and disclose the fates and whereabouts of tens of thousands of people who have been subjected to enforced disappearance over the decades and hold those responsible to account.It called for renewed action by Sri Lanka at the domestic level to hold it to account through criminal justice. The report also called for the international community to be engaged with Sri Lanka for investigation and prosecutions for targeted sanctions.Sri Lanka maintains that OHCHR is not mandated by the member states to issue any such report.","There is seemingly a ""lack of political will"" in delivering justice to the many victims of Sri Lanka's three-decade-long internal armed conflict, Amnesty International says.
