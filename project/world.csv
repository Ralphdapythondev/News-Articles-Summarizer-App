Ukraine's military officials on Monday said that the country's air defense units were actively engaged in countering a barrage of drones, cruise and multiple Russian missile attack on Kyiv .Ukraine experienced nationwide air raid alerts, while neighbouring Nato member Poland activated Polish and allied aircraft to ensure the safety of its airspace.A Russian missile attack on Kyiv partially destroyed a boiler house at a water plant in the city's Holosiivskyi district, and a fire broke out in the Shevchenkivskyi district, which is home to several educational institutions.Medical personnel are on the scene providing assistance, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app.Emergency services were dispatched to the Svyatoshynksyi, Holosiivskyi, and Solomyanskyi districts, he added.Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine conducted multiple drone assault on Russia, targeting power plants and an oil refinery, marking one of the largest attacks since the full-scale war commenced, officials said. Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to make advancements towards a crucial town in eastern Ukraine.In the Russian missile attack on Kharkiv, at least 47 people, including five children, were injured when missiles hit a shopping mall and events complex in the northeastern Ukrainian city.The attack comes at a pivotal moment in the two-and-a-half-year conflict, as Russia intensifies its offensive in eastern Ukraine while attempting to repel Ukrainian forces that breached its western border in a surprise incursion on August 6.Last week, Russia launched its most intense airstrikes of the war, targeting key sites including energy facilities, in the heaviest aerial assault since the conflict began in February 2022.In response to the escalating Russian aggression, Ukraine has bolstered its domestic drone production capabilities and intensified its own strikes on Russian energy, military, and transportation facilities.Following the attack in Kharkiv, which authorities reported involved a minimum of 10 missiles and impacted various sites, President Zelenskyy on his Telegram channel said: ""All necessary forces for the rescue operation have been brought in.""""And all the necessary forces of the world must be brought in to stop this terror. This does not require extraordinary forces, but enough courage on the part of the leaders - courage to give Ukraine what it needs to defend itself,"" he added.","Ukraine experienced nationwide air raid alerts, while neighbouring Nato member Poland activated Polish and allied aircraft to ensure the safety of its airspace.

Is Melania secretly rooting for Kamala Harris? Former Trump aide drops a bombshell: 'She hates ...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-melania-secretly-rooting-for-kamala-harris-former-trump-aide-drops-a-bombshell-she-hates-/articleshow/112978592.cms,"Scaramucci’s brief White House tenure

Melania Trump’s low-profile life

Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci has made headlines again with a provocative claim: Melania Trump may be more invested in a Kamala Harris victory than he is. According to Scaramucci, Melania’s enthusiasm for Harris is not just a matter of political preference but is deeply rooted in her strong dislike for her husband, Donald Trump.Scaramucci shared this surprising insight on the MediasTouch podcast, where he suggested that Melania’s support for Harris could surpass even his own.“I think Melania Trump might be the only person who feels that way,” Scaramucci said, hinting that her intense aversion to Trump is so significant that it affects her political choices. He humorously noted that even his wife and the podcast host’s spouse seem more neutral compared to Melania’s fervent stance.Adding a touch of humor, Scaramucci joked that General Mark Milley is the only individual he knows who harbors even stronger negative feelings toward Trump than Melania. “It’s almost as if Melania’s hatred sets the benchmark for how much someone can dislike Trump,” he quipped.Anthony Scaramucci, known for his brief and tumultuous role as White House Communications Director, served in the position from July 21 to July 31, 2017. His short stint was marked by high drama and controversy, including the resignation of Sean Spicer, which was reportedly tied to Scaramucci’s appointment. The former aide’s departure was ultimately influenced by John Kelly, the new Chief of Staff, who questioned his credibility.Trump has consistently dismissed Scaramucci’s comments, attributing them to personal animosity and grudge-holding.Meanwhile, Melania Trump has kept a low profile, focusing on her personal life rather than her husband’s 2024 campaign. Besides a few fundraisers and a brief public statement following a serious incident involving Trump, she has remained out of the spotlight. Melania is also gearing up for the release of her memoir, Melania, set for October 1. The memoir promises an inspiring look into her personal journey and experiences.Recently, Melania expressed her affection for New York, where her son Barron is about to start college. Although details about Barron’s college choice are still under wraps, Melania’s message highlights her current focus on family and personal milestones.","Scaramucci shared this surprising insight on the MediasTouch podcast.

US elections 2024: Muslim-American vote in focus as 'Abandon Harris' campaign intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/muslim-american-vote-in-focus-as-abandon-harris-campaign-intensifies/articleshow/112979243.cms,"The "" Abandon Harris "" campaign is intensifying its efforts to mobilize Muslim-American voters against Vice President Kamala Harris , focusing on key swing states in the upcoming election. This renewed push comes in response to Harris’s stance on the Gaza conflict , which the campaign criticizes as inadequate.The campaign's statement on X last week condemned Harris for her support of policies they claim contribute to ongoing violence in Gaza.“We are not interested in hollow rhetoric or empty platitudes,” the campaign said, criticizing Harris for not addressing their concerns about the Gaza situation.Originally based in Dearborn, Michigan—a city with a large Muslim population—the campaign initially focused on President Biden’s re-election campaign, arguing that his support for Israel was problematic. The campaign successfully mobilized over 100,000 voters to cast uncommitted ballots in Michigan during the primaries.Following Biden's withdrawal from the race and Harris's ascension as the Democratic nominee, the campaign shifted its focus to Harris. The group’s criticism of Harris highlights their dissatisfaction with her response to their demands for policy changes regarding Gaza.The campaign's influence is expanding to other critical swing states such as Wisconsin. These states, which have been decided by narrow margins in previous elections, are now seeing significant mobilization efforts from the campaign. According to Real Clear Politics Polling average, Harris has narrow leads in both Michigan (1.1 points) and Wisconsin (1.4 points).The campaign is also targeting additional swing states, having gained traction in Minnesota during the primary season. Although they have not endorsed any third-party candidate, the campaign urges Muslim-American voters to explore alternatives to the major parties as a protest against their stance on Gaza.A spokesperson for the campaign mentioned their efforts to engage with Harris, stating, “We have extended an olive branch to Kamala Harris and expressed our openness to dialogue. However, after her recent rally in Michigan and her response to our concerns, we launched Abandon Harris on August 19.”The spokesperson added that while they do not support former President Donald Trump, they emphasize that abstaining from voting is not an option. “We have consistently urged voters not to support either the Democratic or Republican parties,” they said.The Harris campaign has not yet responded to requests for comment. The growing influence of the ""Abandon Harris"" campaign within the Muslim-American community could impact the electoral dynamics in key swing states.","The ""Abandon Harris"" campaign is intensifying its efforts to mobilize Muslim- American voters against Vice President Kamala Harris.

It later claimed, without proof, that the hostages were killed by the Israeli military's bullets.Netanyahu vowed to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed.

""I am devastated and outraged. Hersh was among the innocents brutally attacked while attending a music festival for peace in Israel,"" he said. ""He lost his arm helping friends and strangers during Hamas' savage massacre. He had just turned 23.""Biden vowed to keep working toward an agreement but also issued a warning: ""Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes.""Goldberg-Polin's parents, perhaps the most high-profile relatives of hostages on the global stage, confirmed his death Sunday ""with broken hearts"".More than 60 living hostages, and bodies of about 35 other hostages, are still in Gaza, according to Israel. agencies","Israel's largest trade union, Histadrut, pressured the govt by calling a general strike for Monday.

Jeff Walz declared that he is not supporting his brother and Kamala Harris. He said Tim Walz is not the type of person who should decide America's future.Jeff is open about his differences with Tim with whom he has not spoken in eight years. The revelation was made in a Facebook post which made the Republicans jump in joy -- only to be reminded by the Democrats that Trump and Kennedy Jr too do not have much of a family support.67-year-old Jeff is Tim's elder brother with zero faith in Tim. He's contemplating publicly endorsing Donald Trump but is not sure whether he should drag the entire family in it. “The stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future,” he said adding that Tim did not inform the family that he was running for the vice president.Jeff has always been a Trump supporter, a registered Republican who donated $20 to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. On March 30, 2023 when Trump was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury over hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, Jeff wrote: ""We've just become a third world banana republic.""Jeff lives on the Florida panhandle in Freeport with his wife Laurie. He and Laurie owned So Fine Music in Inverness, a musical instrument and equipment store from 2001 to 2010, according to public records. Walz was also an assistant principal at a Citrus County middle school in the early 2000s, New York Post reported. Laurie Walz on Facebook is friends with Tim Walz and other family members.Why Jeff hates Tim is not clearly known. Like Tim, Jeff also used to work at a school -- an assistant principal at a middle school in Citrus County, Florida, in the early 2000s. They both have criminal cases -- while Tim Walz pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving over a 2005 drunk driving arrest, Jeff pleaded guilty for allegedly stealing from a Walmart store in 2001.",67-year-old Jeff Walz declared that he is not supporting his brother and Kamala Harris. He said Tim Walz is not the type of person who should decide America's future.

Maya Neelakantan: Chennai guitar prodigy Maya Neelakantan’s Master of Puppets on America’s Got Talent blows Metallica’s mind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chennai-guitar-prodigy-maya-neelakantans-master-of-puppets-on-americas-got-talent-blows-metallicas-mind/articleshow/112971782.cms,"11-Year-Old Guitarist Maya Neelakantan Performs ""Master Of Puppets"" | Quarterfinals | AGT 2024

Who is Maya Neelakantan?

There are two major musical moments in Season 4 of Stranger Things. The first is, of course, Kate Bush’s ""Running Up That Hill,"" and the second is Metallica ’s "" Master of Puppets ,"" which Eddie Munson plays in the Upside Down, a scene that has been labeled ""the most metal scene of all time."" Now, Joseph Quinn (who plays Eddie Munson) has some competition, and she’s even more metal.One of the standout performers at America’s Got Talent was 10-year-old Maya Neelakantan whose Master of Puppets cover wowed every judge and even Metallica who shared her performance on Facebook.She wrote on YouTube: ""Thank you so much! It was such an honor that Metallica trusted me that I’ll make them proud and I was able to play this iconic Metallica song for the first time ever on AGT! And the AGT crew are amazing in creating such an incredible unforgettable experience. Metallica was the reason I started playing guitar since 6 years old and now it feels like a full circle that I got to play Metallica for my 2nd ever biggest stage performance. That's what made this day most special for me! Thank you all for the love and support. It means a lot!""Maya advanced to the quarterfinals of America’s Got Talent, where she delivered a powerful rendition of Metallica's Master of Puppets, using a Gibson Flying V metallic silver guitar. Despite her electrifying performance, she did not advance to the semifinals. However, her journey on AGT significantly boosted her profile, earning her fans worldwide, including notable musicians like Gary Holt of Exodus and Slayer, who attended her audition to show his support.Here’s what you ought to know about the guitar prodigy :Maya Neelakantan, born on May 4, 2013, in Chennai, India, is a young guitar prodigy renowned for her unique fusion of heavy metal and Carnatic music . Hailing from MRC Nagar, Raja Annamalai Puram in Chennai, Maya has captivated audiences worldwide with her extraordinary talent and innovative musical style. Her journey began at the tender age of six when she picked up the guitar under the influence of her father, who, though not a professional musician, had a passion for playing riffs from iconic metal bands like Metallica and Slayer. This early exposure to rock music sparked Maya's interest, and soon she was learning to play her first song, ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" by Metallica.Maya's multicultural background has played a significant role in shaping her musical identity. Her father, an IT company owner with a background in astrophysics, and her mother, Lorina, an Australian entrepreneur, met in Australia. Maya’s diverse heritage and her family's musical inclinations inspired her to explore various genres, blending them seamlessly in her performances. At nine, she began formal training in Carnatic music with Prasanna Ramaswamy, a renowned Tamil guitarist based in New York. Prasanna's mentorship helped Maya develop a profound understanding of Carnatic music, which she skillfully integrates with her heavy metal renditions.Maya’s talent soon caught the attention of the global music community. In 2022, her cover of ""7empest"" by the Grammy-winning rock band Tool went viral on her YouTube channel, which her father had set up to showcase her skills. This performance impressed Adam Jones, Tool's guitarist, who became an admirer of her work. Jones even gifted Maya a customized Gibson Adam Jones Les Paul guitar, marking a significant milestone in her burgeoning career.In 2024, Maya's exceptional abilities led her to the stage of America's Got Talent (AGT), where she auditioned for the show's 19th season. Her performance was broadcast in June 2024, but the actual audition took place two months earlier when she was just ten years old. Dressed in traditional Indian attire, Maya wowed the audience and judges with a mesmerizing blend of a Carnatic devotional intro and a heavy metal rendition of ""Last Resort"" by Papa Roach. This unique fusion not only earned her a standing ovation but also garnered praise from all the AGT judges. Simon Cowell, known for his critical eye, hailed her as a ""rock goddess,"" while Howie Mandel predicted that her performance would go viral.Beyond her television appearances, Maya has continued to develop her musical style, drawing on her dual love for heavy metal and Carnatic music. She credits her grandmother for introducing her to Carnatic music at the age of two, a genre that has remained close to her heart even as she explored the world of metal. Maya's ambition to merge these two seemingly disparate styles has driven her to create a unique sound that reflects her diverse influences and her desire to push musical boundaries.","Maya Neelakantan is a young guitar prodigy renowned for her unique fusion of heavy metal and Carnatic music.

Weeks before Tulsi Gabbard extended her support to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, the former Democratic leader -- at a podcast -- said that Kamala Harris replacing Biden only makes for good chatter but in reality it does not matter as the same cabal will run the show. Tulsi said the debate debacle of President Biden and Donald Trump on CNN only confirmed what insiders have known for long -- that Biden has not been taking the shots.""It will neither be Kamala Harris -- if she is elected. It is this cabal of Democratic elite, the woke war mongers made up of the likes of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and Tony Blinken, Jake Sullivan who are in the military national complex who profit from being in constant state of war,"" Gabbard said adding that it's difficult to pinpoint any time since when it has been like this.Tulsi Gabbard is now on Donald Trump's transition team and is believed to be aiding Trump for the debate. Gabbard is a military veteran who represented Hawaii in Congress for eight years. She ran for president as a Democrat in 2019 and then left the party in 2022. Her disagreement with the Democrats was on the issue of war -- the stand US taken in the ongoing wars.Tulsi Gabbard said the number of politicians who want to continue war is shocking. ""They won't say I like war or I like to see more people dead, of course. They won't use those words but politicians with donors from defence companies want war,"" Tulsi Gabbard said. ""It's like we are going to punish this bad guy, topple this regime...without thinking through the implications,"" Tulsi said.They tell themselves whatever they need to tell themselves to sleep at night, Tulsi said adding that such neocon war mongers are there in the GOP as well who hate Trump from his anti-war stance and Nikki Haley is one of them. Kamala Harris will be dangerous for America if elected, Tulsi said, because she will immediately have the urge to assert her strength and what better way is there other than waging war.",Tulsi Gabbard is a military veteran who represented Hawaii in Congress for eight years.

Early Times American Blended Whiskey

Consumption Volume: In 2022, Americans consumed approximately 75 million 9-liter cases of whiskey, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). This includes various types of whiskey, such as bourbon, rye, Tennessee whiskey, and blended whiskey. Growth Rate: The whiskey category has seen a consistent growth rate. In 2022, the overall volume of whiskey consumption increased by about 4% compared to the previous year. This growth is partly driven by a rising interest in premium and super-premium whiskey categories, which have seen even higher growth rates. Bourbon, Tennessee, and Rye Whiskey: These specific types of American whiskey are particularly popular. In 2022, the combined sales of Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, and rye whiskey reached over 29 million 9-liter cases, showing a growth of approximately 5.5% from the previous year. Spending on Whiskey: Consumer spending on whiskey also reflects its popularity. In 2022, whiskey sales in the U.S. reached about $5.1 billion, with a significant portion of this revenue coming from premium and super-premium brands. Craft Whiskey: The craft whiskey segment continues to grow rapidly. There are now over 2,000 craft distilleries in the U.S., many of which are focusing on producing high-quality, small-batch whiskeys that cater to a more discerning consumer base. Craft whiskey sales have seen double-digit growth rates in recent years. Exports: U.S. whiskey exports have also been robust. In 2022, American whiskey exports reached nearly $1 billion, showing a strong demand in international markets, particularly in Europe and Asia.

The Whiskies of the World Awards is a whisky competition hosted by the Whiskies of the World (WOW) organization, which is dedicated to promoting the appreciation and enjoyment of whisky.

The Triple Cask STR is an American Single Malt aged in three types of casks: shaved, toasted, and re-charred (STR). Inspired by the STR process popularized by whiskey consultant Dr. Jim Swan, this method enhances the oak's influence, resulting in a richly complex whisky. At 55.6% ABV, this expression is both powerful and nuanced.The nose is rich and aromatic, featuring dried fruit, caramel, and toasted oak, with subtle hints of spice, dark chocolate, and a touch of citrus adding depth. On the palate, it's full-bodied and intense, delivering bold flavors of toffee, dark chocolate, and roasted nuts. The triple cask aging imparts layers of spice, charred wood, and a slight smokiness, balanced by sweeter notes of vanilla and honey.

Is Usha Vance's Hindu identity an asset or a liability to the Trump-Vance campaign?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-usha-vances-hindu-identity-an-asset-or-a-liability-to-the-trump-vance-campaign/articleshow/112970640.cms,"Usha Chilukuri Vance , the wife of JD Vance who is Donald Trump's running mate in the presidential elections, shared a glimpse into their blended cultural marriage during the Republican National Convention. She spoke about how her ""meat and potatoes"" husband adapted to her vegetarian lifestyle, even learning to cook Indian dishes from her mother.This portrayal of her white, Christian husband embracing South Indian cuisine stood out in a party largely dominated by white Christians.Her appearance at the convention resonated with some Indian American conservatives, especially among Hindu Americans, although most Indian Americans lean Democratic.Despite highlighting her intercultural marriage during her speech in Milwaukee, Usha Vance did not mention her Hindu upbringing or her faith, details that have drawn online criticism. While some believe her presence as a Hindu American is a point of pride, others question whether the Republican Party is truly ready to embrace a Hindu second lady.According to the Associated Press Usha Vance remained silent about her religious beliefs leading up to the election. She avoided answering questions about whether she practices Hinduism or attends Mass with her Catholic husband, who converted to the faith and is raising their three children as Catholics.Raised in a Hindu household in San Diego by immigrant parents, both professors, Usha confirmed that one of their children has an Indian name, and their wedding included both Indian and American ceremonies. The couple met while studying at Yale Law School.Her Hindu background might attract South Asian voters in swing states with significant South Asian populations, like Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, according to Dheepa Sundaram, a Hindu Studies professor at the University of Denver. However, Sundaram suggests that the campaign seems hesitant to fully embrace Usha Vance’s Hindu identity, viewing it as more of a liability than an asset.Sundaram notes that Usha Vance could appeal to Hindu Americans who support the politics of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, under whom Hindu nationalism has grown. However, there are significant divisions within Indian American communities on issues such as taxes, education, relations with India, and anti-caste discrimination legislation.Surveys by Pew Research Center indicate that about 7 in 10 Indian Americans align with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while about 3 in 10 lean Republican. However, surveys by AAPI Data and AP-NORC show that fewer than 1 in 10 South Asian Americans trust the Republican Party on key issues like abortion, gun policy, and climate change, while around half or more trust the Democrats.Still, Ohio State Senator Niraj Antani, a Republican and Hindu American, believes Usha Vance’s presence as “a second lady who looks like us and speaks like us” could help the GOP attract a voter bloc that has been challenging for the party to reach. Antani emphasizes the importance of Republicans reaching out to minority groups to avoid losing elections.Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur who ran for president in 2020 and now supports the Trump-Vance ticket, prominently featured his Hindu faith in his campaign, arguing that Hindu teachings align with Judeo-Christian values. However, Ramaswamy declined to comment on Usha Vance’s religious background.Usha Vance’s silence on her faith, combined with Ramaswamy’s defeat in the primaries, suggests that non-Christian religious identities may still face challenges within the Republican Party, according to Karthick Ramakrishnan, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. He notes that more exclusionary voices within the GOP have spoken out against the Vances, highlighting the potential political risks of openly embracing a non-Christian religious identity.Antani, who has successfully won several elections in predominantly Christian, conservative Ohio, argues that the racism in the Republican Party comes from individual racists rather than the party itself. He celebrated Usha Vance’s mention of her Indian heritage at the RNC and believes Ramaswamy’s loss was due to his lack of name recognition rather than his Hindu faith.JD Vance, who has publicly condemned the online attacks on his wife, speaks about raising their three children as Catholics but rarely mentions his wife’s role in their religious life. He credits Usha with helping him find his Catholic faith after a tumultuous spiritual journey, which included a transition from Protestantism to atheism during college. He and his children were baptized in the Catholic Church in 2019.Suhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, sees Usha Vance’s influence on her husband’s spiritual journey as a reflection of Hindu values, emphasizing that Hinduism is about finding one’s own path. She describes Usha as a positive example of Hindu contributions to American society, noting that her interfaith marriage and openness to different perspectives align with Hindu teachings.Shukla adds that Hindu Americans often assimilate while retaining important aspects of their culture and traditions, which positions them well to engage with diverse communities. She also notes that some Hindu Americans are turning to the Republican Party in response to perceived anti-Hindu prejudice within the Democratic Party, particularly concerning legislation on caste discrimination.However, Ramakrishnan remains skeptical that Indian Americans feel truly welcome in the Republican Party, even if they agree with conservatives on certain issues. He argues that the rise of Christian conservatism and nationalism within the GOP has driven many Indian Americans to consistently support the Democrats, making it less likely they will align with the Republican Party.","Usha Chilukuri Vance, the wife of Donald Trump's running mate in the presidential elections, shared a glimpse into their blended cultural marriage during the Republican National Convention.

Moreover, a brief knowledge about sanitation, nutrition and feeding habits among women and children should form the core focus of government-driven campaigns and policies.It is impossible to attain even a minimal reduction in undernutrition and malnutrition indicators without consistent funding and healthcare system improvements to close the wealth and poverty divides between rich and poor communities, as well as between rural and urban areas, Dawn stated citing the opinion piece.Earlier this month, the Pakistan government and the IMF staff concluded the ninth review of the $6.5 billion bailout package without a staff-level agreement. The Pakistan government had hoped that they would be able to convince the IMF about implementing the conditions in a gradual manner.However, Islamabad's hopes were dashed during the IMF mission's 10-day visit to Pakistan.","Pakistan's lawmakers cannot escape the fact that malnutrition is a major socioeconomic determinant of maternal health, gender empowerment, child marriage and education. 4 out of 10 children under five years of age are stunted, 17.7 per cent suffer from wasting, 28.9 per cent are underweight and 9.5 per cent in same age bracket are overweight.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112967135,imgsize-23132,width-400,resizemode-4/112967135.jpg"

As Pakistan grapples with a surge in terrorist strikes in the past couple of years, its restive Balochistan province was rocked this week by a wave of attacks that have left more than 70 dead. The coordinated strikes, perhaps more widespread than any such assault in the past, by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army ( BLA ), have again foregrounded Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources as the soft underbelly of Pakistan.The attacks, which saw BLA targeting police stations and taking control of major highways, coincided with the death anniversary of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, who was killed 18 years ago in one of then president Pervez Musharraf's counter-insurgency operations.","Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources.

Regarding Bangladesh's foreign policy, Hossain explained that their approach is to maintain positive relationships with all countries while prioritizing their national interests.""Our policy is to maintain good relations with all countries while protecting our national interests. We seek friendship with all and enmity with none, aiming to establish balanced relations. Our primary task is to safeguard our interests,"" Touhid said.Hossain also clarified that it would be inaccurate to assume that the interim government is solely focused on any particular direction, as they aim to maintain smooth and positive relations with all countries, including India and China. He hinted at the possibility of general elections in the country, asserting that their primary objective is to ensure a fair and impartial election process, and speculation at this point is unnecessary.According to The Daily Star newspaper, Hasina, who fled to India on August 5 following her forced resignation amid a student-led mass uprising, is eligible for visa-free entry and a stay of up to 45 days under Indian visa policy for Bangladeshi citizens holding diplomatic or official passports.The extradition of Hasina, who faces 51 cases, including 42 for murder, is governed by the extradition treaty signed between Bangladesh and India in 2013 and amended in 2016. The treaty states that ""extradition may be refused if the offence for which it is requested is an offence of a political character."" However, it also specifies that certain offences, such as murder, ""shall not be regarded as offences of a political character"" for the purposes of the treaty. One ground for refusal of extradition is if the charges being pressed have not been ""made in good faith, in the interest of justice,"" according to the BSS report.","Bangladesh's foreign affairs advisor, Touhid Hossain, said India will be obligated to comply with a request for Sheikh Hasina's extradition. He said that if such a request is made, it could create an uncomfortable situation for the Indian government.
