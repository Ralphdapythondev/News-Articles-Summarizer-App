Israeli strike kills field commander in elite Hezbollah unit: Sources,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-strike-kills-field-commander-in-elite-hezbollah-unit-sources/articleshow/111845549.cms,"A high-ranking commander in Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces, Habib Maatouk, was killed in an Israeli strike on south Lebanon, according to two security sources on Thursday. Maatouk had recently taken over the position from another commander, Ali Ahmed Hassin, who was also killed in an Israeli strike in April.The strike that killed Maatouk was one of several on the neighbouring border villages of Safad El Battikh and Jmaijmeh.Eighteen wounded individuals were taken to the nearby Tebnine government hospital, as reported by its director, Mohammed Hamadi, to Reuters.However, it was not immediately clear how many of the wounded were fighters and how many were civilians.In a speech on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned that the group would expand the range of its attacks in Israel if more civilians were targeted.Earlier on Thursday, Hamas reported that one of their commanders had been killed in an Israeli strike in Lebanon's West Bekaa, while a Hezbollah member was killed in a separate Israeli strike in the southern town of Jbal El Botm. Throughout the day, Hezbollah announced attacks on Israel with dozens of rockets and missiles, including on the Filon base in Israel's Safed for the first time.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah began when Hezbollah declared a ""support front"" with Palestinians shortly after its ally Hamas attacked southern Israeli border communities on October 7, prompting Israel's military offensive inGaza .The fighting in Lebanon has resulted in the deaths of more than 100 civilians and over 300 Hezbollah fighters, according to a Reuters tally, and has caused significant destruction in Lebanese border towns and villages, comparable to the levels seen during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war.International observers have expressed growing concerns in recent weeks that Israel may expand its military operations in Lebanon, potentially leading to a wider war. While Israel has stated that it is making the necessary preparations for a broader operation, no decision has been made yet. Hezbollah, on the other hand, has declared that it does not desire war with Israel but is prepared for it if necessary.","Habib Maatouk was a high-ranking commander in Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces.

"Ex-Trump adviser Peter Navarro, just released from prison, gets roaring applause at RNC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ex-trump-adviser-peter-navarro-just-released-from-prison-gets-roaring-applause-at-rnc/articleshow/111829862.cms,"MILWAUKEE: Former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro took the stage at the Republican National Convention to enthusiastic cheers hours after being released from prison and pushed talk of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol to the center of an event that has largely avoided mentioning the riot.Navarro left a Miami prison in the morning, completing a four-month sentence for refusing to cooperate with a congressional investigation into the attack by a mob of former President Donald Trump's supporters trying to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.He then took a flight to Milwaukee.Immediately, Navarro attacked the committee that led the investigation and cast his time in prison as a sign of loyalty to Trump.""The J6 committee demanded that I betray Donald John Trump to save my own skin,"" he said. ""I refused.""His remarks were the first extended mention of the Capitol riot during the first three days of the RNC after programming that has been heavily focused on the economy, national security and immigration. But Trump often mentions the riot in his rallies and speeches - and many in his GOP base argue that the hundreds of people jailed on charges related to the riot have been wrongly prosecuted.""I went to prison so you won't have to,"" Navarro told the raucous crowd. ""I am your wakeup call.""Navarro received some of the most thunderous applause of convention speakers to date, with one woman yelling out, ""I love you, Peter!""Navarro spoke for more than 10 minutes - one of the longest speeches yet -- about what he called the ""lawfare jackals"" he blamed for locking him up. He embraced his fiancee onstage to wild cheers.The scene was the sort of spectacle common at Trump rallies, where the presidential nominee routinely calls those convicted of crimes on Jan. 6 ""hostages."" But there hasn't been a similar moment at the convention, which has so far largely avoided talk about Trump's push to overturn his 2020 loss.In an interview before his speech, Navarro told The Associated Press he was just one example of what many on the right say is the Biden administration's use of the judiciary to punish its political enemies.""I'm a small part of the bigger issue,"" Navarro said, referring to the oft-repeated claim by conservatives that, during President Joe Biden's administration, the justice system has been used to hobble Trump and those close to him. ""If we don't control the government, the government will control us,"" Navarro said.The telephone interview took place as Navarro was awaiting takeoff from a Florida airport for the trip to Milwaukee.Despite his echo of a common GOP refrain that the Biden administration has ""weaponized"" the judicial system to punish Trump and his allies, Navarro said he planned to offer a message of unity, a common theme among Republicans in light of the assassination attempt on the former president Saturday.""To win the election, we have to unite not just the Republican party but the entire country,"" Navarro said. ""I'm going to reach out to Democrats disenchanted with the radical left.""Many ""mainstream Democrats"" are ""disenfranchised, disengaged and disgusted with the radical left,"" Navarro said. ""In Trump's America, people don't have to worry about food on the table, medicine in the cabinet and a roof over their head.""""Unity is my message,"" he added.Trump has accused the Justice Department of targeting him politically with indictments in two criminal cases even as the department also brought tax and gun charges against Biden's son, Hunter. Hunter Biden was convicted on three felony charges last month.A federal judge in Florida this week dismissed one of Trump's federal cases, which accused him of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The Justice Department plans to appeal.Attorney General Merrick Garland has forcefully defended the independence and integrity of the Justice Department against what he has described as unprecedented attacks by Republicans.""The idea that politics infects our prosecutions, nothing could be further from the truth. We have one rule. We follow the facts, and we follow the law and we make the appropriate decisions,"" Garland told reporters last month.Still, Navarro said Democrats are a potentially fertile voting bloc for Trump that he plans to try to reach in his convention speech.Trump won in 2016 in large part by carrying once-Democratic swaths of states carried by former President Barack Obama in 2012, including Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.""Just like Donald Trump, I am fighting for important principles,"" Navarro saidNavarro was the first senior Trump administration official to be locked up for a crime related to the Jan. 6 attack when he reported to a federal prison in Miami in March. He has called his conviction the ""partisan weaponization of the judicial system.""He was subpoenaed by the committee over his promotion of false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election in the run-up to the Capitol insurrection. He has maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. Courts have rejected that argument, finding that Navarro couldn't prove Trump had actually invoked privilege.Longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon reported to prison earlier this month to begin serving his four-month sentence on contempt of Congress charges for defying a subpoena in the congressional Jan. 6 investigation.The House committee spent 18 months investigating the deadly insurrection, interviewing more than 1,000 witnesses, holding 10 hearings and obtaining more than 1 million pages of documents. In its final report, the panel ultimately concluded that Trump criminally engaged in a ""multi-part conspiracy"" to overturn his election loss to Biden and failed to act to stop his supporters from storming the Capitol. Trump insists he did nothing wrong.",Former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro takes the stage at the Republican National Convention to enthusiastic cheers. Navarro attacked the committee that led the investigation and cast his time in prison as a sign of loyalty to Trump. His remarks were the first extended mention of the Capitol riot during the first three days of the RNC.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111829900,imgsize-1491983,width-400,resizemode-4/111829900.jpg"

Donald Trump , the Republican presidential candidate, on Thursday recounted his personal experience of the assassination attempt on his life during a rally at Pennsylvania rally.While delivering his speech at the closing night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump called for unity among Americans.Trump vividly described the moment when the assassin's bullet nearly struck him, missing by a mere quarter of an inch.He shared the details of the incident, stating, ""I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear. I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet. If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the bullet would have perfectly hit its mark. I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack, and in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground.""Trump said that the attack was swiftly ended by a Secret Service sniper, who took out the assassin with a single shot from a greater distance.“There was blood pouring everywhere, yet, in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side,"" Trump said. “I'm not supposed to be here tonight.""The crowd responded with chants of ""Yes you are,"" to which Trump replied, ""I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God.

Sharpshooters were positioned on top of the event hall and on nearby buildings as dozens of people waited in line to enter. Among the mourners were firefighters in dress uniforms.Comperatore, 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer, was an Army reservist and spent many years as a volunteer firefighter after serving as chief, according to his obituary.Trump suffered an ear injury but was not seriously hurt and has been participating this week in the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.Mourners filled Laube Hall, a space with white brick walls, white linens, white curtains and exposed wooden beams that's normally used for weddings and other celebratory occasions.Guests walked past a large, framed photo of Comperatore holding a fish, while a slideshow of photos from his life was projected on a screen - his wedding, a recent 50th birthday party, time with his daughters, firefighting, fishing on a lake and palling around with his beloved Dobermans.The gathering included firefighters from other nearby communities and people involved in local and state Republican politics.Rich Tallis, a Penn Hills volunteer firefighter who attended the visitation, did not know Comperatore personally but felt a need to honor his memory.""Any first responder, it's a brotherhood - police, EMS fire, military. We're technically all one,"" he said. ""When one goes, we all go.""Tables inside the hall were lined with flowers - some sent by fire departments in New York and West Virginia, an auto racing circuit and the mayor of a nearby community. Others came from people in faraway places such as Connecticut and Florida who knew of Comperatore only because of his death.The messages on the cards accompanying the arrangements praised his selflessness and dedication to his family. One said his name would be ""written in the history books.""Mourners took turns pausing in front of Comperatore's open casket, which was adorned with flower arrangements and ribbons with words such as ""dad"" and ""husband.""In a corner was a framed copy of a note to Comperatore's wife signed by Trump and former first lady Melania Trump. ""Corey will forever be remembered as a True American Hero,"" they wrote.Retired New York City Fire Department Lt. Joe Torrillo said outside the visitation that he came because Comperatore was a firefighter who lost his life the same way he lived his life - like a hero.""And, you know, a lot of people maybe wouldn't or couldn't have done what he did,"" Torrillo said.Jon Ruffley, who lives outside Pittsburgh and attended part of the Trump rally Saturday, went to the visitation with his wife and young child. He said he hoped his presence sent a supportive message to the family that ""we stick together as Americans regardless of, you know, what someone's political affiliations are.""""I think it's really important that we raise our kids in a way where we can see that political violence is unacceptable, that we stand for having important discourses about things in, in our society,"" he said.A box truck parked on a route to the banquet hall displayed video screens showing slides, including a photograph of Trump raising his fist after Saturday's shooting. It had the slogan ""never surrender"" and a message expressing prayers for Trump and Comperatore.The visitation, which was broken into a pair of two-hour blocks, was the second of two public events memorializing and celebrating Comperatore's life. Hundreds of people gathered Wednesday at a vigil for him at an auto racing track.A private funeral is scheduled for Friday. Trump is not going to the funeral because of Secret Service concerns, according to a source familiar who was not authorised to speak publicly.A statement issued Thursday by Comperatore's family described him as a ""beloved father and husband, and a friend to so many throughout the Butler region.""""Our family is finding comfort and peace through the heartfelt messages of encouragement from people around the world, through the support of our church and community, and most of all through the strength of God,"" the statement said.Dan Ritter, who gave a eulogy at Wednesday's vigil, said he bought Comperatore's childhood home in 1993, sparking a friendship that grew with their shared values of family, Christian faith and politics.""Corey loved his family and was always spending time with them,"" Ritter said. ""This past Saturday was supposed to be one of those days for him. He did what a good father would do. He protected those he loved. He's a true hero for us all.""Comperatore's pastor, Jonathan Fehl of Cabot Methodist Church in Cabot, said the family ""has been humbled by the way this community has rallied around them"" and by the support they have received from people around the world.The vigil concluded with people in the crowd lighting candles and raising cellphones, glow sticks and lighters as Comperatore's favorite song - ""I Can Only Imagine,"" by Christian rock band MercyMe - played.Two other people were wounded at the rally: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township. As of Wednesday night, both had been upgraded to serious but stable condition, according to a spokesperson with Allegheny Health Network.Joseph Feldman, an attorney for Copenhaver, said Wednesday that he had spoken with his client by phone.""He seems to be in good spirits, but he also understands the gravity of the situation,"" Feldman said. ""And he's deeply saddened about what has occurred, and he's deeply sympathetic"" to the other victims and their families.Feldman said Copenhaver suffered ""life-altering injuries,"" declining to go into detail. He said Copenhaver's priority is to ""keep up with the medical treatment he's receiving and hopefully be released at some point.""In a statement, Dutch's family thanked the ""greater western Pennsylvania community and countless others across the country and world"" for the incredible outpouring of prayers and well wishes.","Mourners filled Laube Hall, a space with white brick walls, white linens, white curtains and exposed wooden beams. Sharpshooters were positioned on top of the event hall and on nearby buildings as dozens of people waited in line to enter.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111849570,imgsize-1095146,width-400,resizemode-4/111849570.jpg"

It has also created the world's largest displacement crisis, with more than 11 million people forced to flee their homes.Thomas-Greenfield said Thursday's contribution raises total US humanitarian assistance to Sudan to $1.6 billion since September 2023, making the United States Sudan's largest single donor.""We hope this new round of aid serves as a call to action for others to follow,"" she said.The ambassador said the additional $203 million will go toward food supplies, shelters, schools and health services, as well as cash assistance to refugees to help pay their rents. The funds also will help neighboring countries, where over 2 million Sudanese refugees have fled, she said.The US mission to the UN said Thomas-Greenfield briefed UN diplomats on the hunger crisis in Sudan, where a record 25 million people face acute food insecurity and 755,000 people face famine in the coming months, according toa recent report by the UN global network monitoring the threat of famine.Human rights experts working for the United Nations said both sides have used food and starvation as a weapon of war.Thomas-Greenfield recalled her visit to a hospital in Chad run by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders: ""Children were so weak they lacked the energy to even cry.""Global humanitarian aid organization Mercy Corps recently estimated that nine in 10 children suffer from life-threatening malnutrition in central Darfur, where the World Food Program has delivered aid in recent months after facing challenges negotiating access with armed groups.Thomas-Greenfield said the US will continue diplomatic efforts to hold perpetrators of the violence accountable and reach a peace agreement between the warring parties.Last week, representatives of the two sides arrived in Geneva for separate talks with the UN secretary-general's personal envoy, Ramtane Lamamra, about protecting civilians through possible local cease-fires.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said late Thursday that Lamamra and his team have continued engaging separately with each of the delegations throughout this week on humanitarian assistance and protection of civilians.

'20 min before shooting'

FBI officials told members of Congress on Wednesday that the gunman who tried to kill ex-Prez Donald Trump used his cellphone and other devices to search images of Trump and Prez Joe Biden , along with an array of public figures.The 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks , also looked up dates of Trump's appearances and the Democratic National Convention, according to people on two conference calls held to answer lawmakers' questions.The disclosures, made during private briefings to lawmakers by the FBI and the head of the embattled Secret Service , offered the most complete portrait so far of a would-be assassin with no criminal history, or even clearly discernible political beliefs. Still, no clear motive for the attack has emerged.The FBI has been scouring Crooks' possessions, including two phones and at least one laptop, for clues about his motive. So far, they have found no indication that Crooks, who was a registered Republican, had strong partisan political views one way or another, bureau officials told lawmakers. Nor have they uncovered any evidence of co-conspirators or connections to foreign actors. The officials told lawmakers that there was some indication that the gunman, who led a quiet life and worked at a nursing home near his house, might have been struggling with depression. Officials said he had looked up ""major depressive disorder"".Among the other prominent figures the gunman searched for using one of his phones: FBI Director Christopher Wray; attorney general Merrick Garland; and a member of the British royal family, according to two sources. Wray, who was also on the calls, cautioned that the probe was still in early stages.Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, acknowledged during one of the calls that her agency made serious ""mistakes"", and provided new information about Crooks' movements during the shooting. During the briefing with senators, officials ran through a timeline of events, noting that law enforcement officers had identified the gunman as suspicious about an hour before the shooting but then lost track of him. About 20 minutes before the shooting, a sniper spotted him again, the sources said. Some senators left their call angry with the Secret Service after learning that officers did not intervene before he opened fire.","The 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, also looked up dates of Trump's appearances and the Democratic National Convention, according to people on two conference calls held to answer lawmakers' questions.

Dobbs began his career at CNN in 1980, serving as a reporter and network vice president.

He hosted the business program Moneyline, which premiered in 1980 and was later renamed Lou Dobbs Tonight in 2003.

He resigned from CNN in 1999 but rejoined the network in 2001 before resigning again in 2009.

From 2011 to 2021, Dobbs hosted Lou Dobbs Tonight on the Fox Business Network, where he became known for his staunch support of former President Donald Trump and his anti-immigration views. The show was canceled in February 2021 following a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit filed against Fox News by Smartmatic, a voting machine vendor, over statements made by Dobbs and other Fox hosts about the 2020 presidential election.

In recent years, Dobbs hosted a show on the streaming platform Lindell TV, owned by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a prominent supporter of Trump's false claims of election fraud.

Dobbs was born in Texas in 1945 and graduated from Harvard University with a degree in economics.

He briefly attended the University of Idaho and Idaho State University before being persuaded by his high school staff to apply to Harvard.

NEW DELHI: Lou Dobbs, a prominent conservative political commentator and former longtime host of Lou Dobbs Tonight on CNN and Fox Business Network , has passed away at the age of 78.

US court blocks Biden's student debt relief plan: What it means for borrowers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-court-blocks-bidens-student-debt-relief-plan-what-it-means-for-borrowers/articleshow/111845254.cms,"What it means for borrowers



NEW DELHI: A US federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the implementation of the Joe Biden administration 's student debt relief plan , which would have lowered monthly payments for millions of borrowers .The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, which aimed to provide more generous income-driven repayment terms and loan forgiveness, has now been halted by the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals.The SAVE plan would have lowered monthly payments for eligible borrowers and allowed those with original principal balances of $12,000 or less to have their debt forgiven after 10 years of payments. However, the appeals court granted a request by seven Republican-led states to put the plan on hold, siding with their argument that the administration had overstepped its authority.This ruling means that the millions of borrowers who had already enrolled in the SAVE plan will no longer be able to benefit from its more favorable terms.Instead, they will likely revert to previous income-driven repayment plans, which typically require higher monthly payments and longer repayment periods before any forgiveness is granted.The legal battle over the student debt relief plan has created significant uncertainty and confusion for borrowers.Conflicting injunctions from different federal courts have left the student loan repayment system in disarray, with potential disruptions and complications for those seeking lower payments or debt relief.Advocacy groups have warned of the widespread impact of these court orders, which could make it more difficult for borrowers to access the relief they were counting on. The Biden administration has also cautioned that a reversal of the SAVE plan could lead to significant challenges, including delays and complications for millions of borrowers.With the 8th Circuit's ruling, the future of the student debt relief plan is now uncertain.The involvement of the Supreme Court seems probable, as the highest court in the land may need to weigh in on the legality of the administration's actions. Until then, borrowers will have to navigate the legal uncertainty and potentially face higher monthly payments and fewer options for debt relief.",A US federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the implementation of the Joe Biden administration's student debt relief plan.

"Tishomingo Crash: After crash that killed 6 teens, NTSB chief says people underestimate marijuana's impact on drivers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-crash-that-killed-6-teens-ntsb-chief-says-people-underestimate-marijuanas-impact-on-drivers/articleshow/111844037.cms,"DETROIT: A horrific crash that killed six high school girls in Oklahoma two years ago has the head of the US National Transportation Safety Board urging parents to warn teenagers about the risk of driving after using marijuana.Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy made the appeal to parents Thursday as her agency released the final report on the March 22, 2022 collision between a tiny Chevrolet Spark hatchback and a gravel-hauling semi in the small town of Tishomingo.The board, after an investigation by its staff, determined that the crash was caused by the 16-year-old driver slowing for an intersection, then accelerating through a stop sign because she likely was impaired by recent marijuana use and was distracted by having five teen passengers in the car, the NTSB report said.In an interview, Homendy also said the cannabis problem isn't limited to teens. As more states have legalized recreational marijuana, teens and adults tend to underestimate the risks of driving under its influence.""There's a perception that in states where it's legal that it's safe and legal to drive impaired on marijuana,"" she said.In its report on the crash, the NTSB cited studies showing that marijuana decreases motor coordination, slows reaction time and impairs judgment of time and distance, all critical functions for driving.Currently it's legal for people 21 and older to use marijuana recreationally in 24 states plus Washington, DC, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Oklahoma doesn't allow recreational use, but like most states, it's legal for medical purposes. Driving while impaired by marijuana is illegal in all states and Washington, DC.The NTSB, which investigates transportation-related crashes but has no regulatory power, put out a safety alert Thursday urging parents to talk to young drivers about how marijuana can impair driving, and how they can make responsible choices to avoid driving while impaired or riding with impaired drivers.Homendy said states that have legalized marijuana are behind in making sure people know that it's illegal to drive under its influence. Over half of Americans live in a state where recreational cannabis use is legal, she said.""Unfortunately, I think state laws that are legalizing recreational and medicinal use of marijuana have really come before thoughts or action on what are they going to do about traffic safety ,"" Homendy said. ""They are far ahead on legalizing it, but very behind when it comes to traffic safety.""States, she said, need to collect more data on how legalizing marijuana has affected traffic safety, and they need to start enforcing laws against driving while impaired by cannabis.""Enforcement has got to be there in order to deter,"" she said.One study on crashes in Washington state, which has legalized recreational marijuana use, showed that more drivers involved in fatal crashes tested positive for marijuana after it became legal, the NTSB said.In Tishomingo, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southeast of Oklahoma City, six high school girls got into the car designed to carry four for a lunch break, the NTSB report said.At an intersection, the driver slowed to 1 mile per hour (1.6 kilometers per hour), but accelerated and didn't come to a complete stop for a sign. Instead, she sped up and turned left in front of the gravel truck. The truck driver braked and steered to avoid the Spark, but hit the driver's side at just under 50 mph (80 kilometers per hour). All six teens died of multiple blunt force injuries.Tests on blood taken from the driver's body found a THC concentration of 95.9 nanograms per milliliter, the NTSB said. If such a level of THC, the main chemical component of marijuana, were found in a living person, it would indicate ""a high likelihood that the person had used cannabis very recently, and therefore was likely still experiencing acute impairing cannabis effects,"" the report said.But the NTSB cautioned that body-cavity blood samples can sometimes be contaminated by other body fluids or by THC from other tissues, including the lungs, that may contain high concentrations.In addition, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol found vaping mouthpieces and cannabis buds in the car at the scene of the crash, the report said.The NTSB recommended in the report that the Oklahoma State Department of Education develop a drug and alcohol abuse curriculum for local school districts that tells students about the risk of cannabis-impaired driving . At present, only Massachusetts and Rhode Island have such course requirements, the NTSB said.The agency also wants the Governors Highway Safety Association, a group of state highway safety officers, the National Conference of State Legislatures and the National Association of State Boards of Education to inform members about the Tishomingo crash and the need for cannabis information in school and driver education coursework.The safety association said in a statement that cannabis-impaired driving is a growing safety concern, and state highway safety offices are focused on eliminating all impaired driving.""We have to start communicating well ahead of time, to kids, that driving, having ingested or smoked or inhaled marijuana is impairing, and it's a risk to them and a risk to others,"" Homendy said.","Six high school girls were killed in a crash in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, two years ago. The NTSB says the 16-year-old driver likely was impaired by recent marijuana use. The agency is urging parents to talk to young drivers about how marijuana can impair driving.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111844072,imgsize-1422716,width-400,resizemode-4/111844072.jpg"

It stated that security forces killed all 10 assailants in the ensuing gunfight.The attack on Bannu cantonment, the ISPR said, had been orchestrated by militants based in Afghanistan. “The attempt to enter the cantonment was effectively thwarted by security forces personnel, which forced the terrorists to ram an explosives-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall of the cantonment,” ISPR said.It added that the suicide car bombing destroyed a portion of the wall and damaged adjoining infrastructure, resulting in the deaths of the eight soldiers.“In the ensuing operation, our troops effectively engaged the terrorists as a result of which all 10 terrorists were sent to hell,” the army said. “This timely and effective response by the security forces prevented a major catastrophe, saving precious innocent lives,” it added.Locals said the blast was heard miles away and caused damage to nearby houses and shops. They said they saw black smoke billowing above the site and heard gunshots in the cantonment area.A militant outfit allied with the globally designated terrorist group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) took responsibility for the attack shortly after it started.The ISPR statement attributed the assault to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group which, according to it, operates from Afghanistan and has used Afghan soil to orchestrate acts of terrorism inside Pakistan in the past.Bannu and adjoining districts in the border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have particularly seen frequent TTP attacks targeting military and police forces since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan three years ago.Pakistan maintains TTP leaders and fighters are being increasingly facilitated by the de facto rulers of Afghanistan. The Taliban govt dismisses the allegations, saying TTP is an internal problem for Pakistan to deal with.There has been a sharp rise in terror incidents since PM Shehbaz Sharif announced anewmilitary offensive against militancy and extremism in the country’s northwestern and southwestern border regions. The announcement was vehemently resisted by Pashtun and Baloch leaderships in Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces through public protests, rallies and digital media campaigns.","At least 15 people, including 10 soldiers, killed in two separate attacks in the volatile northwest bordering Afghanistan.

However, the PTI leader declined to meet with the team, which sought to interrogate him on charges related to inciting public unrest against the state, as reported by Dawn.According to Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Asghar, Imran Khan was arrested as the primary suspect in 12 cases registered at different police stations in Lahore. The charges against him range from provoking the public to attacks on government properties and military installations.Senior police officials specified that the focus of the investigation primarily centred on two cases: the assault on the Lahore corps commander's residence and the Askari Tower.The cases were filed at several police stations, including Sarwar Road, Gulberg, Race Course, Naseerabad, Shadman, and others in Lahore.In today's hearing at anti-terrorism Court-I before Judge Khalid Arshad , the police requested a 30-day physical remand for Imran Khan to facilitate further investigation into the 12 cases.

Import premiums during the period remained unchanged at USD 9.60 and USD 6.50 per barrel for petrol and HSD, respectively, while the Pakistani Rupee depreciated by about 17 paise against the dollar over the same fortnight.The government also disclosed its decision to raise the maximum limit of the petroleum development levy (PDL) to PKR 70 per litre through the Finance Bill. This move aims to bolster revenue collection, targeting PKR 1.28 trillion for the current fiscal year, up from PKR 960 billion in the previous year and surpassing the initial budget target by PKR 91 billion.Taxes on both petrol and HSD currently stand at approximately PKR 77 per litre, alongside a fixed PKR 60 per litre PDL, which notably impacts consumers. Additionally, a PKR 17 per litre customs duty is applied uniformly to both locally produced and imported petrol and HSD.The price hikes in petrol and diesel are expected to impact inflation, with petrol predominantly used in private transport, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, while diesel is crucial for heavy transport vehicles and contributes significantly to the cost of essential commodities such as vegetables, Dawn reported.","Petrol prices surged by PKR 9.99 per litre, reaching PKR 275.6/ltr, while HSD saw a rise of PKR 6.18/ ltr.

""We believe Article 17 of the Constitution gives the govt the right to ban political parties.""Tarar said that besides Imran and Alvi, the govt had decided to slap a treason case on ex-deputy speaker Qasim Suri under Article 6 for dissolving the assemblies in April 2022 despite a no-confidence motion moved against the then government in parliament.“The reference, under Article 6, will be sent to the apex court after being approved by the cabinet,"" he said.Article 6 states, ""Any person who abrogates or subverts or suspends, or holds in abeyance or attempts or conspires to abrogate or subvert or suspend the Constitution by use of force, or show force or by any other unconstitutional means shall be guilty of high treason.""The minister said the Sharif govt would also submit a review petition in the apex court, challenging its verdict on reserved seats.Lawyer-politician Moiz Jaferii said a political party couldn't be banned other than through a reference to the apex court.

""The apex court gave relief to the PTI which had not even asked for it,"" the minister said.Referring to the time when the then-government decided to dissolve the assemblies during the no-confidence motion against Khan in 2022, the minister said the ruling alliance has also decided to move a case against the then-prime minister, then-president Alvi and then National Assembly deputy speaker Qasim Suri.""Whether it was the foreign funding case, the riots of May 9, or the manipulation of the cipher saga, in which the former Pakistani ambassador to the US, Asad Majeed - who authored the cipher - clarified that there was ""no threat"", the PTI continued decrying that the country was in danger.Meanwhile, Khan has been jailed for nearly a year in a series of cases which he claimed were orchestrated to prevent his return to power in February elections.The Supreme Court, however, granted the PTI more seats in parliament in a landmark ruling last week, while Khan's illegal marriage conviction was overturned on Saturday.","Pakistan government has decided to ban the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ), alleging that the former ruling party was involved in number of anti-state activities.

The former first couple was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) soon after a district and sessions court on Saturday quashed their conviction in their un-Islamic marriage case.The court's short order also stated to release Khan and Bibi immediately unless they were wanted in other cases.The NAB, which filed a new Toshakhana case against the couple, on Sunday presented them before Judge Muhammad Ali Warraich of the accountability court.The judge conducted the hearing inside the Adiala Jail due to security reasons.NAB Deputy Director Mohsin Haroon, who led the team to arrest them, requested their physical remand and the court, after hearing the lawyers, agreed to grant an eight-day remand.The court then ordered to present the two on July 22.The remand period can be extended to a maximum of 40 days at the request of NAB if it is needed to probe the suspects.Khan, objecting to the absence of media, said at the beginning of the hearing: ""If the media is not allowed, I will walk out of the court.""The court subsequently ordered media representatives to be brought inside the jail, and the hearing commenced once they arrived.Khan, 71, then addressed the judge directly, asserting that his wife had no involvement in the Toshakhana case, The Express Tribune reported.""I have read the Quran four times in jail, and it places a great responsibility on judges,"" he stated. ""Bushra Bibi is only imprisoned to cause me distress.""Bibi, 49, was also re-arrested on Saturday in the new NAB reference as she was to be released from Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail.He accused higher authorities of targeting his wife due to his decisions and said: ""My wife is being targeted by the King because I removed him from the ISI position, and my wife did not support him.""He referred to the army chief Gen. Asim Munir without naming him.""Jail me, but leave my wife alone. Judge, you are answerable to Allah, not the ISI. Judge Bashir said a decision was made at gunpoint,"" Khan pleaded.""A former prime minister being told in the middle of the night that he has to appear for a brand new case in the morning,"" he remarked wryly.He harshly criticised the accountability watchdog and alleged that it was operating like robots, doing whatever they are paid to do.He added, ""In the previous case, the jewellery set, which was valued at Rs 18 million, was claimed to be worth Rs 3.25 billion.""""I am only speaking about my wife. Re-arresting her [Bushra Bibi] was a grave mistake,"" the cricketer-turned-politician said.The new Toshakhana case is based on the accusation that the couple during Khan's government purchased gifts from the state depository in violation of rules.This is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.Last week, the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the National Assembly and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.",Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi handed over to anti-corruption officials.

Tough road ahead for Imran Khan despite back-to-back judicial relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tough-road-ahead-for-imran-khan-despite-back-to-back-judicial-relief/articleshow/111729030.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Despite back-to-back judicial relief to beleaguered Imran Khan , his woes are far from over and Pakistan 's former prime minister remains in jail with his wife Bushra Bibi. A district and session court on Saturday overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case related to the violation of the mandatory waiting period for a Muslim woman between two marriages.The relief came a day after the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the national and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some kind of change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.The court in the Iddat case verdict stated that Khan and his wife should be released ""if not required to be detained in any other case"" and anticipating his release a large number of PTI supporters accompanied by key leaders reached the Adiala Jail Rawalpindi, where they have been kept, to welcome them.But the PTI feared counter-measures by the government and announced that Khan would be arrested in three cases related to May 9 violence. However, it emerged that he and his wife were taken into custody by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB ) in a fresh Toshakhana corruption case .Khan and his wife during his government allegedly obtained gifts from the gift repository at low prices and sold them at higher rates.It is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.The new case alleged that the couple got some precious watches and other gifts from the state depository by violating rules.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.Despite dozens of cases against him and several party leaders, he has kept up his rhetoric by attacking the senior Army leadership , and his supporters churning out half-baked stories against the establishment on social media.The Army this month after a key meeting termed the attack on social media as ""digital terrorism"", calling it ""unwarranted criticism by some quarters"".Army commanders stated that the onslaught of politically motivated digital terrorism, unleashed by conspirators, duly abetted by their foreign cohorts against state institutions is meant to induce despondency in the nation and sow discord through the peddling of blatant lies, fake news and propaganda.The forum affirmed that military leadership is cognizant of the full spectrum of the challenges and resolved to shoulder its constitutionally mandated responsibilities with the support of the resilient people of Pakistan.Khan on his side uses the presence of media on the occasion of hearing cases against him in the Adiala Jail to fire salvos at rivals, showing unflinching resolve to fight. He also reiterates not to spare his tormentors.His own X handle is active, apparently operated by someone on his behalf, charging his opponents from the Army and civilians with an unwavering commitment. The same attitude has been displayed by his party leaders who often compete with each other to breathe more fire than others.All this had added to his hardships despite getting relief from the courts regularly.In the latest arrest, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) is expected to produce Khan and his wife before an accountability judge to seek their physical remand. Under the law, NAB can detain a person for 40 days on remand for investigation.As courts operate within rules, it is not easy for his legal team to secure his release.The circuitous legal battle is getting more entangled due to the official opposition to his release from jail.Recently, political advisor to Prime Minister, Rana Sanaullah, reportedly stated that new cases would be lodged against Khan in the coming days. Talking to the reporters in Lahore on June 15, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stated that Khan's detention for the next five years was necessary to bring economic stability.""People come to us and tell us if Pakistan has to progress then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,"" he said.","A district and session court overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case.

This was the last case keeping Khan in prison but he will not walk free as the authorities immediately issued fresh orders for his arrest in three other cases.In a short order, additional sessions judge Afzal Majoka directed authorities to immediately release Khan and his wife if they are not wanted in any other case.After the decision Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said, “Mr Khan has been arrested in three more cases.” The three cases are linked to violence against the military and other state installations after his brief arrest in May 2023.“An anti-terrorism court in Lahore approved the request to arrest Imran Khan in the May 9 case,” the PTI statement read. The party warned that keeping Khan, 71, in jail after Saturday’s decision would lead to another political crisis.Just days before national polls on Feb 8 the couple were sentenced to seven years in jail in the “iddat” case after the court found them guilty of breaking Islamic law by failing to observe the required interval between Bibi’s divorce from her previous husband and her marriage to Khan. The verdict had coincided with his convictions and sentences in the Toshakhana (state treasure store) and cipher cases. His sentences in two alleged graft cases, however, were suspended, while his sentence in the cipher case, linked to leaking of state secrets, was overturned. Various courts have also freed him in several other cases linked to the events of May 9, 2023 when his first arrest had caused riots across the country, following which the state launched a crackdown against him and his party.Ahead of Khan’s acquittal in a fake marriage case , a pair of applications was filed by Khawar Fareed Maneka, Bushra’s previous husband. One application asked the court to carry out a medical checkup of his ex-wife to ascertain her menstrual cycle while the other called on religious scholars for consultation on further deliberation on the duration of “iddat”.Before ordering Khan and his wife’s release, judge Majoka dismissed both applications. “Both petitions seeking the formation of a medical board and consultations with religious scholars are hereby rejected,” the verdict stated.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023. He blames powerful military generals for his ouster from power in April 2022.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, acquitted in a case of unlawful marriage.
