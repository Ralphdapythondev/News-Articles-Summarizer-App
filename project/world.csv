'A never Trump guy': A Vance remix goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-never-trump-guy-a-vance-remix-goes-viral/articleshow/112753355.cms,"One of the hottest tracks on TikTok this summer is, unexpectedly, a 22-second Petey Pablo hip-hop beat remixed with a years-old audio clip of JD Vance - now former prez Donald Trump's vice presidential pick - declaring, before his loyalties changed, that he was ""a never Trump guy "".The song has been used in over 8,500 TikTok videos since two independent music producers created it in July.Supporters of vice-prez Kamala Harris have seized on it, wagging their fingers and swinging their arms to it, some hoping to create its official dance. It was also reposted by @KamalaHQ, the campaign's official TikTok account. Videos with the sound have racked up more than 40 million views overall, according to Zelf, a social video analytics company focused on TikTok.In response to the TikTok video, Taylor Van Kirk, a Vance spokesperson, said: ""Cringe"".The ""never Trump guy"" song was created by Carl Dixon and Steve Terrell, two 34-year-old music producers. Dixon and Terrell saw the footage of Vance's comments in a post on the Harris campaign's TikTok account that compared them with newer footage of him expressing support for Trump. The two found Vance's manner of speech ""sort of melodic in a sense"", Terrell said. Dixon said, ""We were like, what if we put this to a catchy beat?"" The process took three hours, they said.Their video started with footage of a member of the Harris campaign staff saying, ""So this is really who Donald Trump chose as his running mate?"" A different voice then says, ""Drop the beat"", after which a sample of Petey Pablo's ""Freek-a-Leek"" plays, remixed with Vance saying, ""I'm a never Trump guy"" and ""I never liked him.""Sasha Khatami, 24, from Virginia, came across the song on TikTok in July. ""I don' think people are sharing their opinions any more. They're making TikTok dances,"" she said. Khatami, whose earlier posts got between 300 and 1,000 views, made up a dance to the ""never Trump guy"" song - and was thrilled to see her post rack up hundreds of thousands of views. Since then, she has performed the dance in front of iconic locations and has been tickled to see other users perform their own version of her shimmy.","The song has been used in over 8,500 TikTok videos since two independent music producers created it in July.

His newly minted Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris , had just accused him of grovelling to dictators, imperilling democracy, betraying American values and, to top it off, deemed him ""an unserious man"".So Trump picked up the phone and called Fox News . The network quickly patched him in to its live coverage of the DNC , and the former prez proceeded to issue a meandering, stream-of-consciousness rebuttal.He asked why Harris hadn't already done all the things she was promising to do considering she was still vice-prez. Several times, Fox anchors tried to interject to ask a question but Trump ignored them. At several points, a familiar beeping sound interrupted Trump's remarks. It appeared that the ex-prez was accidentally pressing buttons on the keypad of his phone.The impromptu call-in - which lasted for 10 minutes, until Fox News informed Trump that the network had run out of time - came shortly after he had taken to his social media platform, Truth Social, to provide real-time commentary. ""Where's Hunter?"" he asked as Harris came onstage, reviving one of his favourite slogans about the son of Prez Biden. At one point, referring to Harris,Trump asked, in all capital letters, ""Is she talking about me?"" (She was, often.) Trump also accused Harris's running mate, Tim Walz, of puffing up his resume as a leader of a high school football team. ""Walz was an ASSISTANT Coach, not a COACH,"" he wrote.","The ex-prez made the impromptu call-in to Fox News during the DNC.

'Tyrants are laughing at her': What Donald Trump said about Kamala Harris' DNC speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tyrants-are-laughing-at-her-what-donald-trump-said-about-kamala-harris-dnc-speech/articleshow/112728097.cms,"Former US President and Republican nominee Donald Trump reacted strongly to Kamala Harris 's speech during the final night of the Democratic National Convention on Thursday. As Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination, Trump accused her of 'lying' and shared his live reactions on X through his Truth Social account.In anticipation of her address, Trump clearly expressed his intent to denounce Harris by posting on Truth Social, ""I'm getting ready to be fair but critical of Comrade Kamala Harris.My Play by Play will be on TRUTH Social, starting SOON!""As Harris began her speech, Trump wasted no time taking to social media to share his thoughts. He blasted her opening remarks, posting, ""Too many 'Thank yous,' too rapidly said, what's going on with her?""Trump went on tweeting spree on the vice president, focusing on her early remarks about her childhood and career aspirations. He urged her to address other pressing issues, writing, ""A lot of talk about childhood, we've got to get to the Border, Inflation, and Crime!""As Harris made a forceful defence of Ukraine and Nato in her speech, she attacked Trump’s past comments on the war in Ukraine.“As President, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our Nato allies,” Harris declared, highlighting her commitment to international alliances.She also said that five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, she warned President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and helped lead the US diplomatic response, rallying “more than 50 countries” to support Ukraine.In response, Trump defended his record on Nato, tweeting, ""Nato wasn’t paying their Bills, almost every Country was delinquent. When I said, 'If you don’t pay, we’re out, the United States is tired of being a sucker,' the money came rolling in by the BILLIONS, and I saved Nato!""Trump also seized the moment to criticise Harris on domestic issues, particularly immigration. As Harris also addressed about reforming America's broken immigration system in her speech at DNC.He accused her of wanting to grant citizenship to all undocumented immigrants. ""She just called to give all Illegals CITIZENSHIP, SAY GOODBYE TO THE USA! SHE IS A RADICAL MARXIST!"" Trump tweeted.Continuing his social media onslaught, Republican nominee posted, ""She talked about the Rule of Law but, as Border Czar, she allowed 20 Million people into our Country, many of them Criminals, who are MAIMING and KILLING our people!""Trump, with other top Republicans, has frequently labelled Harris a failed ""border czar"" in attacks on social media and during rally speeches, despite the fact that she never officially held this title. In March 2021, President Biden tasked Harris with addressing the ""root causes"" of migration to the US, a role distinct from direct oversight of border enforcement.Kamala Harris also highlighted Trump's past praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her speech, asserting, “I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators.”In reaction, Trump tweeted, ""The Tyrants are laughing at her; she’s weak and ineffective. For three and a half years, she has done nothing but enable them to become STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!""He further criticised Harris, stating, ""There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris because she will lead us into Nuclear World War III! She will never earn the respect of the Tyrants of the World!""Harris on the final night of DNC said that she would “always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself,” while also pressing for the release of hostages and a cease-fire deal.She also acknowledged the dire situation in Gaza, saying, “At the same time, what has happened in Gaza in the last 10 months is devastating, so many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing to safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.”On her statement, Trump criticised Harris's statements on Israel, posting, ""SHE HATES ISRAEL - Wouldn’t even show up to Congress for Netanyahu’s session!"" He also made inflammatory claims, asserting, ""She caused the Attack of October 7th. Iran was BROKE - Didn’t have money for Hezbollah!""Harris took the center stage to officially accept her nomination, nearly a month after she entered the race following President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw.","Former US President and Republican nominee Donald Trump reacted strongly to Kamala Harris's speech during the final night of the Democratic National Convention.

Remembering a legacy: Death and reflection

A guiding force for the future

Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris delivered a powerful tribute to her late mother , Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris , a figure who profoundly influenced her life and career at the Democratic National Convention today. The convention, which has been a showcase of the party’s key figures and their personal stories, saw Harris reflect on her mother’s legacy and its impact on her own journey.""I miss her every day, and especially right now - and I know she's looking down, smiling,"" Harris began, as she accepted the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nomination. She recounted her mother’s remarkable journey from India to the United States, where she pursued a groundbreaking career in biomedical science.Dr Shyamala Gopalan Harris arrived in California at just 19 years old, driven by an ambitious dream to become a scientist who would make significant strides in cancer research.Harris also shared the personal aspect of her mother's story, explaining how Gopalan was initially expected to return to India for a traditional arranged marriage. However, fate led her to meet and marry Donald J. Harris, an economist from Jamaica.This union resulted in the birth of Kamala and her sister Maya, marking the beginning of a new chapter in their lives. “When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. They fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister, Maya, and me,” Harris said.Maya Harris, in her speech, echoed these sentiments, highlighting how their mother’s journey was emblematic of the American dream. She noted that their mother would be immensely proud of Kamala but would also remind her to keep working tirelessly. “Mommy’s journey, and the opportunity that she wanted for Kamala and me - that’s a distinctly American story,” Maya said.Shyamala Gopalan’s contributions to science were significant; she worked as a breast cancer researcher, making notable advancements in the field.Despite her impactful career, she spent considerable time in Wisconsin, where she worked at the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The family’s move to Madison, however, was a period that also contributed to the eventual separation of Kamala’s parents.Dr Gopalan passed away in 2009 from colon cancer at the age of 70. Kamala Harris, who was serving as San Francisco's district attorney at the time, made a poignant journey to Chennai, India, to honor her mother’s memory by scattering her ashes.Harris has often reflected on her mother’s influence in her writings and speeches. In her memoir, ""The Truths We Hold,"" she described her mother as the cornerstone of her achievements. “Mommy, you are the star of this book because you are the reason for everything,” Harris wrote.As Harris prepares to accept the Democratic nomination and potentially make history as the first female US president, her mother’s legacy remains a guiding force. Dr Shyamala Gopalan Harris, though not physically present at the convention, continues to inspire and shape the trajectory of her daughter’s career and life.With her mother’s influence ever-present, Kamala Harris stands poised to carry forward a legacy of ambition, resilience, and dedication to public service.","Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris delivered a powerful tribute to her late mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris.

In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts that have devastated their populations and infrastructure.To explore and understand which countries face the highest levels of danger, we turn to the Global Peace Index (GPI) compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace.The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations, highlighting those most impacted by war, violence, and unrest.This non-profit organization annually evaluates 163 countries across 23 indicators, including internal conflicts, societal safety, and levels of militarization, providing a comprehensive assessment of global peace and security. Here’s the list of the most dangerous countries in the world.With a 2024 GPI score of 3.397, Yemen continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. Since the onset of civil conflict in 2015, the nation has been plunged into chaos, with widespread famine, disease, and infrastructure collapse exacerbating the situation.The conflict, which started as an internal struggle, has been prolonged and intensified by the involvement of neighbouring countries, each backing different factions. This has only deepened the suffering of the Yemeni people, who face unimaginable hardships daily.Sudan remains one of the most dangerous countries globally, primarily due to ongoing conflicts in regions like Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. In 2024, these conflicts resulted in over 3,000 deaths and displaced nearly 2 million people.The humanitarian crisis is severe, with frequent attacks on civilians by government forces, opposition groups, and militias. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 14 million people in Sudan are in dire need of humanitarian aid.South Sudan, with a GPI score of 3.324, remains one of the world's most perilous countries due to ongoing civil conflict, ethnic violence, and political instability. Since gaining independence in 2011, the country has struggled to maintain peace and stability, with its citizens facing continuous threats from internal strife and external pressures.Afghanistan, with a 2024 GPI score of 3.294, continues to be one of the most dangerous countries worldwide. Decades of conflict, compounded by the Taliban's seizure of power in 2021, have left the nation in a state of constant instability.The risks of terrorism, kidnappings, and widespread violence remain high, making Afghanistan a focal point of international concern.Ukraine has witnessed a significant decline in safety and stability, particularly since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. By 2024, the conflict has claimed over 150,000 lives, with millions more displaced both internally and externally.The destruction of cities and critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals, has created a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions.The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer from one of the deadliest conflicts in African history. The ongoing violence, which has spanned more than four and a half years, has resulted in more lives lost than any other conflict since World War II, according to the International Rescue Committee. The DRC remains a highly dangerous place, with widespread violence and instability threatening the lives of millions.In 2024, Russia's GPI score of 3.249 reflects the nation's increasing danger, exacerbated by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Internally, Russia faces significant challenges, including organized crime and corruption, which undermine law and order.Additionally, environmental concerns, such as industrial accidents and pollution, pose substantial health risks to the population.Since the onset of its civil war in 2011, Syria has been one of the world's most dangerous countries. The conflict has devastated infrastructure, leaving buildings, roads, hospitals, and schools in ruins.The humanitarian situation is dire, with over 13 million Syrians in need of assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced. Food insecurity is rampant, and the healthcare system is in disarray, with many hospitals destroyed or operating at minimal capacity.Mali has been embroiled in armed conflict since January 2012, when Tuareg rebels seized control of the northern territory, declaring the independent nation of Azawad by April of that year. The situation escalated further with a military coup in March 2012, deepening the turmoil in the region. Today, Mali remains one of the most dangerous countries, with ongoing violence and instability threatening the safety of its citizens","The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations.

Eugenio Ernesto Hernandez-Garnier, 27, and Yusleydis Blanca Loyola, 32 were flying from Miami when the airlines staff approached them and asked Eugenio to clean up the blood coming out of his head.He said he did not have any clan bandage and refused to get off.The request soon turn into an altercation as Eugenio said, ""If we can't fly, no one else can either"". Loyola posted a TikTok video capturing the argument where she repeatedly told that her partner just had a surgery.After they were arrested, first they were taken to the hospital and then placed in jail. On Tuesday night, they were released following which they said they were cleared for flying by the doctor. A flight attendant “tells me you either go out, or I’m gonna call the police,” Eugenio said, adding he was in pain from the surgery. “I said, call the police, because that’s injustice.

The company identified the perpetrators as the same Iranian hacker group that recently compromised the Trump campaign.According to Meta's blog post, the hacking attempts involved a small number of accounts posing as technical support for various online services, including AOL, Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft.The company blocked these accounts after users flagged them as suspicious, and there was no evidence to suggest that the targeted WhatsApp accounts had been successfully compromised.The hacking group responsible for these attempts, known as APT42 , is believed to be connected to an intelligence division within Iran's military. This group is known for installing surveillance software on the mobile devices of its targets, allowing them to record calls, steal text messages, and secretly activate cameras and microphones.Meta linked APT42's activities to the recent efforts to breach US presidential campaigns , as reported by Microsoft and Google earlier this month, in the lead-up to the November US presidential election. The company's blog post refrained from naming the targeted individuals, stating only that the hackers ""appeared to have focused on political and diplomatic officials, business and other public figures, including some associated with administrations of President Biden and former President Trump.""The targeted individuals were located in Israel, the Palestinian territories, Iran, the United States, and the United Kingdom.According to the NBC news, both the US government and Google confirmed that a cyberespionage group linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have tried to target the presidential campaigns of both parties.

The ballpark, which has been featured in several movies, including "" A League of Their Own ,"" suffered extensive damage in the blaze.The flames that tore through Jay Littleton Ball Park in Ontario, did more than damage wood and metal; they scorched a piece of history.The grandstand, a fixture since 1937 and a beloved backdrop for iconic films like ""A League of Their Own,"" was reduced to charred remains in a late-night blaze.According to Dan Bell, the city communications director, firefighters arrived at the scene promptly at 11:25 pm on Thursday after receiving a report of the fire. However, by the time they reached the location, ""the structure was already fully engulfed.""The cause of the fire remains under investigation, and no injuries have been reported. The grandstands, described as ""traditional, old-school,"" were constructed in 1937 and extended from behind home plate along the first- and third-base lines. Despite multiple renovations over the years, officials suggested that the presence of aged, dry wood in the structure might have contributed to the intensity of the flames.The ballpark has been a prominent location for various films, such as ""Eight Men Out"" and ""The Babe Ruth Story,"" in addition to ""A League of Their Own,"" which starred Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Lori Petty. The 1992 movie told the story of a women's professional baseball team in the 1940s.US Representative Norma J. Torres, who represents the area, emphasised the importance of the ballpark to the community, saying that families have made ""countless, cherished memories"" there since the 1930s.

The interview, which took place on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, has gone viral because of a moment where Trump compared choosing a partner to picking an item from a restaurant menu.Back in 2004, Trump, who was then famous for The Apprentice, sat down with Conan O'Brien for what started as a lighthearted chat.But things took an unexpected turn when O'Brien brought up a notable scene from the show.In the clip, Trump, known for his direct approach, asked contestant Clay Lee a blunt question: ""Are you a homosexual, Clay?"" The straightforwardness of the question caught everyone off guard.Lee answered with a simple ""yes,"" and Trump seemed accepting of the answer. However, Trump didn't stop there and went on to ask if Lee found any of the female contestants attractive.""They're beautiful women,"" Lee said, though he added that they weren't his ""thing.""Then came the moment that has sparked fresh debates online. In what seemed like an attempt at humor or to show his acceptance, Trump compared choosing a partner to picking a dish from a menu.""That's why they have menus in restaurants,"" Trump said with a casual shrug. ""I like steak, someone else likes spaghetti. That's why they have menus in restaurants. A great world.""The comment, a mix of awkwardness and indifference, has sparked a wide range of reactions online. Some see it as a clumsy but well-intentioned effort to be inclusive, while others view it as a dismissive oversimplification of a complex issue, likening it to choosing a meal.Trump has always had a complicated relationship with LGBTQ rights. While his stance has often been ambiguous, the comment in the interview has resurfaced at a time when the issue of LGBTQ rights remains a divisive topic in American politics. For the 2024 presidential election, the Republican Party's new platform notably removed language that previously supported opposition to same-sex marriage, signaling a shift in tone, but the party remains deeply divided on the issue.","An old interview featuring former US president Donald Trump has resurfaced, causing a stir on social media.

Code Red in US: Comrade Kamala v Traitor Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/code-red-in-us-comrade-kamala-v-traitor-trump/articleshow/112746487.cms,"WASHINGTON: Mocking her laugh didn't work because her supporters began to celebrate its hearty timbre while pointing out that he only sneers and jeers, never laughs. Denigrating her character for a relationship she had 30 years ago with a man 30 years older did not work either because she is happily married now and he is not exactly a paragon of virtue, with a wife who is seldom seen with him.Disparaging her as a drunk didn't work because it did not pass the smell test. So Donald Trump and his supporters have finally hit on a line of attack they think will work in a country still fearful of communism: characterising her as a communist and calling her Comrade Kamala .The hashtag #ComradeKamala , accompanied by colorful memes, trended often during the DNC in Chicago as Trump and his supporters ratcheted up attacks on Harris' purported leftist orientation, with the former President himself leading the way.At his rallies and on social media, Trump has begun to call her ""Comrade Kamala,"" inferring that she got her socialist views from her father Donald Harris, a "" Marxist Economist "" in his view. And in live, real-time rebuttals as she made her acceptance speech at the DNC, Trump doubled down on the Communist caper in a string of social media posts.“There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris , because she will take us into a Nuclear World War III ! She will never be respected by the Tyrants of the World!” he said, ever as Harris supporters taunted him about his love for communist North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un. “SAY GOODBYE TO THE U.S.A.! SHE IS A RADICAL MARXIST!” he wrote in his trademark all-caps another time, invoking the dark, dystopian view he has of America in a Democratic dispensation.""What they mean is that they want to get Elected, and then destroy our Country with Radical Left, Marxist/Socialist Policies. We can’t let this happen and, if it does, we won’t have a Country any longer. The U.S.A. will be reduced to ashes,"" he warned in another apocalyptic post.It is not clear if the tactic is working in a country where there is still some residual fear of communism although most communist countries have been cast into the dustbin of history. Even at the height of the Cold War, many Americans, most notably its Nobel laureate poet-singer Bob Dylan, parodied Washington's paranoia about domestic communists.""I got up in the mornin' 'n' looked under my bed/ Well, I wus lookin' everywhere for them gol-darned Reds/ Looked in the stove, behind the door/ Looked in the glove compartment of my car...Couldn't find 'em... I wus lookin' for them Reds everywhere/ I wus lookin' in the sink an' underneath the chair/ I looked way up my chimney hole/ I even looked deep inside my toilet bowl/ They got away..."" Dylan wrote in a song titled Talkin’ John Birch Paranoid Blues. John Birch Society was an American right-wing political advocacy group, named after spy who was killed in a confrontation with Chinese Communist soldiers.Dylan's idol Woody Guthrie was also an avowed socialist whose songs praised leftist ideals, including labor unions and worker rights, among the favorite talking points of vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz. “Walz said that socialism is just another word for neighborliness,” Trump told supporters in a recent rally, suggesting he's just toeing Kamala's ideology.Trump's treatise on Kamala and communism appears to have no takers outside his MAGA base. Even moderate Republicans scoff at the idea, particularly given his own cosiness with and admiration for communist dictators like Kim.""Donald Trump and his minions call Kamala a communist. I know communism. I fled communism from Nicaragua... let me tell you what communist dictators do...they attack the free press...they put their unqualified relatives in cushy government jobs so they can get rich... they refuse to accept legitimate elections when they lose and call for violence to stay in power. Do any of those things sound familiar? Is there anybody running for president who reminds you of that?"" Ana Navarro, a moderate Republican anti-Trumper said this week.","The hashtag #ComradeKamala trended often during the DNC in Chicago as Trump and his supporters ratcheted up attacks on Harris' purported leftist orientation.
