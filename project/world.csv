'Had to sign or face consequences': Venezuela’s opposition leader claims he was forced to admit defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/had-to-sign-or-face-consequences-venezuelas-opposition-leader-claims-he-was-forced-to-admit-defeat/articleshow/113474027.cms,"The Venezuelan opposition presidential candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia , on Wednesday, revealed that he was forced to sign a letter distributed by Venezuelan authorities, in which he supposedly admitted defeat to Nicolas Maduro in the election. The letter, which was addressed to Jorge Rodriguez, the national assembly leader, said ""I respect"" the CNE electoral council 's proclamation that Maduro has emerged victorious on the July 28 vote.The 75-year-old retired diplomat took to X from Madrid, where he was granted asylum after weeks of hiding in Venezuela and said that he was coerced into singing the letter in exchange for being allowed to leave.He disclosed that ""I had to either sign it or deal with the consequences,"" when, aides of Maduro brought him the letter at the Spanish embassy in Caracas.Urrutia further said that ""there were very tense hours of coercion, blackmail and pressure. At that point, I considered I could be of more use free than if I were imprisoned."" He emphasised that the letter was invalid due to the ""coercion"" involved.Shortly after the polls closed, the CNE proclaimed Maduro the winner with 52 percent of the votes. The opposition immediately disputed the results, and numerous countries refused to acknowledge Maduro's claim to a third six-year term unless the CNE released a comprehensive vote breakdown, which it has not done.The United States said that there was ""overwhelming evidence"" that Gonzalez Urrutia had won, and the opposition presented its own figures based on polling station-level counts, which it claims proves Gonzalez Urrutia's landslide victory.Gonzalez Urrutia asserted on Wednesday that ""as the president elected by millions and millions of Venezuelans who voted for change, democracy and peace, I will not be silenced."" He departed for Spain under the shadow of an arrest warrant, which was denounced by the international community, for ""serious crimes"" related to his insistence that Maduro had stolen the election.The charges against Gonzalez Urrutia stem from the opposition's publication of voting results, which the government claims only authorized institutions have the right to do. The CNE has stated that it cannot publish the voting records due to data corruption by hackers, although observers have noted that there is no evidence of such interference.Jose Vicente Haro, Gonzalez Urrutia's lawyer, told AFP on Wednesday that his client had been subjected to ""blackmail"" by the Maduro government. In a video call hours before his departure for Spain, Haro described seeing a man ""under a lot of pressure, in a situation of coercion, under a situation of urgency, with little chance of speaking."" He added, ""I saw a person broken psychologically, emotionally.""Gonzalez Urrutia replaced opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on the ballot at the last minute after she was barred from running by institutions loyal to the Maduro regime. She, too, has been mostly in hiding since the vote, except for appearing at a handful of organized demonstrations.Maduro has said that both Gonzalez Urrutia and Machado belong ""behind bars,"" holding them responsible for the deaths of 25 civilians and two soldiers in protests that erupted spontaneously after his alleged victory was announced. Nearly 200 people were injured, and more than 2,400 were arrested.Despite sanctions that were intensified after his 2018 reelection, which was also dismissed as a sham by dozens of countries, Maduro has managed to maintain his grip on power.","Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia says he was forced to sign a letter in which he supposedly admitted defeat to Nicolas Maduro in the election.

"Yale, Princeton and Duke are questioned over decline in Asian students",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/yale-princeton-and-duke-are-questioned-over-decline-in-asian-students/articleshow/113473858.cms,"The group that successfully sued Harvard to end affirmative action in university admissions last year is now threatening to investigate whether schools are complying with the new rules and to file lawsuits if it believes that they are not. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, has focused on three universities - Princeton , Yale and Duke - where there were notable declines in Asian American enrollment this year compared with last year, which the group said defied expectations.On Tuesday, Students for Fair Admissions sent letters to the schools questioning whether they were complying with rules laid out by the Supreme Court. Princeton, Duke and Yale also saw minor differences in black and Hispanic enrollment in the first class of students admitted since the court struck down race-conscious admissions.The group, a nonprofit that opposes race-based admissions and that represented Asian students in the lawsuit against Harvard, suggested that it was setting itself up as an enforcer of the new rules. ""Based on S.F.F.A.'s extensive experience, your racial numbers are not possible under true neutrality,"" the letters, signed by Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, said.It was one of the first shots across the bow at universities struggling to comply with the court's order while maintaining a diverse student body, and a sign that the fight over race-conscious admissions did not end with the SC's decision. The threatening letters also gave universities - which have been notoriously secretive about their admissions procedures - even more incentive to be opaque.OiYan Poon, a researcher of college admissions systems and the author of a book about the affirmative action debate, said Blum had jumped the gun with his letters. Admissions numbers fluctuate, she said, and one year is too soon to draw conclusions. Among the variables shaping the current numbers is the jump in the percentage of students who chose not to check the boxes for race and ethnicity on their applications. At Princeton, for instance, that number rose to 7.7% this year from just 1.8% last year. ""We've carefully adhered to the requirements set out by the SC,"" a spokesperson for Princeton, said. Yale and Duke did not comment.Asian American enrollment dropped to 29% from 35% at Duke; to 24% from 30% at Yale; and to 23.8% from 26% at Princeton. Black enrollment rose to 13% from 12% at Duke; stayed at 14% at Yale; and dropped to 8.9% from 9% at Princeton.In the court case, Harvard, supported by others like Yale, Princeton and Duke, argued that considering race as one of many factors in an application was the best way to achieve diversity in college classes. The SC ruled that giving preferences to students based on race violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. To comply with the court's decision, colleges did not allow their admissions officers to see the boxes where applicants checked off their race or ethnicity until after students had been admitted.","Students for Fair Admissions sent letters to the schools questioning whether they were complying with rules laid out by the Supreme Court.

Everyone was afraid that their phone, or the phone of a person standing next to them in the crowd, would also soon explode.One woman, Um Ibrahim , stopped a reporter in the middle of the confusion and begged to use the reporter's cellphone to call her children.

"Pannun files civil lawsuit in US against GOI, Doval and others, seeks damages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/pannun-files-civil-lawsuit-in-us-against-goi-doval-and-others-seeks-damages/articleshow/113468735.cms,"LONDON: The general counsel of pro-Khalistan Sikhs for Justice, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , has through his attorneys filed a civil lawsuit in a US federal district court against the Indian government , national security adviser Ajit Doval , and others, seeking damages for the alleged attempt to assassinate him on US soil last year.Pannun, a US-Canadian dual citizen of Indian origin designated by India as a terrorist, had evaded an attempt on his life after a murder plot was foiled in June 2023.The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in the district court for the southern district of New York, against the GOI, Doval, former R&AW chief Samant Goel, senior R&AW officer Vikram Yadav, and Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national incarcerated in a New York jail after being charged with murder for hire and murder-for-hire conspiracy for allegedly contracting hitmen to murder Pannun. The civil case is also against other “possible defendants whose identity is currently unknown”.Pannun is seeking financial compensation for assault (in the US this includes attempt to cause physical harm) and inflicting extreme emotional distress. He claims his life is still under threat.The lawsuit alleges that Yadav, directed by R&AW, recruited Gupta to hire hitmen to murder Pannun, and that the murder plot was approved by Goel and Doval. However, it was foiled as the hitmen were undercover US law enforcement agents. The complaint alleges that PM Modi knew about the murder plot but states that he is not named in the lawsuit as he has immunity as head of a foreign state.The Indian government has already set up a high-level inquiry committee to investigate the allegations.In the complaint Pannun says that it was not a “rogue operative” behind the plot and alleges that “India has been traced to over 20 recent international murders carried out by R&AW”. He refers to remarks PM Modi made in April when he said at a rally: “New India enters into enemy homes and kills them.” The complaint states that “Pannun faces a continued threat to his life from the GOI and its agents. The defendants should be required to compensate Pannun for the harm they caused and are continuing to cause.”“This lawsuit seeks to hold the GOI and a number of high-ranking officials there accountable under US tort law,” said Pannun’s counsel, Matthew Borden of Braun Hagey & Borden LLP. “We aim to hold everyone involved in this plot accountable.”“This is a civil claim for compensation to Pannun for the damages he has incurred,” Borden said. “The amount of damages we are going to seek will be proven at trial. It will be based on all the security he has had to engage,” he added, explaining the US court has jurisdiction of this case under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 1976The civil case is separate to the criminal proceedings Gupta is facing. “Under US law there is a lower standard of proof in civil cases and we are entitled to take discovery in a way that does not necessarily happen inside of criminal cases,” Borden explained. “This has a separate goal beyond punishing Gupta.”In the complaint Pannun alleges he is being targeted because he campaigns for the creation of Khalistan and is organising an unofficial Khalistan referendum.The complaint goes into great detail about the alleged plot to murder Pannun, claiming that Gupta promised to pay the undercover agents $100,000 to kill Pannun, and that he told the undercover agents there would be “more jobs once Pannun was assassinated”. It alleges Yadav told Gupta the murder could not happen during an upcoming trip to the US by high-ranking Indian officials. It claims that after Hardeep Singh Nijjar was assassinated on June 18, 2023 in Canada, Yadav sent Gupta a video clip of Nijjar’s body slumped in his truck. One hour later Yadav sent Gupta Pannun’s home address.",Gurpatwant Singh Pannun has filed a civil lawsuit in a US federal district court. He is seeking damages for the alleged attempt to assassinate him on US soil last year.

In March, Sean Diddy's Lon Angeles mansion was raided by the police. Various supplies meant for freak off sessions or orgies including drugs, 1,000 bottles of baby oil were seized during the raid. In an earlier lawsuit, Diddy's girlfriend Casandra Ventural said Diddy used his position of power to coerce her into a romantic and sexual relationship. She said Diddy used to regularly beat and kick her, leaving her with black eyes, bruises. This lawsuit was filed in 2023. Many more women came forward and claimed the same about Diddy's Freak Off sessions where women are forced to do sex for days. Then there were allegations that minors were also involved in it. In May this year, a video showing how Diddy assaulted his girlfriend Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 got leaked. Diddy took responsibility and apologized. Diddy failed to appear at the hearings of the lawsuits against him and maintained innocence. As he was arrested, the federal authorities released the indictment explaining what those freak offs were. These ""freak offs"" were ""elaborate and produced sex performances"" and were highly organised parties, prosecutors said. Diddy's associates allegedly booked hotel suites, recruited sex workers and distributed drugs including cocaine, methamphetamine and oxycodone to coerce partygoers into sex and keep them ""obedient"". Diddy offered to post bail for a $50 million to be released from custody. He even offered to wear an ankle monitor and limit his travel to New York and Miami. After his bail was rejected on day one, he has come up with a new condition that no woman will enter his house.

After Sean Diddy's bail was rejected, the music mogul has now moved a fresh bail plea vowing that he would not have women visit his Florida mansion. He has not pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation for prostitution.

At least 9 people were killed and over 2,000 people, including hundreds of Hezbollah members, fighters and medical personnel, sustained serious injuries on Tuesday after thousands of pagers exploded across Lebanon .Two of the deceased were Hezbollah fighters, read an official statement.A Hezbollah official described the pager explosions as the ""biggest security breach"" the organisation had experienced in almost a year of conflict with Israel.""The enemy (Israel) stands behind this security incident that targeted the devices,"" the official said, without elaborating.The Israeli military , which has been engaged in an exchange of fire with Hezbollah since October, coinciding with the Gaza war , did not provide an immediate response to the incident.Hezbollah accused Israel of being responsible for the explosions that resulted in the deaths of eight individuals.The Iran-backed organization in a statement said, ""We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression,"" adding that Israel ""will certainly receive its just punishment for this sinful aggression"".Iran's ambassador to Beirut Mojtaba Amani also sustained injuries when a pager detonated, according to reports from state media. The ambassador's condition was described as stable and non-life-threatening.""Iranian ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani was injured in a pager explosion ,"" state television said, adding that he was ""conscious and in no danger"".According to Reuters, the explosives that detonated in Lebanon were the most recent models smuggled into the country by Hezbollah over the past few months.The new pagers had lithium batteries that apparently exploded.Lithium batteries, when overheated, can smoke, melt and even catch on fire. Rechargeable lithium batteries are used in consumer products ranging from cellphones and laptops to electric cars.Lithium battery fires can burn up to 590 C (1,100 F).Videos circulating online showed ambulances hurrying through Beirut's southern suburbs amidst widespread chaos.Photos and videos from Beirut's southern suburbs circulating on social media and in local media showed people lying on the pavement with wounds on their hands or near their pants pockets.Even 30 minutes after the initial explosions, residents reported ongoing detonations and observed groups of individuals gathered at building entrances, checking on acquaintances who might have been injured.Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA) reported ""an unprecedented security incident involving the enemy"", with multiple detonations of handheld pagers occurring across several regions.""Dozens of injuries have been reported,"" NNA added.In response to the devastating incident, the Lebanese Red Cross deployed a significant emergency response team including more than 50 ambulances and 300 emergency medical staff to assist in the evacuation of victims.The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between Lebanon and Israel.The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been clashing near-daily for more than 11 months against the backdrop of war between Israel and Hezbollah ally Hamas in Gaza.The clashes have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border.

But by then, OceanGate was suing Lochridge -- in response to which, he filed a countersuit.About 10 months after he filed the complaint, he decided to walk away. The case was closed and both lawsuits were dropped.""I gave them nothing, they gave me nothing,"" he said of OceanGate.Lochridge further claimed that he frequently clashed with the company's co-founder and felt the company was committed only to making money.""The whole idea behind the company was to make money,"" Lochridge said. ""There was very little in the way of science,"" he said.Lochridge was one of the most anticipated witnesses to appear before a commission. His testimony echoed that of other former employees on Monday, one of whom described OceanGate head Stockton Rush as volatile and difficult to work with.The Titan submersible disappeared on 18 June 2023, after losing communication with its support ship following its descent about 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.Onboard were Stockton Rush; Shahzada Dawood, a British-Pakistani businessman; Dawood’s 19-year-old son Suleman; British aviation tycoon and explorer Hamish Harding; and Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French maritime expert with extensive experience of the Titanic wreck site.Last month, Nargeolet’s family filed a lawsuit against OceanGate, accusing the company of misleading him about the submersible’s safety.

Hezbollah blames Israel for attacks; vows retaliation



US denies involvement

Thousands of modified pagers turned into instruments of destruction in a deadly attack against Hezbollah on Tuesday. Israeli operatives had embedded explosives in these pagers, which were originally intended for Hezbollah’s communication network. When the devices received a seemingly routine message, they detonated, causing the deaths of at least 11 people and injuring over 2,800 across Lebanon.The pagers, manufactured by Taiwan-based Gold Apollo , were initially intended for low-tech communication among Hezbollah fighters, who sought to avoid detection from advanced tracking systems.However, Israeli intelligence agents managed to insert explosive components into these devices at the production stage. The pagers were then distributed to Hezbollah under the guise of standard equipment.The operation centered on the strategic deployment of 5,000 Taiwan-made pagers, procured by Hezbollah months in advance. These devices, modified by Israel 's Mossad , were embedded with a small amount of explosives, Reuters reported quoting sources. The modification included a remote-trigger mechanism that was activated by a seemingly innocuous message received on the pagers.On Tuesday afternoon, the pagers received a coded message that appeared to be from Hezbollah's leadership. Instead of conveying instructions, the message triggered the hidden explosives within the devices. The simultaneous detonation resulted in widespread chaos and destruction, impacting not only Hezbollah members but also Iran’s envoy to Beirut.The explosives, concealed within the pagers, went undetected despite months of use. The precise details of the attack were revealed by a senior Lebanese security source who described the embedded explosives as difficult to detect with conventional scanning methods.In response to the attack, Hezbollah has vowed retaliation against Israel. The scale and effectiveness of the operation have been described as one of the most significant intelligence failures for Hezbollah in recent years. Jonathan Panikoff, a former US national intelligence officer on the Middle East, labeled it as “the biggest counterintelligence failure Hezbollah has faced in decades.”Following the attack, Hezbollah has promised retaliation against Israel, labeling the incident as “Israeli aggression.” Lebanese information minister Ziad Makary condemned the attacks, while a Hezbollah official stated, “Israel will receive its fair punishment” for the blasts.The group confirmed that among the casualties were its fighters and civilians.""This is not a security targeting of one, two or three people. This is a targeting of an entire nation,"" senior Hezbollah official Hussein Khalil said.The United States denied any involvement or prior knowledge of the explosions in Lebanon. During a press briefing, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that the US is currently collecting information about the incident but was unaware of it beforehand and played no role in it.""We are gathering information on this incident. I can assure you that the US was not involved and had no prior knowledge,"" Miller said.When pressed for details about the information being collected, he noted that the US is seeking facts similarly and reiterated the United States' commitment to seeking a diplomatic resolution.""We continue to collect information. I don't have any public readout. We are collecting information in the same way that journalists are across the world to gather the facts about what might have happened,"" he said.""Our overall policy remains consistent, which is we do want to see a diplomatic resolution to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. We want to see one that allows the tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes and tens of thousands of Lebanese who have been displaced from their homes to return home,"" Miller added.","Israeli operatives had embedded explosives in 5,000 Hezbollah pagers.

Jonathan , born in 1832, holds the title of the world’s oldest living land animal . As of 2024, Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise , is estimated to be 191 years old.Jonathan lives at the governor’s residence on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. He was brought to Saint Helena in 1882 and has since become a beloved figure there.Veterinarian Joe Hollins , who has cared for Jonathan and three other tortoises on Saint Helena since 2009, celebrates Jonathan's birthday each year on New Year’s Day.Although the governor of Saint Helena, Nigel Phillips, has unofficially assigned Jonathan a hatch date of December 4, 1832, Hollins prefers to celebrate on New Year’s Day, honoring Jonathan’s age rather than his exact birthdate. On his birthday, Jonathan typically spends his day slowly roaming in search of fresh clover and taking an afternoon nap, according to Hollins.Jonathan’s diet consists of various vegetation, including grasses, leaves, and fruits, which are essential for his health and longevity. His caretakers ensure he receives a balanced diet.Weighing approximately 200 kg and measuring about 1.2 meters in length, Jonathan remains in relatively good health despite his age. He spends his days basking in the sun, eating grass and leaves, and interacting with visitors. His remarkable longevity has made him a popular tourist attraction.Though Jonathan is blind and lacks a sense of smell, he still has excellent hearing.According to Hollins, Jonathan’s age could be even greater than recorded.Historical records show Jonathan grazing the governor’s mansion grounds between 1882 and 1886. A letter mentions that he was fully grown when he arrived from the Seychelles Islands in 1882, meaning he was at least 50 years old at that time. Hollins highlights Jonathan’s historical significance, noting that he was around 50 years old when the incandescent lightbulb was invented. During his lifetime, Jonathan has seen 31 governors come and go.Jonathan has exceeded the average life expectancy of 150 years for a land tortoise. As he has entered his 92nd year, Hollins remains hopeful that Jonathan will continue to greet visitors well into his third century.Hollins shares a deep affection for Jonathan, calling it a privilege to care for him. When Hollins first arrived, Jonathan had health issues, including cataracts and a deteriorating beak. Hollins introduced fresh fruits and vegetables into Jonathan’s diet, which significantly improved his health.Jonathan has become a major attraction on Saint Helena, drawing around 1,500 tourists annually. Due to high visitor interest, a tortoise corridor was introduced to allow tourists to view Jonathan without disturbing him.“He loves the chatter and interaction,” said Hollins, as quoted by The Washington Post, noting that Jonathan also enjoys the sounds from a nearby tennis court.“Whatever happens, I think we can be satisfied that we’ve done our best for him,” Hollins said, expressing his hope to be present for Jonathan’s 200th birthday celebration.","Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise, is estimated to be 191 years old.

Arkansas Republican governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders criticised vice president Kamala Harris on Tuesday night during a campaign event for former Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in Michigan. Sanders remarked that her children help keep her ""humble,"" while Harris ""doesn't have anything keeping her humble.""In her speech in Flint, Sanders shared a personal anecdote about her daughter, recounting how, while preparing for a father-daughter dance, her daughter told her, ""It's OK, Mommy, one day you can be pretty too,"" noting how her kids keep her grounded.Sanders contrasted this with Harris, asserting, ""Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn't have anything keeping her humble.""Sanders further criticized Harris's performance over the past four years, focusing on issues such as the southern border and inflation.Sanders said, ""The future of my kids and the future of our country depends so much on who our next president is.""Sarah Huckabee Sanders, inaugurated as the 47th governor of Arkansas on January 10, 2023, made history as the first woman to hold the office and is currently the youngest governor in the country.Prior to becoming governor, Sanders served as White House press secretary for former President Trump from 2017 to 2019. As a key advisor, she shaped the Trump's communications strategy, personnel decisions, and policy initiatives. Sanders was notable for being the third woman and the first mother to hold the position of White House press secretary.Her political career includes serving as a senior advisor on Trump’s 2016 campaign. She has also held leadership roles in various other campaigns, including those for Senators Tom Cotton and John Boozman, and her father, former governor Mike Huckabee. Sanders also worked in the Department of Education during President George W Bush’s administration.Since taking office, Sanders has introduced several significant conservative reforms. Her initiatives include the Arkansas LEARNS program, which overhauls the state’s education system with higher teacher pay and universal school choice. She has also implemented public safety reforms, tax cuts, and launched the Natural State Initiative to boost Arkansas’ outdoor economy. Additionally, Sanders has focused on streamlining state government operations.Raised in Pine Bluff and Texarkana, Sanders is a graduate of Little Rock Central High and Ouachita Baptist University. She resides in Little Rock with her husband, Bryan, their children Scarlett, Huck, and George, and their golden retriever, Traveler.Sanders has been featured in Fortune and TIME Magazine’s “40 under 40” lists.

Agranoff warned that such rhetoric might backfire as voters may prefer candidates who emphasize unity over division.","Sarah Huckabee Sanders criticised vice president Kamala Harris on Tuesday night during a campaign event for former Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in Michigan.

In one way, I sort of wish the call hadn’t been made because I do feel a little — He’s so nice.‘I’m so sorry about what happened and all that.’”Trump also recounted his call with Harris, stating, “Same with Kamala today. She could not have been nicer.” When Trump mentioned the “very nice call” he had with Harris, the crowd responded with boos. However, Trump countered, “No, it was very nice.”The former president was quickly evacuated from Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Sunday after a Secret Service agent discovered a gunman hiding in the bushes. The gunman, Ryan Wesley Routh , 58, was found with an AK-47-style rifle, a GoPro camera, and two backpacks. Routh fled but was later arrested on I-95. This marks the second assassination attempt on Trump since July. Routh has been charged with two gun-related crimes.Both Biden and Harris have condemned the incident and political violence in general.In an interview with Fox News Digital, Trump claimed that Routh was influenced by Biden and Harris' rhetoric, attributing the violence against him to their comments. Trump accused them of inciting attacks on him while he works to save the country.Democrats have accused Trump of escalating tensions and label him a ""threat to democracy,"" particularly due to his involvement in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. President Biden recently criticised Trump for inciting hate, referring to his comments about Haitian immigrants, while Trump contends that Biden and Harris' policies are weakening the US and diminishing its global respect.","The former president was evacuated from Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Sunday after a Secret Service agent discovered a gunman hiding in the bushes.

However, this endorsement contrasts sharply with the political ideologies of his employees who are supporting Trump's Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.Data from OpenSecrets , a nonpartisan organization tracking campaign contributions, reveals that employees at Tesla, SpaceX, and X have collectively donated significantly more to Harris than to Trump.At Tesla, workers have contributed $42,824 to Harris's campaign, compared to $24,840 for Trump. SpaceX employees have given $34,526 to Harris versus $7,652 to Trump. At X, donations stand at $13,213 for Harris and less than $500 for Trump.Despite these donations showing a clear difference from Musk's political views, the amounts are relatively small for overall presidential campaigns. Musk, who backed President Joe Biden in 2020, has since shifted his support to the right, endorsing Trump and criticising progressive policies.Musk’s public support for Trump includes promoting his candidacy on X and criticizing progressive ideas, which he has described as a ""woke-mind virus."" If Trump wins the election on November 5, Trump has promised to appoint Musk to lead a government efficiency commission.The data from OpenSecrets includes contributions from employees, company owners, and their immediate family members, as campaign finance laws prevent companies from directly donating to federal campaigns.

The move comes after the couple petitioned the Islamabad High Court to stay the proceedings and sought acquittal.The Al-Qadir Trust case centers on accusations that Khan and his wife caused a loss of over Rs 50 billion to the national exchequer.An anti-corruption court has been overseeing the trial, where so far, the statements of 35 witnesses have been recorded, leaving only the investigating officer to be cross-examined by the defense.A two-member bench headed by Chief Justice Amir Farooq heard the plea on Wednesday. Although the bench rejected the request to completely halt the legal proceedings, it granted relief by restraining the accountability court from issuing a final verdict.Khan and Bibi's lawyers argued that recent amendments in anti-corruption laws make the charges against the former prime minister and his wife invalid. They contended that the approval of the federal cabinet was involved in the matter, and the revised laws make it clear that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cannot investigate decisions made by the cabinet.""The case does not stand after the new amendments, and we seek acquittal for our clients,"" argued the defense.The court has issued notices to the involved parties, and the trial remains ongoing. The case stems from a March 2023 NAB probe into the Al-Qadir University Trust, alleging that Khan and his wife received large sums of money and real estate from Malik Riaz Hussain, a real estate magnate, in exchange for Rs 50 billion. The amount had been part of a settlement with the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) and later adjusted against a Supreme Court fine imposed on Hussain.","Former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, seek acquittal.

Shiva Kachi, a Hindu community leader from Hyderabad, said, ""We are getting information about such incidents nearly every week now from different parts of the province and no one seems to care.There is so much fear in the Hindu community now.""Kachi heads the Pakistan Darewar Ittehad , an organisation which is fighting for the recovery of Hindu girls kidnapped, allegedly forcibly converted to Islam and married off to Muslim men who are much older in many instances.In the recent days there have been two incidents in Khairpur and Mirpurkhas of two girls being abducted from their homes by armed men, he said.In the first instance, a 16-year-old girl was kidnapped from her home in Khairpur while a class 7th student was abducted from Digri town near Mirpurkhas.Kachi said in the first case, a Muslim youth claimed she eloped with him and married him after converting to Islam.He said the Pakistan government and provincial authorities needed to place safeguards to ensure the safety of the Hindu community.Ramesh Kumar, a social activist from Hyderabad city, claims once the girls are abducted, even the police don't cooperate and refuse to file FIRs on behalf of the affected families who are mostly uneducated and poor.""There is a nexus between some clerics, policemen and influential Muslims and the Hindu community suffers,"" he claimed.Hindus are not the only minority who claim they are discriminated against and face injustice.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.

We (police force) arrest militants and they (the military) call us to release them,"" another official at the sit-in told TOI.The army has a large presence in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, where it has been battling the Taliban and other outfits for nearly two decades.Police officials in Bajaur tribal district, bordering Afghanistan, have announced they wouldn't work even with anti-polio teams until the administration identified and arrested the killers of a colleague who was shot dead while escorting once such group in Bajaur this week.“There will be a complete boycott of polio duty,” a video circulating on social media showed a man standing among a group of uniformed personnel as saying.

Gunmen kill a policeman guarding polio workers in northwestern Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gunmen-kill-a-policeman-guarding-polio-workers-in-northwestern-pakistan/articleshow/113301216.cms,"PESHAWAR: A pair of gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on Thursday and killed a policeman guarding a group of polio workers going door-to-door in a vaccination campaign in northwestern Pakistan , police said, the second attack on the country's anti-polio campaign in as many days.The latest attack took place in Bannu, a district in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to police officer Nasrullah Khan.The policeman who was gunned down was standing on a street corner and the attackers fled the scene, Khan said.In a similar attack Wednesday in Bajur, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a group of gunmen on motorcycles killed two people, a polio worker and a police escort.No one has so far claimed responsibility for the two attacks, which have spread fears among the polio workers. Authorities on Monday launched a new, nationwide polio vaccination campaign amid stepped-up security to protect the polio workers.On Monday, a roadside bomb exploded near a vehicle carrying officers assigned to protect polio workers in the district of South Waziristan, also in the same province, wounding six officers and three civilians. The militant Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for Monday's attack.Anti-polio campaigns in Pakistan are regularly marred by violence. Militants target vaccination teams and police assigned to protect them, falsely claiming that the campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Since January, Pakistan has reported 17 new cases of polio, jeopardizing decades of efforts to eliminate polio in the country.The potentially fatal, paralyzing disease mostly strikes children under age 5 and typically spreads through contaminated water. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in which the spread of polio has never been stopped.","Gunmen on a motorcycle kill a policeman guarding a group of polio workers.

There has also been a 20-30% tariff increase on electricity and other energy products, hitting the common man hard.Pakistan's external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.The February general election produced Shehbaz Sharif-led shaky coalition government, which now has the challenging task of tackling deep-rooted structural problems to pull the $350-billion economy out of its misery.Since joining the multilateral lender in 1950, Pakistan has secured 24 IMF bailouts, the latest being subject to approval by the lender's executive board and the confirmation of necessary financing assurances from the country's development and bilateral partners.","Islamabad has been working on implementing conditions from the IMF to complete a $7 billion, 37-month loan programme agreed in July.

You should fight his legal battle on merit,"" Bilawal said.Bilawal also recalled the ""Charter of Democracy"" agreement between the PML-N and the PPP, suggesting that certain factions consistently oppose political consensus.
