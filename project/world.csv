King Charles III plans extensive tour covering 12 time zones post Cancer treatment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/king-charles-iii-plans-extensive-tour-covering-12-time-zones-post-cancer-treatment/articleshow/111741574.cms,"King Charles III is set to visit Australia and Samoa in October, an ambitious trip that will cover 12 time zones and challenge the monarch's endurance as he continues to recover from his recent cancer treatment . The palace announced the visit on Sunday, signaling a significant step for the 75-year-old king, who has been gradually resuming his public duties following a hiatus due to his cancer diagnosis in early February.Although the itinerary in Australia will be ""limited,"" the decision to undertake such an extensive trip points towards Charles' ongoing recovery. The visit to Australia will be a pivotal moment for the king as he seeks to bolster support for the monarchy both domestically and internationally, the Associated Press reported.This trip will be the first time Charles visits one of the 14 countries outside the United Kingdom where the British monarch remains head of state since his ascension to the throne. While this connection is a source of pride for some, it is an unwelcome reminder of Britain's colonial dominance for others.Despite the anticipated welcome from supporters waving flags and singing ""God Save the King,"" Charles is also likely to encounter anti-monarchy sentiments in a nation where 45% of voters supported the creation of an Australian republic in a 1999 referendum.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor Party advocates for abolishing the monarchy, although the government maintains that it is not a priority and has not set a timeline for another referendum.The palace has provided limited details about the tour, saying that Charles and Camilla will visit the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales, as well as making a more formal state visit to Samoa, where the king will attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.The capital territory is home to Canberra, Australia's national capital, while Sydney, Australia's largest city, is located in New South Wales. The annual heads of government meeting will take place from October 21-25.However, the trip will not include a visit to New Zealand, as the palace stated, ""The King's doctors have advised that a further extension to Their Majesties' trip should be avoided at this time, to prioritize His Majesty's continued recovery.""Isaac Jeffrey, national director and CEO of the Australian Republic Movement, called for a meeting with Charles and questioned the justification for Australia to fund the royal visit. He said, ""This visit is a great opportunity for all Australians to ask themselves whether the British Royals really represent a modern Aussie democracy.""The trip comes at a time when the health issues of Charles and Kate, the Princess of Wales, have underscored the challenges faced by a streamlined royal family as the king pledges to reduce costs. With fewer working royals available to carry out the endless round of public engagements that make up the life of a modern royal, the remaining family members have been required to take on more events.The Princess of Wales, one of the most popular royals, underwent abdominal surgery and later revealed that she, too, had cancer, while Prince William took time off to support his wife and their young family.",King Charles III is set to visit Australia and Samoa in October. The trip will be a pivotal moment for the king as he seeks to bolster support for the monarchy. It will be the first time Charles visits one of the 14 countries outside the United Kingdom where the British monarch remains head of state.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111741572,imgsize-868539,width-400,resizemode-4/111741572.jpg"
China's Communist Party will signal its approach to the country's challenges at a meeting this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-communist-party-will-signal-its-approach-to-the-countrys-challenges-at-a-meeting-this-week/articleshow/111741293.cms,"BEIJING: China's ruling Communist Party is starting a four-day meeting Monday that is expected to lay out a strategy for self-sufficient economic growth in an era of heightened national security concerns and restrictions on access to American technology While the meeting typically focuses on such long-term issues, business owners and investors will also be watching to see if the party announces any immediate measures to try to counter a prolonged real estate downturn and persistent malaise that has suppressed China's post-Covid-19 recovery.""There's a lot of unclarity of policy direction in China,"" which is weighing on consumer and investor confidence, said Bert Hofman, the former World Bank country director for China and a professor at the National University of Singapore. ""This is a point in time where China needs to show its cards.""The outcome of the meeting will send a message to local government officials and others about the future direction of policy. The general expectation is that it will confirm a path laid out by Chinese leader Xi Jinping , though some hope for some fine-tuning to address concerns that increasing government control over business and society is stifling economic growth.What is the ""third plenum"" and why does it matter? The Communist Party's 205-member Central Committee is holding its third plenum, or the third plenary session of a five-year term that started in 2022. This year's meeting was expected to be held last year, but was delayed.Historically, this third meeting has emerged as one at which major economic and policy decisions have been set, though not every time. Analysts say the plenum often sets longer-term directions impacting the economy.1. In 1978, the meeting endorsed the ""reform and opening up"" of former leader Deng Xiaoping, the transformation from a planned economy to a more market-based economy that propelled China's growth in the ensuing decades.2. In 1993, it endorsed a ""socialist market economy"" that sealed the victory of reformers battling against conservatives warning about the dangers of economic liberalization.3. In 2013, in another endorsement of reform, it said that the market would become the decisive force in the allocation of resources.The last pronouncement, made a year after Xi became leader, didn't come to be. Within a couple of years, the party began backtracking before setting off in a new direction in 2017, Hofman said.What issues are at stake? Under Xi, the Communist Party has decided that the party needs to be at the center of efforts to take China to the next level of development. China is now the world's second largest economy, but with a population of 1.4 million people, it is also still a middle-income country.The government has reined in China's high-flying tech giants, such as Alibaba, the fintech and e-commerce giant. As the United States became more adversarial, Xi pushed Chinese companies and universities to try to develop the high-end semiconductors and other technology that is being blocked by U.S. restrictions on exports to China.Free-market advocates are concerned this government-led approach is discouraging the entrepreneurial spirit. Another worry is that the rising importance of national security will take a toll on economic growth. The government has investigated companies that transferred economic data overseas in what appears to be a widening definition of what constitutes a breach of the law.A major change in direction is not expected and would be momentous if it were to happen. Instead, the degree to which the meeting acknowledges concerns about the business environment and national security could signal whether there will be some policy adjustments.What policy shifts might happen? Further support for high-tech industries that are considered vital for national security and future growth is all but certain, along with related industrial policies.But the party faces demands on other fronts. Alexander Davey, an analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Germany, said they are watching how the government will balance two major prerogatives: economic growth and social equity.Local governments are heavily in debt, with multiple cities suspending transit services because they could not afford to keep running them. In February last year, the city of Shangqiu, home to more than 7 million people, temporarily shut down bus lines.""There may be a bit of a shift, does the central government issue more debt to local government so they can run their services?"" Davey said. The trade off will be between vast resources poured into science and tech development, areas deemed vital to national security, and social services.Investors will be on the lookout for indications that the government, having increased its control over the economy, will take any steps to create a more favorable environment for private companies.Then, there is the real estate market. In April, the government announced policies that signaled a shift in its approach by funding direct purchases of unsold homes.""A notable first-half shift in China's property stance,"" said Yifan Hu, chief investment officer for greater China at UBS bank, in a statement. ""This ongoing pressure underscores the need for additional easing, which we think will be forthcoming given the supportive policy tone.""",The outcome of the meeting will send a message to local government officials. The general expectation is that it will confirm a path laid out by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Analysts say the plenum often sets longer-term directions impacting the economy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111741322,imgsize-896631,width-400,resizemode-4/111741322.jpg"

Secret service had one job. Did it fail its duty?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secret-service-had-one-job-did-it-fail-its-duty/articleshow/111742189.cms,"The US Secret Service is trying to figure out how a gunman armed with an AR-style rifle was able to get close enough to shoot and injure former Prez Donald Trump at a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, a monumental failure of one of the agency’s core duties.The gunman, who was killed by Secret Service personnel, fired multiple shots at the stage from an “elevated position outside of the rally venue”, the agency said.An AP analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos, as well as satellite imagery, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the ex-prez was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows the body of a man wearing gray camouflage lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of Butler Farm Show grou nds, where Trump’s rally was held.The roof was less than 150 metres from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 metres is a distance at which US army recruits must hit a human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M16 assault rifle in basic training. The ARstyle rifle used by the shooter is the semiautomatic civilian version of the military M16.The FBI on Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20. FBI special agent in charge Kevin Rojek said it was “surprising” that the gunman was able to fire at the stage before he was killed. The FBI said it will lead the probe into the shooting, working with the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement.Two witnesses at the rally clai med to have seen the shooter, with one saying he saw the gunman apparently scouting for a perfect perch to shoot at the former US prez. According to attendee Ben Macer, he “saw the guy move from roof to roof”, CBS News reported. Macer said he told an officer that the shooter was on the roof, approximately “200 to 250 yards” away from where Trump was addressing. “When I turned around to go back to where I was, it was when the gunshots started, and then it was just chaos”.Butler resident Ryan Knight, another witness along the fence line, also said he saw the suspected shooter atop the American Glass Research building, the CBS report said. “My main thought is why wasn’t the Secret Service on top of AGR? That’s a very big vantage point to shoot at the president. How did that get missed?” Knight asked.Calls for an investigation came from all sides. James Comer, a Republican who is the House Oversight Committee chairman, said he has called on Secret Service direc tor Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing. Some even called for Cheatle’s resignation. Rep Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called for investigating “security failures”. US secretary of homeland security Alejandro Mayorkas said his department and the Secret Service are working with law enforcement to probe the shooting. Maintaining the security of presidential candidates is one of the department’s “most vital priorities”, he said.The Secret Service, meanwhile, denied accusations by some Trump supporters that it had rejected campaign requests for additional security. “In fact, recently the Secret Service added protective resources and capabilities to the former president's security detail,” a spokesperson said.(With inputs from AP,PTI)","US Secret Service is trying to figure out how a gunman armed with an AR-style rifle was able to get close enough to shoot and injure former Prez Donald Trump.

"Who is Priscila Barbosa, Brazilian immigrant who made $10,000 a month defrauding rideshare apps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/priscila-barbosa-brazilian-immigrant-uber-and-instacart/articleshow/111666866.cms,"Early days in US

A scheme of epic proportions

A web of deceit: The scheme unfolds

Legal consequences: The fall

In the annals of American dream-chasing, few stories are as dramatic or cautionary as that of Priscila Barbosa . Barbosa’s story began in Sorocaba, Brazil, an industrial city where she grew up as the eldest daughter of a hardworking family. Her parents, an electrician and a postal worker, invested in her education, providing English lessons and ballet classes.She studied IT, taught computer skills, and even ran a successful healthy meal delivery service, Fit Express, until Brazil’s recession hit hard. Desperate to support her family, Barbosa accepted a suggestion from an acquaintance to move to the US on a tourist visa and drive for Uber and Lyft.According to a Wired report, Barbosa's journey to the United States began on April 24, 2018, at New York's JFK International Airport. Standing just outside customs with two suitcases filled with clothes and Brazilian bikinis, she found herself in a predicament when her US contact, who had promised to help her settle and drive for Uber and Lyft, disappeared. With only an iPhone, $117, and no return ticket, Barbosa was determined to make her American dream a reality.As per the Wired report, Barbosa’s journey would eventually lead her to the center of a massive fraud conspiracy involving rideshare and delivery services. Alongside fellow Brazilian national Guilherme da Silveira and 17 other co-defendants, Barbosa was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. They had orchestrated a scheme to create fraudulent driver accounts using stolen identities, which they then rented or sold to unqualified drivers.Using the dark web and other sources, they obtained over 2,000 identities, bypassing stringent background checks required by companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. They exploited referral bonus programs and used ""bots"" and GPS spoofing technology to maximize earnings. According to the indictment, Barbosa's role in creating and managing these accounts was integral to the scheme's success, which netted her over $791,000.Barbosa, with da Silveira, used the stolen identities to create fraudulent driver accounts. They edited driver’s license images to match the photos of the drivers renting or buying the accounts, circumventing facial recognition technology. They advertised these accounts on WhatsApp, targeting Brazilian nationals living in the US, and managed the accounts by collecting rental payments and troubleshooting issues.The scheme was elaborate and far-reaching. They exploited referral bonus programs, used “bots” and GPS spoofing to inflate earnings, and managed to siphon off hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Bomb-making materials were also found inside Crooks’ vehicle near the rally and at his home, according to two officials who were not authorised to speak publicly.An FBI official said Saturday that a motive had not yet been determined. Public court records in Pennsylvania show no past criminal cases.Investigators believe the weapon Crooks used was purchased by his father at least six months ago, the officials said. His father, Matthew Crooks, told CNN he was trying to figure out “what the hell is going on” but wouldn’t speak about his son until after he talked to law enforcement.Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter, but federal campaign finance reports also show that age of 17 he gave $15 to ActBlue, a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians, on Jan. 20, 2021, the day Prez Biden was sworn in to office. Both Republicans and Democrats will be looking for evidence of Crooks’ political affiliation as they seek to cast the rival party as representing extremism.Crooks appears to have graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School, which has about 1,400 students, and received a $500 “star award” that year from National Math and Science Initiative.

Theodore Roosevelt gave a speech with a bullet in his chest at a comeback event,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/theodore-roosevelt-gave-a-speech-with-a-bullet-in-his-chest-at-a-comeback-event/articleshow/111742312.cms,"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump is not the first former president to survive an assassination attempt while trying to reclaim his old office. More than a century ago, Theodore Roosevelt was shot just before he was scheduled to go onstage at a campaign event -- and went ahead to give his speech anyway with a bullet in his chest.Roosevelt's gritty response to the attack in 1912 proved to be the stuff of legends and helped cement his reputation for toughness.To that point in US history, three other presidents had been killed by assassins, including William McKinley, whose death elevated Roosevelt, then the vice president, to the presidency. But as of then, no current or former president had been shot without dying.Roosevelt, like Trump, was staging a comeback attempt, running again four years after moving out of the White House. Unlike Trump, Roosevelt had left office voluntarily, declining to run in 1908 after serving nearly two terms. Instead, he had helped elect his protégé, William Howard Taft. But within four years, the two had a falling out and Roosevelt decided to challenge Taft for the presidency.Although Taft beat him for the Republican nomination at the GOP convention, Roosevelt broke off from his old party to form the Progressive Party, also known as the Bull Moose Party , so that he could compete in the fall contest against Taft and Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic governor of New Jersey.On October 14, 1912, Roosevelt was in Milwaukee, coincidentally the same city where Trump is scheduled to be nominated this week. As Roosevelt left the Gilpatrick Hotel to head to a nighttime speaking event, a man named John Schrank approached and opened fire with a Colt revolver. Several men tackled Schrank, but Roosevelt stopped the crowd from killing him on the spot.Roosevelt, 53, was saved by a metal eyeglasses case and the fat text of his speech, 50 pages folded over so that it was 100 pages thick, in his pocket. But the bullet, even slowed down, still penetrated his chest and he found blood on his hand when he searched for and found a dime-sized wound. Allies wanted to take Roosevelt to the hospital, but he insisted on proceeding to the auditorium to deliver his address first. And thus followed one of the most extraordinary speeches in presidential campaign history.""I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot,"" Roosevelt told the astonished crowd as he got started. ""But it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose!""He apologized that as a result he might not be able to speak as long as normal -- and then proceeded to give a 90-minute stemwinder. Only at that point did he agree to be taken to the hospital. The bullet had been headed straight for his heart before stopping, lodged against a rib 4 inches from the sternum.Schrank was what is today called a lone wolf, an individual acting outside of any network. When Roosevelt, just shot, asked him why he had done it, Schrank had ""the dull-eyed, unmistakable expressionlessness of insanity,"" as Edmund Morris put it in the final volume of his famous three-book account of Roosevelt's life.Schrank told authorities that he had had visions of the slain McKinley calling for Roosevelt's death and he had thought that it was his responsibility to stop Roosevelt from breaking George Washington's tradition of serving no more than two terms, long before the 22nd Amendment formally put the limit in the Constitution.The attempt on his life ""captured the imagination of the country,"" H.W. Brands, a historian at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote in ""T.R.,"" another biography of the 26th president. But as impressive as Roosevelt's performance that day had been, it did not propel him to victory. He finished ahead of Taft but, having split the Republican vote, was defeated by Wilson. Unlike a later president, Roosevelt conceded defeat. ""Like all other good citizens,"" he told reporters, ""I accept the result with good humor and contentment.""","Theodore Roosevelt was shot in 1912 while trying to reclaim his old office.

The former first couple was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) soon after a district and sessions court on Saturday quashed their conviction in their un-Islamic marriage case.The court's short order also stated to release Khan and Bibi immediately unless they were wanted in other cases.The NAB, which filed a new Toshakhana case against the couple, on Sunday presented them before Judge Muhammad Ali Warraich of the accountability court.The judge conducted the hearing inside the Adiala Jail due to security reasons.NAB Deputy Director Mohsin Haroon, who led the team to arrest them, requested their physical remand and the court, after hearing the lawyers, agreed to grant an eight-day remand.The court then ordered to present the two on July 22.The remand period can be extended to a maximum of 40 days at the request of NAB if it is needed to probe the suspects.Khan, objecting to the absence of media, said at the beginning of the hearing: ""If the media is not allowed, I will walk out of the court.""The court subsequently ordered media representatives to be brought inside the jail, and the hearing commenced once they arrived.Khan, 71, then addressed the judge directly, asserting that his wife had no involvement in the Toshakhana case, The Express Tribune reported.""I have read the Quran four times in jail, and it places a great responsibility on judges,"" he stated. ""Bushra Bibi is only imprisoned to cause me distress.""Bibi, 49, was also re-arrested on Saturday in the new NAB reference as she was to be released from Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail.He accused higher authorities of targeting his wife due to his decisions and said: ""My wife is being targeted by the King because I removed him from the ISI position, and my wife did not support him.""He referred to the army chief Gen. Asim Munir without naming him.""Jail me, but leave my wife alone. Judge, you are answerable to Allah, not the ISI. Judge Bashir said a decision was made at gunpoint,"" Khan pleaded.""A former prime minister being told in the middle of the night that he has to appear for a brand new case in the morning,"" he remarked wryly.He harshly criticised the accountability watchdog and alleged that it was operating like robots, doing whatever they are paid to do.He added, ""In the previous case, the jewellery set, which was valued at Rs 18 million, was claimed to be worth Rs 3.25 billion.""""I am only speaking about my wife. Re-arresting her [Bushra Bibi] was a grave mistake,"" the cricketer-turned-politician said.The new Toshakhana case is based on the accusation that the couple during Khan's government purchased gifts from the state depository in violation of rules.This is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.Last week, the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the National Assembly and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.",Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi handed over to anti-corruption officials.

Tough road ahead for Imran Khan despite back-to-back judicial relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tough-road-ahead-for-imran-khan-despite-back-to-back-judicial-relief/articleshow/111729030.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Despite back-to-back judicial relief to beleaguered Imran Khan , his woes are far from over and Pakistan 's former prime minister remains in jail with his wife Bushra Bibi. A district and session court on Saturday overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case related to the violation of the mandatory waiting period for a Muslim woman between two marriages.The relief came a day after the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the national and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some kind of change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.The court in the Iddat case verdict stated that Khan and his wife should be released ""if not required to be detained in any other case"" and anticipating his release a large number of PTI supporters accompanied by key leaders reached the Adiala Jail Rawalpindi, where they have been kept, to welcome them.But the PTI feared counter-measures by the government and announced that Khan would be arrested in three cases related to May 9 violence. However, it emerged that he and his wife were taken into custody by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB ) in a fresh Toshakhana corruption case .Khan and his wife during his government allegedly obtained gifts from the gift repository at low prices and sold them at higher rates.It is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.The new case alleged that the couple got some precious watches and other gifts from the state depository by violating rules.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.Despite dozens of cases against him and several party leaders, he has kept up his rhetoric by attacking the senior Army leadership , and his supporters churning out half-baked stories against the establishment on social media.The Army this month after a key meeting termed the attack on social media as ""digital terrorism"", calling it ""unwarranted criticism by some quarters"".Army commanders stated that the onslaught of politically motivated digital terrorism, unleashed by conspirators, duly abetted by their foreign cohorts against state institutions is meant to induce despondency in the nation and sow discord through the peddling of blatant lies, fake news and propaganda.The forum affirmed that military leadership is cognizant of the full spectrum of the challenges and resolved to shoulder its constitutionally mandated responsibilities with the support of the resilient people of Pakistan.Khan on his side uses the presence of media on the occasion of hearing cases against him in the Adiala Jail to fire salvos at rivals, showing unflinching resolve to fight. He also reiterates not to spare his tormentors.His own X handle is active, apparently operated by someone on his behalf, charging his opponents from the Army and civilians with an unwavering commitment. The same attitude has been displayed by his party leaders who often compete with each other to breathe more fire than others.All this had added to his hardships despite getting relief from the courts regularly.In the latest arrest, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) is expected to produce Khan and his wife before an accountability judge to seek their physical remand. Under the law, NAB can detain a person for 40 days on remand for investigation.As courts operate within rules, it is not easy for his legal team to secure his release.The circuitous legal battle is getting more entangled due to the official opposition to his release from jail.Recently, political advisor to Prime Minister, Rana Sanaullah, reportedly stated that new cases would be lodged against Khan in the coming days. Talking to the reporters in Lahore on June 15, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stated that Khan's detention for the next five years was necessary to bring economic stability.""People come to us and tell us if Pakistan has to progress then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,"" he said.","A district and session court overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case.

This was the last case keeping Khan in prison but he will not walk free as the authorities immediately issued fresh orders for his arrest in three other cases.In a short order, additional sessions judge Afzal Majoka directed authorities to immediately release Khan and his wife if they are not wanted in any other case.After the decision Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said, “Mr Khan has been arrested in three more cases.” The three cases are linked to violence against the military and other state installations after his brief arrest in May 2023.“An anti-terrorism court in Lahore approved the request to arrest Imran Khan in the May 9 case,” the PTI statement read. The party warned that keeping Khan, 71, in jail after Saturday’s decision would lead to another political crisis.Just days before national polls on Feb 8 the couple were sentenced to seven years in jail in the “iddat” case after the court found them guilty of breaking Islamic law by failing to observe the required interval between Bibi’s divorce from her previous husband and her marriage to Khan. The verdict had coincided with his convictions and sentences in the Toshakhana (state treasure store) and cipher cases. His sentences in two alleged graft cases, however, were suspended, while his sentence in the cipher case, linked to leaking of state secrets, was overturned. Various courts have also freed him in several other cases linked to the events of May 9, 2023 when his first arrest had caused riots across the country, following which the state launched a crackdown against him and his party.Ahead of Khan’s acquittal in a fake marriage case , a pair of applications was filed by Khawar Fareed Maneka, Bushra’s previous husband. One application asked the court to carry out a medical checkup of his ex-wife to ascertain her menstrual cycle while the other called on religious scholars for consultation on further deliberation on the duration of “iddat”.Before ordering Khan and his wife’s release, judge Majoka dismissed both applications. “Both petitions seeking the formation of a medical board and consultations with religious scholars are hereby rejected,” the verdict stated.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023.

Judge Majoka announced the judgment in the afternoon after reserving the verdict earlier in the day, acquitting Khan, 71, and Bushra, 49.""If they are not wanted in any other case, then PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi should be released [from jail] immediately,"" the judge said after accepting their appeals. However, it was not immediately clear if Khan would be released, as this was the only case for which he was currently imprisoned following the suspension of his Toshakhana corruption case sentence and acquittal in the cipher case.Imran Khan, the cricketer-turned-politician, has been behind bars since August last year after being sentenced in the Toshakhana corruption case and subsequently convicted in other cases ahead of the February 8 elections.Maneka filed the case against the couple in November 2023, alleging that they married without observing the mandatory Iddat period. He sought to have the marriage declared null and void.Khan and Bibi married in 2018, the same year Khan won the general elections and became prime minister. Bibi, who was ostensibly Khan's spiritual guide, divorced her husband of 28 years, with whom she had five children, and developed a romantic relationship with Khan. She is Khan's third wife; during his cricketing career, Khan had a reputation as a playboy.PTI chief Gohar Khan welcomed the verdict, calling it a victory for the independent judiciary. ""All these cases were fake, and he will also get justice in all other cases,"" he said, demanding Imran Khan's immediate release as this was the last case in which he was convicted.This judgment follows a major legal victory for Khan's PTI party.

As a result, over 600,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan since the order was issued last year. Human rights organizations have cautioned that some of those sent back to Afghanistan may face persecution by the Taliban , who took power in 2021 and have implemented strict Islamic laws, denying girls access to higher education and excluding women and girls from many areas of public life.Malala, who grew up in Pakistan's Swat valley and had to relocate to the UK after being shot at the age of 15 for resisting the Pakistan Taliban's ban on girls' education, emphasized the importance of protecting girls and women, given the bleak future they face in Afghanistan. She expressed hope that Pakistan would reverse its policy, stating, ""I hope that Pakistan reverses its policy and that they protect girls and women especially because of the dark future that they would be witnessing in Afghanistan"".On her birthday, recognized by the UN as Malala Day, the activist addressed the challenges faced by Afghan girls, who have been banned from education for over three years. While finding the situation shocking, she admired the resilience of Afghan activists. The Malala Fund is advocating for the UN to formally expand its definition of crimes against humanity to include ""gender apartheid,"" a term used by the UN to describe the situation in Afghanistan.Malala criticised the recent talks between the UN and the Taliban in Doha, which took place without the presence of women. She called for a ""principled engagement"" with the Taliban and urged world leaders to realize that excluding women and girls from such discussions is doing the Taliban a favor.She specifically called out countries with feminist foreign policies, such as Canada and France, to condemn such conversations.Furthermore, Malala called for an urgent ceasefire in the ongoing war in Gaza, expressing concern over the bombing of schools in the region. She emphasized the importance of providing humanitarian support to innocent civilians and praised countries that have resumed funding for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, despite Israeli accusations of its workers being involved in Hamas's attack against Israel on October 7.","Malala Yousafzai has expressed deep concern over Pakistan's decision to deport undocumented Afghan refugees.

After the polls, they had joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party to claim a share of reserved seats as independents were not eligible for the extra seats. The electoral body, however, ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim the reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats.”The commission had decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) and the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries with 16 and five additional seats in the National Assembly.Friday’s verdict, however, nullified the Peshawar high court’s order wherein it had upheld the election regulator’s decision denying the reserved seats to the SIC. The top court also declared the ECP’s ruling to be ultra vires to the constitution, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.“It is declared that lack of denial of an election symbol does not in any way affect the right of a political party to participate in an election,” the court order said, adding that PTI was and is a political party.It further stated that the elected members of PTI could not be declared independents or candidates of the SIC and gave the PTI 15 days to submit its list of candidates entitled for reserved seats to the election commission.ECP, the order said, should then publish the list of reserved seats of the candidates on its website within seven days.“The seats allocated to the PTI after this stage will be considered as their seats. Once the PTI gets its seats in parliament, it will be eligible for the reserved seats,” said the ruling.PTI spokesman Raoof Hassan lauded the SC for “breaking the barriers of intimidation”. “This is only the beginning of a long haul till we reach the final destination when Imran Khan shall take over as the Pakistan PM,” he said.The governing coalition still has well over 200 members of the 336-member lower house of parliament but the judgment has effectively denied a two-third majority to them that they were hoping for. Khan’s party strength stood at 84 in the National Assembly before the decision and is expected to rise to over 100.Under Pakistan’s election rules, parties are allocated 70 reserved seats – 60 for women, 10 for non-Muslims – in proportion to the number of seats they win.

However, in March, the Peshawar high court (PHC) and the election commission rejected the council’s appeal in separate rulings, declaring it ineligible for the reserved seats, as per the Dawn.Although the allocation of 23 reserved seats does not impact PM Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government's parliamentary majority, it does strengthen the political position of Khan's supporters.

He refuted the Punjab Food Minister Bilal Yasin's claim and said that the strike had not been postponed until Ashura (July 17).He added, ""Neither the government nor the FBR has contacted us for talks or to reconsider the strike.""Iftikhar Ahmed Mattoo, chairman of PFMA's Punjab chapter, said, ""We don't wish to trouble the public during Muharram, which is why the industry continued to supply flour to the market until July 10 despite bearing a tax burden of millions of rupees.""Mattoo said that now it was not feasible for them to bear the burden of tax. So, ""extreme measures have to be taken"". He said that flour mills across the city joined their call to ensure the survival of the industry, Dawn reported.The strike reportedly halted wheat supply all across the nation, bringing the flour availability and that of its related products to a grinding halt.Aamir Abdullah, PFMA's chairman for Sindh, confirmed an indefinite strike until the government withdraws the tax measures, noting that the suspension of wheat supply has also affected the bran supply for livestock.","Flour dealers and owners of atta chakkis joined the protest, causing disturbances in the supply flow of flour.

Pakistan's begging business collects $42 billion annually: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-begging-business-collects-42-billion-annually-report/articleshow/111667723.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's economy is in a precarious state, prompting the government to seek financial assistance from other nations and international organizations. This has led to the term 'begging' becoming a significant part of the country's political discourse, with citizens lamenting the need to constantly seek foreign aid .Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged this issue two years ago, stating, ""Today, when we go to any friendly country or make a phone call, they think that we have come to beg for money.""While the government seeks financial help, begging has become an organized industry within Pakistan, with beggars operating in cities and towns and even being exported to other countries.The government has recently decided to block the passports of more than 2,000 beggars for seven years and also restrict the activities of agents who facilitate this overseas begging business . Pakistani beggars primarily operate in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq.A parliamentary probe revealed that a significant number of beggars arrested in foreign countries were of Pakistani origin, with many exploiting pilgrim visas to travel to holy sites. The Interior Ministry has offloaded 44,000 individuals in the past two and a half years, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called for increased screening before issuing passports.Within Pakistan, begging is a highly organized and competitive business, with an estimated 38 million beggars in the country. The average daily amount collected by beggars varies across cities, with Karachi having the highest at Rs 2,000. Annually, beggars extract $42 billion, which is more than 12% of Pakistan's GDP. Turf wars between beggars for lucrative spots are common, with some even resorting to violence.The government has struggled to abolish beggary, and police action against beggars has often been met with resistance. In 2011, hundreds of beggars clashed with police officials in Faisalabad, throwing stones and bricks at the police station. One beggar remarked, ""Since when has begging become a crime in Pakistan? We will stop begging the moment our government stops begging from the IMF and other foreign countries.""","Pakistan's economy is in a precarious state, prompting the government to seek financial assistance from other nations and international organizations.

The two buses carrying 54 passengers, including seven Indians, went missing in the Trishuli River in the landslides at the Simaltal area along the Narayanghat-Mugling road in Chitwan district on Friday.Three people swam to safety later.The first body from the buses has been recovered from 50 km away from the accident site. The deceased was identified as Rishi Pal Shahi from India, police said.The body was found half covered by sand in the Narayani River of Chitwan district, police said, adding that he was carrying an Indian ID.Other missing Indian nationals are earlier identified as Santosh Thakur, Surendra Sah, Adit Miyaan, Sunil, Shahnawaj Alam, and Ansari.There were 24 people including seven Indian nationals on board a bus heading towards Kathmandu from Birgunj and another bus heading to Gaur from Kathmandu was carrying 30 local people. The two buses fell into the river as the landslide accompanied by muddy water, triggered by heavy rain, swept them away.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) and Chitwan District Police Office spokesperson Bhesh Raj Rijal, the deceased Indian national was a passenger of the bus which was heading to Gaur from Kathmandu, MyRepublica news portal reported.Shahi was originally from the Rajmunuwa area of Bihar's Motihari city and used to live and work in Nepal, the report said, quoting his brother.Rescuers assisted by divers from Nepal's security forces on Saturday resumed the search for the missing persons.Earlier, it was reported that more than 60 people were on board the two buses.The Nepali Army , Nepal Police and armed police personnel along with deep divers are being mobilised to resume the search operation, according to the Nepal Police.The Armed Police Force (APF) deployed a water drone to find the missing buses in the Trishuli River, MyRepublica reported.DSP Shailendra Thapa, co-spokesperson of APF, said that a search operation has been resumed by using a sonar camera through pipeline inspection.More than 500 security personnel are involved in the search operations, according to the police official.The search operation was stopped on Friday evening as it was not possible to work during the night with high water current coupled with muddy water, the police official said.The search operation resumed at 8 am Saturday.""All possible locations will be searched and we will put all our best efforts into search and rescue,"" he said.Nepal is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year, The Kathmandu Post newspaper reported.Experts say extreme weather events-excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures-have become more frequent in Nepal.The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority estimates that 1.81 million people and 412,000 households will be affected by monsoon this year.","Two buses carrying 54 passengers, including seven Indians, went missing in the Trishuli River.

President Ram Chandra Paudel is expected to appoint Oli, 72, as the new Prime Minister of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist ( CPN-UML )-Nepali Congress (NC)coalition on Sunday.""However, the President is likely to administer the oath to the new Prime Minister and other members of the cabinet on Monday morning. A small cabinet is likely to be announced on Monday before the oath-taking ceremony starts,"" said sources close to the NC and UML.Amid political turmoil in the Himalayan nation, CPN-UML chairman Oli, 72, is set to become prime minister once again after incumbent Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' on Friday failed to win a trust vote in Parliament.Late on Friday night, Oli staked his claim to become the next Prime Minister with the backing of NC president Sher Bahadur Deuba and submitted the signature of 165 House of Representatives (HoR) members -- 77 from his party and 88 from the NC -- to form the government under Article 76-2 of the Constitution.Out of a total of 21 ministries, the Nepali Congress will get nine and the UML eight plus the post of Prime Minister, a source close to Oli said.""Key positions such as Home, Foreign, Finance and Energy will be divided between NC and UML. Nepali Congress is likely to get the portfolio of Home while the Finance will go to the UML,"" the source said.Earlier in the day on Saturday, CPN-UML held a high-level meeting to discuss the future course of action and finalise the names of ministers to be included in the new cabinet.However, in the beginning, there will be a small cabinet, which will be expanded later, according to senior leader of the party and Standing Committee member Rajan Bhattarai.Nepali Congress also held its Central Work Performance Committee meeting to discuss and finalise the ministerial list and the policy to be adopted by the party.""The meeting discussed the ongoing political developments and finalised the names to be included in the Oli-led cabinet,"" said former Deputy Prime Minister and senior NC leader Prakash Man Singh.Although Deuba and Oli have already held preliminary discussions regarding the modality of the new coalition and power-sharing, the matter will be finalised by Saturday night.During a crucial meeting last week, Deuba and Oli had agreed to share the post of Prime Minister by turns and that the CPN-UML chief would lead the government for the first 18 months.Besides CPN-Maoist, CPN-Unified Socialist and Rastriya Swotantra Party, which had voted in favour of Prachanda during the floor test, Rastriya Prajatantra Party and other smaller parties are likely to back the NC-UML coalition.Also, smaller parties such as Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP), JSP Nepal, Janamat Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party and Lokatantrik Samajwadi Party are likely to join the Oli-led coalition, according to party sources.Prachanda, 69, chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre (CPN-MC), faced the trust vote as CPN-UML withdrew support from his government last week after inking a power-sharing deal with the largest party in the House, the NC.Prachanda lost the vote of confidence as he received only 63 votes in the 275-member HoR with 194 votes against the motion. At least 138 votes are needed to win the vote of trust.Nepal is facing frequent political instability as the country has seen 14 governments in the past 16 years after the Republican system was introduced.Meanwhile, a leading newspaper in Nepal commented that it takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation.The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases, The Kathmandu Post wrote in an editorial this week.""What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best.""Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act,"" it added, apparently referring to the exit of Prachanda as the prime minister, just 18 months after he assumed office.","K P Sharma Oli, 72, is set to become Nepal's new Prime Minister.

Nepal leader Oli's party pledges 'neutral' foreign policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-leader-olis-party-pledges-neutral-foreign-policy/articleshow/111720322.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nepal under veteran communist leader K P Sharma Oli will follow a ""neutral"" foreign policy focused on securing national interests and territorial integrity , while not allowing anyone to use its territory to target any third country, according to Oli's party CPN (UML). However, Oli will likely press India to address outstanding issues like the border dispute and trade imbalance, a top party functionary told TOI.While the latest round of what has come to be known as Nepal's own Game of Thrones has again thrown up Oli as the head of govt, India may not necessarily be disquieted by the return of the ""pro-China"" functionary.For one, Oli will form a govt with support from India-leaning Nepali Congress (NC), the largest party in House of Representatives with 89 seats. NC and Oli's party, which has 78 seats, struck a power-sharing agreement that will see the three-time PM assuming office again for 21 months, followed by Congress' Sher Bahadur Deuba for the remaining period.Oli's previous term is remembered for the political row with India over Nepal's new map that claims territory in Uttarakhand. However, while India's ties with NC help hedge against unexpected developments in a political environment fraught with rent-seeking and individual interests, Oli himself worked as PM to ramp up economic ties with India, by launching largest hydropower project in the country with Indian PM Modi. Modi, too, visited Nepal twice with Oli as his counterpart.Not having good relations with India is not an option for Nepal, CPN (UML) head of foreign policy dept Rajan Bhattarai told TOI. ""We have multi-dimensional ties with India that has an important role to play in realising (Oli's) 'Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali' goal,"" he said, while ruling out any dramatic shift in Nepal's approach to India or China.According to Bhattarai, however, pending issues related to border, trade deficit, water and transit must be addressed. Nepal's position on dispute over Kalapani area, which is of strategic significance because of its location at India-China-Nepal tri-junction, will remain the same as he said that while Nepal is ready to listen to Indian side and have ""open-minded"" talks, it's important to heed ""historical facts"". Bhattarai reiterated Nepal's position that as per the 1816 Treaty of Sugauli, all territories east of the Kali river, including Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulekh, belong to Nepal.On the row over Nepal's decision to issue a new map showing disputed areas in Nepal, the official said that Oli govt's action was in response to India's new map, issued after reorganisation of J&K, that included Nepal's territory.","Nepal under veteran communist leader K P Sharma Oli will follow a ""neutral"" foreign policy focused on securing national interests and territorial integrity.

He died as he was being treated at a hospital.Deadly crashes are common in the Himalayan republic because of poorly constructed roads, badly maintained vehicles and reckless driving.Nearly 2,400 people lost their lives on Nepal's roads in the 12 months to April, according to government figures.Twelve people were killed and 24 injured in an accident in January when a bus heading to Kathmandu from Nepalgunj fell into a river.Road travel becomes deadlier during the annual monsoon season as rains trigger landslides and floods across the mountainous country.Monsoon rains across South Asia from June to September offer respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies, but also bring widespread death and destruction.The rainfall is hard to forecast and varies considerably, but scientists say climate change is making the monsoon stronger and more erratic.Floods, landslides and lightning strikes have killed 88 people across the country since the monsoon began in June, according to police figures.","Nepali rescue teams recover first body from around 50 people missing after landslide.
