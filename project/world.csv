'You're the naan that I want': How 'bad' TikToks boosted a curry house,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/youre-the-naan-that-i-want-how-bad-tiktoks-boosted-a-curry-house/articleshow/111009856.cms,"The tables were filling up at Urban Tandoor, a British curry house wholesome enough for a family meal and elegant enough for a low-key first date. Painted flowers twist up its entrance and lights adorn the colourful walls inside, a homage to Bristol 's artistic reputation. The local haunt in southwest England promises an array of crowd-pleasers, from jalfrezi to moilee. But it wasn't only the food that had brought diners to Urban Tandoor on a recent evening. ""Their TikToks ,"" said Jake Smith, 22, who was celebrating his birthday. ""I think they're hilarious.""Staff members at this local institution have charmed an audience online with their versions of pop songs, anthems and trends. By most judges of talent, the covers are, well, bad. @urbantandoorbristol There is ""Bhaji Girl"", in which two employees wear blond wigs a la Barbie and Ken and sing about chutney. There's a ""Grease""-inspired ""You're the Naan That I Want"", featuring the group in leather and lipstick. In ""Mr. Riceside,"" the popular Killers anthem becomes a tale of a diner whose eyes are bigger than his stomach. You might, kindly, describe the dancing as ""fervent.""The singing, reminiscent of a bevy of uncles at a karaoke night, is possibly worse. But production value is beside the point. And their ""so-bad-it's-good"" marketing campaign is working, said Sujith D'almeida, the restaurant's owner. Online commenters from as far away as Texas vow to visit Bristol one day to eat a meal at Urban Tandoor. D'Almeida said the restaurant had seen a noticeable boost in diners under the age of 30. ""There is no talent involved,"" he said. ""There is no practice. Somebody just puts on the wig. We just get on with it.""Grown men dancing in costumes may seem silly, but D'almeida is serious about his business, which he started in 2013 after a career in five-star hotels and on cruise ships. He enlisted Nonsensical Agency, a marketing company, in 2021 to help further the restaurant's reach on TikTok. But he also just wants Urban Tandoor to cheer people up. Some patrons have confided that the videos had entertained them through periods of ill health and depression, he said. ""Happiness is something that is lacking in the world at the moment. It is a sad place,"" he said. ""We just give them 60 seconds of enjoyment.""D'almeida said the videos had helped the restaurant stay afloat. Curry houses, which hold a special place in Britains's culinary landscape, have faced challenges in recent years, from labour shortages, changing palates and Covid lockdowns. ""We were very worried,"" D'almeida said. But he also said he never wanted Urban Tandoor to just focus on food. He wanted it to be a place of entertainment or escape. ""I wanted to share much more of the Indian culture. I wanted to blend Bristol with Bombay."" The TikToks, he said, had given a ""new dimension"" to their brand. ""It is matter of one song going viral,"" he said, ""and then we get clients from all around the world"".","Urban Tandoor in Bristol, England, has become a viral hit on TikTok.

43 US Congress members call on Biden admin to protect documented dreamers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/43-us-congress-members-call-on-biden-admin-to-protect-documented-dreamers/articleshow/111009857.cms,"A bipartisan group of 43 members of the US Congress have called upon the Biden administration to take administrative action to protect documented dreamers. Pending legislative change, this group in a detailed letter have suggested measures like deferred action and parole to protect over 2.5 lakh documented dreamers , of which more than a lakh are estimated to be children from Indian families.

Once children of parents on non-immigrant visas (such as those holding H-1B visas) turn 21, they can no longer continue with their H-4 visa, which is meant for dependents. On aging out (attaining the age of 21), these children who are referred to as documented dreamers have no option but to obtain an F-1 visa meant for international students, or self deport to India or another country. Over the past few years, immigration reform bills, which included lifting the country-caps for employment-linked green cards have not fructified.

The group is led by Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Deborah Ross, who had spearheaded the America's Children Bill. ""While we continue to pursue legislative solutions to permanently protect these individuals, we urge you to take administrative action to protect the thousands of children who may be forced to self-deport each year,"" the letter said. The measures suggested include use of deferred action on a case-by-case basis, for children of long-term visa holders who age-out; expanding eligibility for employment authorisation to child dependents of visa holders and those with approved 1-140 (green card) applications; and lastly create a process for aged-out children to seek parole on a case-by-case basis, if warranted for urgent humanitarian reasons or to advance a significant public benefit.

Russian President Vladimir Putin promised Friday to ""immediately"" order a ceasefire in Ukraine and begin negotiations if Kyiv started withdrawing troops from the four regions annexed by Moscow in 2022 and renounced plans to join Nato.

Putin's remarks came as Switzerland prepared to host scores of world heads of state - but not from Moscow - this weekend to try to map out first steps toward peace in Ukraine. They also coincided with a meeting of G7 nations in Italy and after the US and Ukraine this week signed a 10-year security agreement that Russian officials, including Putin, denounced as ""null and void"". Putin blasted the Switzerland conference as ""just another ploy to divert everyone's attention. He also denounced the freezing of Russian assets as ""theft"" and vowed it ""will not go unpunished.""

Francis brought his moral authority to bear on the G7 , invited by host Italy to address a special session on the perils and promises of AI. In doing so, he became the first pope to attend the G7. ""The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,"" he declared, warning of the risks of AI 's uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned. ""No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.""

Francis called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically. He himself has been a victim of AI when manipulated images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year.

The pope's appearance was the emotional highlight of theday. Italy PM Giorgia Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved Prez Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina's flamboyant prez Javier Milei.

US Supreme Court rejects ban on gun 'bump stocks',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-rejects-ban-on-gun-bump-stocks/articleshow/111009685.cms,"The US Supreme Court on Friday declared unlawful a federal ban on ""bump stock"" devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to fire rapidly like machine guns , rejecting yet another firearms restriction.The justices, in a 6-3 ruling authored by conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, upheld a lower court's decision siding with Michael Cargill, a gun shop owner and gun rights advocate from Texas, who challenged the ban by claiming that a US agency improperly interpreted a federal law banning machine guns as extending to bump stocks . The conservative justices were in the majority, with the liberal justices dissenting.The rule was imposed in 2019 by Trump's administration after the devices were used during a 2017 mass shooting that killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music festival. The policy was defended in court by Democratic Prez Biden's administration.""This case asks whether a bump stock - an accessory for a semiautomatic rifle that allows the shooter to rapidly reengage the trigger (and therefore achieve a high rate of fire) - converts the rifle into a 'machinegun'. We hold that it does not and therefore affirm the lower court's ruling,"" Thomas wrote.Federal officials have said the rule was needed to protect public safety in the US, a nation facing persistent firearms violence. Bump stocks use a semiautomatic's recoil to allow it to slide back and forth while ""bumping"" the shooter's trigger finger, resulting in rapid fire.Thomas wrote: ""We conclude that semiautomatic rifle equipped with a bump stock is not a 'machinegun' because it does not fire more than one shot 'by a single function of the trigger'.""In a dissent, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, ""Today, the court puts bump stocks back in civilian hands. To do so, it casts aside Congress's definition of 'machinegun' and seizes upon one that is inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory text and unsupported by context or purpose. When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck. A bump-stock-equipped semiautomatic rifle fires 'automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.' Because I, like Congress, call that a machinegun, I respectfully dissent."" Federal law prohibits the sale or possession of machine guns, punishable by up to 10 years' jail.The bump stocks case centered on how the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), a U.S. Justice Department agency, interpreted the National Firearms Act, which defined machine guns as weapons that can ""automatically"" fire more than one shot ""by a single function of the trigger.""After a gunman used weapons outfitted with bump stocks in the Las Vegas shooting spree that killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more, Trump's administration took action to prohibit the devices. In a reversal of the agency's previous stance, the ATF decided that bump stocks were covered by the National Firearms Act.The Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative minority, has taken an expansive view of gun rights, striking down gun restrictions in major cases in 2008, 2010 and in 2022. In that 2022 decision, struck down New York state's limits on carrying concealed handguns outside the home and set a tough new standard for determining the legality of gun regulations. Unlike those three cases, this challenge was not centered on the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.Conservative Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a concurring opinion on Friday: ""The horrible shooting spree in Las Vegas in 2017 did not change the statutory text or its meaning. That event demonstrated that a semiautomatic rifle with a bump stock can have the same lethal effect as a machinegun, and it thus strengthened the case for amending (existing law). But an event that highlights the need to amend a law does not itself change the law's meaning,"" Alito said.","The justices, in a 6-3 ruling, upheld a lower court's decision siding with Michael Cargill. The conservative justices were in the majority, with the liberal justices dissenting.

US sub pulls into Guantanamo Bay after Russian warships in Cuba,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-sub-pulls-into-guantanamo-bay-after-russian-warships-in-cuba/articleshow/111009682.cms,"Washington: A US navy submarine has arrived in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba, in a show of force as a fleet of Russian warships gather for planned military exercises in the Caribbean. US Southern Command said the USS Helena, a nuclear-powered fast attack submarine, pulled into the waters near the US base in Cuba on Thursday, just a day after a Russian frigate, a nuclear-powered submarine, an oil tanker and a rescue tug crossed into Havana Bay after drills in the Atlantic Ocean.

The stop is part of a ""routine port visit"" as the submarine travels through Southern Command's region, it said in a social media post. Other US ships also have been tracking and monitoring the Russian drills , which Pentagon officials say do not represent a threat to the US. ""We've seen them do these type of port calls before,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh

The exercises, however, come less than two weeks after Prez Biden authorised Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike inside Russia to protect Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. Russian Prez Putin then suggested his military could respond with ""asymmetrical steps"" elsewhere in the world. Singh said it wouldn't be a surprise to see more Russian activity around the US. The drills are in international waters, and US officials expect the Russian ships to remain in the region through the summer and possibly also stop in Venezuela, which is also a Russian ally.

Russian ships have occasionally docked in Havana since 2008, when a group of Russian vessels entered Cuban waters in what state media described as the first such visit in almost two decades.

Elon Musk's X demands repayment from former Australian employees over currency conversion error,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-x-demands-repayment-from-former-australian-employees-over-currency-conversion-error/articleshow/111011492.cms,"NEW DELHI: Elon Musk ’s social media company X, formerly known as Twitter, is demanding that former Australian employees repay overpayments ranging up to $70,000 plus interest, due to an error in currency conversion. The company has indicated potential legal action if the amounts are not repaid.According to a report by the Sydney Morning Herald, at least six ex-employees have received legal notices from X. These employees, who were made redundant more than 18 months ago, are being pursued for overpayments ranging from $1,500 to $70,000. The overpayments occurred because of a mistake in converting employee entitlements from US dollars to Australian dollars.X claimed that the overpayments were related to the company’s employee share scheme and were caused by a significant error in currency conversion. In some instances, former employees received up to 2.5 times the amount they were entitled to. The Herald cited an email from X’s Asia-Pacific human resources department that was sent to many of the affected employees. “It has come to our attention that you received a significant overpayment in error in January 2023,” the email said. “We would be grateful if you could arrange the repayments to us…at your earliest convenience.”The company also indicated that if the former employees did not repay the money, X reserves the right to commence proceedings to recover the overpayment “together with interest.” Despite these notices, none of the former staff have agreed to repay the money, as per the Sydney Morning Herald.The payments in question involve shares that were provided to employees when they joined the company. These shares were valued at $82 ($US54.20) each, reflecting the price at which Musk acquired the company in 2022. However, due to the currency conversion errors during the payout process, some employees received significantly higher amounts than they were due.In addition to pursuing the overpayments, X is reportedly attempting to recover company laptops from employees who were laid off over a year ago. Following Musk's takeover of Twitter, the company experienced large-scale layoffs, with up to 80% of its workforce, including many Australian employees, being made redundant. At its peak, Twitter Australia employed about 40 people, but this number dwindled significantly after Musk's acquisition.The layoffs in Australia involved a significant number of the company’s safety accounts and coincided with the reinstatement of over 6,100 previously banned accounts. This move has been part of broader controversies involving Musk’s X in Australia.In the past year, X faced a $600,000 fine from the eSafety Commissioner for failing to address questions regarding the prevention of child abuse material on its platform, which the company has yet to pay. The eSafety Commissioner also took X to Federal Court over its refusal to globally remove posts containing videos of the Wakeley church Sydney stabbing. Although X agreed to geo-block these posts in Australia, it refused to remove them elsewhere.Last week, the eSafety Commissioner dropped the court action but announced plans to contest X’s movement in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have the removal notice dismissed. In response, X characterized this as a win for “freedom of speech.”Musk’s X continues to grapple with multiple labor and workplace issues, including lawsuits alleging that the company failed to pay severance to thousands of workers dismissed after Musk’s $44 billion acquisition in 2022.","Elon Musk’s social media company X is demanding that former Australian employees repay overpayments ranging up to $70,000 plus interest.

She wrote: “Biden has served his country. He's done his bit. But the jig is up. The White House should hear this loud and clear. I'm not judging Biden for being old and slowly declining as almost all elderly people do. I'm judging Biden and his administration for continuing to pretend like nothing is wrong when we can see the opposite happening with our own eyes.” Criticising Trump as well, she further wrote: “Biden is not asking America to qualify him to a nice nursing home. He's asking Americans to give him access to the nuclear codes again. He's asking Americans to decide out of two incompetent men − one a liar and a fraud, the other incompetent and incoherent − who would be the least incompetent. If only neither was truly an option (it is, but you get my point).” On the other hand, Bill McKibben, argues in the Los Angeles Times that Biden’s age was not a hindrance: “…Biden was socialized in an era when government took on big causes, and you can see it reflected in his first-term commitment to rebuilding infrastructure on a grand scale, boosting a new sustainable energy economy with billions of dollars for solar panels and battery factories, dramatically increasing the number of people with healthcare, and standing up for gun control, voting rights and reproductive rights.” McKibben, one of the founders of Third Act, a community of Americans over sixty, argued giving Lyndon Johson’s example who didn’t run for the second time that Biden not running would be a “shame” because four more years of Biden would “restore confidence in an America that has so destructively turned on itself”. He wrote: “Age matters. My cohort agrees. Why did Biden believe he could do what he did in his first term? Because he’d seen it done. Let’s hope the politicians of the future are watching his successes closely.”

Donald Trump’s Gaffes



Trump vs Biden: Last Five Gaffes According to the gaffe tracker by Forbes tracking both Biden's and Trump's gaffes, the five previous ones included: Donald Trump’s Latest Gaffes May 11: Trump referred to President Jimmy Carter as Jimmy Connors before correcting himself. May 11: Trump congratulated Hannibal Lector, the cannibal from Thomas Harris' novels and movies May 11: Trump told a New Jersey audience that Frank Sinatra told him never to eat before you performed, but he had a hot dog and told Sinatra: “I’m not performing, I’m a politician.” However, Sinatra left for the Elysian Fields in 1998, long before Trump entered politics. May 9: Trump claimed his son Barron was 17 when he’s actually 18. March 6: Trump appeared to refer to himself as Barack Obama when he claimed: “Joe Biden won against Barack Hussein Obama, has anyone ever heard of him? Every swing state, Biden beat Obama but in every other state, he got killed.” Joe Biden’s Latest Gaffes June 14: Joe Biden saluted Angelo Meloni at the G7 Summit before wandering off. June 14: Joe Biden wandered off to talk to a parachutist before Meloni urged him to return to the group. June 10: Biden appeared frozen for 30 seconds as other guests, including Vice President Harris and others, were dancing alongside him. June 4: Biden mixed up Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping while discussing tariffs on Chinese products. May 14: Biden claimed inflation was 9% when he took the Presidency (it was actually 1.4% according to the Consumer Price Index). As things stand, Americans face a Hobson’s Choice between two candidates who are rather old, with questionable mental capacities. As the iconic TOI college strip, Dubyaman wondered all those years ago, is it too much power for the ostensible leader of the free world whose words hold so much sway in the so-called rules-based international order (RBIO)?





Post 9/11, Jug Suraiya, along with cartoonist Neelabh Banerjee, had created a cult cartoon strip titled Dubyaman (Dubya being the way Texans pronounced W) based loosely on US President George W Bush which imagined him as a Übermensch superhero but with the brain of a George W Bush who was prone to a few gaffes now and then. The idea of the TOI cartoon strip was that the POTUS ’ faculties were suspect and what that would mean for the world since the American president is the ostensible leader of the free world and the so-called Rules-Based International Order (RBIO) that it claims to oversee.It’s a question that has resurfaced with President Joe Biden whose recent interactions have led many to question if he lacks the mental faculties to be President. While Bush was famous for his gaffes, questions about Biden’s mental acuity have centred around his age: by the time he leaves office at the end of his tenure, he will be the oldest President to leave the White House at 81. The earlier record was held by Ronald Reagan who was 77 when he left the office. Biden was 78 when he took oath and entered the White House.During the G7 Summit in Italy, videos – many gleefully shared by Republicans including the RNC Research handle – showed Biden awkwardly saluting Italian PM Meloni. Another video shows Joe Biden and world leaders watching parachutists, but with an awkward moment where Biden appeared to lose track of the group and started wandering off to speak to a parachutist before being dragged back by Meloni.It's important to note that many of the clips that have gone viral on social media are extremely short-cut clips, often presented without any context and shared by those with Republican affiliations. However, reportage about the POTUS also suggests that there might be a grain of truth to the claims about his declining mental faculties.The conservative New York Post, known for its take-no-prisoners approach, labelled him Meander In Chief.It's important to note that many of the clips that have gone viral on social media are extremely short cut clips, often presented without any context and shared by those with MAGA affiliations. However, reportage about the POTUS also suggests that there might be a grain of truth to the claims about his declining mental faculties.A report in the WSJ titled Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping has numerous instances of Biden losing track of time, zoning out, reading from notes to make obvious points, and even forgetting his own policies. WSJ’s report claimed that the article was based on interviews with more than 45 people, with more Republicans than Democrats, saying that Biden “performed poorly”.In February, a one-on-one chat with House Speaker Mike Johnson, where he claimed a recent policy change on climate change was a “study”, making Johnson worry that the president’s memory about his own policy had “slipped”.Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said: “I used to meet with him when he was vice president. I’d go to his house. He’s not the same person.”Incidentally, the same report claimed that the White House kept close tabs on WSJ’s interviews with Democratic lawmakers, with some speaking to the Journal a second time to emphasise Biden’s strengths.Asked about talking to lawmakers who spoke about Biden’s decline, the White House was quoted saying: “We thought it was important that all perspectives be represented to correct false and politically motivated claims.”Some of Biden’s most famous gaffes during his presidency include telling a mendacious story about travelling 17,000 miles with Xi Jinping (a claim he has repeated numerous times despite being fact-checked), thinking he was vice president during the Covid-19 pandemic (Biden was VP in 2016) and even calling his Veep Kamala Harris President.According to a report in the right-leaning Daily Caller, Biden made 148 gaffes between January 1 to April 24, 2024, which was far higher than the number of gaffes made by Trump. He also tripped over his words at least 118 times during statements, speeches, or comments, forcing the White House to make corrections in official transcripts.The POTUS also misidentified leaders of other countries, such as France, Egypt, and Mexico, and also gave people wrong names and titles 20 times.Earlier this February, Biden took a physical test, but a cognitive test wasn’t part of it. The White House claimed that Biden didn’t need one and that he passes a “cognitive test every day” (as POTUS). Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House Secretary, told reporters that Biden’s doctors determined he didn’t need a cognitive test, but Biden's report mentioned nothing about it. His earlier reports, from November 2021 and February 2023, also didn’t have any references to tests on memory or cognition.When a Justice Department special counsel report stated that Biden was a “well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory,” the POTUS lashed out. He also took great umbrage to a report that claimed Biden didn’t remember his son Beau’s death, claiming: “I don’t need anyone to remind me when he passed away.”When asked about this, he said: “I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what I'm doing.""Biden has a ""mildly decreased range of motion"" due to arthritis, for which he has been prescribed more intense stretching.Biden currently takes medication for seasonal allergies, acid reflux, a blood thinner and a statin to keep his cholesterol in check.The President weighs 178 pounds and exercises five times a week.When Donald Trump posted his $200,000 bail, he claimed he weighed 215 pounds at 6’3”, which seemed a little hard to believe given that’s the average height and weight of an NFL quarterback. At his last physical in the White House, Trump was 30 pounds heavier.As The Washington Post notes: “And while the booking records of those co-defendants list each person’s height, weight, race and hair and eye color, it’s clear that many of the statistics were wrong. What’s not clear is where officials with the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office got them.”However, Trump appeared much thinner during Easter, with many wondering if he was on the weight-loss drug Ozempic. Trump is 78, while Biden is 81.Matthew Foster, a lecturer at American University, also noted that Biden’s gait can be rather stiff at times compared to Trump’s, stating “There are some noticeable differences in terms of physical abilities.”Foster added that Trump’s schedule is lighter and was quoted saying by AFP: “He's giving off the old, drunken uncle vibe at times when he is giving these speeches, and this might be a sign of age, that you become less able to control all of your impulses. And for somebody who's already so impulsive, this could go into unforeseen territory.""Meanwhile, presidential historian Timothy Naftali claimed that Trump projects more energy in public appearances, and it couldn’t be used to determine “who’s in better command of his facilities”.Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University, told Reuters that Trump’s speeches raise “more questions about his mental fitness,” and said: “People somehow focus on the mistakes Biden has made while totally ignoring the way in which Mr. Trump seems to be entirely unhinged from reality.""Americans appear more worried about Biden’s age compared to Trump’s. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 78% of respondents – including 71% of Democrats – said Biden was too old to work in government. 53% Trump was too old for government.Trump’s spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, with the levity one has come to expect from the Trump campaign, claimed Trump was “sharp as a tack with elite stamina.”While the Trump campaign has made it a point to share Biden’s gaffes, the former President is prone to a few embarrassing ones himself though with the former POTUS it’s hard to explain whether the former POTUS is being wilfully mendacious or making a mental mistake. For example, when he was POTUS, Trump wanted to speak to then PM Shinzo Abe in the middle of the day and someone had to explain that Japan was in a different time zone, and it was the middle of the night in Japan. Upon finding out that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was single, he reportedly wondered if he should set him up on a date.On the Jan 6 Insurrection, Trump appeared to confuse Nikki Haley with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as he claimed the former did not secure the Capitol. He also confuses world leaders, claiming that Viktor Orban, the Hungarian premier, was leader of Turkey. He has also often confused Joe Biden and his predecessor Barack Obama .","By the time his tenure ends, he will be the oldest President to leave the White House at 81. Joe Biden’s 148 gaffes have led many to question if he lacks the cognitive faculties to be President in his advancing age. As the iconic TOI college strip is stripped off, it is too much for the ostensible leader of the world to hold so much sway.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111000703,imgsize-130898,width-400,resizemode-4/111000703.jpg"

Several members of US Congress call on Biden administration to protect documented dreamers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/several-members-of-us-congress-call-on-the-biden-administration-to-protect-documented-dreamers/articleshow/110996627.cms,"1.

Clarify the applicability of potential grants of deferred action on a case-by-case basis, where discretion is warranted, for children of long-term visa holders who age out of status:

2. Expand eligibility for Employment Authorization to child dependents of visa holders, and to individuals with approved I-140 petitions:

3. Grant parole to children of long-term visa holders who age out:

MUMBAI: A bipartisan group of 43 members of the US Congress in a letter have called upon the Biden administration to take administrative action to protect documented dreamers .Pending legislative change, this group had suggested measures like deferred action and parole to protect over 2.5 lakh documented dreamers. In the context of the Indian diaspora, more than a lakh children are expected to age out before their parents obtain a green card, owing to the decades-long employment-linked green card backlog .Once children of parents on non-immigrant visas (such as those holding H-1B visas) turn 21, they can no longer continue with their H-4 visa, which is meant for dependents. On ageing out (attaining the age of 21) these children who are referred to as documented dreamers have no option but to obtain an F-1 visa meant for international students, which comes with its own challenges such as limited work opportunities while a student and higher fees. The only other alternative is to self deport to India or another country. Many of these children grew up in the US and have little or no connection with their home country.According to an earlier analysis by David J Bier, director of immigration studies at Cato Institute, as of March 2023, the employment-based green-card backlog from India (EB-2 and EB-3 skilled category) had reached 10.7 lakh, and nearly 1.34 lakh children were expected to age out before a green card was obtained. Indians dominate the backlog because green cards are not issued proportionally to the number of pending applicants in each country but rather limited arbitrarily at 7% per nation of birth – this in turn with children at risk of ageing out can split families apart.Over the past few years, immigration reform bills, which included lifting the country-caps for employment-linked green cards have not fructified. The bi-partisan group is led by Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Deborah Ross, who had spearheaded the America’s Children Act, to protect documented dreamers.“These young people grow up in the United States, complete their education in the American school system, and graduate with degrees from American institutions,” states the letter. “However, due to the long green-card backlog, families with approved immigrant petitions are often stuck waiting decades for permanent resident status.”The letter adds: “While we continue to pursue legislative solutions to permanently protect these individuals, such as the bipartisan and bicameral America’s Children Act of 2023, we urge you to take administrative action to protect the thousands of children who may be forced to self-deport each year.”Specifically, the lawmakers made three recommendations to help address the ongoing threats documented dreamers face.Deferred action is a discretionary determination to defer removal of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion. USCIS recently updated its policy manual to clarify that it would consider deferred action for individuals with approved Special Immigrant Juvenile Status petitions who cannot adjust status because a visa number is not available. USCIS should similarly clarify the applicability of deferred action to children of long-term visa holders on a case-by-case basis where discretion is warranted.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should authorize employment for additional categories of nonimmigrants, including child dependents, in any category for which the spouse of the primary visa holder is authorized to work, as well as nonimmigrants with an approved I-140 petition who are stuck in the green-card backlog. DHS should also expand eligibility for a compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Document (EAD) to include children who are aging out. According to USCIS, a compelling circumstances EAD is a “temporary stopgap measure intended to address particularly difficult situations, including those that may have otherwise forced individuals on the path to lawful permanent residence to abruptly stop working and leave the United States.” Currently, only principal applicants of certain employment-based petitions and their dependent spouses and children are eligible for a compelling circumstances EAD. We urge DHS to include children of long-term visa holders who are raised in America in any expansion of eligibility for compelling circumstances EADs.USCIS has authority to grant parole on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian or significant public benefit reasons. We urge USCIS to create a process to allow children of long-term visa holders who have aged out to seek parole on a case-by-case basis, if warranted for urgent humanitarian reasons or to advance a significant public benefit.Dip Patel, founder of ‘Improve the Dream’, an organization of documented dreamers posted on ‘X’: “The economic case is clear, the moral case is clear, and it’s common sense. With bipartisan support, this must be prioritized in any executive action consideration.”Times of India, in the past, has covered many case studies, showing the challenges and emotional turmoil faced by children who are about to age out. Improve the Dream has posted Hardik’ Mathur’s case. He was selected for the USA cricket under-19 team, but was unable to play due to a lack of social security number – needed to enable the US cricket board to pay him. He is currently a student at UC Irvine studying computer science and cybersecurity. As a child of a long-term visa holder, he is at a risk of aging out and being forced to leave.There are lakhs of children like Hardik, for whom the only ray of hope lies in legislative change or if not – administrative change as suggested in the letter.","43 members of the US Congress have called upon the Biden administration to take administrative action to protect documented dreamers.

""Pretending to be a female is the easiest way to get credibility,"" said Liu, an investigator with Taiwan's ministry of justice.Whether it's Chinese or Russian propaganda agencies, online scammers or AI chatbots , it pays to be female - proving that while technology may grow more and more sophisticated, the human brain remains surprisingly easy to hack thanks in part to age-old gender stereotypes that have migrated from the real world to the virtual. ""You want to inject some emotion and warmth and a very easy way to do that is to pick a woman's face and voice,"" said Sylvie Borau, an online researcher in Toulouse, France, whose work has found that internet users prefer ""female"" bots and see them as more human than ""male"" versions. People tend to see women as warmer, less threatening and more agreeable than men, Borau said. Men, meanwhile, are often perceived to be hostile. Because of this many people may be, consciously or unconsciously, more willing to engage with a fake account that poses as female.When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was searching for a new voice for the ChatGPT AI programme, he approached Scarlett Johansson, who said Altman told her that users would find her voice - which served as the eponymous voice assistant in the movie ""Her"" - ""comforting"". Johansson declined Altman's request and threatened to sue when the company went with what she called an ""eerily similar"" voice. OpenAI put the new voice on hold.Feminine profile pictures, particularly ones showing women with flawless skin, lush lips and wide eyes in revealing outfits, can be another online lure for many men. Female social media profiles receive on average more than three times the views compared to those of males, according to an analysis of over 40,000 profiles. Female profiles that claim to be younger get the most views, it found.A report from the UN suggested there's an even more obvious reason why so many fake accounts and chatbots are female: they were created by men. It said greater diversity in programming and AI development could lead to fewer sexist stereotypes embedded in their products.","Fake profiles that claimed to be women got more engagement, more eyeballs and more influence than supposedly male accounts.

US Supreme Court unanimously rejects bid to restrict abortion pill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-unanimously-rejects-bid-to-restrict-abortion-pill/articleshow/110978233.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a bid to restrict an abortion pill widely used in the United States to terminate pregnancies.The court, in a unanimous opinion, said the anti-abortion groups and physicians challenging the medication, mifepristone , lacked the legal standing to bring the case.Abortion rights are one of the key issues in the Nov polls and the administration of Democratic Prez Joe Biden had urged the court to maintain access to the drug, which was approved by FDA in 2000. His opponent Donald Trump leads a Republican Party broadly favouring blocks to abortion access.The mifepristone case was the first significant abortion case heard by the conservative-dominated Supreme Court since it overturned the previously long-held constitutional right to abortion two years ago. ""We recognise that many citizens, including the plaintiff doctors here, have sincere concerns about and objections to others using mifepristone and obtaining abortions,"" said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the 9-0 opinion. ""But citizens and doctors do not have standing to sue simply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities,"" Kavanaugh said.The conservative justice said the federal courts were ""the wrong forum for addressing the plaintiffs' concerns about FDA's actions"" and they could present their objections through regulatory procedures or through the ""political and electoral processes"". Abortion opponents have been seeking to restrict nationwide access to the pill, claiming it is unsafe and that anti-abortion doctors were being forced to violate their conscience by intervening on patients who suffered complications after using it.Medication abortion accounted for 63% of the abortions in the country last year, up from 53% in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute.Some 20 states have banned or restricted abortion since the SC in June 2022 overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion for half a century.

President Joe Biden faces first lawsuit: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/president-joe-biden-faces-first-lawsuit-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/110968028.cms,"Here's all you need to know about the lawsuit:

The lawsuit has been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES).

and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES). Filed against Biden administration's order that came into effect on June 5, it restricts the asylum processing to 2500 per day. The imposed limitations will remain in place until the daily encounter figures, averaged over seven days, reach or fall below 1,500. However, it remains uncertain when this threshold will be met; the last instance occurred in July 2020 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.

According to the advocates, the order is ""legally indistinguishable"" from an order passed by Trump administration. “By enacting an asylum ban that is legally indistinguishable from the Trump ban we successfully blocked, we were left with no choice but to file this lawsuit, attorney Lee Gelernt said.

Biden has employed the same legal provision utilized by the Trump administration for its asylum prohibition, which falls within Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This provision grants the president the authority to restrict entry for specific migrants if their arrival is judged to be ""detrimental"" to national interests.

White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández justified Biden's directive. Fernández said in a statement that it became essential after bipartisan negotiations were obstructed by congressional Republicans. These negotiations aimed to secure vital resources, statutory adjustments, and additional personnel for border management.

NEW DELHI: In a first, a lawsuit was filed against the US administration on Wednesday over an order issued by President Joe Biden last week limiting the asylum processing claims to 2,500 per day on the southern border.The advocates have argued that the order is similar to the one enacted during Trump administration . However, it was later blocked by the courts.The directive became effective on June 5, with officials from the Biden administration anticipating unprecedented deportation rates of 4,000 daily.","The lawsuit has been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.

"Indian-origin man shoots brother dead, injures mother",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-man-shoots-brother-dead-injures-mother/articleshow/110964002.cms,"NEW DELHI: An Indian-origin man has allegedly shot and killed his brother while also injuring his mother in New York, according to officials on Wednesday.

The incident occurred on Sunday in the Richmond Hill area of New York, where approximately 26 per cent of the population is of Indian or Caribbean origin, as stated by the official.

The suspect has been named as Karamjit Multani (33), while the deceased victim, his brother, was identified as Vipanpal (27). The injured mother (52), who was shot in the stomach, has not yet been named.

According to the police, after fatally shooting his brother, Karamjit Multani turned the gun on himself.

""Karamjit's body was found dead near a street corner with a gunshot wound to his head,"" the police said.

Bhupinder Multani, the father of the suspect, informed reporters that there were no issues within the family, and he could not find any reason that would have prompted his son to take such an extreme action.

Jaspreet Singh, the brother-in-law of both the suspect and the victim, described Karamjit as one of the ""nicest"" men who always enjoyed making jokes, according to media reports.

The New York City Police Department has stated that they have taken up the case and are currently conducting an investigation.

Clash between Pakistan judiciary & military establishment intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/clash-between-pakistan-judiciary-military-establishment-intensifies/articleshow/111007675.cms,"Islamabad: The clash between Pakistan’s superior judiciary and the powerful military establishment has intensified as judges have started questioning the conduct of serving army and Inter-Services Intelligence officers over their blatant interference in judicial matters.Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics such as secret surveillance, and even abduction and torture of their family members, to secure favourable outcomes in political cases related to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party and its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.Addressing an event in the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Friday, Lahore high court chief justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad claimed he has received complaints — many verbally — and letters regarding interference in judicial matters by “institutions” (a reference to the army and ISI).“But I have full faith that this interference of the (military) establishment in the judiciary will come to its end very soon,” he asserted.He said he was saying so not just because it was “part of my faith but also includes my experience”.“To get rid of the (military) establishment’s interference, we have to face it with bravery, courage, and without any fear, and with the belief that this interference, God-willing, will end soon,” the Lahore CJ said. “Temporary worries do come but you have to face them eye to eye and not be a target of any of their blackmailing. Do not be hesitant to make any kind of sacrifice,” he added.Justice Ahmad said Pakistan was currently “going through one of the longest periods of a civil government”, adding that the 2007 lawyers’ movement “closed the doors for martial law forever”.On Wednesday, the Lahore HC had summoned Punjab police chief Usman Anwar and other officials on a complaint from a presiding judge of an anti-terrorism court alleging harassment by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.On June 7, the HC registrar’s office had received a special report on district and sessions judge Muhammad Abbas wherein he had said that on May 25, the first day of his new charge, a message was conveyed to him that some ISI authority wanted to meet him in his chamber.Upon refusing to meet the said authority, Abbas alleged that ever since then he had been encountering various incidents, such as firing outside his court in Punjab’s Sargodha city and questioning of family members, among other things.Earlier, in March, six of the eight Islamabad HC judges had penned a startling letter to Supreme Court judges, regarding attempts by the ISI to pressure them through the abduction and torture of their relatives as well as secret surveillance inside their homes. Following the letter, judges from other HCs also acknowledged interference by spy agencies in judicial functions.It led the apex court to take suo motu notice of the matter, with high courts submitting their responses and recommendations as proceedings continued.","Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics.

Pakistan plans to borrow $23 billion in next fiscal year: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-plans-to-borrow-23-billion-in-next-fiscal-year-report/articleshow/110964344.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan plans to borrow at least $23 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, including a $12 billion bilateral debt rollover, to support its development initiatives and meet external financing needs, according to a media report on Thursday.This reliance on global financial institutions like the IMF will continue to shape the country's foreign and economic policies. The budget documents for fiscal year 2024-25 revealed that Pakistan would borrow a minimum of $23.2 billion, or Rs 5.9 trillion, excluding any loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as reported by The Express Tribune newspaper. The IMF loan will be used for balance of payments support.The government has incorporated $20 billion of the total $23 billion in budget documents. The rollover of $3 billion by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has not been included in the federal books as it is intended for balance of payments support. The details indicate that Pakistan will take $19 billion in loans to finance its budget and build foreign exchange reserves. This substantial amount will maintain the country's dependence on the IMF, World Bank, Saudi Arabia, China, the UAE, and the Islamic Development Bank, which are now imposing their terms due to Pakistan's ongoing reliance on them.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has announced receiving investment pledges of $15 billion from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, but these promises have not yet materialized into formal agreements. The government has once again budgeted $3.9 billion for foreign commercial loans in the new fiscal year, despite being unable to secure new debt from foreign commercial banks. In the current year, China rolled over $1 billion of commercial debt.There were expectations that international credit rating agencies would upgrade Pakistan's junk rating under the $3 billion IMF standby arrangement. However, political and economic vulnerabilities hindered any improvement in Pakistan's standing. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated on Tuesday that the rating agencies were awaiting approval of the new Extended Fund Facility from the IMF. If the ratings do not improve soon, the government's plan to raise $4.9 billion through Eurobond and foreign commercial loans may not materialize.The government has again included the rollover of $5 billion in cash deposits from Saudi Arabia, indicating that the country will be unable to return the money, of which $3 billion was taken in 2019 for just one year. However, Saudi Arabia has not agreed to extend the $1 billion oil facility to the next fiscal year, leading the government to exclude it from the projection of external loan receipts. Similarly, no new loan from Saudi Arabia for petrol imports has been included.China's $4 billion cash deposit has been added to the rollover queue once more, with $2 billion maturing next month. The UAE's financing has not been included in the federal borrowing plan as the funds are provided for balance of payments support and will be serviced by the central bank from its profits. Out of the $3 billion, $1 billion is maturing next month.The government has also estimated a new loan of $500 million from the Islamic Development Bank and $465 million from Naya Pakistan Certificates. Approximately $1.1 billion will be borrowed to finance the federal Public Sector Development Programme, according to the report.","Pakistan plans to borrow at least $23 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, including a $12 billion bilateral debt rollover.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has recently released its Economic Survey but all everyone cares about is the population of donkeys in the country -- the increase in the number, to be specific. The population has increased by 1.72%to reach 5.9 million during the fiscal year 2023-24. The data reveals that the number has been on a steady rise: 5.5 million in 2019-2020, 5.6 million in 2020-21, 5.7 million in 2021-22, and 5.8 million in 2022-23, while it jumped to 5.9 million in 2023-24.Livestock plays a crucial role in Pakistan's economy and hence the economic survey reveals the figures of all livestock populations including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, horses, donkeys and mules. In fact, the population of cattle has also increased by 2 million.""The focus of the present government is on breed improvement for enhanced productivity, establishing a nucleus herd, identifying breeds well adapted to various agro-ecological zones of Pakistan, and importing high-yielding exotic dairy, beef, mutton breeds, and genetic materials (semen, ova, embryos). By implementing these measures, the government aims to stimulate growth in the livestock sector, generate employment opportunities, and contribute to the country's overall economic growth and foodsecurity,"" the Economic Survey document said.Pakistan has the world's third-highest population of donkeys. Ethiopia and China rank first and second. Pakistan's donkey population is an international issue as China wants to import donkeys from Pakistan. China needs more donkeys to obtain gelatin from their skin for Chinese medicine manufacture. A report said China in 2022 expressed its interest in importing donkeys and dogs from Pakistan.Eying at an impetus to the donkey export, the Pakistan government set up a farm of over 3,000 acres in Okara district in its Punjab province which is used to rear donkeys of ""great breeds"", including American.

Pakistan has been in talks with the IMF for a loan estimated to range from $6 billion to $8 billion as it seeks to avert a default in the face of its economy growing the slowest among all countries of the region.Islamabad entered into a $6.5 billion three-year agreement with IMF in 2019. It received a final $3 billion under a standby arrangement last year, just before the agreement was to expire.The finance ministry and IMF were reportedly locked in last-minute talks as the global lender presented some more tough conditions last week to include in the budget.A ministry official said the IMF's key demands include a higher tax revenue target, withdrawal of subsidies, taxes on the agriculture sector, increased taxes and levies on the power, gas, and oil sectors, privatisation of sick govt organisations and units, and improved administration.Despite Pakistan's aggressive pursuit of economic diplomacy to improve trade and investment ties with other nations, finance ministerMuhammad Aurangzeb , who presented the budget in parliament, explicitly said there were no alternatives to IMF under the current circumstances.""As you all know, I have been in this role for about three to three and a half months,"" he said at a presser. ""But even when I was in the private sector, I was very loud and clear that we should go into the IMF programme because there is no plan B. If there were a plan B, the IMF would not be called the lender of last resort. There's a reason for that.""Even with depleted foreign reserves and an economic crisis, the govt allocated 2,100 billion rupees to defence in the federal budget, a 19% increase over the previous year. IMF hasn't demanded cuts in defence spending so far.A day earlier, the govt unveiled the Pakistan Economic Survey 2023-24, which showed that the economy failed to meet most of its targets set in the previous budget.The finance minister also addressed IMF's insistence on ending tax exemptions for a fresh loan.""There are no sacred cows. Everyone has to contribute to this economy. The country can only be run with taxes. This is a basic principle,"" he said.",Pakistan has been in talks with the IMF for a loan estimated to range from $6 billion to $8 billion.

The joint declaration, however, noted that Beijing would not push businesses to take unwarranted risks or make concessions to Pakistani companies. Instead, the statement said, Beijing would support businesses to invest in Pakistan in line with market and commercial principles.Observers, however, pointed out that obstacles still stand in the way of strengthening Beijing-Islamabad economic collaboration, primarily as a result of Pakistan’s misguided policies.Pakistan is currently experiencing a debt crisis and looking for new loans to pay off previous debt.The total debt that Pakistan owes just to power (electricity) plants established under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) stands at around $7.5 billion. Islamabad also owes nearly $2 billion in circular debt, or unpaid bills, to Chinese electricity producers.During Sharif’s visit, no public statement was issued on restructuring debt but experts believe the issue is crucial and cannot be ignored.Pakistan’s current foreign debt, media reports suggest, is close to $130 billion, and Chinese officials say around 13% of it is owed to China.During the visit, Sharif, along with Gen Munir, also held talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping for more than three hours, indicating that the security of its nationals in Pakistan is a key concern for Beijing. Five Chinese workers were killed in a suicide attack in Pakistan’s northwestern Bisham region in March. Pakistan had blamed Afghanistan-based terrorists for the attack. The ruling Afghan Taliban had rejected Pakistan’s claim, saying Islamabad was trying to sour Kabul’s relations with Beijing.In the joint statement, both sides urged Afghanistan to “firmly combat terrorism, including not allowing its territory to be used for terrorist acts”.","Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that his trip to China last week was successful.
