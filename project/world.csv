Police on Tuesday said that three people died and 15 others were injured in a knife attack on Monday at a supermarket in Shanghai.The injured were immediately rushed to a nearby hospital for medical treatment however, despite the efforts, three of the victims succumbed to their injuries, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.The police received a report of the attack and promptly detained the assailant, identified as a 37-year-old man surnamed Lin, Xinhua reported.Authorities are currently conducting an investigation into the incident.Earlier in September, a Japanese student, aged 10, was fatally stabbed by an attacker just meters away from his school in Shenzhen, a city in southern China.This incident, along with another knife attack on two Japanese nationals in Suzhou, a prominent city in eastern China, in June, has heightened security concerns among the Japanese community living in China.While stabbing incidents are not common in Shanghai, they are not unprecedented.In the year 2022, a man carried out a stabbing spree at a major hospital in the Chinese financial hub, injuring 15 people. The authorities said the man was ""resentful of society"" after an investment fell through, was sentenced to death a year later.In recent years, China has witnessed an increase in public stabbing incidents , with authorities frequently attributing the cause to mental illness. Children at schools are often targeted in these attacks.","Police say three people died and 15 others were injured in a knife attack on Monday at a supermarket in Shanghai.

North Carolina hardest hit

Deadliest storm in state since 1989

Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc across the southern United States, claiming over 130 lives. The true extent of the destruction became apparent on Monday, revealing a landscape of devastated homes, wrecked infrastructure, and inundated roads. The storm is considered one of the most severe in US history.The situation in western North Carolina is particularly dire.Residents have been isolated due to damaged roads and power outages, leaving them without communication or access to essential services. People are lined up for fresh water, and many are frantically trying to reach loved ones to inform them of their safety.The death toll currently stands at 133 across six Southeastern states, including North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. As emergency teams continue to access areas cut off by floodwaters and damaged infrastructure, the number is expected to increase.White House Homeland Security Adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall disclosed that up to 600 people remain missing, with some feared dead. President Joe Biden plans to visit North Carolina on Wednesday to meet with officials and assess the most severely affected areas from the air. He has pledged that federal assistance will continue for as long as necessary.Aid delivery efforts to the hardest-hit regions have already begun, with supplies being transported by air and truck. InAsheville and nearby mountain communities, at least 40 people have perished. Rescue teams are still working to reach stranded residents, using mules to transport supplies to remote areas.Western North Carolina has been hit particularly hard. The remnants of Hurricane Helene collided with the Appalachian Mountains, triggering torrential rain and deadly floods. The impact was exacerbated by the fact that many areas were already saturated from previous rainfall. ""By the time Helene came into the Carolinas, we already had that rain on top of more rain"", said Christiaan Patterson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service .Asheville's water system has been severely damaged, forcing residents to collect creek water to flush toilets. Key routes into the city, including sections of Interstate 40, have been washed away or blocked by mudslides. The worst flooding in over a century has left communities isolated, with food and water supplies running low. Long queues were seen of people with any container they could find to collect water.Volunteers have mobilized to assist, and search and rescue teams continue to operate throughout the region. At least 50 hospital patients in Tennessee were airlifted to safety, and several people were rescued from their cars in Atlanta.Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina conducted an aerial survey of the Asheville region and subsequently held discussions with personnel involved in meal distribution. ""This has been an unprecedented storm that has hit western North Carolina,"" he said afterwards. ""It's requiring an unprecedented response.""Hurricane Helene made landfall in northern Florida as a Category 4 storm before sweeping through Georgia, the Carolinas, and Tennessee. In addition to the human toll, there has been widespread destruction of homes and infrastructure. The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) has set up shelters housing over 1,000 displaced people.More than 30 people have died in South Carolina, making this the deadliest storm to hit the state since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. In Florida, the Clearwater Marine Aquarium was inundated with several feet of water, forcing the relocation of animals, though all were reported safe.As the region continues to cope with Hurricane Helene's aftermath, a new threat has emerged. Tropical Storm Kirk has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to intensify into a powerful hurricane within the next 48 hours. While it currently poses no immediate threat to land, meteorologists are closely monitoring its development.","The death toll from Hurricane Helene stands at 133 across six Southeastern states.

Trump says he coordinated with Elon Musk to deploy Starlink in hurricane-hit areas; White House fires back: 'already happening',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-claims-he-coordinated-with-elon-musk-for-starlink-deployment-in-hurricane-hit-regions-white-house-fires-back-already-happening/articleshow/113832977.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump claimed he had personally coordinated with billionaire Elon Musk to deploy Starlink satellite systems in North Carolina impacted by hurricane Helene , suggesting the Biden administration and state officials were slow to act. However, the White House swiftly countered, saying that the satellite systems were already in use and additional units were on the way.The White House announced that dozens of Starlink satellite systems were already operational in the state, with over 100 more en route to the hardest-hit areas.This federal coordination came into focus after former President Donald Trump, during remarks on Monday, claimed he had personally spoken to Elon Musk to arrange Starlink’s deployment in North Carolina.""I just spoke to Elon,"" Trump said. ""We want to get Starlink hooked up because they have no communication whatsoever and Elon will always come through. We are going to try and get the Starlink in there as soon as possible."" Trump added.He went on to allege that the Biden administration, alongside North Carolina’s Democratic governor, was intentionally delaying aid to Republican-dominated areas—a claim offered without evidence.In response, a White House spokesperson swiftly countered Trump's assertions, pointing out that the deployment had already been arranged. ""This is already happening,"" the spokesperson noted, sharing FEMA’s press release that detailed the ongoing efforts to utilise Starlink technology.The high-speed internet systems, powered by Elon Musk’s Starlink, are critical in re-establishing communication lines for emergency responders and affected communities. 40 Starlink systems are currently aiding relief operations, while an additional 140 are on their way to assist in restoring essential infrastructure, according to FEMA.Trump’s comments come amidst his ongoing campaign for re-election, where he faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming November election. Musk, who controls SpaceX and Starlink—one of the world's leading satellite broadband systems—has endorsed Trump in his bid for the White House.Helene's wrath has left a tragic trail, claiming more than 130 lives across six states. Western North Carolina has been among the hardest hit, with some areas completely severed from communication networks.The storm, which crashed into Florida’s Gulf Coast last Thursday night, left insurers and forecasters scrambling to assess the damage, with estimates ranging from $15 billion to over $100 billion.","Former US President Donald Trump claimed he had personally coordinated with billionaire Elon Musk to deploy Starlink satellite systems in North Carolina impacted by hurricane Helene.

Baghdad Airport: Rockets target US troops at Iraq's Baghdad airport amid rising tensions in middle east,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/rockets-target-us-troops-at-iraqs-baghdad-airport-amid-rising-tensions-in-middle-east/articleshow/113831386.cms,"Representative Image (Picture credit: Agencies)

Three rockets were launched at Baghdad International Airport in Iraq on Tuesday, targeting the Victory Base that houses US troops , according to AFP sources.The base's defence system intercepted two of the rockets, while the third landed near the Counter Terrorism Service Command headquarters. Despite the attack, no casualties were reported, and air traffic at the airport remained unaffected.The United States currently has approximately 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria as part of a coalition formed in 2014 to combat the Islamic State group.This coalition also includes forces from the UK, France, and other nations.The attack comes amidst heightened tensions in the Middle East, with the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza and Israeli strikes in Lebanon raising concerns about a potential regional war.Prior to this incident, there had been a period of relative calm. However, in August, a rocket attack on the Ain al-Assad base in western Iraq injured seven Americans, and in September, Washington accused Iran-aligned militias of attacking the US diplomatic compound in Baghdad.Iran-backed factions in Iraq have been demanding the withdrawal of US troops, and last Friday, Washington and Baghdad announced that the international coalition would end its military mission in Iraq within the next year, although the number of US forces that would remain was not specified.Since the outbreak of fighting in Gaza on October 7, militant groups have increasingly targeted US military bases in Iraq and Syria in protest of Washington's military support for Israel . In response, the US has conducted airstrikes on militia positions in both countries.","Three rockets were launched at Baghdad International Airport in Iraq on Tuesday, targeting the Victory Base that houses US troops.

"Helene disrupts presidential race as Trump, Harris address disaster",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/helene-disrupts-presidential-race-as-trump-harris-address-disaster/articleshow/113832848.cms,"Debris from buildings destroyed during Hurricane Helene in Horseshoe Beach. (Nicole Craine/The New York Times)

Hurricane Helene ’s trail of destruction across the US southeast presented Donald Trump and Kamala Harris with a crucial political test just five weeks before Election Day, altering campaign plans and dragging politics into the response to the powerful storm.Trump traveled to Georgia, one of the states hit hard by the hurricane and a key battleground that will determine November’s outcome, while Harris cut short a western campaign swing to return early to Washington for a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency.With more than 100 people dead and hundreds unaccounted for the natural disaster striking the US southeast — including two swing states — comes during an already razor-tight presidential election. Even as floodwaters recede, the region is gripped by power outages, mudslides and supply shortages.As of Monday morning, AccuWeather Inc. had estimated the total damage and economic loss from Helene may be as high as $160 billion — sharply up from forecasts last week — and losses which would make it one of the nation’s top five most costly storms ever.Monday saw both Trump and Harris seeking to signal that their attention was squarely focused on the storm and recovery efforts.Trump in Valdosta, Georgia, offered residents the help of one of his most prominent backers, Elon Musk, saying he had asked the billionaire to use his Starlink service to help restore communications.“We want to get Starlink hooked up, because they have no communication whatsoever,” Trump said about communities in the wake ofHelene ’s devastation. “Elon will always come through.”Starlink is SpaceX’s massive internet-from-space initiative, consisting of more than 6,000 satellites in orbit that beam broadband coverage to Earth.But Biden administration officials said they had already moved to use Starlink to connect communities, with Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall telling reporters during a briefing Monday that FEMA will install 30 Starlink receivers that day in North Carolina, another storm-ravaged state that is also a 2024 battleground.Harris for her part flew cross-country from Nevada. In Washington, she headed to FEMA headquarters. Harris said she had received regular briefings and spoken with both Governors Brian Kemp, a Republican from Georgia, and Roy Cooper, a Democrat from North Carolina.“We will do everything in our power to help communities respond and recover. And I’ve shared with them that I plan to be on the ground, as soon as possible,” Harris said, saying she did not want to disrupt recovery efforts.Citigroup economists led by Andrew Hollenhorst in a note to clients Monday said the storm, along with a potential strike from dockworkers at ports on the East and Gulf coasts, offers a “double disruption” that “may cloud underlying economic trends.”Continuing power outages and flooding threaten to lead to a drop in production and consumption. But since the hurricane struck at the end of a month and quarter, it is unclear the extent to which it will impact economic data as activity rebounds.Trump had castigated Harris and President Joe Biden over the weekend, faulting the sitting president for being at his Rehoboth Beach home in Delaware and his general-election opponent for continuing on a west coast campaign swing as the storm battered communities in states including Florida, Georgia and North Carolina.Biden, speaking from the White House, sought to assure the public the administration is marshaling the full resources of the federal government, saying they would be there “as long as it takes.”“I’ve directed my team to provide every, every available resource as fast as possible to your communities,” Biden said, noting that he has approved emergency declarations in seven states and disaster declarations in three of them.The president said he expected to seek supplemental funding from Congress, and could even request lawmakers return from their pre-election recess to Washington.Biden told reporters he would visit North Carolina on Wednesday. He also reacted angrily to criticism from Trump, including the former president’s claims that Kemp could not reach Biden, when in fact they had spoken the previous day.“He is lying,” Biden said. “It’s irresponsible.”The president also bristled at a question about criticisms of him spending the weekend in Delaware while the storm battered communities in the southeast.“Come on. Stop playing that game. It’s 90 miles from here,” Biden said. “If I sound frustrated, I am.”How presidents and candidates respond to such natural disasters can be pivotal in shaping voter perceptions of their effectiveness in office and their empathy. In 2012, then-President Barack Obama earned plaudits for his embrace of then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, after Hurricane Sandy battered the Northeastern seaboard shortly before that year’s election.Trump drew criticism in office over his administration’s handling of the response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated swathes of Puerto Rico. The then-president clashed with the island’s leaders. And when he visited San Juan after the storm, he famously threw rolls of paper towels into a crowd — a move critics cast as callous but which Trump has defended.Biden has long held a reputation as an empathetic president eager to comfort victims of disasters and visit impacted communities, but that image was undercut by the wildfires on the Hawaiian island of Maui in 2023 – with local residents faulting the response of state and federal officials.That criticism was fueled by the president telling reporters “no comment” when he was asked about deaths from the wildfires while on vacation in Delaware. Biden was again at his Rehoboth Beach home as Helene ravaged North Carolina over the weekend, but defended his efforts to coordinate a federal response.“I was commanding,” Biden said. “I was on the phone for at least two hours yesterday and the day before as well. I command; it’s called a telephone.”During her briefing at FEMA, Harris frowned when reporters asked questions about how the hurricane would impact her campaign and if the disaster was being politicized.",Hurricane Helene's trail of destruction presented Donald Trump and Kamala Harris with a crucial political test just five weeks before Election Day.

Feeling burnt out from the monotonous office routine? Struggling to find time for yourself, family, or friends? You're not alone. The pressures of work can drain us both mentally and physically. If you're seeking a solution, perhaps it's time to consider moving to a country with a healthier work-life balance .According to a survey by Remote , an HR platform, the work culture of 60 countries with the highest GDP was analysed.The survey focused on various factors such as annual leave, minimum statutory sick pay, paid maternity leave, minimum wage, healthcare systems, happiness index, weekly working hours, and LGBTQ+ inclusivity.Based on this evaluation, 10 countries emerged as leaders in work-life balance. From New Zealand to Canada , these countries offer the perfect blend of work and relaxation, allowing you to focus on your well-being. Let’s take a look at them:Brazil is synonymous with carnival culture and vibrant festivities, but it also offers a great work-life balance for its citizens. With generous sick leave, maternity pay, and a government-funded universal health care system, Brazilians enjoy a well-rounded lifestyle year-round.Known for its inclusivity, Canada ranks high for LGBTQ+ friendliness. Canadians benefit from a universal healthcare system, unlike their American neighbours. Cities like Toronto are popular among remote workers who enjoy the flexibility of a thriving city combined with personal freedom and a balanced life.With a renowned National Health Service (NHS), a decent minimum wage, and one of the most generous maternity leave systems in the world, the UK ranks among the top countries for work-life balance. Workers here average just 25.6 hours per week, the shortest working week of any country on the list.The Netherlands stands out for its high quality of life and generous maternity pay. Workers here enjoy a well-balanced lifestyle, making the country one of the best places for life-work balance globally.Although just missing the top five, Norway offers a generous annual leave, universal healthcare, and education. Long working hours are uncommon, leaving workers ample time to explore the natural beauty of Oslo and beyond.Ranking high on the happiness index, Denmark offers a favourable work-life balance. Workers benefit from high annual leave allowances, universal healthcare, full sick pay, and a high level of LGBTQ+ inclusivity. Denmark's progressive policies make it one of Europe’s most attractive countries for workers.With its sunny climate, friendly culture, and some of the world’s best beaches, Australia boasts a laid-back lifestyle. Its work-life balance is one of the best, and the country offers a high minimum wage, a top ranking on the happiness index, and universal healthcare, making it a popular destination for those seeking a better balance.Coming in at number three, France exemplifies a healthy work-life balance. The French culture encourages separating work from leisure, which doesn’t negatively impact the economy—France currently ranks seventh in GDP worldwide. The country’s approach to work and play has become a model for many.Known for the siesta, Spain excels at blending work and leisure. While the siesta may not be as common in corporate life, Spanish workers understand the importance of relaxation. With Madrid serving as a cultural hotspot, workers in Spain know how to enjoy life after work.Topping the list, New Zealand offers a remarkable work-life balance. Kiwis benefit from generous annual leave, a high minimum wage, and 26 weeks of paid maternity leave for new mothers, all of which contribute to an enviable lifestyle.","A survey by Remote analysed the work culture of 60 countries with the highest GDP.

Malcolm Gladwell , the best-selling author ofone of the most important non-fiction books of the 21st century, is back with its dark sequelWhile discussing the new book with the Guardian, Gladwell calls out what he calls Harvard’s admission officers’ “bias towards affluent white students”.Pointing out the disparity between Harvard and an institution with a merit-based admissions process like Caltech compared to Harvard, he writes: “My suspicion is that for many people it’s unconscious, but there must be a point at which [Harvard admissions tutors] are confronting the fact that they have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their campus hasn’t become dominated by Asians and Indians.”In the book, Gladwell notes that Caltech, a highly competitive university with a merit-based admissions system, saw the proportion of Asian American students rise from 25% to 43% between 1992 and 2013.In contrast, at Harvard, where the admissions process is influenced by factors such as legacy, donor contributions, and athletic scholarships, the percentage of Asian American students has remained consistently between 15-20% during the same period. Indian applicants are even more likely to be excluded by Harvard’s application process.Gladwell goes on to argue: ""Meritocracy is one of the most beautiful inventions of the 20th century – it is a foundation of a free society.""Here are 10 other key points aboutand Malcolm Gladwell:Malcolm Gladwell was initially reluctant to revisit his debut work but ultimately chose to create an entirely new version, one that reflects today's more anxious world rather than simply updating the original.The foundational idea that social trends behave like epidemics, initially growing slowly before suddenly taking off, still holds true. However, some of Gladwell's original examples have not aged well.Gladwell now finds his earlier chapter on crime ""embarrassing,"" as he once credited New York City's crime reduction to 'broken windows' policing. He has since acknowledged that this approach led to over-policing in minority neighbourhoods and wasn't actually responsible for the drop in crime rates.Gladwell values the process of learning from errors, a trait he respects in his father. He proposes that authors should periodically reassess their original works every 25 years to stay aligned with new insights.The new book is darker and more nuanced than the original. It delves into how a small number of individuals can disproportionately influence significant events, such as the opioid crisis, where a minority of doctors were responsible for nearly half of all prescriptions.While The Tipping Point became a cultural phenomenon, Gladwell’s latest book explores how individuals with substantial influence can shape societal changes, both positively and negatively.Gladwell reflects on how male leadership failures over the past eight years make a strong case for female leaders, particularly in the current political climate.Gladwell has expressed his support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, noting a personal connection through his mother, who shares Jamaican heritage with Harris's father.He argues that recent examples of male leadership failures have made it increasingly difficult to justify misogynistic attitudes and believes that America is ready for a female president.Now living with his partner and two young daughters, Gladwell views parenting as a journey of intellectual humility. He continuously adapts his understanding of his children as they grow and sees this phase of his life as a ""productivity mechanism"" that shapes his evolving perspective.","Malcolm Gladwell's new book, ""Revenge of the Tipping Point,"" is darker and more nuanced than the original.

Dozens Of Hezbollah Rockets Batter Israel As Nasrallah Revenge Fire Rages; IDF Confirms Impact

Ali Karaki

Mohammad Surour

Ibrahim Kobeissi

Who will succeed Nasrallah?



In a series of targeted strikes over the course of just over a week, Israel has significantly escalated its actions against Hezbollah, resulting in the deaths of seven top commanders, including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah .This escalation came after Hezbollah joined forces with Hamas in Gaza, following the latter's surprise attack on southern Israel.The loss of these key members, many of whom have been with Hezbollah since its inception in the early 1980s, presents a significant challenge for the organization, which is considered Lebanon's most influential military and political force.Among those killed were Nabil Kaouk, a veteran commander who joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and was seen as a potential successor to Nasrallah.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted a targeted airstrike on the headquarters of Hezbollah, resulting in the death of its leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah.With the death of Nasrallah, who had led Hezbollah for over three decades, the organization faces a significant leadership void. Nasrallah, born into a struggling Shiite family in 1960, pursued theological studies and became involved with the Amal movement before co-founding Hezbollah.The group formally declared its formation in 1985, releasing an ""open letter"" that named the US and the Soviet Union as Islam's main enemies and called for the ""obliteration"" of Israel.A day after the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Israel has killed another high-ranking Hezbollah commander, Nabil Kaouk, in an airstrike.Nabil Kaouk was a veteran of Hezbollah, having joined the organisation in the 1980s.The United States had imposed sanctions on him in 2020 for his involvement in Hezbollah’s military operations in southern Lebanon.Kaouk also served as Hezbollah’s military commander in south Lebanon from 1995 until 2010. He made several media appearances and gave speeches to supporters, including in funerals for killed Hezbollah militants. He had been seen as a potential successor to Nasrallah.Senior Hezbollah commander and head of the elite Radwan forces, Ibrahim Aqil was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut’s southern suburbs.Aqil was planning an assault on Israeli territory, with the goal of penetrating and attacking communities in the Galilee, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.The IDF added that his objectives were similar to those of Hamas during the October 7 attacks.In 2015, the US department of the treasury designated Aqil as a specially designated national due to his actions on behalf of Hezbollah. In 2019, he was further designated a ""specially designated global terrorist"" by the US state department. In the 1980s, Aqil was involved in major attacks, including the 1983 bombings of the US embassy and the US Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, which resulted in numerous casualties.Wehbe was a commander of the Radwan Forces and played a crucial role in developing the group since its formation almost two decades ago. He was killed alongside Akil in an airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs that struck and leveled a building.Karaki led Hezbollah's southern front, playing a key role in the ongoing conflict. The US described him as a significant figure in the militant group's leadership.Little is known about Karaki, who was killed alongside Nasrallah.Surour was the head of Hezbollah's drone unit, which was used for the first time in this current conflict with Israel.Under his leadership, Hezbollah launched exploding and reconnaissance drones deep into Israel, penetrating its defense systems which had mostly focused on the group's rockets and missiles.Top Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Mohammed Kobeissi died in an Israeli strike on South Beirut. Kobeissi led Hezbollah's missile unit.According to the IDF, Kobeissi planned the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli soldiers at the northern border in 2000, whose bodies were returned in a prisoner swap with Hezbollah four years later.There is no one nearly as in?uential and respected among the group’s remaining brass as Nasrallah. The man widely regarded as his heir is Hashem Safieddine , a cousin of Nasrallah who oversees the group’s political affairs.It is not known if he survived Friday’s attack, and the Hezbollah statement announcing Nasrallah’s death on Friday made no mention of a successor. The group’s Shura Council will have to meet in the coming days or weeks to choose its new leadership","Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader for over three decades, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Friday. Seven top commanders, including Nabil Kaouk, Ibrahim Aqil and Ahmad Wehbe, were also killed in the strike. The loss of these key members presents a significant challenge for the organization.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113798660,imgsize-991050,width-400,resizemode-4/113798660.jpg"

Projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) indicate that India is set to surpass Japan by 2025, making it the fourth-largest economy. Despite impressive economic growth, a significant gap persists between this expansion and the labour market, particularly among the youth, as highlighted by the latest data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS).Released by the Labour Bureau on September 23, 2024, the PLFS for July 2023 to June 2024 reveals ongoing challenges in the Indian labour market.Despite five years of decline, the overall unemployment rate has stagnated at 3.2% for 2023-24.Alarmingly, the youth unemployment rate is at 10.2%, with males at 9.8% and females facing a higher rate of 11%. This trend is particularly concerning for women, whose unemployment rate has increased from 2.9% to 3.2% over the past year.Topping the list, Lakshadweep has the highest unemployment rate for those aged 15 to 29, with an overall rate of 36.2%. Female unemployment in the union territory stands at a staggering 79.7%, compared to 26.2% for males.With an unemployment rate of 33.6%, this UT also has a significant gap between male (24%) and female (49.5%) unemployment.Despite having the highest literacy rate in India, Kerala faces an unemployment rate of 29.9%, with a particularly high female unemployment rate of 47.1%, compared to 19.3% for males.This northeastern state has an unemployment rate of 27.4%, with a more balanced distribution between males (27.9%) and females (26.6%).Manipur’s unemployment rate stands at 22.9%, with females facing higher unemployment (27.5%) compared to males (19.9%).The union territory of Ladakh has a total unemployment rate of 22.2%, with female unemployment reaching 38.3%, which is significantly higher than male unemployment at 11.4%.Arunachal Pradesh has an overall unemployment rate of 20.9%, with male unemployment at 21.9% and female unemployment at 19.6%. The relatively lower gap between male and female unemployment in this state shows a more balanced employment landscape. However, with a fifth of the youth population unemployed, the state still faces serious labour market challenges.Goa’s unemployment rate stands at 19.1%, with females experiencing much higher unemployment (31%) compared to males (13.2%). This sharp contrast in gender unemployment rates raises concerns about gender-specific barriers to employment in the state, despite its tourism-driven economy.Punjab faces an unemployment rate of 18.8%, with female unemployment at 24.5% and male unemployment at 16.7%. The state’s agricultural base and industrial growth have not translated into sufficient job opportunities for women, indicating the need for policies that foster more inclusive economic participation across genders.Andhra Pradesh rounds out the top 10 with an unemployment rate of 17.5%, featuring a female unemployment rate of 19.7% and a male unemployment rate of 16.4%. While the gap between genders is narrower here, the overall high rate of youth unemployment suggests a skills mismatch in the state’s labour market.","Despite impressive economic growth, a significant gap persists between this expansion and the labour market, particularly among the youth.

All Hail Meghan: Where did all start?

After a damning report cited Meghan Markle's former staff calling her a demon and dictator, a new report claims that Meghan Markle was kind enough to not expect a response to her mails that she used to send at 5 am. She let her staff know that she was not expecting a reply immediately, US Weekly reported citing five current and former employees who recounted their experience of working with the Royal.""My working day may not be your working day.

""[After] a big trip, every employee gets a personal email thanking them for their contribution in making it a success.”Former head of content at Archewell Ben Browning defended Meghan Markle and said that she encouraged a positive and supportive work environment. ""We all continue to be friends,"" he said adding that all suggestions of Meghan Markle being otherwise are false.One employee said they never heard Meghan Markle yell as she is solution-oriented and gives clear direction. “If you come for our bosses, you’re coming for us.

Baseball's all-time hit king and controversial figure Pete Rose dies at 83,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baseballs-all-time-hit-king-and-controversial-figure-pete-rose-dies-at-83/articleshow/113831927.cms,"(With AP inputs)

Legendary Major League Baseball player Pete Rose , who holds numerous records including the all-time hit record, passed away on Monday at the age of 83 in Las Vegas, as confirmed by his former team Cincinnati Reds .Rose was affectionately known as ""Charlie Hustle"" for his relentless work ethic and determination. Throughout his illustrious 24-season career, Rose amassed an impressive list of achievements, setting MLB records with 4,256 hits, 15,890 plate appearances, 3,562 games played, and 3,215 singles.His most iconic moment came on September 11, 1985, when he surpassed Ty Cobb's long-standing hit record with a single off San Diego pitcher Eric Snow in Cincinnati. Rose's versatility was unmatched, as he was selected to the All-Star team a record 17 times across five different positions.Rose's career was adorned with accolades, including three World Series titles (1975 and 1976 with the Reds, 1980 with the Phillies), three batting titles (1968, 1969, 1973), the 1973 National League MVP award, and the 1963 NL Rookie of the Year honor. After brief stints with the Montreal Expos and as a player-manager for the Reds, Rose's career took a dramatic turn in 1989 when allegations of his gambling on MLB games surfaced.Despite Rose's initial denials, an investigation led by attorney John Dowd, appointed by then-MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti, revealed evidence of Rose's betting activities during the 1985-1987 seasons, including bets placed on Reds games while he served as the team's manager. On August 24, 1989, Rose was permanently banned from MLB, a decision that has kept him out of the Baseball Hall of Fame due to the institution's policy of excluding players on the permanent ban list.In the years following his ban, Rose sought reinstatement multiple times without success. He eventually admitted to betting on Reds games in 2004, claiming he always bet on his team to win. However, in 2010, on the 25th anniversary of his record-breaking hit, Rose apologized to his former teammates for ""disrespecting baseball.""Despite his off-field controversies, including a five-month prison sentence for tax evasion in 1990-1991, Rose remained a prominent figure in the sports memorabilia circuit and even ventured into professional wrestling from 1998 to 2000. In 2016, the Reds honored Rose by retiring his jersey number, 14.","Pete Rose, who holds the all-time hit record, passed away on Monday at the age of 83.

We also discussed our Administration’s continued actions to support emergency response and recovery,"" Harris wrote in her post. She added that she had spoken with North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper about the state’s efforts to manage the crisis.But it wasn’t the recovery efforts that caught Trump’s eye—it was the apparent disconnect between the vice president’s earpiece and the phone in front of her.""Another FAKE and STAGED photo from someone who has no clue what she is doing,"" Trump tweeted. ""You have to plug the cord into the phone for it to work! Biden and Harris abandoned Americans in Afghanistan. They sacrificed Americans to an Open Border, and now, they have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South. Under this Administration, Americans always come last, because we have “leaders” who have no idea how to lead!""For Trump, the incident provided an opportunity not only to criticise Harris but to draw broader parallels between the hurricane response and what he sees as the administration’s broader failures, from foreign policy to border security.The human cost of the disaster is substantial, with over 100 lives lost and millions facing the daunting task of rebuilding in the aftermath of the storm. Power outages and destroyed infrastructure have left communities across North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and beyond struggling to recover.The Biden-Harris administration has highlighted its commitment to relief efforts, with over 3,300 federal personnel deployed to affected regions for search and rescue operations, power restoration, and more. Harris, whose campaign plans were disrupted by the disaster, cut her trip short to return to Washington and monitor the federal response.President Joe Biden announced that he had communicated with the governors of Georgia and North Carolina following the devastating impact of Hurricane Helene on their states and expressed his intention to visit the state later in the week, likely on Wednesday or Thursday. Furthermore, he indicated that he ""may have to request"" Congress to convene a special session to approve additional funding to support those affected by the hurricane's aftermath.","Former US President and Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump took to social media, accusing Vice President Kamala Harris of staging a photograph.

Former US President Donald Trump visited Valdosta , Georgia, on Monday to lend support to those affected by the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Helene , according to the New York Post. Trump expressed solidarity with the local community, saying, “We’re here to stand in complete solidarity with the people of Georgia and with all of those suffering in the terrible aftermath of Hurricane Helene.”The hurricane has claimed the lives of about 100 people, with severe impacts reported across multiple states, including Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia, and Alabama.The storm has caused widespread destruction, uprooting homes and resulting in flooding that has left around 600 individuals unaccounted for.Trump highlighted his commitment to aid those affected, saying, “We are going to be with you as long as you need. You’re in our prayers... but the end result is, it’s going to be good. We just wish so many people weren’t so badly hurt.” He announced that he had partnered with the relief organisation Samaritan’s Purse to deliver truckloads of essential supplies, including gasoline and construction tools.In a bid to restore communications in the devastated areas, Trump revealed that he had spoken with Elon Musk about utilising Starlink satellite internet. “I just spoke to Elon [Musk]. We want to get Starlink hooked up because they have no communication whatsoever,” he said.Trump also urged current President Joe Biden and vice [resident Kamala Harris to increase federal involvement in the relief efforts. “We do need some help from the federal government... that governor needs to, he’s been trying to get them,” he remarked, referring to the need for federal support in the recovery process.Earlier on the same day, Biden had addressed the hurricane, indicating his willingness to visit affected areas and assuring the public that FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell was on the ground in North Carolina.","Former US President Donald Trump visited Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday to lend support to those affected by the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Helene.

AI Safety Bill: California’s landmark AI safety bill blocked by governor amid tech industry backlash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/californias-ai-safety-bill-blocked-by-governor-amid-tech-industry-backlash/articleshow/113828813.cms,"California governor Gavin Newsom

California governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a landmark artificial intelligence (AI) safety bill, which had faced significant resistance from major tech companies , according to BBC News. The proposed legislation, which would have imposed some of the first AI regulations in the US, was blocked due to concerns it could stifle innovation and push developers out of the state.The bill, authored by senator Scott Wiener , sought to introduce strict safety testing for advanced AI systems and mandate a ""kill switch"" to disable potentially dangerous models. It also aimed to impose official oversight for the development of powerful ""Frontier Models.""In his veto statement, Newsom explained the legislation ""does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data,"" adding that the bill would impose strict regulations on even basic AI functions if implemented by large systems.Newsom announced plans to protect the public from the risks posed by AI, requesting input from leading experts to help shape future safeguards. In recent weeks, he has signed 17 other bills related to technology, including measures to combat misinformation and deepfakes created with generative AI.Senator Wiener criticised the decision, claiming the veto allows AI companies to continue developing ""extremely powerful technology"" without government oversight. He argued that without this regulation, AI firms will face ""no binding restrictions from US policymakers,"" especially given the lack of action from Congress.The bill had drawn opposition from tech giants such as OpenAI Google , and Meta , who warned it would hinder AI’s development. Wei Sun, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, called the restrictions premature, noting that regulating specific AI applications rather than the technology itself would be more beneficial in the long term.","California governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a landmark artificial intelligence (AI) safety bill.

The decision, delivered by Fulton County superior court judge Robert McBurney on Monday, overturns the 2022 ban, reinstating the previous limit of 22 weeks for terminations, according to CBS News .McBurney's ruling means Georgia can no longer enforce its controversial six-week ban , which took effect after the US Supreme Court 's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v.Wade, the landmark ruling that once safeguarded abortion rights in the US. This decision triggered a wave of abortion restrictions across the country. The ban, passed in 2019, prevented abortions once foetal cardiac activity was detected, typically around six weeks—often before many women know they are pregnant.In his order, McBurney acknowledged the state's interest in protecting ""unborn"" life but noted that a woman's rights must take precedence until the foetus can survive independently. ""The State's interest in protecting 'unborn' life is compelling, but until that life can be sustained by the State, the balance of rights favours the woman,"" he wrote.The judge further argued that women should have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies. ""For these women, the liberty of privacy means that they alone should choose whether they serve as human incubators for the five months leading up to viability,"" McBurney added. ""It is not for a legislator, a judge, or a Commander from 'The Handmaid's Tale' to tell these women what to do with their bodies.""Georgia’s abortion law, one of the strictest in the US, was enacted following the Supreme Court's decision to revoke federal protections for abortion rights.

US President Joe Biden has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt plans for a potential invasion of southern Lebanon following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah . At a press conference on Monday, Biden was questioned about Israel's intentions to launch a limited operation against Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel in retaliation for Nasrallah's death.“I’m more aware than you might know, and I’m comfortable with them stopping,” Biden said. ""We should have a cease-fire now,” he added, according to the New York Post . This comes amidst expectations that Netanyahu’s government will take military action to counter Hezbollah's threats following an airstrike that killed Nasrallah, who had led the group for over three decades.The airstrike caused major destruction in Beirut while Israel worked to weaken Hezbollah's military strength. Just weeks before, an Israeli operation had targeted communication systems used by Hezbollah commanders, resulting in numerous casualties.Biden's relationship with Netanyahu has been tense, facing criticism from both pro-Israel and anti-Israel groups. Despite his longstanding support for Israel, Biden has denounced Netanyahu over civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip and temporarily halted the shipment of some weapons.If Israel goes ahead with its military plans, it would be similar to previous cases where US allies in the region ignored American orders. In 2019, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan disregarded President Trump's warnings before invading Kurdish territories in Syria, only ending the incursion after the US imposed sanctions on Turkey.Last year, Biden called himself a “Zionist” and visited Israel shortly after the Hamas attack on October 7, which killed around 1,200 people and triggered the ongoing war in Gaza.",US President Joe Biden has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt plans for a potential invasion of southern Lebanon.

Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton urges Kamala Harris to 'defeat Donald Trump' in crucial election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hillary-clinton-urges-kamala-harris-to-defeat-donald-trump-in-crucial-election/articleshow/113827799.cms,"Former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (Photo: Reuters)

Former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has stated that Joe Biden made the right decision to step aside in the upcoming US presidential election following a lacklustre debate performance against Donald Trump . Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Clinton expressed that Biden’s inability to recover from the debate meant he was justified in his choice.“Once that debate happened, he could not recover and he did the right thing,” Clinton said.She also pointed out that Democrats have struggled to effectively communicate their efforts to address the economic concerns of Trump supporters. Clinton is familiar with this, having been unexpectedly defeated by Trump in the 2016 election, a relevant lesson as Trump now competes against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in a tight race.Clinton acknowledged that the future of democracy in the United States rests on this election, urging Harris to “defeat Donald Trump to break the fever that he has caused in our political system"", as per BBC News.Clinton noted the stark differences in the agendas presented by the two candidates, asserting that the election’s consequences extend far beyond the US borders, impacting matters like support for Ukraine and stability in the Middle East. She expressed concern over Trump’s previous comments about potentially cutting US aid to Ukraine, saying, “This election will have repercussions far beyond the US.”In the interview, Clinton condemned Trump’s promise to initiate mass deportations of illegal immigrants, referencing comments made by his vice-presidential pick, JD Vance. “He is going to have a military presence [in US cities] to achieve his goals,” she said.Clinton recognised that Trump’s support stems from various factors, including feeling “overlooked” and concerns over an economy that doesn’t seem to benefit everyone. “I think our problem is frankly we are not the most effective messengers,” she said.As the election on November 5 approaches, polling suggests that Trump is currently more trusted on the crucial issue of the economy, with only narrow margins separating the candidates in key battleground states.",Hillary Clinton says Joe Biden made the right decision to step aside from the US presidential election.

MSNBC guest Maria Hinojosa suggested that many Latino voters want to identify with White Americans as they shift toward the Republican Party . Hinojosa, founder of Futuro Media, made these remarks during a discussion about US vice president Kamala Harris ' lead among Latino voters, which has been narrowing since the 2016 election.When asked by MSNBC's Jonathan Capehart about Harris' 14-point lead over Donald Trump among Latino voters, Hinojosa pointed out a concerning trend.A recent NBC-Telemundo poll revealed that while Harris still holds a lead, the Democratic advantage has dropped to its lowest level in four election cycles.""And what I said to you when we asked a question was, Latinos want to be White. They want to be with the cool kids,"" Hinojosa said, reflecting on conversations with Latino voters who view Trump as a ""good businessman,"" despite his controversial record, according to Fox News.

JD Vance Vs Tim Walz: VP debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz: 10 things to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vp-debate-between-jd-vance-and-tim-walz-10-things-to-know/articleshow/113827011.cms,"JD Vance and Tim Walz will debate Tuesday evening at CBS News

Here are 10 things to know about the vice presidential debate

How to watch: The debate will be hosted by CBS News at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York. Moderated by CBS Evening News anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan, the debate will begin at 9 pm ET. Debate rules: Tim Walz will stand behind the podium on stage left, which is the right side on the screen. JD Vance's podium will be in the opposite side. Tim Walz will be introduced first and there will be no opening statements. 90-minute debate with two breaks: The debate will last for 90 minutes with two breaks of four minutes each. No live audience: Like the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, there will be no live audience in this debate too. Mics muted? In the presidential debate the mics of the non-speaking candidates were muted so that there is no interruption. In the VP debate , mics will not be muted but CBS News reserves the right to mute the candidates' microphones. Mock debates: JD Vance's debate braintrust includes his wife Usha Vance, three of his political aides and Trump senior adviser Jason Miller. Vance has been practicing mock debates with Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who's been studying Walz's gubernatorial and congressional debates and doing opposition research on Vance, Axios reported. Walz's debate brain trust: Walz's debate practice team is largely made up of advisers to the national campaign, including the Harris campaign's communication director, as the New York Times reported. His longtime aide and Minnesota chief of staff Chris Schmitter remains involved. Why Vance vs Tim Walz is so high-stake: JD Vance dominated the news cycle for all the wrong reasons ever since he was named by Donald Trump as the running mate. His past statements are goldmine for the opposition but Vance put his foot down and didn't budge. He questioned Tim Walz's 'stolen valor' when Tim Walz claimed he carried weapons in war while he never served in war.The debate has become very high-stake as this will be the last debate this season. Donald Trump declined to debate again with Kamala Harris. So this is the last chance for the Trump campaign to correct political fumbles, though many of them are credited to JD Vance. Who's a better debater? JD and Tim Walz will be debating for the first time against each other but JD has debated in past and he loves debates. ""JD Vance is aggressive and bold in his assertions. His pugnacity often leads to over-the top claims, but he is also careful to present more polite and thoughtful than the caricature of him portrayed by opponents,"" NYT wrote about JD's debate style Walz's line would be...: A CNN report quoting people involved said Walz may try a line that originated when Harris was preparing for a vice presidential debate before Joe Biden dropped out: asking Vance what promises he made to Trump so the former president wouldn’t send an angry mob after him with a gallows, like Mike Pence experienced on January 6.

Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance will debate Kamala Harris running mate Tim Walz on Tuesday in the vice presidential debate This time, a JD Vance versus Tim Walz will be spectacle for the fireworks that started as soon as their names were announced as the VP candidates. It will be a best selling author versus a teacher-turned Congressman -- both having their military credentials.","The debate will be hosted by CBS News at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York. The debate will last for 90 minutes with two breaks of four minutes each. JD Vance has been practicing mock debates with Rep.

Security has generally improved since Taliban surged back to power in 2021, however the regional chapter of the group, known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), has emerged as the main challenge to their rule.A sweeping security crackdown broadly quashed the number of domestic attacks but there was a string of shootings and bombings by IS-K this summer.Taliban govt spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said ""special forces"" apprehended ""key members of the insurgent group"" which claimed a Kabul suicide bombing that killed six people this month. He said the suicide attacker ""infiltrated Afghanistan"" from a training camp in Pakistan, while others arrested in a series of raids had also ""recently returned"" from there.

Islamabad, In an effort to minimise administrative expenditures, cash-strapped Pakistan on Sunday announced to abolish about 150,000 government posts , close six ministries, and merge two others, as part of reforms agreed upon with the IMF under USD 7 billion loan deal . The International Monetary Fund on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to cut expenditures, increase tax-to GDP ratio, tax non-traditional sectors like agriculture and real estate, limit subsidies and transfer some fiscal responsibilities to provinces.Addressing the media on his return from the US, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that a programme had been finalised with the IMF, which would be the last programme for Pakistan.""We need to implement our policies to prove that it will be the last programme,"" he said, and emphasised that in order to join the G20, the economy must be formalised.The minister said right-sizing within ministries was going on and the decision to close six ministries is set to be implemented, while two ministries will be merged. ""Additionally, 150,000 posts across various ministries will be eliminated,"" Aurangzeb said.He dwelt at length on increasing tax revenues, noting that there were approximately 300,000 new taxpayers last year, and so far this year, 732,000 new taxpayers have registered, increasing the total number of taxpayers in the country from 1.6 million to 3.2 million.Aurangzeb also said that the non-filers category will be abolished and those not paying taxes will no longer be able to purchase property or vehicles.The minister claimed that the economy was moving in the right direction and the country's foreign exchange reserves had increased, reaching their highest level. He highlighted significant growth in both national exports and IT exports, and stated that investor confidence regarding the strength of the economy is a major success.Aurangzeb stated that the policy rate has been reduced by 4.5 per cent by the government after coming to power, and expressed optimism that the exchange rate and policy rate will remain as expected.""Our claim that the economy is improving is not a hollow claim because inflation has decreased due to government policies. Inflation has dropped to single digits,"" he said.Pakistan has been struggling to fix its economy for the last many years and it was close to default in 2023 but a timely loan of USD 3 billion by the IMF saved the situation.Pakistan has negotiated a long-term loan with the global lender with the hope and commitment that it would be the last loan. However, many doubt this claim as the country has already secured about two dozen loans from the Fund but failed to address the economy on a permanent basis.","Pakistan to abolish about 150,000 government posts, close six ministries, and merge two others.

ISLAMABAD: At least 64 people have been killed this week in a fresh outbreak of violence involving the Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan 's militancy-prone Kurram district along the Afghanistan border in the northwest, where a ceasefire had been signed just over a month ago.Governor Faisal Karim Kundi of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said dozens on either side were wounded in the fighting, which continued Friday amid reports of higher casualties than the official figure.Police said the clashes started after the Boshehra Shias of upper Kurram started setting up bunkers on land belonging to the Sunni Ahmadzai community last week. The dispute quickly engulfed other areas and became a full-blown sectarian conflict , they said.In Aug, the warring sides signed a truce after clashes resulted in 50 deaths and injuries to over 200 people.Security officials said the renewed fighting led to closure of roads, triggering a shortage of food, medicines and fuel. Educational institutions have also remained shut for a week.Kurram, a mountainous area that shares a long border with Afghanistan, is home to about 700,000 people, of which more than 42% belong to the Shia community. The district's Parachinar town is one of the few Shia-dominated areas in largely Sunni Pakistan. The region has seen frequent tribal and sectarian clashes in recent years.","At least 64 people killed in fresh outbreak of violence involving Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan's militancy-prone Kurram district.

Nepal's urban poor count cost of 'nightmare' floods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepals-urban-poor-count-cost-of-nightmare-floods/articleshow/113813185.cms,"Rescue personnel transport the dead body of a victim who was trapped under a landslide caused by heavy rains in Kathmandu, Nepal, Sunday, September 29, 2024. (AP)

KATHMANDU : When floodwaters submerged large swathes of Nepal's capital, Indra Prasad Timilsina was able to save the three cows that keep his family fed -- but everything else was claimed by the river.The slum he calls home in Kathmandu is one of several neighbourhoods devastated by pounding weekend rains that disproportionately hit the city's poorest and vulnerable inhabitants.The Bagmati river and its tributaries which criss-cross the Kathmandu valley, broke their banks during the downpour, pummelling flimsy wood and sheet metal shacks that house thousands of people along their shorelines.""This is like a nightmare. I have never seen such an extreme flood in my life,"" the 65-year-old told AFP.""Everything is gone,"" he added. ""If you are dead, you don't have to worry about anything. But if you survive, you have to face these problems.""Timilsina makes a modest living by the river in Tripureshwor selling milk from his cows, including to his neighbours -- many of whom left poverty-stricken villages in rural Nepal to eke out a precarious livelihood on the city's margins.He and his wife fled their homes shortly after midnight on Saturday as the river lapped at their feet -- enough time to lead the cattle to higher ground, but not to gather the rest of their meagre possessions.The couple returned to what was left of their homes alongside hundreds of others cleaning mud-caked walls, scooping buckets of water off the floor and salvaging whatever bags of food had not been spoiled.Timilsina said the waters had spoiled the nine bags of animal feed he had stockpiled for his cows.""We can survive,"" he said, ""but if I don't feed them soon, they'll die.""- 'Wrecked by rising waters' -Nearly 200 people across the capital and elsewhere in Nepal were killed in the weekend's floods, with nearly three dozen more still missing.Army search and rescue teams carried more than 4,000 people to safety and relief crews are working frantically to clear highways around the capital blocked by debris from landslides.Entire neighbourhoods around Kathmandu were inundated, damaging schools and medical clinics including many servicing the city of nearly one million people's poorest residents.Not far from Timilsina's home, more than two dozen computers at a community-run school were wrecked by the rising waters.""They are of no use now,"" teacher Shyam Bihari Mishra told AFP. ""Our students will be deprived of education.""Deadly rain-related floods and landslides are common across South Asia during the monsoon season between June and September.Experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity.Parts of Kathmandu saw about 240 millimetres (9.4 inches) of rain in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, the most intense downpour in more than two decades.Even without the record rainfall, monsoon floods are a regular fact of life for the estimated 29,000 squatters among Kathmandu's urban poor , who build by riverbanks for lack of affordable shelter elsewhere.""This year alone we've run up to our roof several times,"" Bishnu Maya Shrestha, 62, told AFP.""But we didn't expect the flood to swell to swallow all our houses this time.""","Nearly 200 people killed in Nepal's floods, with nearly three dozen more still missing.
