Israel-Iran attacks show India needs greater thrust on multi-layered air & missile defence systems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-iran-attacks-show-india-needs-stronger-air-and-missile-defence-systems/articleshow/109448246.cms,"NEW DELHI: Missile defence is technically complex and very expensive. It’s virtually like firing a bullet to stop an incoming bullet. But with the sheer operational criticality of air and missile defence systems being reinforced by the tit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Iran, India needs to majorly crank up efforts to make its airspace as impregnable as possible.India has taken some strides in the arena but much more clearly needs to be done for an effective multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, reliable command and control posts, land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles.Unlike India, Israel of course has only a small territory to defend. And it did so effectively on April 13, thwarting Iran’s mass missile and kamikaze drone attack with its wide array of defence systems, from the short-range Iron Dome to long-range Arrow, as well as help from some others like the US.India’s air defence systems are geared towards protecting only some vital areas and installations. “India is simply too vast to be effectively protected from all kinds of aerial threats. But yes, apart from buying bullets, we need to invest much more in bulletproof jackets as well. Missile defence is now an overwhelming tactical necessity rather than a strategic one,” a senior officer said.For one, India needs to get cracking on operationally deploying its indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy nuclear and other ballistic missiles both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 15-25 km to 80-100 km for “a higher kill probability”.After “successfully completing” a series of tests for Phase-1 of the land-based BMD system quite a while ago, the DRDO also conducted the maiden flight-trial of a sea-based interceptor missile in April last year.The government, however, has so far not sanctioned full-scale deployment of the BMD system at any vital location. This could be due to the exorbitant costs involved or a few technological gaps, or even strategic calculations that it may provoke Pakistan to go in for a larger nuclear arsenal and countermeasures to defeat the BMD system, as reported by TOI earlier.IAF, of course, now has three squadrons of Russian S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems, which can detect, track and destroy incoming strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, drones and even some intermediate-range ballistic missiles at a range of 380-km. They are deployed in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan.Delivery of the remaining two S-400 squadrons, under the $5.43 billion contract inked in 2018, has been delayed to 2025-26 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.Parallelly, India is developing its own long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system under the ambitious Project Kusha. With an interception range of around 350-km, this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29.Then, there is the Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile (MR-SAM) systems, with an over 70-km range, jointly developed with Israel. After the Navy and IAF, Army in Feb last year operationalized its first `Abhra’ MR-SAM regiment in the 33 Corps, which defends the frontier with China in Sikkim and the Siliguri Corridor.Army and IAF have also inducted the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, with an interception range of 25-km, while a new-generation sleeker version is also now ready for user trials.The armed forces also have a variety of shorter range air defence weapons. These range from the older Russian Igla-1M (5-km), OSA-AK-M (10-km) and Pechora missiles and upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5-km) to the newer Israeli low-level Spyder quick-reaction anti-aircraft missiles (15-km range) and Russian man-portable Igla-S (6-km) systems. DRDO is also testing the indigenous very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS) missiles, which has a range of up to 6-km.","India needs to majorly crank up efforts to make its airspace as impregnable as possible.

Can India help calm things down in West Asia?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-india-help-calm-things-down-in-west-asia/articleshow/109487575.cms,"Here's what we know so far:

Escalation in West Asia

The situation in West Asia has escalated since October 7, 2023, culminating in a devastating Hamas attack that caught Israeli intelligence off guard, resulting in significant casualties and hostages.

This marked the largest single-day loss since the Holocaust and a notable escalation in Israel-Hamas skirmishes since 2008.

since 2008. Subsequently, six months of military action led to over 30,000 deaths and more than a million Palestinians displaced in Gaza.

Heightened instability

Despite the presence of US aircraft carriers in the Eastern Mediterranean, tensions in the region have continued to rise.

The Houthis' actions in disrupting shipping through the Red Sea and Hezbollah's attacks on Israel, causing displacement in the northern part of the country, have contributed to heightened instability.

Israeli response

Israel's response to Iranian support for Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis included a lethal attack on Revolutionary Guard commanders at Iran’s Damascus consulate and an expansion of its responses deeper into Lebanese territory, further escalating the conflict.

for Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis included a lethal attack on Revolutionary Guard commanders at Iran’s Damascus consulate and an expansion of its responses deeper into Lebanese territory, further escalating the conflict. This action, perceived as an infringement on Iranian sovereignty, prompted a significant retaliatory strike from Iran, a first since the Yom Kippur War in 1973.

Israel's subsequent limited strike on Isfahan demonstrated its capability to penetrate Iranian air defences, escalating tensions further.

Stalled ceasefire negotiations

Despite efforts by the US, Egypt, and Qatar to mediate a ceasefire, negotiations have stalled, prolonging the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Global impact

The crisis has broader implications for energy prices, maritime security, and the welfare of migrant workers in the Gulf region, underscoring the need for a concerted international effort to address the situation.

Call for international involvement

Given the challenges faced by major powers in resolving the crisis, there is a call for broader international involvement.

The suggestion is for the G20, particularly a troika consisting of Brazil, India, and South Africa, along with other non-P5 G20 members, to explore avenues for intervention. This initiative could serve as a test of the G20's effectiveness in addressing global crises and promoting peace and stability in the region.

NEW DELHI: Tensions in West Asia have surged since October 7, 2023, reaching a critical juncture with a devastating Hamas attack that stunned Israeli intelligence, resulting in significant casualties and hostages. Over the following six months, military engagements have exacted a heavy toll, with over 30,000 deaths and more than a million Palestinians displaced in Gaza alone.It is suggested that the G20 look at ways to intervene, especially through a troika made up of South Africa, Brazil, India, and other non-P5 G20 members.","The situation in West Asia has escalated since October 7, 2023, culminating in a devastating Hamas attack that caught Israeli intelligence off guard.

PORT MORESBY: Papua New Guinea 's leader has dismissed Joe Biden 's unlikely suggestion that his uncle was eaten by cannibals there as ""loose"" talk that does not reflect the US president's feelings for the country.""Sometimes you have loose moments,"" James Marape said in an interview after Biden's contentious remarks, adding that the relationship was stronger than ""one blurry moment"".Biden said last week that his uncle Ambrose Finnegan was shot down over the Pacific nation during World War II, suggesting his body was never found because ""there were a lot of cannibals"" in the area.""I've met him on four occasions, until today, and on every occasion he's always had warm regards for Papua New Guinea,"" Marape said.""Never in those moments (has) he spoke of PNG as cannibals,"" he added.US defence records showed Finnegan's courier flight was actually ""forced to ditch in the ocean"" off the island's coast ""for unknown reasons"".Finnegan's aircraft hit the water hard and three crew members failed to emerge, while one survived and was rescued by a passing barge, the official defense POW/MIA Accounting agency said on its website.A search the next day found ""no trace"" of the missing crew, the agency said, and White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed Finnegan died when he ""crashed in the Pacific"", not over land.Biden's cannibalism quip comes on the back of a string of recent gaffes.Earlier this year, Biden regaled an audience with an anecdote about meeting former German chancellor Helmut Kohl in 2021 -- who at that point had been dead for four years.Days earlier he appeared to confuse long-dead French president Francois Mitterrand with current leader Emmanuel Macron.Critics -- including his Republican rival Donald Trump, himself 77 -- have questioned whether the 81-year-old is sharp enough to withstand another gruelling term in office.Biden has repeatedly asserted there are no problems with his memory or cognition.Historically, cannibalism has been documented among a small number of tribes in remote parts of Papua New Guinea.But the nation has for decades tried to shed outdated tropes that paint it as a wild nation full of savagery.""There are much, much... deeper values in our relationship than one statement, one word, one punchline,"" Marape said.He urged Biden and the White House to instead focus on clearing up the unexploded ordnance that still litters Papua New Guinea today.In a separate statement on Sunday evening, Marape said the people of Papua New Guinea ""live with the fear"" of being killed by bombs left over from the Second World War.""I urge President Biden to get the White House to look into cleaning up these remains of WWII so the truth about missing servicemen like Ambrose Finnegan can be put to rest.""In a single bomb disposal expedition on the island of Bougainville in 2014, troops from Australia and the United States destroyed 16 tonnes of wartime munitions.The US government's own travel advisory for Papua New Guinea cites unexploded ordnance as one of the main dangers in remote areas.","Papua New Guinea's leader dismisses Joe Biden's cannibalism quip as ""loose"" talk.

Top global spenders

Future outlook

NEW DELHI: In 2023, global military spending saw its steepest increase in over a decade, reaching a new high of $2.4 trillion. This surge in spending was driven by ongoing wars and rising geopolitical tensions , affecting regions across the world, according to the latest report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).The SIPRI report highlighted a uniform rise in military expenditures across all five geographical regions, the first occurrence since 2009.""Total military spending is at an all-time high...and for the first time since 2009, we saw spending increase across all five geographical regions,"" stated Nan Tian, a senior researcher at SIPRI. This global trend underscores the escalating concerns about peace and security worldwide, with no region showing signs of improvement.In Europe, the ongoing war in Ukraine has prompted substantial increases in military spending by Ukraine, Russia, and other European countries. Russia's military budget grew by 24%, reaching $109 billion. Ukraine also saw a significant rise in its military spending, up by 51% to $64.8 billion, bolstered by substantial military aid from the US and other countries.The Middle East and Asia also saw notable increases. Israel, responding to security challenges, increased its spending by 24%, while Saudi Arabia, the largest spender in the region, raised its budget by 4.3%. In Asia, tensions driven by China's military buildup led to increased spending by its neighbors, with Japan and Taiwan both increasing their military budgets by 11%.The United States remained the largest global spender with an expenditure of $916 billion, marking a 2.3% increase from the previous year. China followed with a continued increase for the 29th consecutive year, raising its military spending by 6% to an estimated $296 billion.With the war in Ukraine ""nowhere close to an end"" and ongoing tensions in the Middle East and Asia, Tian anticipates that the upward trend in military spending is likely to continue for several years. This expectation sets the stage for ongoing global military escalations as countries prioritize their security in an increasingly unstable world.(With inputs from agencies)","In 2023, global military spending saw its steepest increase in over a decade, reaching a new high of $2.4 trillion.

These aircraft, F-14 Tomcats , were sold to Iran during the Shah's regime before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Last Friday's strike targeted Isfahan Airbase, home to the F-14 fleet, amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.This military action follows a week after Iran's extensive assault on Israel using drones and missiles, a retaliation for what Tehran claims was an Israeli attack on its consulate in Damascus.The F-14s, discontinued in the US in 2006, have been a significant part of Iran's military history , notably during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. Despite their age, these jets have struggled with maintenance issues due to the unavailability of spare parts.Musk highlighted the paradox of the situation on social media, saying, ""our tax dollars somehow also blowing up our tax dollars."" He also expressed a broader concern about global conflicts, suggesting a more peaceful and exploratory use of technology: ""we should send rockets not at each other, but rather to the stars.""Israel, a major recipient of US military aid, continues to be a pivotal American ally in the Middle East. This relationship includes significant financial assistance and collaborative defense projects like the Iron Dome and the F-35 fighter program. The US Congress is currently deliberating a foreign aid package that includes substantial aid for Israel, alongside aid for Ukraine and humanitarian efforts in Gaza.The F-14 Tomcat, a supersonic, twin-engine, two-seat, variable-sweep wing fighter aircraft, was introduced by the US Navy in the 1970s and became one of the most iconic jet fighters due to its advanced technology and unique capabilities. Iran's acquisition and use of the F-14 Tomcats is a unique chapter in military aviation history.Iran purchased F-14 Tomcats from the United States during the 1970s when the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was seeking to modernize the country's armed forces. The deal was part of the Shah's broader military expansion strategy, supported by the US, aimed at making Iran the dominant military power in the Gulf region. Iran received its first F-14s in 1976 and became the only country other than the United States to operate them.The 1979 Islamic Revolution marked a significant turning point for Iran's F-14 fleet. The overthrow of the Shah led to a new Islamic Republic government that was immediately subjected to international sanctions and embargoes. These restrictions severely impacted the maintenance and operational capability of the F-14s, as the US cut off military support and spare parts.Despite these challenges, Iran used its F-14s extensively during the Iran-Iraq War from 1980 to 1988. The aircraft were crucial in defending Iranian airspace against Iraqi air strikes and in conducting reconnaissance missions. The Tomcats achieved a number of aerial victories during the war. However, the lack of spare parts and maintenance support gradually eroded the operational effectiveness of the fleet.After the war, Iran faced ongoing challenges in keeping its F-14s airworthy due to the embargo on military parts. Ingeniously, Iran resorted to reverse engineering and domestic production of parts to maintain its fleet. Over the years, there have been reports of various upgrades to their avionics and armaments, integrating domestic and possibly foreign technology not originally part of the F-14s.Today, the F-14 remains a symbol of Iran's resilience in maintaining a complex weapons system under sanctions. Although their numbers have dwindled and their original capabilities might be degraded, the F-14s continue to be a significant part of Iran's air defense strategy.","Musk highlighted the paradox of the situation on social media, saying, ""our tax dollars somehow also blowing up our tax dollars.""

Chinese military drone spotted flying close to the Philippines ahead of BrahMos delivery from India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-military-drone-spotted-flying-close-to-the-philippines-ahead-of-brahmos-delivery-from-india/articleshow/109461199.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A WZ-7 Soaring Dragon drone belonging to the Chinese People's Liberation Army was spotted flying in close proximity to the Philippines, ahead of preparations by the Southeast Asian country to receive the delivery of Indian BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, The Eurasian Times reported.The drone's distinctive joined-wing shape caught the attention of Raffy Tima , a correspondent for Philippine news organization GMA News, as it traversed the skies over the West Philippine Sea.This sighting comes amidst escalating tensions between China and the Philippines over territorial disputes in the South China Sea , notably at the Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal. The timing is particularly significant as the Philippines prepares to receive the delivery of Indian BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, perceived as a strategic move to bolster defensive capabilities against China's assertiveness in the region.Procured under the 'Horizon 2' Priority Projects aimed at modernizing the Philippine armed forces, the BrahMos missile system arrived in Manila on April 19. The delivery, facilitated through a government-to-government (G2G) deal, includes three missile batteries, operator and maintainer training, and an Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package.The coincidence of the WZ-7 drone sighting with the arrival of Indian transport planes carrying the BrahMos missiles raises eyebrows. This occurrence precedes the commencement of the 'Balikatan 2024' drills between the Philippines and the US.The WZ-7, operated by the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), boasts a service ceiling of over 60,000 feet and a range of about 4,350 miles. Its sighting near the Philippines echoes previous instances of its presence near Taiwan amid tensions between China and the island.As military exercises loom, with activities including target ship sinking and island reclamation, the deployment of the new Typhon ground-based missile system by the US on the northern Philippine island of Luzon raises concerns for China.",A WZ-7 Soaring Dragon drone belonging to the Chinese People's Liberation Army was spotted flying in close proximity to the Philippines.

"Philippines, US launch annual joint military drills",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/philippines-us-launch-annual-joint-military-drills/articleshow/109485848.cms,"'It matters for regional stability'

MANILA: Thousands of Filipino and American troops will kick off joint military exercises in the Philippines on Monday, as Beijing's growing assertiveness in the region raises fears of a conflict.The annual drills -- dubbed Balikatan, or ""shoulder to shoulder"" in Tagalog -- will be concentrated in the northern and western parts of the archipelago nation, near the potential flashpoints of the South China Sea and Taiwan.China claims almost the entire waterway, a key route for international trade, and also considers self-ruled Taiwan to be part of its territory.In response to China's growing influence, the United States has been bolstering alliances with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including the Philippines.Washington and Manila are treaty allies and have deepened their defence cooperation since Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos took office in 2022.While the Philippines is poorly armed, its proximity to the South China Sea and Taiwan would make it a key partner for the United States in the event of a conflict with China.""The purpose of armed forces, why we exist, is really to prepare for war,"" Philippine Colonel Michael Logico told reporters ahead of the drills.""There's no sugarcoating it... for us not to prepare, that's a disservice to the country.""The Philippine Coast Guard will join Balikatan for the first time following several confrontations between its vessels and the China Coast Guard, which patrols reefs off the Philippines' coast.The joint drills involve a simulation of an armed recapture of an island in Palawan province, the nearest major Philippine landmass to the hotly disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.The same exercise will be held in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Batanes, both less than 300 kilometres (180 miles) from Taiwan.Like last year, there will be a sinking of a vessel off the northern province of Ilocos Norte.Other training will concern information warfare, maritime security, and integrated air and missile defence.The United States has deployed its Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) guided missiles to the Philippines for Balikatan, but Logico said the weapons would not be used in the drills.China's foreign ministry has accused the United States of ""stoking military confrontation"", and warned the Philippines to ""stop sliding down the wrong path"".The exercises, which will run until May 10, will involve around 11,000 American and 5,000 Filipino troops, as well as Australian and French military personnel.France will also deploy a warship that will take part in a joint exercise with Philippine and US vessels.Fourteen countries in Asia and Europe will join as observers.For the first time, the drills will go beyond the Philippines' territorial waters, which extend about 22 kilometres from its coastline, Logico said.""Balikatan is more than an exercise; it's a tangible demonstration of our shared commitment to each other,"" Lieutenant General William Jurney, commander of US Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, said in a statement.""It matters for regional peace, it matters for regional stability.""","Thousands of Filipino and American troops will kick off joint military exercises in the Philippines on Monday.

Two men were pronounced dead at the scene, Davis said.The six surviving victims were transported to area hospitals, police said, where one had been in critical condition and one was released.By Sunday morning, the victims had been upgraded to stable condition , police said on the social platform X.The shooting occurred at a block party, which Davis said included an estimated 200 to 300 attendees but did not appear to have been issued a city permit.At least two people are believed to have fired weapons during the shooting and police were examining video footage as part of the ongoing investigation, Davis said. There were no immediate arrests.“There are no words that can adequately express the pain we are all feeling over this most recent act of senseless violence — where guns were brazenly brought to a park filled with young people, families, and children,” Memphis Mayor Paul Young said in a statement released Sunday. “This must stop.

""After a long journey, she's home,"" Roddenberry wrote on social media Thursday.For die-hard Trekkies, the model's disappearance had become the subject of folklore, so an eBay listing last fall, with a starting bid of $1,000, didn't go unnoticed.""Red alert,"" someone in a prop-making online forum wrote, linking to the listing.Roddenberry's father, Gene Roddenberry , created the television series, which first aired in 1966 and ran for three seasons. It spawned numerous spinoffs, several films and a franchise that has included conventions and legions of devoted fans with an avid interest in memorabilia. The seller of the model was bombarded with inquiries and quickly took the listing down. The seller contacted Heritage Auctions to authenticate it, the auction house's executive vice president, Joe Maddalena, said. As soon as the seller, who said he had found it in a storage unit, brought it to the auction house's office in California, Maddalena said he knew it was real. ""That's when I reached out to Rod to say, 'We've got this. This is it,'"" he said, adding that the model was being transferred to Roddenberry.Roddenberry said he would restore the model and seek to have it displayed in a museum or other institution. He said reclaiming the item had only piqued his interest in the circumstances about its disappearance: ""Whoever borrowed it or misplaced it or lost it, something happened somewhere."" It was unclear how the model ended up in the storage unit and who had it before its discovery.The original USS Enterprise, a 33-inch model, was mostly made of solid wood. An enlarged 11-foot model was used in subsequent ""Star Trek"" TV episodes, and is now part of the collection of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.Gene Roddenberry, who died in 1991, kept the original model, which appeared in the show's opening credits and pilot episode, on his desk. The model went missing after Roddenberry lent it to the makers of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"", which was released in 1979. ""This is a major discovery,"" Maddalena said, likening the model to the ruby slippers from ""Wizard of Oz"", a prop stolen in 2005 and recovered by the FBI in 2018. While the slippers represent hope, he said, the starship model ""represents dreams.""","""After a long journey, she's home,"" Eugene Roddenberry Jr. writes on social media.

The House passed the legislation on Saturday by a margin of 360 to 58. It now moves to the Senate where it could be taken up for a vote in the coming days.President Joe Biden has previously said he will sign the legislation. The step to include TikTok in a broader foreign aid package may fast-track the timeline on a potential ban after an earlier separate bill stalled in the US Senate.""It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans,"" TikTok said in a statement.Many US lawmakers from both the Republican and Democratic parties and the Biden administration say TikTok poses national security risks because China could compel the company to share the data of its 170 million US users. TikTok insists it has never shared US data and never would.Democratic US Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Sunday said TikTok could be used as a propaganda tool by the Chinese government.""Many young people on TikTok get their news (from the app), the idea that we would give the (Chinese) Communist Party this much of a propaganda tool as well as the ability to scrape 170 million Americans' personal data, it is a national security risk,"" he told CBS News.Some progressive Democrats have also raised free speech concerns over a ban and instead asked for stronger data privacy regulations.Democratic US Representative Ro Khanna said on Sunday that he felt a TikTok ban may not survive legal scrutiny in courts, citing the US Constitution's free speech protections.""I don't think its going to pass First Amendment scrutiny,"" he said in an interview to ABC News. The House voted on March 13 to give ByteDance about six months to divest the US assets of the short-video app, or face a ban. The legislation passed on Saturday gives a nine-month deadline which could be further extended by three months if the president were to determine progress toward a sale. TikTok was also a topic of conversation in a call between Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping earlier this month.

However, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl of Maulana Fazlur Rehman boycotted the polls.The Election Committee of Pakistan (ECP) has yet to issue the final results but private media channels shared the outcome based on the results of individual polling stations.According to the Dunya News channel, the PML-N won two National Assembly seats while one each was grabbed by PPP, SIC and an independent candidate.The preliminary result showed that PML-N won 10 out of 16 seats in the provincial assemblies , including nine from Punjab and one from Balochistan.

But polls were cancelled for one National Assembly, two Punjab Assembly and one seat of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly respectively.In Punjab, NA-132 (Kasur) and NA-119 (Lahore) were vacated by Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and chief minister Maryam Nawaz, while Shehbaz also gave up two of his provincial assembly seats in Lahore. He, however, retained his NA-123 seat in the National Assembly.Apart from these leaders, candidates who had won more than one seat opted for a chosen seat after the elections, leaving the Election Commission of Pakistan to organise by-elections on 21 seats, including five National and 16 provincial assembly seats.A day earlier, the federal government announced that cellular services would remain temporarily suspended in specific districts of Punjab and Balochistan during the by-elections. The request for the suspension was made by the ECP.The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) issued a statement, saying that the decision has been taken to safeguard the integrity and security of the electoral process.Elaborate security measures have been taken by the authorities to control the law and order situation, with the deployment of regular army troops to maintain peace during the day-long process of by-elections.The Punjab government had also asked the federal government to suspend mobile internet services in the province's 13 districts and tehsils on April 21 to maintain law and order.The move came despite severe criticism by media and political leaders of a similar step on February 8 when mobile services were suspended.","PML-N wins at least two National and 10 provincial assembly seats, according to unofficial results.

A court banned the group in 2008 and constant counterterrorism crackdowns, supported by the United States and Australia, have weakened it further.Last year, police arrested a total of 142 suspected militants, including four women, and fatally shot two others on southern Sumatra island.Militant attacks on foreigners in Indonesia have been largely replaced in recent years by smaller, less deadly strikes targeting the government, mainly police and anti-terrorism forces, and people militants consider to be infidels, inspired by Islamic State group tactics abroad.","Police conducted raids in Central Sulawesi province between Tuesday and Thursday.
