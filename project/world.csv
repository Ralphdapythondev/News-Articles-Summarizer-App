While recounting her trip to authorities, she noted that she was driving behind several trucks when she encountered a slower vehicle, which prompted her to accelerate and pass it at high speed.“I was behind this boxy maybe trailer or RV. And he was going super duper slow, so I passed him,” she recalled, seemingly unaware of the tragedy that unfolded after that.When asked about the tanker truck, she said, “I heard that maybe it flipped” and went off the road. She claimed not to have seen or heard the crash, merely noticing the emergency vehicles heading in the opposite direction.Dashcam footage would later reveal a different story. The video captured the moment the teen cut off the anhydrous ammonia tanker while attempting to pass at approximately 90 mph. The ensuing jackknife maneuver led the truck to collide with a utility trailer parked just off the highway, puncturing the tank and releasing thousands of gallons of the caustic chemical into the air. This toxic plume forced the evacuationof nearly 500 people for hours.When confronted with the dashcam video, the teen said, “Oh, (expletive). Yeah. Oh, my goodness. Yep, totally my bad. Wow. Holy (expletive),” acknowledging her role in the accident that had devastating consequences.The accident that occurred near Teutopolis , Illinois, resulted in the death of five people including a father and his two children and prompted the evacuation of over 500 residents in the vicinity.","A 17-year-old from Ohio admitted to causing a catastrophic crash on September 29, 2023 involving a tanker truck carrying toxic ammonia.

"Who is Hezbollah leader Hashem Safieddine, targetted by Israel airstrikes?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-is-hezbollah-leader-hashem-safieddine-targetted-by-israel-airstrikes/articleshow/113922545.cms,"Hashem Safieddine.

Who is Hashem Safieddine?

NEW DELHI: Israeli warplanes conducted a series of intense airstrikes on Wednesday night targeting Hashem Safieddine , cousin and possible successor of the recently assassinated Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah .The bombardment was one of the most severe in the region since Israel killed Nasrallah, but it remains unclear whether Safieddine, who was believed to be attending a meeting with senior Hezbollah officials, was killed in the strikes.This attempted assassination is the latest effort by Israel to systematically eliminate Hezbollah's leadership, following their invasion of southern Lebanon earlier in the week.Hashem Safieddine, born in southern Lebanon in the early 1960s, is one of Hezbollah's founding members. He joined the Shiite Muslim group in the 1980s during Lebanon's civil war and quickly rose through the ranks alongside Nasrallah.Safieddine held various positions, including political, spiritual, and cultural leadership roles as well as overseeing the group's military activities at one point. Like Nasrallah, Safieddine often wore a black turban, signifying his status as a revered Shiite cleric.In 1995, he was promoted to the group's highest council and soon after he was appointed the head of the military operations of Hezbollah. In 1998, Safieddine was elected to lead the party's executive council, a position previously held by Nasrallah before his appointment as Hezbollah's secretary-general in 1992.Like Nasrallah, Safieddine studied in Iran, forming strong ties with Tehran during his religious studies in Qom before returning to Lebanon to work for Hezbollah.Safieddine's son Reza Hashem Safieddine married Zeinab Suleimani, daughter of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, an Iranian commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps' Quds Force, who was killed by a US airstrike in Baghdad in 2020. The wedding was highly publicized and was largely viewed as a symbol of Iran's deep involvement in Hezbollah.In May 2017, the United States and Saudi Arabia designated Safieddine as a terrorist due to his leadership role in Hezbollah. US has classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organization since 1997, holding the group accountable for numerous attacks that claimed the lives of hundreds of Americans, including the 1983 suicide truck bombings of the US embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, the 1984 US embassy annex bombing in Beirut, and the 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847.","Israeli warplanes conducted a series of intense airstrikes on Wednesday night targeting Hashem Safieddine.

Kamala Harris: ‘No one will vote for her’: Kamala Harris faces challenges in gaining back Arab American and Muslim support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-one-will-vote-for-her-kamala-harris-faces-challenges-in-gaining-back-arab-american-and-muslim-support/articleshow/113950582.cms,"US vice president Kamala Harris

US vice president Kamala Harris is set to meet with Arab American and Muslim leaders in Flint, Michigan, on Friday as her presidential campaign seeks to regain support from voters frustrated with US backing of Israel's military actions in Gaza and Lebanon. This meeting is part of a broader effort to reconnect with Muslim and Arab voters who previously backed Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election but may now withhold their votes from Harris.Harris is expected to engage with representatives from Emgage, the American Task Force on Lebanon, and Hala Hijazi, a long-time friend who has suffered personal losses in Gaza, as reported by Reuters news agency. Sources familiar with the plans, who requested anonymity, indicated that leaders from the Uncommitted National Movement protest campaign were not invited to the meeting, while Jim Zogby, founder of the Arab American Institute, declined the invitation.On Wednesday, Harris' national security adviser, Phil Gordon, held a virtual meeting with community leaders to reaffirm the administration's commitment to a ceasefire in Gaza, diplomatic efforts in Lebanon, and stability in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Additionally, during a Zoom call with Muslim voters , Minnesota governor Tim Walz , Harris’ vice-presidential pick, assured that Muslims would play an equal role in a Harris administration.Some Arab Americans express concern that Kamala's alignment with President Biden's Middle East policies could negatively impact her support. Ali Dagher, a Lebanese American attorney, said, “Harris is going to lose Michigan. I will not be voting for Kamala Harris. No one I know will vote for her.”Polls suggest that Harris and Trump hold nearly equal levels of support among Arab Americans. Harris has been focusing on labour issues, recently celebrating a union deal in Redford Township, Michigan, and planning to vow support for the state's auto industry alongside United Auto Workers Union President Shawn Fain.Harris, a Democrat, is gearing up for a challenging presidential race against Republican former President Donald Trump on November 5.","US vice president Kamala Harris is set to meet with Arab American and Muslim leaders in Flint, Michigan, on Friday.

A 2011 clip featuring Justin Bieber and Sean “Diddy” Combs on American talk show ' Jimmy Kimmel Live !' has resurfaced and garnered attention following Diddy ’s recent arrest for alleged sex trafficking and racketeering . The video shows a young Bieber, then just 16, interacting with the 54-year-old rapper, as host Jimmy Kimmel questions them about their friendship and potential music collaborations.“I think that we have become friends in a strange way,” Combs replied, to which Bieber said, “It’s like Rob & Big,” referencing the late skateboarder Rob Dyrdek and his bodyguard.Combs praised Bieber, saying, “He’s like a little brother” to many in the industry and that they want to protect him because he is “genuinely such a nice person besides his talents.”During the conversation, Kimmel joked, “You know, Diddy bought his son a Bentley; maybe he could buy you one also while you’re at it.” To which Bieber responded, “He got me a Lamborghini. I haven’t gotten it yet, though.”Combs elaborated on the Lamborghini mention, saying, “The Lamborghini for a day or two and he had access to the house. And he knows better than to be talking about the things that he does with big brother Puff on national television. Everything ain’t for everybody.”However, an unsettling exchange in the clip has drawn backlash. Combs said, “He’s having 48 hours with Diddy, where we hanging out and what we’re doing we can’t really disclose,” adding, “But it’s definitely a 15-year-old’s dream.” He claimed to have “custody” of Bieber for that time, saying, “I don’t have legal guardianship of him [Bieber] but for the next 48 hours, he’s with me, and we’re gonna go full crazy.”In a separate video from 2020, Bieber expressed his desire to protect Billie Eilish from the music industry. Speaking with Apple Music ’s Zane Lowe, he reflected on his own experiences as a young artist, sharing, “It was hard for me being that young and being in the industry and not knowing where to turn, and everyone telling me they loved me, and turn their back on you in a second.” He added, “I just want to protect her. I don’t want her to go through anything I went through. I don’t wish that upon anybody.”Bieber described his struggles, saying, “It was bad … it was dark,” and highlighted the psychological toll of his early fame. He hopes to be “a good example” for Eilish, saying, “If she ever needs me, I’m gonna be here for her. I’m just a call away.”Since Diddy’s arrest on September 16, various clips of his extravagant parties have resurfaced, including a 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' segment where Khloe Kardashian recalled encountering Bieber at one of Diddy’s lavish gatherings in 2014, where “half of the guests were naked.”Federal prosecutors have accused Diddy of hosting “freak off” parties where women were lured and forced into sexual performances with male sex workers. The indictment claims these events were recorded, allegedly providing Diddy with material to blackmail his victims. He faces charges of sex trafficking, racketeering, and transportation to engage in prostitution, to which he has pleaded not guilty.Despite the controversy surrounding Diddy, Bieber is focusing on his new role as a father after welcoming his son, Jack Blues, with his wife Hailey Bieber . An insider noted, “He’s aware of Diddy’s arrest and all the allegations. It’s not anything that he wants to focus on, though"", as reported by the New York Times.","A 2011 clip featuring Justin Bieber and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs on American talk show'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' has resurfaced and garnered attention following Diddy’s recent arrest for alleged sex trafficking and racketeering.

President Joe Biden expressed doubts on Friday about the likelihood of November elections being peaceful in the wake of what he said were inflammatory remarks made by Donald Trump , the Republican candidate, who continues to deny the legitimacy of his loss in the 2020 presidential race. The 81-year-old president suggested that while he believes the will be “free and fair,” he cannot guarantee it will be “peaceful.”Biden’s comments came in response to a question from National Public Radio’s Tamara Keith about the political climate leading up to the election.“The things that [former President Donald] Trump has said and the things that he said last time out when he didn’t like the outcome of the election were very dangerous,” Biden said, emphasising his worries over the acceptance of election results. He added, “Have you noticed? I noticed that the vice presidential Republican candidate [Ohio Sen. JD Vance] did not say he’d accept the outcome of the election and hasn’t even accepted the outcome of the last election. So I’m concerned about what they’re going to do.”The president’s appearance caught many off guard, as several seats in the briefing room were empty, and most of the reporters focused their questions on the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Biden has recently increased his press appearances, marking a significant shift from his previous limited interaction with the media.Biden faced backlash for his recent comments, including a slip regarding “Hurricane Helena” during discussions about Hurricane Helene . When a reporter asked if he was considering rejoining the presidential race, he jokingly responded, “I’m back in!” prompting laughter in the room.","US President Joe Biden expressed doubts on Friday about the likelihood of November elections being peaceful.

In a piece for 'New York' magazine titled “Jack Smith’s October Cheap Shot,” Honig criticised Smith’s actions following a new court filing related to Trump’s claim of immunity from prosecution, as reported by Fox News.Smith, who has brought multiple charges against Trump, submitted a 165-page filing with Judge Tanya Chutkan , exceeding the typical limit of 45 pages.Judge Chutkan made the bulk of the document public after eliminating several names. This move comes after earlier efforts to fast-track Trump’s immunity hearing ahead of the November 5 presidential election , despite Judge Chutkan now saying she does not consider the election in her rulings.Honig argues that Smith’s actions are meant to weaken Trump's chances in the upcoming election. ""Smith has essentially abandoned any pretense; he'll bend any rule, switch up on any practice — so long as he gets to chip away at Trump's electoral prospects,"" Honig wrote. He added that this conduct ""violates core Department of Justice principles.""In federal criminal procedures, the defence typically files a motion following an indictment, and the prosecution responds. However, according to Honig, Smith overturned this process by filing his brief, without waiting for a defence motion. Although Judge Chutkan admitted the move was ""procedurally irregular,"" she ruled in Smith’s favour.Smith had earlier raised concerns that Trump's public comments might influence a jury, but now, according to Honig, he is using grand-jury testimony—normally kept secret at this point—in a way that could harm Trump, without giving him the chance to respond or challenge it.Trump, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, continues to argue that he is immune from prosecution related to the cases Smith is pursuing.","CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig accused Special Counsel Jack Smith of bending legal procedures to undermine former US President Donald Trump's electoral prospects.

Hurricane Helene: Health officials issue allergy alert as wasps thrive during Hurricane Helene,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/health-officials-issue-allergy-alert-as-wasps-thrive-during-hurricane-helene/articleshow/113949324.cms,"With the destruction of their homes and nests, many wasps have become more aggressive.

In the wake of Hurricane Helene , deemed the deadliest storm to hit the US since Hurricane Katrina , health officials are facing a new challenge: an influx of wasps. Floodwaters from the hurricane have disturbed wasp nests, leading to increased stinging incidents and prompting US health officials to stock up on allergy medications , as reported by Sky News.The storm, which has resulted in at least 215 fatalities and left communities from Florida’s Gulf Coast to Virginia’s Appalachian Mountains grappling with recovery, has worsened the risk of wasp encounters.Summer Tonizzo, a press assistant at North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed that officials are working to ensure that allergy medications, such as Benadryl and EpiPens, are readily available in western North Carolina. “We are actively working to ensure Benadryl and epinephrine are readily available in western North Carolina for those who may be allergic or have been stung,” she said.Many wasps have become more aggressive with the destruction of their homes and nests. Tarren Pruitt, a registered nurse from West Jefferson, North Carolina, reported noticing a surge in wasp activity since the hurricane, saying that numerous workers have been stung while restoring power. Chris Hayes, an extension associate in urban entomology at North Carolina State University, explained that wasps tend to become more aggressive as the season changes, with food sources dwindling and their populations declining.Most people may not be allergic to wasp stings but can still experience pain, itching, or swelling. While Benadryl can help alleviate these symptoms, EpiPens are crucial for individuals facing severe allergic reactions, which can be life-threatening. The National Park Service is advising residents in affected areas to exercise caution and to move away from disturbed nests while covering their faces.Dozens or possibly hundreds of people remain unaccounted for following the hurricane's devastation. The storm’s impact has prompted President Joe Biden to pledge federal support for recovery efforts, with power restoration and communications still lacking in many areas.","Floodwaters from the hurricane have disturbed wasp nests, leading to increased stinging incidents.

Former US President Donald Trump and Georgia governor Brian Kemp are set to make a joint appearance on Friday for the first time in four years, amidst the recovery efforts following the devastation brought by Hurricane Helene in the United States. The two prominent Republicans will be briefed on storm damage in Evans, Georgia, and are expected to address the press during their visit, as reported by Fox News .This event marks the first time Trump and Kemp have been seen together since their tense relationship following the 2020 presidential election The aftermath of Hurricane Helene has been severe, with the death toll exceeding 220, hundreds still missing, and over 800,000 residents across seven states without power or running water. Damage from the storm is estimated to be in billions.The duo's history is marked by Trump’s ongoing criticism of Kemp for his refusal to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, where Trump lost by a narrow margin. Trump supported a 2022 primary challenge against Kemp from former senator David Perdue. However, after Kemp won the primary and was re-elected, Trump eased his criticism.During an Atlanta rally in August, Trump called Kemp a “bad guy” and “disloyal” while blaming him for not preventing the indictment against him by a county prosecutor. Just weeks later, Trump surprised many by praising Kemp in a post on X, saying, “I look forward to working with you, your team, and all of my friends in Georgia to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”With Trump engaged in a tight presidential race against Vice President Kamala Harris , both he and Kemp have publicly critiqued the federal government’s response to the disaster. In a social media post, Trump said, “It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED ‘STORM,’ AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE,” as Harris toured Georgia to meet with local officials and storm victims.Georgia is a vital battleground state for the 2024 election , scheduled for November 5, and Trump is seeking the support of Brian Kemp. In an interview, Kemp stated, “There’s no path for former President Trump or any Republican to reach 270 [electoral votes] without Georgia.” He highlighted his dedication to mobilising Republican voters, asserting, “We need to be telling people why they should vote for us.”","Former US President Donald Trump and Georgia governor Brian Kemp are set to make a joint appearance on Friday for the first time in four years.

LOS ANGELES: Former LA county sheriff Jim McDonnell will lead the Los Angeles Police Department , taking charge of the force of nearly 9,000 officers as discontent grows among the city's residents over public safety even as violent crime numbers drop, the mayor announced Friday.Mayor Karen Bass , who had the final say after a civilian board of Los Angeles police commissioners vetted McDonnell, said her selection of a veteran law enforcement officer was based on a need to reduce crime and make every neighborhood safer.Bass met with hundreds of LAPD officers and community leaders before making her decision.The pick ended debate over whether Bass would choose an ""insider"" or ""outsider"" who would shake things up and challenge the way things were done within the department's insular culture.""From the beginning, I have been clear: My top priority as mayor is to ensure that Angelenos and our neighborhoods are safer today than yesterday,"" Bass said. ""Chief McDonnell is a leader, an innovator, and a change maker, and I am looking forward to working with him to grow and strengthen LAPD.""The incoming chief will have to make sure the department is ready for the additional security challenges of the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympics .McDonnell was elected LA County Sheriff in 2014 to oversee the largest sheriff's department in the U.S. Before that, he spent 29 years in the LAPD and served as Long Beach's police chief for almost five years.McDonnell vowed to enhance public safety, grow back the force that has shrunk over the years, and ""ensure respectful and constitutional policing practices.""The appointment follows the surprise retirement of Chief Michel Moore in early 2024. Moore's tenure was marked by greater scrutiny into excessive force and police killings of civilians in the nation's second-largest city. Dominic Choi has led the department as interim chief - and the first Asian American chief - since March 2024. Bass thanked Choi for his work, and said he will continue to serve as assistant chief under McDonnell.The other two candidates sent to Bass, who made the final selection, were Deputy Chief Emada Tingrides and former Assistant Chief Robert ""Bobby"" Arcos, both reported by the Los Angeles Times as finalists for the position.The LAPD has faced criticism through the years over its response to the George Floyd protests and several high-profile shootings by officers. It has struggled to get rid of bad cops while also struggling to recruit as more officers leave its ranks than are coming in.John Sullivan, who retired as a lieutenant in 2018 after 30 years at the county sheriff's department, called McDonnell a ""hybrid"" in the insider-outsider debate.""He grew up in the organization, he knows the organization ... but he's also been the chief of a separate department, and he's also been sheriff,"" Sullivan said. McDonnell would bring a ""fresh set of eyes"" to the LAPD's problems while understanding the concerns of the rank-and-file.At the LAPD, McDonnell held every rank from police officer to second-in-command under former LAPD chief Bill Bratton. During that time, he helped implement a federal consent decree imposed on the department largely as a result of the Rampart scandal, a corruption case involving rampant misconduct within the anti-gang unit.When he was elected county sheriff, he inherited a department in the wake of a jail abuse corruption scandal that led to convictions against his predecessor, Lee Baca, and more than 20 other officials. Members of a civilian watchdog commission applauded McDonnell for embracing federal mandates for jail reform, including improving de-escalation training and better documentation of the use of force that has led to improved jail conditions, the Los Angeles Times reported.In 2022, he joined the University of Southern California as director of the Safe Communities Institute, which conducts research on public safety solutions.McDonnell also served on an advisory committee to USC's Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Threats and Emergencies, a U.S. Homeland Security department-funded institution to do research on counterterrorism, according to Sullivan. His experience with studying international security threats could be an asset as police chief.""We have really large public events that are coming that could well be terrorist targets,"" Sullivan said, referring to the World Cup and Olympics. ""The war in Gaza, the brewing war in south Lebanon, all that's going to have echoes or ripples here in Los Angeles.""","McDonnell was elected LA County Sheriff in 2014 to oversee the largest sheriff's department in the U.S. Before that, he spent 29 years in the LAPD and served as Long Beach's police chief for almost five years.

WASHINGTON: An ugly political storm is churning over disaster aid for hurricane victims, with MAGA Trumpers alleging that Kamala Harris is ""stealing"" emergency relief money to give to illegal immigrants and fund war in Ukraine .The charges are coming from the top levels of the MAGA hierarchy, with Trump, his son Eric, and his tech-bro Elon Musk among others making the case, with wild numbers and conflated data, that Harris is short-changing Americans in favor of illegal immigrants and foreign countries.Trump himself, under scrutiny from the left over apprehensions he is already setting the stage to claim election fraud, unloaded against Harris at a rally on Thursday, alleging her administration ""stole"" billions in emergency relief money to house illegal immigrants in luxury hotels -- including giving them $1 billion for gift cards -- while trying to register them to vote in the election.""There are 157 hotels in New York City that are completely full of illegal immigrants... and then you see these pictures of husbands and wives and children who've lost everything... and what does Kamala do? She comes out and offers $750... "" Trump son Eric told Fox News, the leading echo-chamber for MAGA views.MAGA principals also raged against money being spent on foreign wars, including in Ukraine and Israel, alleging sums ranging from $ 60 billion to $ 175 billion had been funneled into the conflicts.While political mavens say Harris herself has little discretion in the matter (the money appropriated by Congress where Republicans have majority), analysts, economics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman among them, accused Trump of ""political dishonesty"" in ""trying to persuade voters that America is a nation with a collapsing economy overrun by violent immigrants.""Still, the charges of money diversion caught on MAGA circles, where demonisation of immigrants had now taken on dangerous proportions.""Yes, they are literally using YOUR tax dollars to import voters and disenfranchise you! It is happening right in front of your eyes. And FEMA used up its budget ferrying illegals into the country instead of saving American lives. Treason,"" Elon Musk said on his platform X (formerly Twitter), where he has repeatedly posted disinformation and MAGA propaganda.Musk also announced that he will join Trump at a rally on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, site of the first assassination attempt on the former President, as the MAGA narrative of stolen elections picked up steam.On Thursday, a judge in Colorado sentenced Tina Peters, a 69 year old election clerk, to nine years in prison for illegally hacking voting systems during the 2020 elections.

Challenges

The US economy added 254,000 jobs last month, far surpassing expectations and alleviating concerns about a faltering job market , as per the US Department of Labor. The report has also beaten Wall Street's expectations of a substantial interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, according to the New York Post.The unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%, down from 4.2% the previous month, while hourly earnings rose by 4% year-on-year.Consensus estimates had predicted a gain of 150,000 jobs, a modest increase from the 142,000 reported for August. The unemployment rate had previously shown slight fluctuations, falling from an unexpected rise to 4.3% in July.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that further interest rate cuts are likely, but he emphasised a gradual approach designed to support a healthy economy. At the Fed's last meeting on September 18, officials reduced the rate to 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, and projected two additional quarter-point cuts in November and December.“If the economy performs as expected, that would mean two more cuts this year,” Powell said.Data from ADP showed that private sector companies added 143,000 jobs in September, surpassing analysts' estimates of 125,000 and marking a rebound from August's figure of 99,000. This increase ended a streak of five consecutive months of job declines.Despite these positive signs, there are indications of a weakening job market. TheLabour Department reported that the quits rate, a crucial measure of worker confidence, fell to 1.9% in August, the lowest since June 2020. The hiring rate also declined to 3.3%, down from 3.4% in July, the weakest rate since August 2013, excluding the pandemic.Payroll growth across most sectors suggests fewer layoffs, although hiring has slowed due to reduced demand following the Federal Reserve's rate hikes of 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% last month, following a 0.5% rise in August, while year-on-year wages rose by 4.0%, up from 3.9% in August. This strong wage growth makes it unlikely that the US central bank will implement another half-percentage-point rate cut at its meeting on November 6-7.The labour market continues to add jobs at a steady pace, allowing Americans to maintain confidence and spending, which supports the economy. However, the hiring rate has slowed significantly, with an average of 116,000 jobs added monthly from June through August, marking the weakest three-month stretch since mid-2020.However, the economy has remained resilient, growing at a 3% annual pace from April to June, boosted by consumer spending and business investments. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta indicates a growth rate of 2.5% for the July-September quarter.Economic concerns weigh heavily on voters as the presidential election on November 5 approaches. While many Americans appreciate the job market's resilience, high prices continue to frustrate them, remaining approximately 19% above levels recorded in February 2021 when inflation began surging.","The US economy added 254,000 jobs last month, far surpassing expectations.

Dozens of PTI workers, including Imran’s sisters Aleema Khan, Naureen Khan and Uzma Khan, have been arrested amid intense tear gas shelling by police in Islamabad.Khan, meanwhile, called on his supporters again to reach Islamabad’s sealed D-Chowk, in front of parliament and the PM’s office, for a peaceful protest against a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at curtailing the judiciary’s independence. The planned constitutional amendment seems to extend the term of Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa.

The Pakistan government on Friday took measures to prevent supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan from holding a rally in Islamabad , seeking his release from prison.It would be the latest in a series of protest rallies since last month to press for Khan's release and agitate against the ruling coalition government, which Imran Khan's party calls illegitimate, saying it was formed after a fraudulent election.Shipping containers were placed on key roads and highways leading to the capital, and Internet services were suspended in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi .

Islamabad, In an effort to minimise administrative expenditures, cash-strapped Pakistan on Sunday announced to abolish about 150,000 government posts , close six ministries, and merge two others, as part of reforms agreed upon with the IMF under USD 7 billion loan deal . The International Monetary Fund on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to cut expenditures, increase tax-to GDP ratio, tax non-traditional sectors like agriculture and real estate, limit subsidies and transfer some fiscal responsibilities to provinces.Addressing the media on his return from the US, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that a programme had been finalised with the IMF, which would be the last programme for Pakistan.""We need to implement our policies to prove that it will be the last programme,"" he said, and emphasised that in order to join the G20, the economy must be formalised.The minister said right-sizing within ministries was going on and the decision to close six ministries is set to be implemented, while two ministries will be merged. ""Additionally, 150,000 posts across various ministries will be eliminated,"" Aurangzeb said.He dwelt at length on increasing tax revenues, noting that there were approximately 300,000 new taxpayers last year, and so far this year, 732,000 new taxpayers have registered, increasing the total number of taxpayers in the country from 1.6 million to 3.2 million.Aurangzeb also said that the non-filers category will be abolished and those not paying taxes will no longer be able to purchase property or vehicles.The minister claimed that the economy was moving in the right direction and the country's foreign exchange reserves had increased, reaching their highest level. He highlighted significant growth in both national exports and IT exports, and stated that investor confidence regarding the strength of the economy is a major success.Aurangzeb stated that the policy rate has been reduced by 4.5 per cent by the government after coming to power, and expressed optimism that the exchange rate and policy rate will remain as expected.""Our claim that the economy is improving is not a hollow claim because inflation has decreased due to government policies. Inflation has dropped to single digits,"" he said.Pakistan has been struggling to fix its economy for the last many years and it was close to default in 2023 but a timely loan of USD 3 billion by the IMF saved the situation.Pakistan has negotiated a long-term loan with the global lender with the hope and commitment that it would be the last loan. However, many doubt this claim as the country has already secured about two dozen loans from the Fund but failed to address the economy on a permanent basis.","Pakistan to abolish about 150,000 government posts, close six ministries, and merge two others.
