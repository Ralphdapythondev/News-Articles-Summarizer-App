"Xenophobia causing China, Japan & India’s ‘economic woes’: US Prez Biden",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/xenophobia-causing-china-japan-indias-economic-woes-us-prez-biden/articleshow/109799301.cms,"Biden was making broader point about US posture on immigration:

White House

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden has called Japan and India “xenophobic” countries that do not welcome immigrants , lumping the two with adversaries China and Russia as he tried to explain their economic circumstances and contrasted the four with the US on immigration .The US President made the controversial remark at a campaign fundraising event Wednesday evening.There was no immediate reaction from either the Japanese or Indian governments.Biden’s Xenophobia remark came just three weeks after the White House hosted Japanese PM Fumio Kishida for a lavish official visit, during which the two leaders celebrated what Biden called an “unbreakable alliance ,” particularly on global security matters. Japan is a critical US ally.The White House welcomed PM Narendra Modi for a state visit last summer. And India is a vital partner in the Indo-Pacific despite differences on human rights.At a hotel fundraiser where the donor audience was largely Asian-American, Biden said the upcoming US election was about “freedom, America and democracy” and that the nation’s economy was thriving “because of you and many others”. “Why? Because we welcome immigrants,” Biden said. “Look, think about it. Why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is Japan having trouble? Why is Russia? Why is India? Because they’re xenophobic. They don’t want immigrants.” The president added: “Immigrants are what makes us strong. Not a joke. That’s not hyperbole, because we have an influx of workers who want to be here and want to contribute.”White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Biden was making a broader point about the US posture on immigration. “Our allies and partners know well in tangible ways how Prez Biden values them, their friendship, their cooperation and the capabilities that they bring across the spectrum on a range of issues, not just security related,” Kirby said Thursday when asked about Biden’s “xenophobic” remarks. White House press secretary, Karine Jean Pierre, said, “The broader case that he was trying to make, which most leaders and allies across the globe understand that when it comes to who we are as a nation, we are a nation of immigrants. That is in our DNA. You have heard the prez say it, it makes us better, and we are stronger for it and that is a very important point to know.”",The US President made the controversial remark at a campaign fundraising event Wednesday evening. There was no immediate reaction from either the Japanese or Indian governments. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Biden was making a broader point about the US posture on immigration.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109799318,imgsize-27996,width-400,resizemode-4/109799318.jpg"
"Russia using chemical weapons in Ukraine, says US; Kremlin denies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russia-using-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine-says-us-kremlin-denies/articleshow/109799225.cms,"The US has accused Russia of using chemical weapons , including poison gas, “as a method of warfare” against Ukrainian forces, in violation of a global ban on the use of such weapons.The state department said in a statement on Wednesday that Russia had used chloropicrin , a “choking agent” widely used during World War I, as well as tear gas , against Ukrainian troops.The use of these gases in warfare is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, an arms control treaty ratified by more than 150 countries, including Russia. “The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident and is probably driven by Russian forces’ desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,” the state department said.The state department also said that the US would impose sanctions on three state entities linked to Russia’s chemical and biological weapons programmes and four companies that support them.Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the US, called the accusations that Russian forces had used chemical weapons “odious and unsubstantiated” in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow remained bound by its obligations under the treaty that bans chemical weapons. “As always, such announcements are absolutely unfounded... Russia has been and remains committed to its obligations under international law in this area,” he said.The Ukrainian authorities have reported hundreds of cases of suspected chemical weapons use on the battlefield by Russia since invasion began in Feb 2022. Lt. Col. Artem Vlasiuk, an expert in the Ukrainian army department that deals with nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological security, said that about 250 cases of suspected chemical weapons use by Russian forces had been reported in Feb, about five times the number in March 2023. He said that most of the chemical substances used in the attacks had been identified as CS gas, a tear gas commonly used by riot police to control crowds.Although govts use tear gas for domestic law-enforcement purposes, it is considered a chemical weapon when used in warfare, according to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Civilians can usually escape tear gas during protests, but soldiers in trenches have little choice but to flee under enemy fire or risk being suffocated.Gyunduz Mamedov, Ukraine ’s deputy prosecutor general, said last week that the Russian army had used tear gas against Ukrainian troops at least 900 times in the past six months, with more than 1,400 incidents reported since the start of the war. In addition to tear gas, the state department said that Russian forces had used chloropicrin, a choking agent that irritates the nose, throat and the lungs when inhaled and can cause nausea and vomiting. Ukrainian army officials have said that the chemicals are usually contained in grenades that Russian forces throw at Ukrainian positions, forcing soldiers out of their fortified positions.",The use of these gases in warfare is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The state department also said that the US would impose sanctions on three state entities linked to Russia’s chemical and biological weapons programmes.

"Russian troops enter base housing US military in Niger, US official says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russian-troops-enter-base-housing-us-military-in-niger-us-official-says/articleshow/109798716.cms,"WASHINTON: Russian military personnel have entered an air base in Niger that is hosting US troops, a senior US defense official told Reuters, a move that follows a decision by Niger's junta to expel US forces from the country.The military officers ruling the West African nation have told the US to withdraw its nearly 1,000 military personnel from the country, which until a coup last year had been a key partner for Washington's fight against insurgents who have killed thousands of people and displaced millions more.A senior US defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russian forces were not mingling with US troops but were using a separate hanger at Airbase 101, which is next to Diori Hamani International Airport in Niamey, Niger's capital.The move by Russia 's military puts US and Russian troops in close proximity at a time when the nations' military and diplomatic rivalry is increasingly acrimonious over the conflict in Ukraine.It also raises questions about the fate of US installations in the country following a withdrawal.""(The situation) is not great but in the short-term manageable,"" the official said.The Nigerien and Russian embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The US and its allies have been forced to move troops out of a number of African countries following coups that brought to power groups eager to distance themselves from Western governments. In addition to the impending departure from Niger, US troops have also left Chad in recent days, while French forces have been kicked out of Mali and Burkina Faso.At the same time, Russia is seeking to strengthen relations with African nations, pitching Moscow as a friendly country with no colonial baggage in the continent.Mali, for example, has in recent years become one of Russia's closest African allies, with the Wagner Group mercenary force deploying there to fight jihadist insurgents.Russia has described relations with the United States as ""below zero"" because of US military and financial aid for Ukraine in the war now approaching the end of its second year.The US official said Nigerien authorities had told President Joe Biden's administration that about 60 Russian military personnel would be in Niger, but the official could not verify that number.After the coup, the US military moved some of its forces in Niger from Airbase 101 to Airbase 201 in the city of Agadez. It was not immediately clear what US military equipment remained at Airbase 101.The United States built Airbase 201 in central Niger at a cost of more than $100 million. Since 2018 it has been used to target Islamic State and al Qaeda affiliate Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) fighters with armed drones.Washington is concerned about Islamic militants in the Sahel region, who may be able to expand without the presence of US forces and intelligence capabilities.Niger's move to ask for the removal of US troops came after a meeting in Niamey in mid-March, when senior US officials raised concerns including the expected arrival of Russia forces and reports of Iran seeking raw materials in the country, including uranium.While the US message to Nigerien officials was not an ultimatum, the official said, it was made clear US forces could not be on a base with Russian forces.""They did not take that well,"" the official said.A two-star US general has been sent to Niger to try and arrange a professional and responsible withdrawal.While no decisions have been taken on the future of US troops in Niger, the official said the plan was for them to return to US Africa Command's home bases, located in Germany.",Russian military personnel have entered an air base in Niger that is hosting US troops.

He warned that no attempt to create instability would be tolerated.“Let us all reject negative forces (a reference to critical voices) together and focus on Pakistan’s journey of development and stability,” he said.The Pakistan Supreme Court is currently hearing a case involving accusations levelled by six out of eight Islamabad high court judges of intimidation and interference by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), an organ of the army.The judges provided various examples of alleged interference, including a case concerning Imran Khan, and mentioned incidents where they said their relatives were abducted and tortured, and their homes secretly surveilled to coerce them into delivering favourable judgments.",Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir said on Thursday that the military was “well aware’ of its “constitutional limits” Gen Munir was quoted as talking about constitutional limits at a passing out parade at the Pakistan Air Force Academy in Risalpur.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109795052,imgsize-508829,width-400,resizemode-4/109795052.jpg"
"US judge questions DOJ, Google in antitrust trial",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-questions-doj-google-in-antitrust-trial/articleshow/109799335.cms,"WASHINGTON: A US judge on Thursday pushed against the central pleas of both US govt and Google lawyers as he heard closing arguments at a landmark antitrust trial . Federal judge Amit Mehta, whose decision is not expected until later in the year, raised his questions during two days of hearings that come six months after the conclusion of testimony.The case is the first of five major lawsuits by the US govt to reach trial, with Meta, Amazon, Apple and a separate case against Google also heading for federal court.The trial is the first time the US department of justice ( DoJ ) has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system. At the heart of the govt’s case is the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other firms to keep its search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products. In 2022, Google paid Apple $20 billion for the default status, documents unsealed this week showed.DoJ lawyers allege that Google achieved and perpetuated its dominance through these default deals that also expanded to Samsung and other device makers. But Mehta expressed doubts that the case had sufficiently demonstrated the negative consequences necessary to deem the deals anti-competitive according to US law and precedent. Mehta also said the Google case was very different from Microsoft’s as it did not involve agreements to outright exclude competing browsers and other products.He also poked holes in Google’s defence, wondering how any rival search engine could win access to default deals if the cost would require tens of billions of dollars.","The case is the first of five major lawsuits by the US govt to reach trial.

"In jobless Canada, student dreams end in debt and drugs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/in-jobless-canada-student-dreams-end-in-debt-and-drugs/articleshow/109742538.cms,"When the going gets tough, the young and restless look for a high elsewhere, just to stay afloat. This is the case for numerous students from various regions of India who have gone to Canada in pursuit of education and jobs. The unemployment crisis in the land they once hoped would offer prosperity and success has plunged many students into a perilous spiral of drug and alcohol abuse, alongside heightened levels of depression and a surge in therapy sessions, according to Canada-based counsellors TOI spoke with.The counsellors said students are turning to marijuana and cocaine, hallucinogenic drugs like Ecstasy, and opioids like Fentanyl as a coping mechanism against unemployment-induced stress. They reported a monthly average of five to eight cases over the past few months.One student from Badlapur in Maharashtra, currently in British Columbia’s Burnaby city for a degree in environmental science, said the realisation that even degree-holding seniors were relegated to paid-by-the-hour gig workers drove him to depression.“In my second semester, I saw seniors around me doing ad hoc jobs to get by. It stressed me out, and I started to believe I’d meet a similar fate. I started smoking, then alcohol, and eventually marijuana,” the 25-year-old said.After failing a semester, he sought professional help from a psychologist and is currently undergoing treatment. However, therapy sessions are expensive — each session ranging from Canadian $70 to $150 (Rs 4,249 to Rs 9000-odd) or more.“Earlier, addiction cases were predominantly among students from Punjab, Haryana, and Jharkhand. Now, we see students from Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana reaching out for help,” said a counsellor of Indian origin practising in Richmond, British Columbia. The counsellors chose to stay anonymous to respect the patient confidentiality agreement.There are currently around 3 lakh Indian students , according to Canadian Bureau for International Education. Many of them take loans, ranging from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 40 lakh on average, to enrol in universities and colleges in Canada. But the transition from campus to corporate life appears bleak as Canada’s unemployment rate stood at 6.1% in March.Still, students find ways to fund their addiction, including deceiving family members back home or working multiple odd jobs. “My former roommate has moved in with four others in a crammed accommodation. He stopped eating either at home or outside, works multiple shifts, and rides a bicycle to faraway locations,” said a 27-year-old in Vancouver. “Drug dealers extend credit, knowing they’d come back for more.”A counsellor from Delta, British Columbia, shared the story of a patient who had moved to Richmond from a town near Kolkata in 2021.“He finished his master’s degree in June 2023. Following that, he worked at a restaurant and a convenience store to cover his expenses. The frustration of being unable to support his family back home led him to recreational drugs,” the counsellor said.His addiction swirled out of control last year. “He stopped eating, left his jobs, and began ingesting drugs regularly. His roommates reached out to his distant cousin, who brought him to me. Since Dec 2023, he has been undergoing rehab,” the counsellor said.Many students are left vulnerable to self-harm. “I’ve had suicidal thoughts over the prospect of being unable to repay my loan. I searched for a job for six months. I couldn’t get one. So, I have moved in with my distant aunt because I can’t afford rent,” said Mahima Chaudhary, a computer science student in Surrey, British Columbia. She has no addiction-related issues, but struggles with stress. “I don’t have the funds for it,” said Mahima on seeking professional help for her mental health. “So, I’m relying on therapy provided by my college counsellor.”",Many students from various regions of India have gone to Canada in pursuit of education and jobs.

In the first three months of 2024 a total of 40,700 study visa applications were made, a fall of 44% compared to the same period the previous year when there were 72,800.Applications for dependant study visas fell by 80% from 32,900 in the first quarter of 2023 to just 6,700 in the same period in 2024.From Jan 1, 2024 most international students starting courses this year were prevented from bringing family members to Britain.“It is not surprising that there has been a decline in applications,” said Sanam Arora, founder and chair of National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK. “Students have exercised their choice and decided not to study in the UK. Given that higher education is one of our biggest exports, this will be quite a blow to UK universities.”Foreign students can also no longer switch to a work visa before completing their course. The home office has also commissioned the Migration Advisory Committee to carry out a review of the graduate visa, raising fears even this could get restricted, despite the two-year work opportunity being a major draw to Indians.There has been a 28% drop in the total number of applications for health and care visas , falling from 82,900 in the first quarter of 2023 to 59,500 in the same period in 2024.New measures to restrict care workers from bringing dependants came into force on March 11. This does not apply to doctors and nurses.The government has repeatedly said it wants to cut net immigration levels, estimated to be 672,000.Home secretary James Cleverly said: “This does not mark the end of the road in our plan to cut migration, there is more still to come.”This comes as the first failed asylum-seeker was sent to Rwanda on Monday and the home office started rounding up illegal migrants on Wednesday to detain them ahead of sending them there.","UK government's plan to cut legal migration appears to be working, new figures show.

Protesters and police shoved and scuffled as officers encountered resistance. Video showed police pulling off protesters' helmets and goggles as they were detained.With police helicopters hovering, the sound of flash-bangs - which produce a bright light and a loud noise to disorient and stun - pierced the air.Protesters chanted at the officers, ""Where were you last night?"" Late Tuesday, counterprotesters attack the encampment and the UCLA administration and campus police took hours to respond.Tent encampments of protesters calling on universities to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say support the war in Gaza have spread across campuses nationwide in a student movement unlike any other this century. The ensuing police crackdowns echoed actions decades ago against a much larger protest movement protesting the Vietnam War.They included a college professor from Illinois who said he suffered multiple broken ribs and a broken hand during a pro-Palestine protest on Saturday at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.Bystander video shows the arrest of Steve Tamari, a history professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. He seems to be moving in to take video or photos of protesters being detained when multiple officers roughly take him down.Tamari said in a statement Thursday that it was ""a small price to pay for Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza.""Officials at New York 's Stony Brook University on Long Island said 29 people were arrested early Thursday morning, including students, faculty members and others ""from outside our campus community.""In New York City, Fordham University officials said 15 people were arrested after pushing inside the lobby of a building on the school's campus at Lincoln Center.Seventeen people were arrested on criminal trespass charges Wednesday at the University of Texas at Dallas after demonstrators refused to comply with law enforcement orders to remove an encampment from the school's main walkway, a university spokeswoman said in a statement Thursday.Yale University police arrested four people, including two students, Wednesday night after around 200 demonstrators marched to the school president's home and the campus police department, school officials said. Protesters ignored repeated warnings that they cannot occupy parts of campus without permission, school officials said in a statement Thursday.The protest group Occupy Yale said campus police were violent during the arrests and did not issue warnings. The group posted a video on Instagram showing officers taking one person to the ground and pinning another to a sidewalk.""A peaceful protest,"" Occupy Yale said. ""Police officers seized, pushed, and brutalized people. Is this what you call keeping campus safe?""In Oregon, police began to clear pro-Palestinian rights demonstrators out of the Millar Library at Portland State University, which they have been occupying since Monday.They spray-painted graffiti inside and knocked over or piled up furniture to create barricades. Portland State said on social media Thursday that campus would remain closed because of the police activity.University President Ann Cudd said Wednesday that about 50 protesters vacated the library after administrators promised not to seek criminal charges, expulsion or other discipline if they left peacefully, but others - including non-students - remained. Portland police said Thursday that 15 police vehicles were set on fire overnight; it was not immediately clear if that was related to the protest.University of Minnesota officials meanwhile reached agreement with protesters to end an encampment on the Minneapolis campus. Interim President Jeff Ettinger said in an email Thursday to the campus community that protesters agreed not to disrupt final exams or commencement ceremonies. That followed similar agreements at Northwestern University in suburban Chicago and Brown University in Rhode Island.Meanwhile, Florida's state university chancellor has ordered campus presidents to take whatever steps necessary to prevent disruption of graduation ceremonies, including at large schools such as the University of Florida and Florida State University.Protests also sprung up off campuses. In Albuquerque on Thursday, about two dozen protesters sat in the middle of a roadway blocking access to a main gate at Kirtland Air Force Base. The group waved flags and vowed to ""shut everything down"" over the ongoing war in Gaza.The protests at UCLA appeared to be getting the most attention. Iranian state television carried live images of the police action, as did Qatar's pan-Arab Al Jazeera satellite network. Live images of Los Angeles also played across Israeli television networks.President Joe Biden on Thursday defended the students' right to peaceful protest but decried the disorder of recent days.Israel has branded the protests antisemitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers - some of whom are Jewish - call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war.California Highway Patrol officers poured into the UCLA campus by the hundreds early Thursday. Wearing face shields and protective vests, they held their batons out to separate them from demonstrators, who wore helmets and gas masks and chanted: ""You want peace. We want justice.""Police methodically ripped apart the encampment's barricade of plywood, pallets, metal fences and dumpsters, then pulled down dozens of canopies and tents. The number of protesters diminished through the morning, some leaving voluntarily with their hands up and others detained by police.The law enforcement presence and continued warnings contrasted with the scene Tuesday night, when counterdemonstrators attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, throwing traffic cones, releasing pepper spray and tearing down barriers. Fighting between the two sides continued for hours before police stepped in. No one was arrested, but at least 15 protesters were injured. Authorities' tepid response drew criticism from political leaders, Muslim students and advocacy groups.By Wednesday afternoon, a small city sprang up inside the reenforced encampment, with hundreds of people and tents on the quad. Demonstrators rebuilt the makeshift barriers around their tents while state and campus police watched.Some protesters said Muslim prayers as the sun set, while others chanted ""we're not leaving"" or passed out goggles and surgical masks. They wore helmets and headscarves, and discussed the best ways to handle pepper spray or tear gas as someone sang over a megaphone.Outside the encampment, a crowd of students, alumni and neighbours gathered on campus steps, joining in pro-Palestinian chants. A group of students holding signs and wearing T-shirts in support of Israel and Jewish people demonstrated nearby.The crowd grew as the night wore on as more and more officers poured onto campus.Ray Wiliani, who lives nearby, said he came to UCLA on Wednesday evening to support the pro-Palestinian demonstrators.""We need to take a stand for it,"" he said. ""Enough is enough.""California Gov. Gavin Newsom denounced the delayed law enforcement response on Tuesday and UCLA Chancellor Gene Block promised an investigation. The head of the University of California system, Michael Drake, ordered an ""independent review of the university's planning, its actions and the response by law enforcement.""""The community needs to feel the police are protecting them, not enabling others to harm them,"" Rebecca Husaini, chief of staff for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said during a news conference Wednesday.Meanwhile, police cleared protest encampments at schools across the US, resulting in arrests, or were closed up voluntarily. In New York, those included the City College of New York, Fordham University, Stony Brook University and the University of Buffalo. Others nationwide included the University of New Hampshire in Durham, Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, and Tulane University in New Orleans.On Tuesday night, police burst into a building occupied by war protesters at Columbia University, breaking up a demonstration that had paralyzed the school.Columbia's chapter of the American Association of University Professors condemned the school's leadership on Thursday for asking New York police to remove the protesters. The chapter said ""the horrific police attack on our students"" is now ""shamefully on view for the whole world to see.""At the University of Wisconsin in Madison, a scrum broke out early Wednesday after police with shields removed all but one tent and shoved protesters. Four officers were injured. Four people were charged with battering law enforcement.The nationwide campus demonstrations began at Columbia on April 17 to protest Israel's offensive in Gaza, following Hamas' deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Health Ministry there.US college campuses have become a flashpoint, with school leaders facing intense scrutiny over their handling of allegations of antisemitism and the right to free speech. The presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania resigned following questions at a congressional hearing about whether calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school's conduct policy.","At least 200 people were arrested at UCLA on Thursday, bringing the nationwide total of arrests to more than 2,000. Police removed barricades and began dismantling demonstrators' fortified encampment at UCLA after hundreds of protesters defied orders to leave. The arrests came after officers spent hours threatening arrests over loudspeakers if people did not disperse.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109795778,imgsize-113106,width-400,resizemode-4/109795778.jpg"

Landmark Google antitrust case ready to conclude,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/landmark-google-antitrust-case-ready-to-conclude/articleshow/109791815.cms,"WASHINGTON: Lawyers for both the Department of Justice and Google will present arguments on Thursday and Friday to conclude the biggest antitrust case in a quarter century. In closing arguments of a Washington , DC, trial that began last September, regulators will apply the finishing touches to a case alleging Google has turned its search engine into an illegal monopoly that stifles competition and innovation.Regulators claim that Google competed unfairly when it made lucrative deals with Apple and other companies to automatically lock its search engine into smartphones and web browsers. Meanwhile, Google maintains that consumers use its dominant search engine because it is the best available option.""Google pays more than USD 10 billion per year for these privileged positions,'' argued Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department's lead litigator, last September. ""Google's contracts ensure that rivals cannot match the search quality ad monetisation, especially on phones.""Prabhakar Raghavan, Google's senior vice president for knowledge and information products, said during testimony last October that the company's success is precarious and said its leadership fears their product could slide into irrelevance with younger internet users as technology evolves. He said the company has been tagged with the disparaging moniker ""Grandpa Google"" among younger demographics who don't see it as an interesting product.""Grandpa Google knows the answers and will help you with homework,"" Raghavan said. ""But when it comes to doing interesting things, they like to start elsewhere.""After the closing arguments in the Justice Department's antitrust case against Google wrap up this week, US District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to issue his ruling in the late summer or early autumn. If he decides Google broke the law, another trial will determine how to rein in its market power.The case against Google mirrors the one brought against Microsoft in many ways, including the existential threat it poses to a renowned tech giant whose products are relied on by billions of people.","The case against Google mirrors the one brought against Microsoft in many ways, including the existential threat it poses to a renowned tech giant whose products are relied on by billions of people.

How police took down the UCLA protest camp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-police-took-down-the-ucla-protest-camp/articleshow/109792635.cms,"LOS ANGELES: As protesters chanted and sprayed fire extinguishers at them, police officers moved in on the pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA in the early hours of Thursday, tearing down its barricades, arresting dozens of people and clearing out the tents that had dominated the center of campus for days.The chaotic scenes were part of a tense, hourslong back-and-forth between protesters and police that had been building after violent clashes a day earlier — involving counterprotesters who attacked the encampment — prompted administrators to call in law enforcement.On Wednesday night, authorities issued a warning to pro-Palestinian demonstrators : Leave the encampment outside Royce Hall or face arrest.As the night wore on, officers in riot gear tried to approach the encampment through one of its entrances but were turned back several times.Demonstrators appeared to try several tactics to fend them off. At one point, they blocked an entrance with wooden pallets and homemade shields. They surrounded police officers, chanting “Free, free Palestine!” and “Peaceful protest!” At another point, they opened umbrellas and began flashing lights and taking photos of the police officers.Then, around 3 a.m. Thursday, officers breached one of the barricades at the encampment and began to pull apart plywood and other materials that demonstrators had used to build a wall. Some demonstrators sprayed fire extinguishers in response, briefly forcing some officers to fall back.But an hour into the raid, the encampment’s main barricade had been dismantled. A line of students linking arms took its place.Officers gave another dispersal warning to protesters. They corralled those who refused to leave and began arresting them, zip-tying their wrists and leading them away from the encampment.Police pulled up tents — one removed a Palestinian flag and tossed it aside — and at several points fired devices at demonstrators. It was not clear what the officers were using, but Erik Larsen, an officer for the California Highway Patrol, said in a telephone interview that its officers were equipped with a variety of “nonlethal” tools, including flash-bang devices.By dawn, the camp had been cleared of all but a final group of demonstrators, some of whom chanted, “We’ll be back, and we’ll be stronger — you cannot ignore us any longer.” Some were detained and marched away with their hands zip-tied behind their back.The CHP — which, in addition to patrolling state highways is responsible for safekeeping state property, including public universities such as UCLA — said that 132 demonstrators had been arrested and would be handed over to the university’s police department. At least 250 CHP officers were involved in clearing the encampment, Larsen said.Other law enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and the UCLA police, were also on the scene, he said.","The California Highway Patrol said 132 demonstrators had been arrested and would be handed over to the university’s police department.

He meticulously documented his findings, including improperly drilled holes in the aft pressure bulkhead, a component crucial for maintaining cabin pressure.In April 2023, Spirit terminated Dean's employment, a move he believed was in retaliation for exposing the plane's flaws.The timing of Dean's demise echoes that of Barnett, who took his own life in March while involved in a lawsuit alleging retaliation for disclosing safety concerns related to the 787 Dreamliner.Former Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour recently testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill, shedding light on a culture within Boeing that allegedly prioritizes pushing flawed components despite safety risks. Salehpour, with 17 years of Boeing experience, turned whistleblower after facing repercussions for raising safety issues regarding the popular 787 Dreamliner and 777 aircraft.While Boeing acknowledged the presence of imperfections, it emphasized ongoing efforts toward improvement. Boeing contested Salehpour's assertions regarding the Dreamliner's safety, citing extensive testing purportedly demonstrating no signs of fatigue.","Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, passed away at the age of 45 on Tuesday.

The case, which has shocked the nation, centers around a disturbing video that emerged during the trial, revealing harrowing details of alleged child abuse .Appearing in court on Tuesday, Gregor stands accused of forcing Corey to run on a treadmill, purportedly because the child was deemed ""too fat."" If convicted, Gregor could face a life sentence behind bars, according to a report from NY Post.The Superior Court in Ocean City was shown surveillance footage depicting Gregor compelling Corey to run on the treadmill, despite the child's repeated falls due to the machine's excessive speed. The incident occurred on March 20, 2021, at the Atlantic Heights Clubhouse fitness centre.In the video obtained by CourtTV.com, Gregor is seen adjusting the treadmill's settings, pushing the limits of the machine as Corey struggles to keep pace. The distressing footage captures the child falling multiple times, with Gregor forcefully placing him back on the moving track, even appearing to bite Corey's head at one point.The emotional toll of the trial was evident as Corey's mother, Bre Micciolo, took the stand, tearfully watching the horrifying events unfold on screen.Disturbingly, days before Corey's tragic death, Bre Micciolo had reported her son's injuries to the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency, urging Gregor to seek medical attention for their son. Corey reportedly revealed to doctors that his father made him run on the treadmill because he was ""too fat.""Tragically, Corey's health deteriorated rapidly, and on April 2, 2021, he was rushed to the hospital after exhibiting alarming symptoms, including stumbling, slurred speech, and respiratory distress.

A forensic pathologist, Dr. Thomas Andrew, concluded that Corey had suffered from acute traumatic injuries, ultimately leading to his demise.Gregor's arrest in July 2021 on child neglect charges was followed by further scrutiny, culminating in his arrest on March 9, 2022, for Corey's death.

According to the poll, 58% of respondents believe that the Chinese government uses the popular short-video app to influence American views , while only 13% disagreed with this assertion.Amid these concerns, the US government is moving closer to possibly banning TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance.The debate intensified last week when President Joe Biden signed a law mandating ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within 270 days or face a prohibition. This legislation reflects bipartisan apprehension about the app's potential as a vehicle for foreign influence and data security threats.""TikTok has spent more than $1.5 billion on data security efforts and would not share data on its 170 million US users with the Chinese government,"" the company said, denying any promotion or removal of content at Beijing's request. TikTok further declared its intention to challenge any ban as a breach of free speech rights under the US Constitution, noting past legal successes where a judge in Montana blocked a state-level ban on the app citing free speech concerns.Despite TikTok's assurances, the poll indicates that half of the American adults surveyed support a ban, while 32% are opposed, and the remainder are undecided. The support for a ban is stronger among Americans aged 40 and older, with about 60% in favor, compared to roughly 40% of younger adults aged between 18 and 39.Moreover, 46% of respondents also concurred with the view that China uses TikTok for espionage activities on ordinary Americans, a claim repeatedly denied by Beijing.The app's pervasive influence in America is evident, with even Biden's re-election campaign utilizing it as a strategic tool to engage voters for the upcoming presidential election. The issue has created a split among political figures, including former President Donald Trump, who criticized the potential ban despite owning a competing platform, Truth Social.As the January 19 deadline for TikTok’s sale approaches—one day before Biden's term could end—the future of the app in the US remains uncertain, with potential legal and political battles ahead.",A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has highlighted a growing perception among Americans that TikTok is being used by China to manipulate US public opinion. 58% of respondents believe that the Chinese government uses the popular short-video app to influence American views.

According to Pakistan’s Institute Of Space Technology (IST), the moon-bound spacecraft is a lunar cubesat , designated ICube Qamar ( ICUBE-Q ), with a three-month mission span.The mission is a collaborative effort of IST’s faculty and students, Pakistan’s national space agency Suparco and China’s Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).In 2022, China National Space Agency (CNSA) had offered member-states a unique opportunity through Asia Pacific Space Cooperation Organisation (APSCO) to send a student-built payload to the moon on board the Change’6 mission. Pakistan’s ICUBE-Q was selected.According to IST, ICUBE-Q weighs approximately 7kg and is equipped with two optical cameras to capture the lunar surface.

IMF approves last tranche of $3-billion loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-approves-last-tranche-of-3-billion-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/109738150.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism Tuesday regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country, saying it would bolster economic stability . Pakistan is now eyeing a new, longer and larger economic bailout package, but economists cautioned against the country’s continued reliance on overseas financial assistance, warning of potential dire consequences.IMF approved the immediate release of the tranche following a key meeting of the global lender’s executive board in Washington late Monday night.All board members favoured releasing the funds, except India, which abstained.Pakistan has been reeling from a severe economic crisis for more than two years, with its inflation at one point shooting up to nearly 38% and its foreign currency reserves depleted to $3bn in Feb 2023, enough to cover less than five weeks of imports.Last year, the global lender had approved a nine-month standby arrangement with Pakistan “to support its economic stabilisation programme”. The approval had allowed for an immediate disbursement of $1.2bn, with the rest phased over the programme’s duration — subject to two quarterly reviews.The IMF bailout proved important to save the country from default, the state broadcaster quoted PM Sharif as saying.Leading economist Qaiser Bengali expressed scepticism about the perceived stability, highlighting the temporary nature of the current situation and underscoring the necessity of meaningful reforms to address long-term economic challenges.“If the so-called stability was due to a rise in exports or better inflow of dollars, that would have been meaningful, but that is not happening,” Bengali said, adding that the economy cannot run on a policy of getting new loans to pay past loans.Pakistan’s external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.","PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country.

The pre-action letter sent on Monday outlines his civil claim for damages for harassment abroad, physical injury, trespass to the person, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.“While in office, Shahzad highlighted army and ISI interference with his accountability and anti-corruption objectives. Believing that he could not fix the rampant corruption in Pakistan, he resigned from Khan’s government in Jan 2022,” a spokesperson for UK law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Akbar, said. On April 17, 2022, he fled to London.“He continues to campaign against corruption in Pakistan and remains highly critical of the military establishment and govt officials,” the spokesperson added.Akbar said: “Compared to what was done to me, I believe a lot worse is being inflicted on dissidents in Pakistan by the current regime. They are targeting political workers, lawyers, judges andjournalists. However, what should be most alarming is that Pakistan is able to target its dissidents on British soil without any accountability.”A spokesperson for Hertfordshire constabulary confirmed to TOI it was investigating the acid attack and was appealing for witnesses and to trace the motorbike the suspects rode. No arrests have been made.The Pakistan high commission in London said: “The govt rejects all such attempts to malign the reputation of its institutions for motivated agendas.”A spokesperson for the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said last Dec, when asked about the attack: “We reject any insinuations of Pakistan's involvement and that of Pakistani agencies in such a heinous attack. It is not our policy to target our own nationals abroad. We hope that culprits in this case will be identified and treated as per UK law.”","Shahzad Akbar (46), a Pakistani citizen who fled to Britain after Khan was ousted, was nearly blinded in the attack in front of his young child at their home in Royston, Hertfordshire.

At the age of 73, Dar, a chartered accountant and experienced politician from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, was named deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday, with the appointment taking immediate effect and until further notice.Shehbaz Sharif and Dar are currently in Saudi Arabia for the World Economic Forum's (WEF) special meeting.According to the Dawn newspaper, Dar's new appointment ""took many by surprise, but drew hardly any criticism from its allies'.Dar being ""awarded' the ""rarely filled' slot of deputy prime minister has raised many questions, the report said.The main talking point is that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif wants to have his ""confidant' in a key position in the federal cabinet to ""compensate him for the loss of the finance portfolio', it said.The report mentioned that the action was also viewed in connection with Nawaz Sharif assuming leadership of the ruling PML-N party as its president, a position he had been deprived of after being convicted in the Panama Papers case.Dar is seen as having a close relationship with Nawaz Sharif because of the family connection through marriage, as his son is married to the elder Sharif's daughter.An insider claimed that the move to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister was ""pre-planned', the report said. During the formation of the coalition government, it was agreed that Dar would serve as the Deputy Prime Minister.However, based on a report from Geo News, the decision to appoint a four-time finance minister as the foreign minister indicates an increased focus on economics in the country's diplomacy as the financially struggling nation aims to obtain another deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and strengthen external financing from foreign capitals.Dar was the finance minister from 1998 to 1999 and then again from March to May 2008. He once more headed the finance ministry from 2013 to 2017 and later from 2022 to 2023. He additionally worked as the minister for industry and investment from February 1997 to July 1997, and also in commerce from December 1997 to October 1999.According to the report from Dawn, during Nawaz Sharif's tenure as the prime minister, Dar served as the de facto deputy prime minister, leading numerous government and parliamentary committees in the capacity of chairperson. Even though the Constitution does not include a provision for a deputy prime minister, Dar is the second legislator to assume this role.Chaudhry Parvez Elahi served as Deputy Prime Minister when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was in power from June 25, 2012, to June 29, 2013. During that period, his responsibilities were largely symbolic, and he was given recognition by then-President Asif Ali Zardari for his support of the government led by the PPP.Elahi is currently serving as the president of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party led by the jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, and he is in prison due to corruption allegations.Interestingly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the main ally of the PML-N-led government, did not raise any objection to Dar's new appointment. The PPP Information Secretary, Faisal Karim Kundi, stated that his party had no objections to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister. ""It is the PM's prerogative to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister,"" he said, adding that the move was not meant as a ""message' to anyone.Meanwhile, Khan's PTI on Monday reacted strongly to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister, saying ""Sharifs are distributing key national posts within the family'.""The Sharif family is distributing important national posts among themselves,"" Special Assistant to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister For Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said.The PTI leader criticized the federal government for appointing individuals to high-ranking positions instead of addressing the problems faced by the people as the Constitution does not provide for the position of deputy PM.Reacting to Dar's appointment, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob termed the PM Shehbaz Sharif-led government's move ""an extra-constitutional step that carries no substantial value'.""This just indicates intra-party tensions and competition for influence.

The Islamic State group says it was behind a mosque attack in Afghanistan that killed 6 people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/the-islamic-state-group-says-it-was-behind-a-mosque-attack-in-afghanistan-that-killed-6-people/articleshow/109759726.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a deadly shooting this week targeting members of the country's minority Shiite community inside a mosque in western Afghanistan that killed six people. The militant group said in a statement posted on its Telegram website late on Tuesday that one of its members attacked a ""Shiite temple"" in Herat province with machine-gun fire.The attack, which took place on Monday night in the district of Guzara, also left one person wounded.The attacker fled the scene. The Taliban Interior Ministry has said that an investigation is underway.Local media reported that the mosque's imam was among those killed. The UN mission in Afghanistan condemned the attack, saying a child was among the victims. It called for urgent accountability for perpetrators and protection measures for Shiite communities.Afghanistan's former President Hamid Karzai said on the social media platform X that he considered""this terrorist act against all religious and human standards.""Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry said on Wednesday that ""the people and government of Pakistan extend their heartfelt condolences to the people of Afghanistan.""""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families in this hour of grief,"" it said.The statement added that Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms.The IS affiliate in Afghanistan is a major Taliban rival and frequently targets schools, hospitals, mosques and Shiite areas throughout the country.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, during the last weeks of the chaotic departure of US and Nato troops from the country after 20 years of war.Despite initial promises of a more moderate stance, the Taliban gradually reimposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, as they did during their previous rule of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.","Islamic State group claims responsibility for deadly shooting at mosque in Afghanistan.

Explosion in Cambodia that killed 20 at an army base was likely caused by mishandling of ammunition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/explosion-in-cambodia-that-killed-20-at-an-army-base-was-likely-caused-by-mishandling-of-ammunition/articleshow/109724952.cms,"PHNOM PENH: A huge explosion in southwestern Cambodia over the weekend that killed 20 soldiers at an army base appears to have been an accident caused by mishandling of ammunition by troops, a senior military official said Tuesday.The Saturday afternoon blast in Kampong Speu province also destroyed military vehicles and four buildings at the base, and damaged homes in a nearby village.Army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Mao Phalla said the soldiers were transferring ammunition from trucks into a storage facility when the blast occurred, killing them instantly. He said another 11 people, including soldiers and nearby villagers, were slightly injured, mostly from debris from the damaged buildings, not shrapnel.Cambodia held a mass funeral on Sunday for those killed in the explosion.The initial but still not official theory was that the soldiers were unloading ammunition from a truck and stacking it on the ground before moving it into the storage facility, causing one item to explode, he said. That set off a chain reaction, added Mao Phalla.However, he said it will be difficult to determine the exact chain of events as all those involved in the unloading were killed.Mao Phalla said the site has been sealed off and that deminers from theCambodian Mines Action Center were clearing the area any unexploded ordnance.In March 2005, a nighttime blast at an arms depot in the northwestern provincial town of Battambang triggered an hourslong spray of shells and bullets that killed at least six people and caused panic.A 2014 report by the Swiss-based group Small Arms Survey highlighted the dangers of poorly stored or mishandled munitions, calling it a ""global problem."" It noted that from 1979 through 2013 there were more than 500 incidents involving unplanned explosions at munitions sites.","The Saturday afternoon blast in Kampong Speu province also destroyed military vehicles and four buildings at the base.

From spring offensive to charm offensive: The Taliban are working to woo tourists to Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-spring-offensive-to-charm-offensive-the-taliban-are-working-to-woo-tourists-to-afghanistan/articleshow/109713887.cms,"KABUL: Around 30 men are crammed into a Kabul classroom, part of the debut student cohort at a Taliban-run institute training tourism and hospitality professionals.It's a motley crew. One student is a model. Another is 17 and has no job history.The students vary in age, education level and professional experience. They're all men - Afghan women are banned from studying beyond sixth grade - and they don't know anything about tourism or hospitality.But they are all eager to promote a different side of Afghanistan . And the Taliban are happy to help.Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife.And yet, foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence, increased flight connections with hubs like Dubai, and the bragging rights that come with vacationing in an unusual destination. The numbers aren't huge - they never were - but there's a buzz around Afghan tourism.In 2021, there were 691 foreign tourists . In 2022, that figure rose to 2,300. Last year, there were 7,000.Mohammad Saeed, the head of the Tourism Directorate in Kabul, said the biggest foreign visitor market is China because of its proximity and large population. Afghanistan also has advantages over some of its neighbors.""They've told me they don't want to go to Pakistan because it's dangerous and they get attacked. The Japanese have said this to me also,"" Saeed said. ""This is good for us.""But there are disadvantages, too.Visas are difficult and expensive to access. Many countries severed ties with Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power, and no country recognizes them as the legitimate rulers of the country.Afghan embassies either closed or suspended their operations. There's an ongoing power struggle between Afghanistan's embassies and consulates staffed by people from the former Western-backed administration, and those under the Taliban administration's full control.Saeed concedes there are obstacles for Afghan tourism to develop but said he was working with ministries to overcome them.His ultimate aim is to have a visa on arrival for tourists, but that could be years away. There are problems with the road network, which is half-paved or non-existent in some parts of the country, and airlines largely avoid Afghan airspace.The capital Kabul has the most international flights, but no Afghan airport has direct routes with major tourist markets like China, Europe, or India.Despite the challenges, Saeed wants Afghanistan to become a tourism powerhouse, an ambition that appears to be backed by the Taliban's top leaders.""I have been sent to this department on the instructions of the elders (ministers). They must trust me because they've sent me to this important place.""The students also have aspirations. The model, Ahmed Massoud Talash, wants to learn about Afghanistan's picturesque spots for Instagram posts and its history for media appearances.Business school graduate Samir Ahmadzai wants to open a hotel but thinks he should know more about tourism and hospitality first.""They hear that Afghanistan is backwards, poverty and all about war,"" said Ahmadzai. ""We have 5,000 years of history. There should be a new page of Afghanistan.""Classes include Afghan handicrafts and anthropology basics.An unofficial subject is how to interact with foreign women and how their behavior or habits could clash with local customs and edicts. Examples might be women smoking or eating in public, to mixing freely with men who are not related to them by blood or marriage.The Taliban have imposed a dress code for women and requirements for them to have a male guardian, or mahram, when they travel. Dining alone, traveling alone, and socializing with other women in public have become harder. With gyms closed to women and beauty salons banned, there are fewer places where they can meet outside the home.In a sign that the country is preparing for more overseas visitors, the country's only five-star hotel, the Serena, has reopened its women's spa and salon for foreign females after a monthslong closure.Foreigners must show their passport to access services. Women with ""born in Afghanistan"" on their ID are barred.The restrictions on Afghan women and girls weigh on overseas travel companies, who say they try to focus on the positive aspect of cultural interactions by making donations, supporting local projects or only visiting family-run businesses.Shane Horan, the founder of Rocky Road Travel, said visiting Afghanistan should not be seen as an endorsement of any particular government or political regime.""Ultimately, the goal should be to support responsible tourism practices that contribute positively to the local economy and foster mutual respect and understanding, while also remaining cognizant of the broader political context in Afghanistan.""He said there was no input from authorities about what tour groups saw or did, and that the company worked closely with a women's rights organization in Afghanistan. A percentage of the tour cost went into supporting this organization's programs, Horan added.There are no women at the Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. The students don't mention it. But an official at the Tourism Directorate does.""It's a heartbreaking situation,"" said the official, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""Even female family members ask if they can study here. But there was a change in policy with the change in government. The women who were studying before (the takeover) never came back. They never graduated.""","Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife. But foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109714068,imgsize-1602274,width-400,resizemode-4/109714068.jpg"
