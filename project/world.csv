Crash circumstances

Potential causes and expert opinions

Weather conditions:

Engine failure:

Multiple factors:

An ATR-72 turboprop operated by regional carrier Voepass crashed in a residential area near Sao Paulo on Friday, resulting in the deaths of all 62 passengers. The aircraft was en route from Cascavel to Sao Paulo when it went down around 1:30 pm local time in Vinhedo, roughly 80 km (50 miles) northwest of the city.Brazil's aviation accident investigation center, Cenipa, has recovered the plane's black box, which includes crucial voice recordings and flight data.A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, according to Cenipa's head. The aircraft reportedly lost radar contact at 1:22 pm after failing to respond to communication attempts, with no emergency signals sent by the crew.Witness videos show clear skies before the plane began a spiraling descent. Experts are now scrutinizing several factors to determine the cause of the crash.US aviation safety expert Anthony Brickhouse noted that investigators will examine the weather conditions and the aircraft's engine and control systems. Preliminary analyses suggest ice buildup could have played a role. Voepass had predicted ice at the altitude where the plane was flying, though it was expected to be manageable. Brazilian aviation engineer Celso Faria de Souza is inclined to believe ice was a significant factor based on video evidence. ATR-72 planes have had past issues with icing, including a fatal 1994 crash in Indiana and a 2016 incident in Norway.MIT professor John Hansman reviewed footage of the crash and suggested that engine failure, rather than weather, might be to blame. He proposed that a malfunction on one side of the engine could have led to the plane's downward rotation if not properly managed by the crew.Robert A Clifford, an attorney who has handled similar cases, pointed out that air crashes often result from a combination of factors, including ice, engine failure, and human error.As the investigation continues, authorities and experts will work to piece together the exact circumstances leading to this tragic event.","The ATR-72 turboprop crashed in a residential area near Sao Paulo on Friday, resulting in the deaths of all 62 passengers.

TikTok’s ‘Underconsumption Core’ trend goes viral: Everything you need to know about this social media sensation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktoks-underconsumption-core-trend-goes-viral-everything-you-need-to-know-about-this-social-media-sensation/articleshow/112453522.cms,"TikTok’s ‘ underconsumption core ’ trend represents a significant shift in social media behavior, emphasizing minimalist living and sustainability over consumer excess. As the cost of living rises and social media continues to flood users with advertising and trends centered around material wealth, many young adults in the US are turning towards this new movement.This movement advocates for sustainable living , repurposing items, and focusing on quality over quantity, diverging sharply from the consumerism often showcased online.Kara Perez, a financial influencer, highlighted the growing dissatisfaction with constant consumer pressures. “When every moment of your life feels like you're being sold something and the price of said item keeps going up, people will burn out on spending money,” she was quoted by AFP as saying. This trend is gaining traction as individuals seek alternatives to the excess and materialism frequently promoted on platforms like TikTok.The ""underconsumption core"" trend emphasizes making do with what one already has and living more sustainably. This shift stands in stark contrast to the opulence often depicted by influencers on social media. Perez, who repurposes everyday items like jars for practical use, is part of this growing movement.TikTok user loveofearthco’s video, which critiques the culture of overconsumption, has amassed over 100,000 views. The video reflects a growing awareness of the pitfalls of excessive spending: “I spent money I didn’t have on things I didn’t need.”The US economy, while showing record corporate profits, has not alleviated the financial strain felt by many, especially younger generations. Culture analyst Tariro Makoni noted that this economic disparity can feel misleading. “It feels almost 'gaslighty' to consumers,” she said, suggesting that BNPL plans might exacerbate overconsumption and skew perceptions of financial stability.A recent surge in searches for ""underconsumption"" and related terms reflects a shift in priorities. The trend aligns with broader economic concerns, as many young adults face challenges in keeping up with social media-driven consumption patterns.Andrea Cheong, a UK-based influencer, observed that social media pressure can drive compulsive spending. Her recent video on mending old clothes exemplifies the ""underconsumption core"" approach, emphasizing sustainability and authenticity over fleeting trends.Ashley Ross of Bank of America noted that the ""underconsumption"" trend offers a practical way for Gen Z to manage their finances and adopt environmentally friendly practices. A 2024 survey found that high living costs are a major barrier for over half of Gen Z adults, underscoring the relevance of this movement.As the trend gains momentum, it reflects a broader cultural shift towards sustainability and mindful consumption. Anjali Zielinski’s participation in a ""Mending 101"" workshop with her daughter highlights how this approach resonates across generations. By teaching the value of preserving and repurposing items, Zielinski embodies the principles of ""underconsumption core,"" demonstrating that sustainable choices can span age groups and lifestyles.",TikTok’s ‘ underconsumption core ’ trend represents a significant shift in social media behavior.

MOSCOW: Kyiv and Moscow traded blame on Sunday after a fire broke out at a cooling tower of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, under the control of Russian forces.Ukraine , Russia and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said there had been no detected spike in radiation levels or any impact on nuclear safety.A Moscow-installed official, Vladimir Rogov, said the blaze at a cooling tower has been ""completely extinguished"" in a Telegram post Monday.He and Yevgeny Balitsky, the Moscow-installed governor of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region, blamed ""Ukrainian armed forces"" for the incident.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a social media post that ""Russian occupiers have started a fire"" at the plant, accusing them of trying to ""blackmail"" Kyiv.""Currently, radiation levels are within the norm,"" he added. Balitsky and the facility's press service also reported the ""radiation background"" around the facility was normal.""No impact has been reported for nuclear safety,"" the IAEA, which has experts stationed at the plant, said.""IAEA experts witnessed strong dark smoke coming from ZNPP's northern area following multiple explosions heard in the evening,"" the UN agency said in a post on social media platform X.It said the plant had reported to them an ""alleged drone attack today on one of the cooling towers"".In a later statement, the IAEA said it had requested that its team get ""immediate access to the cooling tower to assess the damage"".Kyiv has accused Russia of purposefully starting the fire.""Russia must be held accountable for this. Only Ukrainian control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant can guarantee a return to normalcy and complete safety,"" Zelensky said.Ukraine's interior minister said Kyiv was ""intensively monitoring"" radiation levels from nearby meteorological stations.All six of its reactors are currently in cold shutdown, the plant's press service said after the incident.""There is no threat of a steam explosion or any other consequences,"" Balitsky said.A video published by Zelensky showed black smoke billowing out of one of the station's cooling towers as red flames licked around the bottom.Russia seized control of the plant just days after it launched its full-scale military offensive in February 2022.The site is on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river -- a de facto front line snaking through southern Ukraine.Ukraine controls the opposite bank and Russia has repeatedly accused its forces of deliberately shelling the nuclear power station -- claims denied by Ukraine.Kyiv, in turn, has accused Moscow of militarising the facility, including by placing heavy weapons there at the start of the conflict.The IAEA has repeatedly urged restraint, saying it fears reckless military action could trigger a major nuclear accident at the plant.","Ukraine, Russia and the International Atomic Energy Agency say there had been no detected spike in radiation levels or any impact on nuclear safety.

"US elections: How will 40,000 black men’s support impact Kamala Harris’ campaign?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-how-will-40000-black-mens-support-impact-kamala-harris-campaign/articleshow/112453301.cms,"A day after Vice President Kamala Harris declared her intention to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, over 40,000 Black men participated in a virtual fundraising call, exploring the critical support they could offer her campaign.The four-hour call featured influential Black figures, including politicians, activists, and entertainers, who discussed the challenges Harris would face, particularly the anticipated racist and sexist attacks from opponents.Many participants shared personal stories of their relationships with Harris and pledged their support.Kwame Raoul, Illinois Attorney General, addressed a crucial issue: “Sometimes as Black men we get confused as to what strength is, and sometimes we think that standing behind a Black woman as a leader does not display strength as Black men.” Raoul emphasized that supporting Harris demonstrates strength, not weakness. “I’m standing behind a Black woman to be president of the United States, and it doesn’t make me any less of a Black man,” he asserted, reported NYT.The call underscored the importance of rallying support from a key Democratic constituency—Black men—who have historically been skeptical of Black women in high-ranking positions. Although Black men have reliably supported Democrats, some remain hesitant to back Black women for top roles, a trend with potential implications for Harris' bid.Moya Bailey, a Northwestern University professor, highlighted the unique challenges faced by Black women in leadership roles. “Patriarchy is not unique to the Black population, but the consequences are much higher,” she was quoted as saying by NYT, pointing to a historical reluctance among some Black men to support Black female leaders.The call’s tone resonated with past efforts by Black female politicians like Shirley Chisholm and Stacey Abrams, who faced similar skepticism. Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress, encountered resistance from Black male colleagues when she sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972. Abrams’ “Stacey and the Fellas” gatherings aimed to address concerns about her support among Black men during her 2022 gubernatorial run in Georgia.Harris faces additional challenges stemming from her past as a prosecutor, which has led to criticism from some Black men who feel disillusioned by the Democratic Party’s actions on their priorities. Polls have shown a disconnect between Black voters and the Democratic Party, with some Black men voting for Trump in recent elections.Harris' campaign advisers recognize that Trump’s appeal to Black men could impact their support for Harris. Trump has made contentious claims, including that Harris recently began identifying as Black for political gain. This rhetoric, along with Trump’s marketing strategies, has further complicated Harris' efforts to connect with Black male voters.Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, urged Black men to support Harris, emphasizing her qualifications and experience. “An African American male has to talk in the community to African American women about why he would pick Trump over an African American woman,” Morial said.While Harris has made strides in engaging Black men, including organizing meetings with leaders and addressing their concerns, W. Mondale Robinson, founder of the Black Male Voter Project, noted ongoing challenges. “Everything she says will be looked at with a side eye from Black men because there’s a lack of trust in politicians,” Robinson said.Despite these hurdles, some observers believe Harris' candidacy represents progress. Jason Nichols, a senior lecturer in African American studies, noted that while Black men might not see themselves as clearly in Harris as they did in Barack Obama, they recognize the significance of her candidacy. “You see the community coming together to vote their best interest — which, in this case, is a Black woman,” Nichols said.","Over 40,000 Black men participated in a virtual fundraising call, exploring the critical support they could offer Vice President Kamala Harris.

Often called ""tidal waves,"" tsunamis are among the most powerful natural disasters in recorded human history. In contrast to ordinary ocean waves, tsunamis are caused by abrupt, large-scale events in or close to a body of water, such landslides, undersea earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions. These disturbances produce waves that move across oceans with enormous force and speed, becoming taller as they get closer to shallow coastal regions.The sheer force of tsunamis has the potential to completely destroy infrastructure, wreak havoc on coastal populations, and result in a high death toll. Because of their unparalleled devastation, several tsunamis have left enduring impressions on history over the ages. Here are the top 10 deadliest tsunamis ever recorded in human history.The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, hit Japan with a magnitude of 9.0. This tsunami caused catastrophic damage to Japan's northeastern coast and led to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The tsunami caused extensive economic damage and nuclear fallout.On December 26, 2004, one of the deadliest tsunamis in recorded history struck the Indian Ocean. Triggered by a massive undersea earthquake with a magnitude of 9.1-9.3, it affected countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, and several others. The tsunami resulted in entire communities being washed away.On December 26, 2003, a tsunami struck the coast of Iran following a magnitude 6.6 earthquake near Bam. The tsunami, combined with the earthquake's impact, led to the destruction of Bam and surrounding areas.The Valdivia earthquake, also known as the Great Chilean Earthquake, occurred on May 22, 1960, with a magnitude of 9.5, the strongest ever recorded. The tsunami affected Chile and spread across the Pacific Ocean, causing deaths in places as far away as Hawaii and Japan.On November 4, 1952, an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 struck the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. The resulting tsunami affected the Pacific Ocean, reaching as far as Hawaii and causing significant damage in the region.On December 28, 1908, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 struck the Strait of Messina between Sicily and mainland Italy. The resulting tsunami caused massive destruction in Messina and Reggio Calabria, killing an estimated 123,000 people. This event remains one of the deadliest tsunamis in European history.A magnitude 8.5 earthquake struck off the coast of Japan’s Sanriku region on June 15, 1896, triggering a massive tsunami. The waves hit the Japanese coast with enormous force, causing widespread destruction and killing many people. This event is often remembered for its sheer scale and impact on the local population.On August 13, 1868, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 8.5 struck off the coast of Peru. The resulting tsunami devastated coastal towns in Peru and Chile, particularly Arica (now in Chile). The waves were reported to have reached as far away as Hawaii.Following the earthquake of March 5, 1783, in Southern Italy, a tsunami struck the coast of Calabria. The earthquake, with a magnitude of around 7.9, triggered a tsunami that resulted in significant destruction and loss of life, with estimates of up to 50,000 deaths in the affected regions.Following the Lisbon earthquake on November 1, 1755, a devastating tsunami hit Portugal and its colonies. With an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, the tsunami ravaged Lisbon and other Portuguese coastal cities, resulting in approximately 10,000-100,000 deaths","Tsunamis are among the most powerful natural disasters in recorded human history.

They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together,” Prof Yunus said during a session with students at Begum Rokeya University. He urged students to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.Thousands of protesters demonstrated in major cities like Dhaka, Chattogram, Barisal, Tangail and Kurigram saying that Hindus have a right to live in Bangladesh.They blocked the Shahbagh intersection in Dhaka for the second consecutive day on Saturday to protest against attacks on homes, shops, and temples in various parts of the country following the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt.“August 2024: Save Bangladeshi Hindus. We Want Justice and Safety,” read a placard held by a young woman. Others chanted slogans like “Save the Hindus”, “Why are my temples and homes being looted? We want answers”, “Hindu persecution in independent Bangladesh, it will not continue”, “Religion is for individuals, the state is for everyone”, and “Ensure the safety of Hindus”.The Hindu minorities demonstrating in Shahbag demanded security for the Hindus and their homes, temples and businesses, the arrest of those who perpetrated violence against them, and compensation for vandalism, loot and torture.Members of minority communities in Bangladesh faced at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts since the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt on Aug 5, according to two Hindu organisations — Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad — in the country.

Royal Family: 'Meghan Markle allegedly screaming after CBS interview': Duchess of Sussex faces fresh controversy over tense TV appearance with Prince Harry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meghan-markle-allegedly-screaming-after-cbs-interview-duchess-of-sussex-faces-fresh-controversy-over-tense-tv-appearance-with-prince-harry/articleshow/112397519.cms,"Meghan Markle is at the center of fresh controversy after a royal expert claimed she suffered a ""meltdown"" following a recent television interview with Prince Harry . The couple's joint appearance, their first since the explosive Oprah Winfrey interview, has been branded a ""car crash"" amid allegations of behind-the-scenes tension and anger, as reported by The Mirror.During a recent appearance on GB News, Royal author Angela Levin shared her take on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's latest interview, claiming that the Duchess of Sussex was ""screaming"" and ""very annoyed"" after the cameras stopped rolling, the Mirror reported.During the CBS Sunday Morning interview, the couple intended to discuss online harm and their philanthropic endeavors. However, the conversation took an unexpected turn when Meghan was questioned about her previously disclosed suicidal thoughts, which she reportedly did not expect. Royal author Angela Levin claims that Markle was visibly upset by the line of questioning, revealing a tense atmosphere that persisted off-camera.""After the interview was over, she was apparently screaming at the producers, very, very annoyed at what they had asked her,"" Levin said on Dan Wootton's show. ""You mustn't do that with Meghan because she's in control. But you could see she couldn't contain her anger, her fury,” she added.Observers and body language experts noted a palpable sense of discomfort between the couple during the interview, according to body language expert Judi James. Harry appeared either bored or distracted, and Meghan’s icy stares seemed to convey dissatisfaction whenever he spoke. Broadcaster Dan Wootton remarked, “It certainly wasn’t a good 43rd birthday for the Duchess of Sussex, was it?”Levin further emphasized the strain in their dynamic, saying, ""Just the same as in and out of the interview, she couldn't stand Harry speaking. She would look at him with such harsh eyes and such a terrible expression on her face because she didn't want him to talk, I imagine. He is really lost at the moment... I think that he's in a very, very bad way.""The interview, which was meant to mark a fresh start in their public engagement, has instead raised questions about the couple’s relationship dynamics and their handling of media scrutiny.

US elections: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to face off in prime-time debate on September 10,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-to-face-off-in-prime-time-debate-on-september-10/articleshow/112389058.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to meet in a highly anticipated prime-time debate on September 10, as announced by ABC News on Thursday. This 90-minute showdown, expected to be held in Philadelphia, marks a pivotal moment in an unpredictable presidential campaign that has already seen significant twists and turns.The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Although the exact format and ground rules are still being finalized, it is likely that the event will proceed without a live audience, according to sources familiar with the plans.Notably, Trump had proposed three debates with major networks - September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with NBC, and September 25 with ABC. However, Harris has agreed to participate only in the September 10 debate with NBC. Harris has not yet provided reasons for declining the other proposed dates.This announcement follows Trump's initial agreement to debate President Joe Biden on the same date, an arrangement made months ago. However, after Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Trump questioned the validity of that commitment with Harris, leading to uncertainty over whether the debate would take place.Recent events, including Biden's exit and an assassination attempt on Trump, have drawn renewed attention to the presidential race, which had initially been shaping up as a repeat of the 2020 election. The upcoming ABC debate is expected to serve as a critical moment in the campaign's final stretch leading up to the election.Trump has also indicated his willingness to engage in additional debates with Harris, proposing events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. However, the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these additional debates. NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate on September 25, but Harris has not committed to participating. Similarly, no agreement has been reached for a debate hosted by Fox News.","The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis.

US orders missile submarine move to Middle East amid rising Israel-Iran tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-orders-missile-submarine-move-to-middle-east-amid-rising-israel-iran-tensions/articleshow/112453468.cms,"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has directed the deployment of a guided missile submarine to the Middle East , the Pentagon announced on Sunday. This move comes as the region braces for potential retaliation following the recent assassinations of senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah.The USS Georgia, a nuclear-powered submarine, was already stationed in the Mediterranean Sea in July, according to a US military social media post.The Pentagon's decision to publicly announce the submarine's deployment is notable for its rarity.Following a conversation with his Israeli counterpart, Austin also ordered the Abraham Lincoln strike group to expedite its deployment to the region. “Secretary Austin reiterated the United States’ commitment to defend Israel and emphasized the enhancement of US military force posture and capabilities throughout the Middle East due to escalating regional tensions,” the Pentagon statement read.In addition to the submarine deployment, the US military plans to send extra fighter jets and Navy warships to the Middle East to strengthen Israeli defenses.The recent escalation was triggered by the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Iran-backed Hamas, in Tehran on July 31. This attack has led to threats of retaliation from Iran against Israel, which is engaged in conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Iran has accused Israel of the killing, although Israel has not claimed responsibility.The situation was further exacerbated by the death of Fuad Shukr, a senior military commander of Hezbollah, in an Israeli strike on Beirut. This has heightened fears that the Gaza conflict may expand into a broader Middle East war.Iran has accused the US of complicity in Haniyeh's assassination due to its support for Israel.Amid these rising tensions, Reuters reported that several US and coalition personnel were injured in a drone attack in Syria on Friday, marking the second significant attack on US forces in recent days.","The USS Georgia, a nuclear-powered submarine, was already stationed in the Mediterranean Sea in July, according to a US military social media post.

Iranian cyber attack targets US election: How Trump campaign caught in crossfire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/iranian-cyber-attack-targets-us-election-how-trump-campaign-caught-in-crossfire/articleshow/112453184.cms,"The specter of foreign interference has returned to the US presidential election, with new allegations of Iranian cyberattacks targeting American political campaigns. On Friday, Microsoft released a report revealing that a hacking group linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard had breached the account of a former senior adviser to a presidential campaign.This breach was followed by a spear-phishing attempt aimed at a high-ranking official within the same campaign.Former President Donald Trump responded swiftly to the news, claiming that his campaign had been targeted by Iranian hackers . Trump, who has often highlighted his aggressive policies toward Iran as a testament to his strength, used the incident to criticize the Biden administration , describing it as ""Weak and Ineffective.""The attack, which Microsoft attributed to the group Mint Sandstorm, raises concerns about the security of the 2024 election. While Trump downplayed the breach, saying that only ""publicly available information"" was accessed, the full extent of the damage remains unclear.In a parallel development, Politico reported on Saturday that it had obtained internal documents from the Trump campaign, leading to speculation about whether these were linked to the Iranian hack or resulted from a separate leak. The New York Times also received a similar trove of data, further complicating the narrative around the incident.The timing of these events has reignited fears about foreign influence in US elections, particularly from Iran, which has a history of animosity towards Trump. His administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and the 2020 assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani have made Trump a key target for Tehran.As investigations continue, the hacking attempts underscore the ongoing vulnerabilities in the US political landscape, with the potential for further foreign interference as the 2024 election approaches.","Microsoft reports that a hacking group linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard breached the account of a former senior adviser to a presidential campaign.

"‘America has become anti-family’: JD Vance repeats criticism of Democrats, defends Trump’s abortion stance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/america-has-become-anti-family-jd-vance-repeats-criticism-of-democrats-defends-trumps-abortion-stance/articleshow/112453183.cms,"State of the Union

Face the Nation

In a series of interviews on Sunday, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, the Republican vice-presidential nominee , reiterated his stance that Democrats are “anti-family” and defended former President Donald Trump’s position on abortion policies .During the interviews on CNN , CBS, and ABC News, Vance clarified his controversial past comments where he had criticized ""childless cat ladies"" and suggested that parents should have more influence in the democratic process than individuals without children.He emphasized that his criticism was directed at the policies of the Democratic Party, not at the personal lives of Democrats. Vance described the notion of allowing children the right to vote, controlled by their parents, as a ""thought experiment"" rather than a serious proposal.“I’m pro-family,” Vance stated on CNN’s. “I want us to have more families. And obviously sometimes it doesn’t work out, sometimes for medical reasons, sometimes because you don’t meet the right person. But the point is that our country has become anti-family in its public policy.”Vance also addressed a recent moment where Trump gave a confusing response to a question about whether he would direct the FDA to revoke its approval of the abortion drug mifepristone. On CBS’s, Vance suggested that Trump might not have fully understood the question at the time. He added, “He just wants to make sure that drugs are safe and effective before they’re out there in the market, and of course that doctors are properly controlling this stuff so that people don’t get hurt.”Despite Vance’s defense, the safety of mifepristone and misoprostol, another drug commonly used in conjunction with it, has been confirmed by more than 100 scientific studies.In his CNN interview, Vance was again asked about Trump’s stance on mifepristone. He referenced Trump’s support for a Supreme Court ruling during a June presidential debate, which maintained access to the drug. When interviewer Dana Bash highlighted that the court’s decision was based on the plaintiffs’ lack of standing rather than the substance of the case, Vance reiterated that Trump supports leaving abortion policy decisions to individual states, despite the fact that states have no control over FDA drug approvals.","JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, gave a series of interviews on Sunday.

We hold these relationships in the highest regard and our personnel would not enter, or instruct our partners to enter, a business without the owner’s permission,”“He said to me everything that was done was done very wrong.

The owner mentioned that due to the chaotic security measures, her salon had to shut down before the fundraiser took place, The New York Post reported.She said: “They had a bunch of people in and out of here doing a couple of bomb sweeps again — totally understand what they have to do, due to the nature of the situation,” she told the outlet.“And at that point, my team felt like it was a little bit chaotic, and we just made the decision to close for Saturday,” she added.","Alicia Powers, a salon owner based in the Berkshires region of Massachusetts, said the incident occurred on July 27, prior to Vice President Kamala Harris' fundraising event.

Whipsawed by Events

Struggling to Frame the Attack

Griping About Circumstances, but Not Staff

The August 2 dinner at the Bridgehampton, New York, home of Howard Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO, was a high-powered affair. Among the roughly 130 people who dined under an air-conditioned tent were some of Donald Trump 's wealthiest supporters, including billionaire hedge fund financier Bill Ackman, who sat next to the former president, and Omeed Malik, the president of another fund, 1789 Capital.Some guests hoped Trump would signal that he was recalibrating after a series of damaging mistakes. He did not.Before the dinner, answering a question that voiced concerns about the upcoming election during a small roundtable discussion inside Lutnick's house, Trump said, ""We've got to stop the steal,"" reviving yet again his false claims about the 2020 election -- claims that his advisers have urged him to drop because they don't help him with swing voters.According to two people present, Trump also brought up his remark, made two days earlier at a gathering of the National Association of Black Journalists, in which he had questioned Vice President Kamala Harris ' racial identity.It had been a display of flagrant race-baiting that was egregious even by Trump's standards, and it instantly reprogrammed America's TV news chyrons: He falsely claimed that Harris had only recently decided to identify as Black for political purposes.But Trump showed no regret. ""I think I was right,"" he told the rattled donors that Friday night.Later, at dinner under the tent, Harrison LeFrak, the scion of a New York real estate family, whose father is an old friend of Trump's, asked how Trump planned to take the narrative back from Democrats, and what his positive vision for the country would be. It appeared to be a request for reassurance.Trump provided none. Instead, he criticized Harris on a range of fronts, before adding: ""I am who I am.""The fundraiser came amid a stretch of flailing and self-harm that began after President Joe Biden 's July 21 withdrawal from the race and endorsement of Harris to succeed him. Close Trump allies have described this as the rockiest period of Trump's campaign -- and easily the worst since a late 2022 spree in which he mused about terminating parts of the Constitution and dined at Mar-a-Lago with a white supremacist and an outspoken antisemite.Since then, Trump has picked fights with allies publicly and privately, including a broadside against Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia at an Atlanta rally -- the kind of mean-spirited public attack on a popular Republican that his own allies believe helped sink two Senate races in Georgia in January 2021 and could harm Trump in the state, a vital battleground in November.This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen people close to Trump, nearly all of whom insisted on anonymity to describe private discussions and events.As Harris -- long ridiculed and underestimated -- has transformed the contest, campaigning energetically and drawing roughly even with Trump in many polls, Trump has responded with one unforced error after another while struggling to land on an effective and consistent argument against her.He has found the change disorienting, those who interact with him say. Trump had grown comfortable campaigning against an 81-year-old incumbent who struggled to navigate stairs, thoughts and sentences. Suddenly, he finds himself in a race against a Black woman nearly 20 years younger, one who has made history and who is drawing large and excited crowds.The people around Trump see a candidate knocked off his bearings, nothing like the man who reclined serenely July 15 as he watched as thousands of delegates cheered him on the first night of the Republican National Convention. Then, Trump, his ear bandaged, was a living martyr after the assassination attempt two days before. Inside the Milwaukee arena, the Democrats had been defeated; the only thing left to wonder about was the margin of Trump's victory.In a statement in response to the reporting for this story, a spokesperson, Brian Hughes, said that Trump ""continues to run a winning campaign and has built a movement focused on making our nation great again."" Another spokesperson, Steven Cheung, insisted Trump had put forward a ""positive"" vision for the country that contrasted with ""the dangerously liberal policies"" of Biden and Harris.But to Trump's close allies, that first night in Milwaukee now seems a foggy memory, as if it never happened.At the Aug. 2 dinner, Trump told donors that the news media had been incorrectly suggesting that he had mellowed since the assassination attempt. ""I'm not nicer,"" he said, according to one person in attendance.Another said Trump described himself as ""angry,"" because ""they"" -- unspecified adversaries that the attendee took to mean Democrats -- had first tried to bankrupt him and then to kill him.Indeed, Trump has often been in a foul mood the past few weeks. He has ranted about Harris. He has called her ""nasty,"" on ""Fox & Friends,"" and a ""bitch,"" repeatedly, in private, according to two people who heard the remark on different occasions. (""That is not language President Trump has used to describe Kamala, and it's not how the campaign would characterize her,"" Cheung said.)His quickness to anger has left him susceptible to manipulation, even among close allies.A week before the Hamptons fundraiser, on July 25, Trump stunned one of his wealthiest patrons, Miriam Adelson, the widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, by having an aide, Natalie Harp, fire off a series of angry text messages to Adelson in Trump's name, according to three people with knowledge of what took place.The texts were particularly jarring because Adelson and Trump had a friendly meeting just a week earlier at the Republican National Convention, according to a person briefed on the matter.The texts complained about the people running Adelson's super political action committee, Preserve America, into which she is pouring millions of dollars to support Trump.At the time, Preserve America was spending nearly $18 million on a week's worth of ads aiding Trump in three battleground states. The texts said that the officials running Preserve America were ""RINOs"" -- Republicans in name only -- and that Adelson's late husband would never have tolerated that, the people said.According to two of the people, aides to Adelson later discovered that the outburst against her had been encouraged by another major Trump donor, Ike Perlmutter, the former chair of Marvel Entertainment, who had hoped in vain that Adelson would contribute to a rival super PAC that he backs. (A lawyer for Perlmutter did not respond to an email seeking comment, and an adviser to Adelson, Andy Abboud, declined to comment.)The text messages prompted concerns -- as yet unrealized -- that Adelson might scale back her support of Trump.Over the past two weeks, Trump has fielded complaints from donors about his running mate , JD Vance, as news coverage exploring Vance's past statements unearthed -- and then exhaustively critiqued -- remarks including a lament that America was run by ""childless cat ladies.""Trump dismissed out of hand donors' suggestions that he replace Vance on the ticket. But Trump privately asked his advisers whether they had known about Vance's comments about childless women before Trump chose him.And, at the Aug. 2 fundraiser, according to two people with knowledge of what took place, when a donor at the roundtable discussion asked about Democrats trying to paint the Republican ticket as ""weird,"" Trump replied: ""Not about me. They're saying that about JD.""Trump didn't reveal any loss of confidence in Vance. Rather, he offered him simple advice: Attack, attack, attack. And Trump has been impressed over the past week as Vance attacked Harris and her new running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, on the campaign trail -- praising him and taking credit for scouting him, according to two people who have spoken to Trump. They said Trump had described Vance as a great political ""athlete.""Trump deals more in projection than subtext, and his recent posts on Truth Social reveal how blindsided he feels about the upturned election.Despite his public insistence that he would rather face Harris than Biden, those close to him say that is untrue. He had been on a glide path to an all-but-certain victory. Now, he needs to work for it.But Trump has also been whipsawed by a seven-week roller-coaster-ride of events: an attempt on his life, the selection of a running mate, a nominating convention, his opponent's withdrawal from the race, the entry of a galvanizing new rival, a potential Iranian assassination threat against him and new layers of security that have brought a bunkerlike feel to his properties, more than at any time since he was in the White House.Also unsettling to him: For the first time in Trump's political life, his opponent has received more sustained news coverage than he has, beating him at the game of ""earned media,"" the kind that costs campaigns nothing to produce.Moreover, the coverage of Harris has overwhelmingly been positive.Harris ""has gotten the equivalent of the largest in-kind contribution of free media I think I have ever seen in all the years I've been doing presidential campaigns,"" said Tony Fabrizio, the Trump campaign's chief pollster.Trump has seemed to want to wish his new situation away. He claimed on Truth Social, without evidence, that Biden regretted his decision to drop out and wanted to undo it. He has talked repeatedly about how badly he thinks Democrats mistreated Biden. He has complained about how unfair it is that he's had to start the race over again. He has vented about wasting time, energy and millions of dollars on Biden, only to find himself facing a new opponent for the final 100-day sprint.And Trump told one aide that Democrats were trying to ""steal"" the election again from him -- comparing the reshuffling of the Democratic ticket to when state legislatures changed voting rules midway through the 2020 election cycle because of the COVID pandemic.He has also peppered his advisers with questions about whether Harris can sustain her momentum, constantly asking what new polling shows.Soon after Harris replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket, Fabrizio, the Trump pollster, stressed to the campaign staff that the polls would get worse before they got better. Fabrizio has insisted, though, that the race has not fundamentally changed, that once voters are educated about Harris ' liberal record on crime and her role in Biden's unpopular policies -- especially on immigration -- they will sour on her.Fabrizio has predicted to campaign colleagues that Harris will have two to three more good weeks, through the Democratic National Convention, and then her poll numbers will turn in the other direction.Others are more concerned about what they are seeing in private polling. Two private polls conducted in Ohio recently by Republican pollsters -- which Trump carried in 2020 with 53% of the vote -- showed him receiving less than 50% of the vote against Harris in the state, according to a person with direct knowledge of the data.Nearly three weeks since Harris became his Democratic opponent, Trump and his campaign are still struggling to settle on how to define her, what message with which to attack her, and even what nickname with which to belittle her.He initially called her ""Laffin' Kamala,"" mocking her laugh, before cycling through other epithets, including ""Crooked,"" an insult he had used against both Hillary Clinton and Biden. Lately, he has favored ""Crazy Kamala.""His advisers have gone to great lengths testing policy-based attacks to see which work best with voters in the battleground states. They have privately described having so much material against Harris -- from interviews to policy statements to her record as a prosecutor -- that condensing it all into a specific frame can feel like a challenge.Yet most of Trump's top advisers have urged the campaign and the candidate to focus on the economy, immigration and crime -- issues on which Trump's message resonates powerfully with the so-called persuadable voters they are targeting.Sometimes, Trump has done so. Other times, he has not.His advisers have urged Trump to portray Harris as someone who frequently changes her positions, some of them recalling how successfully President George W. Bush used that strategy against John Kerry in the 2004 presidential race.Trump has called her ""fake"" -- but in self-defeating ways, like questioning whether Harris, who is Black, is Black.Outside advisers and allies have also called Trump to impress on him the political peril of continuing with those kinds of attacks. Kellyanne Conway, who managed his 2016 campaign, recently told Trump to stick to policy contrasts, rather than personal attacks, and to treat Harris as a formidable adversary, as he had Clinton.That advice has gone unheeded. At his news conference Thursday in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump again attacked Harris as ""nasty,"" denigrated her intellect and said she was ""very disrespectful"" to both her Black and Indian heritages.Trump's mood improved a little in recent days, people who have spoken with him said, after Harris named Walz her running mate. He had become convinced that she would choose Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and that Shapiro could help her carry a must-win state. On ""Fox and Friends,"" Trump called Walz ""a shocking pick,"" adding, ""I could not be more thrilled.""Summertime has been a challenging season for Trump in election years: In June and again in August 2016, he replaced his campaign leadership. In July 2020, he fired his campaign manager.However, changes to his team do not now appear likely; Trump has privately expressed faith in his top advisers, even as he gripes about his current circumstances.On Aug. 2, before the Hamptons fundraiser, Trump met at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, whom he had installed as a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, and with Conway, according to three people with knowledge of the meeting. Lara Trump, reached by phone, said there was no discussion of replacing any senior aides. Conway declined to detail her conversation with Donald Trump, but also said she had not discussed any personnel by name, saying she was there instead to discuss policy, strategy and how to beat his new, female rival.In an angry phone call to a New York Times reporter Friday afternoon, Trump denied that he was making any changes to his team, saying he was ""thrilled"" with his top advisers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, and asking why he would even want to make such a change.(In the same call, Trump threatened to sue the Times over a story about his description in Thursday's news conference of a near-death experience on a helicopter ride with Willie Brown, a former California politician. Brown denied ever having flown on a helicopter with Trump.)Trump's own behavior remains one of the most unpredictable factors in his campaign.And after years of holding only a few rallies a month and still managing to play plenty of golf, while Biden held very few campaign events, Trump now has an opponent who is outworking him politically.Perhaps the clearest indication that Trump's knack for forcing the public discussion to take place on his terms was failing him came a week ago, when he abruptly declared in a midnight social media post that a debate on ABC News, to which he had agreed when Biden was running, was now ""terminated"" and that he would only debate Harris on the more hospitable terrain of Fox News.Trump was widely mocked as fearing a confrontation with Harris.On Thursday, he reversed himself, declaring in his news conference that he would, indeed, show up for the ABC debate -- and proposing two others.",Donald Trump's campaign has been in a tailspin since Joe Biden's withdrawal. Trump is struggling to find an effective argument against Kamala Harris. Trump's allies say he has been knocked off his bearings by the events of the past two weeks. Trump has picked fights with allies publicly and privately.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112449742,imgsize-72922,width-400,resizemode-4/112449742.jpg"
"JD Vance: JD Vance slams far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes who attacked his wife, calls him a total...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-slams-far-right-white-supremacist-nick-fuentest-who-attacked-his-wife-usha-calls-him-a-total-/articleshow/112448911.cms,"Who is Nick Fuentes?

Senator JD Vance , the Republican vice-presidential candidate from Ohio, has publicly disavowed far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes, who recently attacked Vance's wife, Usha Vance , for her Indian heritage. Vance emphasised that the best way to respond to such attacks is to ""ignore"" them.Fuentes, who had dined with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, launched his attack on Vance and his family after Vance joined Trump’s re-election campaign last month.Fuentes questioned Vance's loyalty to white identity, citing his marriage to an Indian woman and the name of their child, Vivek.In response to these comments on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” Vance stated that such views have “no place in the MAGA movement.” He added, “Donald Trump has also criticised this person. Look, I think the guy’s a total loser. I absolutely disavow him. But if you ask me what I care more about, it’s not personal attacks but rather government policies that discriminate based on race. That’s my real concern.” Vance also highlighted the importance of ignoring such attackers, believing that “not feeding the trolls” would cause them to eventually fade away.Although Vance did not immediately condemn Fuentes's remarks, he did address the white supremacist attacks against his wife in an interview with Megyn Kelly, expressing deep love for his wife and pride in her accomplishments. He acknowledged the challenges they face due to her heritage but emphasised their strong relationship.Trump’s 2022 meeting with Fuentes drew widespread criticism, including from within his own party. The meeting, which also included rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, who later claimed to have angered Trump by asking him to be his running mate in 2024, added to the controversy.The Justice Department has labelled Fuentes a white supremacist, known for his racist and antisemitic rhetoric, while Ye has also faced backlash for antisemitic remarks.Nick Fuentes has emerged as a prominent figure on the far right in America, notorious for his antisemitic, racist, and white supremacist views. As the head of the America First Political Action Conference, he has formed connections with several Republican lawmakers, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona. His rise has been marked by statements and actions aligned with his extremist ideology.Fuentes openly promotes his hateful views on his podcast, recently calling for military intervention in Black neighbourhoods and demanding that Jews leave the country. He has gained notoriety for denying the Holocaust and using openly racist language, attracting condemnation from various political and social groups.A notable incident involving Fuentes occurred when he attended a dinner with former President Donald J. Trump at Trump’s private club in Florida. The dinner, also attended by Kanye West and political operative Karen Giorno, sparked controversy due to Fuentes’s extreme views. Trump later claimed he was unaware of Fuentes’s background, but the meeting highlighted the lack of discipline in Trump’s post-presidency activities.Fuentes first gained widespread attention for his involvement in the violent far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. He later led the America First movement, whose followers, known as groypers, have actively supported Trump, especially after the 2020 presidential election. Fuentes's rhetoric has often been incendiary, urging his followers to ""storm every state capitol"" and leading chants to ""Destroy the G.O.P.""On January 6, 2021, Fuentes was present at the Capitol, where he and his supporters rallied in favour of Trump. Following the attack, several individuals connected to his organization were charged with federal crimes. Fuentes himself was subpoenaed by the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack, seeking information about his involvement.Despite widespread condemnation, Fuentes remains a vocal and influential figure within the far-right community, reflecting the ongoing challenges posed by extremist ideologies in American politics.","Nick Fuentes is a prominent figure on the far right in America.

First responders pronounced a victim dead at the scene.Alkire said that a home next door to the explosion was heavily damaged, and a woman in that house was treated for her injuries on the scene. At least one utility worker on the scene was also injured. Two utility workers were in the area to work on a reported electrical issue, but authorities didn't immediately say if that was related to the explosion.Investigators are working to determine how many houses were damaged and how far the blast radius was. Firefighters were continuing to search the debris for other possible victims of the blast. Authorities said there's no ongoing threat to the public.The blast leveled the home. A photo posted by county officials showed a number of firefighters around the rubble of one home with another damaged home in the background. Charred pieces of wood were heaped on the property, and insulation and splintered wood spilled out into the street.Alkire said the house that blew up was for sale, but it wasn't clear if it was still occupied.More than 60 first responders came to the scene from multiple agencies. The state fire marshal, sheriff and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were assisting with the probe, as is standard procedure.Lisa Czawlytko, who lives in a nearby condominium, said the explosion woke her and her three children and knocked a pet bird to the ground.She said the roof structure on four condominium buildings buckled and sent aluminum siding from the roof down to the ground. She attended a news conference at a nearby library to ask officials if it was safe to be in the building.She said she felt the force of the explosion.""The whole building shook like a major earthquake,"" she said in an interview.It scared her daughter, 8-year-old Myca.""I thought a bomb dropped,"" she said.The blast woke up Greg Clifford from a heavy sleep inside his townhouse about a block away. He first thought that a tree had fallen on his deck, or that a lightning strike caused the loud noise.""It just shook the whole thing,"" Clifford said. ""It was crazy loud.""He also noted some damage to his home.""The window in my bedroom is pulled away from the framing of the house,"" Clifford said. ""I mean, I can look straight down to my deck. My basement door - the glass - it didn't shatter, but it blew in, and my frame's all cracked out.""","Firefighters were called to the scene around 6:40 am for a report of a gas leak and an outdoor odor of gas.

Polio is transmitted through contaminated water or food, or contact with an infected person. Treatment includes bed rest, pain relievers, rehabilitation and portable ventilators.Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO 's regional director of polio eradication was cited by Al-Jazeera as saying that the challenge exists in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. ""This is where there's a lot of militancy, insecurity and community hostility and frustration towards the government because of conflict and a lack of services,"" Jafari said.Over 50 districts across Pakistan are detecting the virus, he said.Compounding to the challenges is the fact, says the WHO official that not only is the polio programme being targeted but also security personnel that are guarding the teams ""because they become soft targets when they are in the community.""At least 102 polio field workers, officials and security personnel have been killed, including at least six in campaigns carried out this year, the Al Jazeera report cited.Meanwhile, the latest victim is an 11-month-old infant from Qila, in Balochistan who has succumbed to paralysis caused by the wild poliovirus.The child from Qila who displayed symptoms of paralysis on July 17, is among the five cases detected in the district. Other cases in Balochistan have been reported in Chaman, Quetta, Zhob, Dera Bugti, and Jhal Magsi as per a report in the Balochistan Post.In Balochistan, the situation is compounded by a recent history of inadequate vaccination coverage and persistent misconceptions about the vaccine. Despite numerous vaccination campaigns, efforts have struggled to keep pace with the actual number of infections, the publication stated.","On August 10, the 14th polio case of the year was reported from Qilla Saifullah district of Balochistan boosting the number of poliovirus cases in the country to 13 for the year 2024.

Asif Raza Merchant was charged in a complaint unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn with murder-for-hire as part of a scheme to assassinate a politician or US government officials on its soil. Law enforcement said they foiled the charged plot before any attack could be carried out. Merchant, who has stated that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan, is in federal custody in New York. US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said that working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of US government officials on American soil. According to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. FBI director Christopher Wray said the ""dangerous murder-for-hire"" plot allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook. In April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source. In early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a ""finger gun"" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant stated that the intended victims would be ""targeted here"", meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official. Merchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.

The plot by Asif Merchant

A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant , has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil. Prosecutors in Brooklyn announced criminal charges against Asif Merchant, accusing him of travelling to New York for the purposes of trying to hire a hitman for the assassinations. The plot was disrupted before it could be carried out.The document did not name any potential target but CNN reported that former president Donald Trump and other current and former US government officials might be the targets of the plot.Trump was shot at by Thomas Crooks at a Pennsylvania rally last month in which the shooter was killed. This attempt was unrelated to the life threat that Trump had from Iran. US officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump.Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement: ""The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.""Merchant said, as revealed by the document, that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified ""party"" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to ""finalize"" the plan and leave the United States.In mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a ""political person"".Merchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.On June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance.

"Pakistan plans to regulate VPN, Opposition-civil society cry foul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-plans-to-regulate-vpn-opposition-civil-society-cry-foul/articleshow/112257788.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others, according to PTA Chairman Maj General (retd) Hafeezur Rehman, Samaa TV reported.During the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat meeting, Rehman said that once the policy is in place, only whitelisted VPNs will be operational in Pakistan, while all others will be blocked.In 2024, the use of VPNs among local internet users surged significantly, primarily to access X, which has been banned in the country since February 19, according to the Samaa TV report. Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy. For a nation largely comprising very young people, this would be an unmitigated disaster as it could have repercussions that may spill over generations. Already struggling to compete, the Pakistpeople will end up being deprived of even more chances to realise their potential and contribute positively on a global scale,"" the editorial said.According to the website DataReportal, there were 71.70 million active social media user identities in Pakistan in January 2024. YouTube is Pakistan's most-used social media platform in 2024 with a potential ad audience of 71.70 million. Data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 54.38 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Pakistan at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 38.9 per cent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.Meanwhile, according to Samaa TV, the Pakistan government has made previous attempts to regulate VPN usage by requiring registration, but these efforts have not resulted in significant action. In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions. The PTA also passed VPN regulations in 2010, but enforcement has been inconsistent.","Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others.

Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, who addressed reporters alongside the party's secretary-general Omar Ayub Khan outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail where the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician is lodged since last August, said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has decided to expand the opposition alliance in a meeting with Imran Khan on Thursday, Geo News reported.Qaiser announced that the former ruling party would gather all opposition parties to run a powerful anti-government movement. He said that the party's forthcoming power show in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swabi was aimed at raising a ""strong voice"" for the release of the PTI founder and other detained leaders.""This country will only be governed in accordance with the law and the Constitution,"" Qaiser emphasised.During his address, Qaiser also rebuked the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government over skyrocketing power bills.
