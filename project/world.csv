Michael Cohen: Trump knew checks were for hush-money and not legal work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/michael-cohen-trump-knew-checks-were-for-hush-money-and-not-legal-work/articleshow/110132111.cms,"‘Lying to Them’

Michael Cohen came under a plodding cross-examination Tuesday by Donald Trump ’s lawyer, who sought to undermine his earlier testimony that he participated in a hush money scheme to help the former president influence the 2016 election.Trump attorney Todd Blanche questioned Cohen at Trump ’s hush money trial for about two hours, focusing on how his decade-long devotion to Trump soured after he pleaded guilty to federal crimes in 2018 and went to prison.Blanche depicted Cohen as a fawning acolyte who turned into a vengeful media hound and made $3.4 million on two books, along with profits from a podcast and merchandise sales — all devoted to condemning Trump as a criminal who should go to jail.Blanche asked Cohen if he was “obsessed” with Trump, serving as his fixer and lawyer for a decade until after the 2016 election.“I wouldn’t use the word obsessed, I admired him tremendously,” Cohen told a Manhattan state jury. But Cohen added: “At the time, I was knee-deep into the cult of Donald Trump.”Blanche sought to undermine the credibility of Cohen, who paid $130,000 in October 2016 to adult film star Stormy Daniels after she claimed she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier. Cohen said Trump directed him to make the payment to influence the election.False PremiseCohen testified Tuesday that Trump’s reimbursements to him in 2017 were all based on the false premise that he provided legal services, not a reimbursement. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to conceal the nature of the payments.Blanche reviewed some of Cohen’s social media posts and podcast statements that belittled Trump, sometimes in crude terms. He called his former boss “a Cheetos-dusted cartoon villain” and a “dictator d____ bag.”Earlier, as prosecutor Susan Hoffinger ended her questioning of Cohen, she asked him about what Trump told him after FBI agents raided his home, office and hotel suite in April 2018.Cohen said Trump told him: “Don’t worry, I’m the president of the United States. There’s nothing here. Everything is going to be OK. Stay tough. Everything is going to be OK.”In August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion, lying to a bank and campaign finance violations. He told the jury that was the “worst day of my life.”Cohen later pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Trump hotel project in Moscow. He returned to Congress in February 2019, and apologized for his earlier false testimony.He said he apologized to the American people for “lying to them, for acting in a way that suppressed information that the citizenry had a right to know in order to make the determination of the individual who was seeking the highest office in the land.”Cohen was also shown a series of checks, invoices and other Trump Organization documents that are central to the trial.He testified that he sent bogus invoices for legal services to get repaid, as part of an agreement with Trump’s company.“Was this invoice a false record?” Hoffinger asked.“Yes, ma’am,” he said.“Did each of those monthly invoices you submitted make the same false representation?”“Yes, ma’am.”National EnquirerThe testimony buttressed earlier witness accounts and documents outlining an alleged hush money scheme that began with an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower involving Trump, Cohen and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.Pecker agreed to publish positive stories about Trump, attack his rivals, and alert Cohen to any salacious stories about Trump and women that could hurt his campaign, Cohen and Pecker both testified.Cohen gave extensive testimony about his efforts to stay in Trump’s good graces as the hush money plan was playing out. The former lawyer said he knew all along that paying Daniels off was part of a plan to influence the election.“Why, in fact, did you pay that money to Stormy Daniels?” Hoffinger asked.“To ensure that story did not come out, did not affect Mr. Trump’s chances of becoming president of the United States,” Cohen said.“On whose direction did you commit that crime?” Hoffinger asked.“On behalf of Mr Trump,” he said.Cohen, who prosecutors say is their last witness, will return to the stand Thursday when the trial resumes.","Trump attorney Todd Blanche questioned Michael Cohen for about two hours.

Putin visits Xi as US threatens China sanctions over ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/putin-visits-xi-as-us-threatens-china-sanctions-over-ties/articleshow/110132102.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is heading to China for the first foreign visit of his new term, underlining the vital importance of the relationship as Beijing faces growing US pressure to curtail support that’s helping Moscow continue its war in Ukraine.Putin, 71, who extended his nearly quarter-century rule in tightly controlled March elections, will visit Beijing starting May 16, as well as the northern city of Harbin where he’ll take part in the opening ceremony of the eighth Russian-Chinese Expo.He is likely to prioritize countering the US warnings to China over trade with his country at talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping .The two leaders, who declared a “no-limits friendship” just weeks before Putin invaded Ukraine, have met more than 40 times since Xi came to power in 2012. China, which has helped Russia weather unprecedented US and European sanctions imposed over the Kremlin’s invasion of its neighbor, has faced increasing US threats of retaliation.The world’s second-largest economy has become an indispensable ally for Russia, which relies on China as a market for its energy and supplier of its wartime needs. That’s put Putin in a sometimes awkward position, with Beijing wary of his nuclear sabre-rattling and mindful of the need to keep unfettered access to the US-led global economic system.Putin’s decision to make Beijing his first foreign destination since his inauguration last week shows that “China is without a doubt our main partner,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, which advises the Kremlin. “In some aspects, we’ve no other alternative.”The visit comes just days after Putin appointed Andrey Belousov, an economist and technocrat, as his new defense minister, replacing the long-serving Sergei Shoigu in a signal the Russian leader sees an extended conflict ahead. Several other prominent officials, some with experience working with China, kept their current roles. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who oversees Russia’s relations with the OPEC+ group of oil-exporting nations, retained his position, while adding oversight of the nation’s economy to his responsibilities.In addition to a one-on-one meeting with Xi, Putin also will be joined by both Belousov and Shoigu for closed-door talks, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said, according to the Interfax news service. Novak, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina are among a host of other officials that will also participate in talks, he said.In recent weeks, the US has stepped up warnings to Chinese banks and exporters about consequences if they help to bolster Russia’s military capacity.In December, the Treasury Department announced it would impose secondary sanctions on banks that facilitate deals in which Russia procures semiconductors, ball bearings and other equipment necessary for its military — even if they’re unaware they’re doing so.Banking transactions between Russia and China in general have now hit obstacles, according to Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center and an expert on Russia-China ties. “The chilling effect of US policy is already there,” he said.The two leaders and their top officials could look for solutions such as designating smaller banks with no exposure to the US financial system to handle transactions with Russia, said Gabuev.The Chinese ambassador to Russia, Zhang Hanhui, said in an interview with Russian state TV last week that US sanctions have caused “some disturbance” in trade between the two countries. He added that the “two sides are actively holding consultations and striving to find effective solutions as soon as possible.”In a written interview with China’s official Xinhua News Agency published Wednesday, Putin said he was confident in the economic relationship with Beijing.Driven by Russian oil and gas sales and purchases of electronics, industrial equipment and cars, Moscow’s trade with China hit a record $240 billion in 2023, more than double the $108 billion reached in 2020.Despite the growing economic ties, China’s exports to Russia were down 13% in April from a year earlier, the second month in a row of an annual decrease, according to Chinese customs data. Russian media reported that Chinese banks in late March began blocking payments from companies in Russia buying components for electronic assembly.“It has become a tradition for the two heads of states to visit each other in the first overseas trips of their respective new presidential terms,” a display of mutual trust, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.However, Beijing doesn’t want to be seen as tied to Russia’s war machine, he said. “China wants to build a multi-polar world with partners including European nations — as President Xi’s recent trip showed — not just with Russia,” said Wang, who was also a former Chinese diplomat to the European Union. Xi traveled to France, Serbia and Hungary last week, seeking to promote China as a reliable partner.On the energy front, negotiating a new supply contract with China will be on the agenda. Russia has all but lost its position in the European gas market in the wake of the invasion, and gas giant Gazprom PJSC sees China, the world’s largest energy importer, as a replacement.Currently, Gazprom ships natural gas to China through just one route, the Power of Siberia pipeline. Deliveries have been growing gradually and are planned to reach an annual record of 38 billion cubic meters next year. They are set to increase by a further 10 billion cubic meters, with supplies starting from 2027, under a separate contract signed in 2022.Russia’s ambition is to reach another agreement with China, with one option being a potential new Power of Siberia 2 link through Mongolia, which could lift Gazprom’s eastbound deliveries by 50 billion cubic meters a year.While Putin and Xi may discuss the contract when they meet, the Russian side does not expect a final agreement this time around, according to a person familiar with the matter.Even if China and Russia did agree on a new deal, Gazprom’s flows to the Asian nation wouldn’t exceed half of what it used to ship to Europe, and would be less lucrative, with the price for Russian gas to China lower than for remaining European clients through at least 2027, according to an economic outlook prepared by the Economy Ministry.Yet another source of worry for Russia is Ukraine’s bid to rally international support for a June conference in Switzerland aimed at promoting Kyiv’s demand for a Russian troop withdrawal from occupied territory as a pre-condition for any peace agreement.“The key here is whether China attends or not,” said Lukyanov from the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy. “Moscow takes into account the risk that the conference will create the impression on the world stage that everyone is for peace except Russia.”Still, China is continuing to sell more than $300 million a month of dual-use components to Russia identified by the US and its allies as essential for making weapons such as missiles, drones and tanks, according to a study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace published May 6.Providing components rather than weapons allows Beijing to claim plausible deniability, while supporting Russia diverts American resources away from the Indo-Pacific where China and the US are in competition, the study said.For China, “they don’t want Russia to lose” the war in Ukraine, Carnegie’s Gabuev said.","Vladimir Putin will visit Beijing starting May 16, as well as the northern city of Harbin. He is likely to prioritize countering the US warnings to China over trade with his country.

The van, transporting prisoner Mohamed Amra , also known as ""The Fly,"" was rammed by a car at a toll booth while en route from court to prison.Following the collision, gunmen opened fire on the prison officers, resulting in the death of two officers and leaving two others in critical condition.A large-scale manhunt involving several hundred police officers and gendarmes has been initiated to apprehend the perpetrators. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his commitment to finding those responsible, saying on X that ""everything is being done to find the perpetrators"".Prosecutors have identified the escaped inmate as Mohamed Amra, a 30-year-old born in 1994. Amra, who has ties to a gang in Marseille, a city grappling with drug-related gang violence, was convicted of burglary on May 10 and had been indicted for a kidnapping that resulted in a death. The ambush occurred around 11:00 (09:00 GMT) near a toll booth on the A154 motorway as Amra was being transported back to jail in Évreux after attending a court hearing in Rouen.French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti confirmed that the officers were shot with ""heavy weapons"" by the prisoner's accomplices. The attackers fled the scene in a car, which police believe has been recovered, abandoned near the toll gate where the attack took place.Roadblocks have been set up across north-west France, and police are following up on every lead.In a press conference following a crisis unit meeting, Mr. Dupond-Moretti shared the tragic personal details of the deceased officers, with one leaving behind a wife and two children who were meant to celebrate their 21st birthday in two days, and the other leaving a wife who is five months pregnant.He vowed that ""Everything - and I mean everything - will be put in place to find the perpetrators of this vile crime,"" and that they would be punished ""in a way that is proportionate to the crime"".","Two French prison officers lost their lives when a prison van was ambushed.

"8 dead, at least 40 injured as farmworkers' bus overturns in central Florida; truck driver arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/several-dead-at-least-40-injured-as-farmworkers-bus-overturns-in-central-florida-truck-driver-arrested/articleshow/110130971.cms,"OCALA: A bus carrying farmworkers collided with a pickup truck and overturned in central Florida on Tuesday, killing eight people and injuring about 40 other passengers, authorities said.The converted school bus was transporting 53 farmworkers at about 6:40 a.m. when it collided with a 2001 Ford Ranger in Marion County , about 80 miles north of Orlando, the Florida Highway Patrol said.The workers had been headed to Cannon Farms in Dunellon, which has been harvesting watermelons.FHP Lt. Patrick Riordan said it appears the truck ""traveled toward the center line"" and the two vehicles sideswiped, causing the bus to swerve off State Road 40, a straight but somewhat hilly two-lane road that passes through horse farms. The bus crashed through a fence, struck a tree and rolled over in a field, Riordan said.The driver of the pickup was also injured and taken to the hospital, Riordan said.The bus ended up on its side, with its windows smashed and its emergency rear door and top hatch open. The truck came to a stop at the side of the road, with its air bag blown and extensive damage to its driver's side.Federal statistics show that vehicle crashes were the leading cause of job-related deaths among farmworkers in 2022, the latest year available. They accounted for 81 of 171 fatalities.There is no immediate indication that weather was a factor. It also was not immediately not known if the bus had seat belts.Authorities in several states have been pushing for greater regulations for the safety of farmworkers, who are overwhelmingly migrants. It is unknown if all the workers on the bus were migrants.The Labor Department announced new seat belt requirements for employer vehicles used for farmworkers on temporary visas, among other worker protections that take effect June 28. The Florida Fruit & Vegetable Association has been opposed, calling the seatbelt requirement ""impractical.""State law requires seatbelts for farmworker transport using smaller vehicles, weighing less than 10,000 pounds.""We will be closed today out of respect to the losses and injuries endured early this morning in the accident that took place to the Olvera Trucking Harvesting Corp.,"" Cannon Farms announced on its Facebook page. ""Please pray with us for the families and the loved ones involved in this tragic accident. We appreciate your understanding at this difficult time.""Cannon Farms describes itself as a family-owned operation that has farmed its land for more than 100 years. The company now focuses on peanuts and watermelons, which it sends to grocery stores across the U.S. and Canada.No one answered the phone at Olvera Trucking on Tuesday afternoon. The company had recently advertised for a temporary driver to bus workers to watermelon fields. The driver would then operate harvesting equipment. The pay was $14.77 an hour.It wasn't immediately clear if the workers who were on the bus are migrants, but a Department of Labor document shows Olvera recently applied for 43 H-2A workers to harvest watermelons at Cannon Farms this month. The company again offered a base rate of $14.77 an hour, with promises of housing and transportation to and from the fields.The H-2A program allows U.S. employers or agents who meet certain regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals into the country to fill temporary agricultural jobs. Florida farms employ more H-2A workers than any other state, about 50,000 a year, according to the Florida Fruit & Vegetable Association.Andres Sequra, a director of mission and ministry for AdventHealth hospitals, told reporters that the injured workers who could be visited by chaplains ""were in good spirits for what they have been through.""""We were able to provide support, presence, prayer when it was asked of us,"" he said.","The converted school bus was transporting 53 farmworkers when it collided with a 2001 Ford Ranger.

"Alice Munro, Canadian Nobel Prize-winning author, dead at 92",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/alice-munro-canadian-nobel-prize-winning-author-dead-at-92/articleshow/110126773.cms,"'Shame and embarrassment'

OTTAWA: Nobel Prize-winning Canadian writer Alice Munro , whose exquisitely crafted tales of the loves, ambitions and travails of small-town women in her native land made her a globally acclaimed master of the short story, has died at the age of 92, her publisher said on Tuesday.Munro had died at her home in Port Hope, Ontario, said Kristin Cochrane, chief executive officer of McClelland & Stewart.""Alice's writing inspired countless writers ... and her work leaves an indelible mark on our literary landscape,"" she said in a statement.The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing family members, said Munro had died on Monday after suffering from dementia for at least a decade.Munro published more than a dozen collections of short stories and was honored with the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.Her stories explored sex, yearning, discontent, aging, moral conflict and other themes in rural settings with which she was intimately familiar - villages and farms in the Canadian province of Ontario. She was adept at fully developing complex characters within the limited pages of a short story.""Alice Munro was a Canadian literary icon. For six decades, her short stories captivated hearts around Canada and the world,"" Canadian Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge said on the X social media network.Munro, who wrote about ordinary people with clarity and realism, was often likened to Anton Chekhov , the 19th century Russian known for his brilliant short stories - a comparison the Swedish Academy cited in honoring her with the Nobel Prize.Calling her a ""master of the contemporary short story,"" the Academy also said: ""Her texts often feature depictions of everyday but decisive events, epiphanies of a kind, that illuminate the surrounding story and let existential questions appear in a flash of lightning.""In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation after winning the Nobel, Munro said, ""I think my stories have gotten around quite remarkably for short stories, and I would really hope that this would make people see the short story as an important art, not just something that you played around with until you'd got a novel written.""Her works included: ""Dance of the Happy Shades"" (1968), ""Lives of Girls and Women"" (1971), ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" (1978), ""The Moons of Jupiter"" (1982), ""Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage"" (2001), ""Runaway"" (2004), ""The View from Castle Rock"" (2006), ""Too Much Happiness"" (2009) and ""Dear Life"" (2012).The characters in her stories were often girls and women who lead seemingly unexceptional lives but struggle with tribulations ranging from sexual abuse and stifling marriages to repressed love and the ravages of aging.""Last month I reread all of Alice Munro's books. I felt the need to be close to her. Every time I read her is a new experience. Every time changes me. She will live forever,"" leading Canadian author Heather O'Neill said in a post on X.Munro's story of a woman who starts losing her memory and agrees to enter a nursing home titled ""The Bear Came Over the Mountain,"" from ""Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage,"" was adapted into the Oscar-nominated 2006 film ""Away From Her,"" directed by fellow Canadian Sarah Polley.Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood , writing in the Guardian after Munro won the Nobel, summarized her work by saying: ""Shame and embarrassment are driving forces for Munro's characters, just as perfectionism in the writing has been a driving force for her: getting it down, getting it right, but also the impossibility of that. Munro chronicles failure much more often than she chronicles success, because the task of the writer has failure built in.""American novelist Jonathan Franzen wrote in 2005, ""Reading Munro puts me in that state of quiet reflection in which I think about my own life: about the decisions I've made, the things I've done and haven't done, the kind of person I am, the prospect of death.""The short story, a style more popular in the 19th and early 20th century, has long taken a back seat to the novel in popular tastes - and in attracting awards. But Munro was able to infuse her short stories with a richness of plot and depth of detail usually more characteristic of full-length novels.""For years and years, I thought that stories were just practice, 'til I got time to write a novel. Then I found that they were all I could do and so I faced that. I suppose that my trying to get so much into stories has been a compensation,"" Munro told the New Yorker magazine in 2012.She was the second Canadian-born writer to win the Nobel literature prize but the first with a distinctly Canadian identity. Saul Bellow, who won in 1976, was born in Quebec but raised in Chicago and was widely seen as an American writer.Munro also won the Man Booker International Prize in 2009 and the Giller Prize - Canada's most high-profile literary award - twice.Alice Laidlaw was born to a hard-pressed family of farmers on July 10, 1931, in Wingham, a small town in the region of southwestern Ontario that serves as the setting for many of her stories, and started writing in her teens.Munro originally began writing short stories while a stay-at-home mother. She intended to someday write a novel, but said that with three children she was never able to find the time necessary. Munro began building a reputation when her stories started getting published in the New Yorker in the 1970s.She married James Munro in 1951 and moved to Victoria, British Columbia, where the two ran a bookstore. They had four daughters - one died just hours after being born - before divorcing in 1972. Afterward, Munro moved back to Ontario. Her second husband, geographer Gerald Fremlin, died in April 2013.Munro in 2009 revealed she had undergone heart bypass surgery and had been treated for cancer.","Canadian writer Alice Munro has died at the age of 92, her publisher says.

"How is Pakistan buying fighter jets, submarines despite the economic crisis?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/how-is-pakistan-buying-fighter-jets-submarines-despite-the-economic-crisis/articleshow/110059597.cms,"Despite facing a dire economic situation with a foreign debt totaling $124.5 billion, equivalent to 42% of its GDP, Pakistan is persistently expanding its military capabilities, notably through substantial arms imports and collaborations with China. A report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) indicates that between 2019 and 2023, China accounted for 82% of Pakistan’s arms imports, reflecting a deepening military relationship between the two nations.""China is strongly contributing to the strengthening of Pakistan’s military by providing fighter jets, warships, missile technology, drones, etc.This is part of China’s strategy to counter the influence and power of Quad-4 (that includes India) and the West’s other regional alliances,"" an opinion piece in the EurAsian Times said.During President Xi Jinping’s 2015 visit to Pakistan, a significant agreement was forged for China to construct eight Hangor-class submarines for Pakistan, enhancing its naval power. ""The submarines will play a pivotal role in maintaining peace and stability in the region. It would add a new dimension to the ever-tested Pakistan-China friendship,” said Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Pakistani Chief of Naval Staff. This deal is part of China's broader strategy to counterbalance the influence of the Quad alliance and Western powers in the region.Amidst this backdrop of military enhancement, Pakistan grapples with an acute economic crisis , exacerbated by last year's devastating floods which led to a severe reduction in the GDP growth projection from 5% to 0.29%. The financial strain is further highlighted by a comment from the Business Standard, noting, ""Pakistan has no food for its people but purchases weapons."" The national budget reflects a 15.4% increase in defense spending, totaling 1804 billion rupees, even as the nation contends with skyrocketing inflation and widespread poverty.The economic hardships have led to public discontent, with Pakistani media reporting severe shortages of basic necessities such as food and medicines. Many believe that the real power in Pakistan lies with the military, which commands a significant portion of the national budget and operates vast revenue-generating enterprises. This perception is reinforced by international discussions, such as those held by the IMF, which highlight the disproportionate allocation of resources to the military at the expense of civil needs, the EurAsian Times report said.Adding to the controversy, recent reports from the BBC and other media outlets have suggested that despite Pakistan’s official stance of neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, there have been covert operations involving the supply of arms to Ukraine. These reports allege that under American pressure, Pakistan engaged in secret deals that not only violated its declared neutrality but also provided substantial profits from arms sales.","Pakistan is persistently expanding its military capabilities, notably through substantial arms imports and collaborations with China.

"Pakistan PM Shehbaz approves PKR 2,300 crore for POK to halt protests",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-clears-cash-to-calm-pok/articleshow/110093460.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif approved Monday around $82.6 million (Pak Rs 2,300cr) for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to halt violent protests and strikes against escalating electricity tariffs , flour prices and taxes. The protests have left a police officer dead and 90 others, mostly cops, injured in the last few days.The growing unrest poses a grave challenge to Pakistan’s military, which maintains a significant presence in the region to guard the Line of Control with India.On Monday, protesters led by Awami Action Committee (AAC), an activist group that has united people to demand lower rates for essentials, continued a march to regional capital Muzaffarabad after negotiations with the govt ended in deadlock.The stalemate prompted PM Sharif, already under pressure over postponement of Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman’s crucial visit to Pakistan later this month, to clear the grant for PoK at a special meeting in Islamabad. The meeting was attended by PoK’s PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, local ministers and other top figures. Following the meeting, PoK PM Haq announced cuts in bread prices and electricity tariffs.Meanwhile, mobile and internet services suspended in PoK a day earlier have not been restored in most parts. Govt offices, markets, trade centres and educational institutes also remained shut.Although there have been no calls for independence in the current wave of turmoil, locals said the protests reflected a general feeling of discontent with Islamabad. In the past, Islamabad had come under fire for suppressing regional movements that demanded total independence.The recent crisis began Friday when AAC started a Muzaffarabad strike that soon snowballed into violent clashes with law-enforcement officials. The detention of over 70 activists fuelled the unrest. The movement announced its march on Muzaffarabad after talks between AAC’s core committee and PoK’s chief secretary, Dawood Bareach, in Rawalakot ended inconclusively.PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari vowed to address the “genuine demands” of protesters, urging all to exercise restraint and resolve issues through dialogue.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif approved around $82.6 million (Pak Rs 2,300cr) for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to halt violent protests and strikes.

Pakistan's Gwadar port exposes China's Belt and Road failure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-gwadar-port-exposes-chinas-belt-and-road-failure/articleshow/110100113.cms,"'Investors thought Gwadar would become Dubai'

China investing heavily in its Belt and Road network

Gwadar performs worse than other new ports

CPEC hampered by political, economic instability

China learning from its mistakes in Pakistan

Unsustainable investment pushes countries into debt

In November 2016, Gwadar port symbolized stability, peace and prosperity for Pakistan — at least according to then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.""This day is the dawn of a new era,"" he told the opening ceremony crowd, which had gathered to witness a row of Chinese trucks arriving to load cargo onto the first-ever container ship to pass through the port.It was the official launch of the port's operations nearly a decade after its completion. The ceremony also marked the start of the prestigious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), part of China's global collection of infrastructure projects and trade networks known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Yet today, nearly eight years later, this new era has yet to dawn. A DW analysis shows what went wrong.The idea behind the CPEC was to connect China's western Xinjiang province with the sea via Pakistan. This would shorten trade routes for China and help avoid the contentious Malacca Strait choke point, a narrow waterway between Malaysia and Sumatra that links the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Pakistan, meanwhile, would benefit from increases in trade, infrastructure and industry along the 2,000-kilometer corridor (1,240 miles), all financed by China.In addition to the already established port of Karachi, Gwadar was chosen to connect the corridor to the global shipping network. The small fishing city lies near the Iranian border, some 500 kilometers away from Karachi.Gwadar's recently built deep-sea port, completed in 2007 and handed over to a Chinese operating company in 2013, was to become the heart of the CPEC. It would be integrated into a new special economic zone that would transform Gwardar into a bustling port city.The port has potential, said Azeem Khalid, an assistant professor of international relations at COMSATS University Islamabad who studies Chinese investments in Pakistan. ""It is a natural deep-sea port which can host bigger ships than Karachi. It sits at the crossroads of the global oil trade. And it would consolidate China's regional interests,"" he told DW.At home, China has already proven it can transform sleepy fishing villages into economic powerhouses. Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone, is the best example. In just four decades, the city's population grew from around 60,000 inhabitants to more than 17 million today.""Back then, investors thought Gwadar would become the next Dubai,"" said Khalid.Pakistan is not alone in pursuing this vision. All over the world, governments are hoping to boost their economies through new and expanded ports and other infrastructure projects — and Chinese banks are more than willing to provide financing. Chinese companies often build and operate the ports as well.DW has collated information on at least 38 ports that have been built with Chinese investment since 2000; an additional 43 ports are planned or in construction. Seventy-eight existing ports also have Chinese stakeholders, DW found.These deals are lucrative for China, said Jacob Mardell, a former analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think tank, and a journalist covering the BRI.""This model almost kind of acts as a subsidy for Chinese companies,"" he told DW. He explained that Chinese banks loan money to governments that then give that money to Chinese construction companies and pay the loan back to the bank over time. This means the money essentially never leaves China, ""while the bill is ultimately footed by taxpayers in other countries.""One common pattern appears to be building new ports relatively close to already established ones, as is the case with Gwadar and Karachi. The new ports are often meant to supplement or replace the older, less efficient ones over time.This is also the case in Cameroon and Nigeria, for instance. In Cameroon, the newly built port of Kribi is set to replace the congested and far too shallow port of Douala, while in Nigeria, the port of Lagos is supplemented by the just-opened Lekki deep-sea port, less than 100 kilometers away. Both ports were financed and built by Chinese state-owned companies.Similarly, in 2017, the government of Sri Lanka granted China a 99-year lease and majority stake in its relatively new Hambantota port, which was originally intended to supplement the country's main port of Colombo.Lekki port received 26 ships in 2023, its first year of operation, according to ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic. It's a modest number compared to bigger ports — but Gwadar, despite being completed in 2007, has only logged 22 ships in its best year to date. It has also failed to attract any regularly scheduled deep-sea shipping lines.This means Gwadar processes almost no cargo that could generate income for Pakistan — or, for that matter, for the Chinese operating company. And it's no wonder: Gwadar is operating at very limited capacity. The port's three berths, where loading and unloading takes place, can handle 137,000 standard 20-foot shipping containers per year. In contrast, Karachi and its 33 berths can handle the equivalent of 4.2 million 20-foot containers per year.While ports like Kribi or Lekki are comparatively small, they outshine Gwadar, the supposed new centerpiece of trade for South and Central Asia.Khalid told DW that although Gwadar has the potential to eventually surpass Karachi, a lack of investment is holding it back. A $1.6 billion (€1.5 billion) expansion was promised in 2015, but little progress appears to have been made at the port since then. Much of the supporting infrastructure, including roads and railways needed to transport cargo to and from Gwadar, is also missing.Publicly, investors like the China Pakistan Investment Corporation still claim Gwadar port is ""becoming a focal point for trade and investment in the region."" But the empty port site suggests the opposite.Mardell and Khalid said that behind the scenes, both Pakistan and China have become disillusioned with the project.""Jobs promises were not met. Industrial promises were not met. The business opportunities for Pakistanis were not met,"" said Khalid. ""They [China] promised nine special economic zones. Not one is fully functional to date.""The of development in Gwadar broadly mirrors the situation in the rest of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. ""CPEC has had problems since its inception,"" said Mardell.Some of these problems are specific to the border region of Balochistan, where Gwadar is situated. It is among the poorest regions of Pakistan and has strong separatist militias that commonly carry out attacks, including some that have specifically targeted Chinese nationals. In turn, the militias have been violently suppressed by the Pakistani military.At the national level, Pakistan has been experiencing a severe economic crisis in recent years, and the country is still struggling to stabilize politically after the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022.""Since the political and security situation in Pakistan has deteriorated more recently, that's hampered CPEC even more,"" said Mardell.On the Chinese side, Mardell thinks decision-makers might have miscalculated.""When it comes to investment decisions, the Chinese are famously not risk-averse,"" he told DW. He says ""basically unlimited"" state backing for state-owned investment and construction companies, coupled with the political will to rapidly step up competition with Western economies, has led China to fund even very risky projects in less stable countries worldwide.""I just don't think they fully understood the situation in Pakistan going in,"" said Mardell, though he believes this might change for other projects going forward. ""I think they've learned from their mistakes with the BRI and with CPEC, and they're probably more reluctant to commit capital nowadays.""In the last few years, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, China's spending on BRI projects has slowed. But while the country may now be more selective in which projects it funds, it is starting to invest more again, with total BRI investment amounts having reached pre-pandemic levels.Still, countries like Pakistan are now stuck paying back large amounts of debt to Chinese lenders. ""Pakistan has to pay billions of dollars back in loans, because of reckless investments in the name of CPEC,"" said Khalid.Similar cases have previously led to criticism that China is conducting debt-trap diplomacy, allowing partner countries to go into unsustainable amounts of debt to gain political influence.Moreover, part of the revenue from the newly built projects also goes back to China.""China gets the lion's share of everything,"" Khalid said, referring to CPEC investments. With Gwadar port, for instance, 90% of the quite limited revenue goes to the Chinese operating company. The Pakistani government receives 10%, while nothing goes to the Balochi regional government.Mardell said that the CPEC and Gwadar port with it will likely continue despite all its issues.""There's no way that China will lose face and admit that it's a disaster. And pulling out of CPEC and abandoning Pakistan isn't an option now. They're in too deep, and Pakistan is too important an ally,"" he said.Instead, he thinks it's likely China will continue to drag its feet on large investments in Pakistan, but still show token amounts of effort to keep the project going.Yet, he said, there's still a chance for Gwadar. ""If the situation in Pakistan changes for the better, then maybe CPEC will make progress.""","Gwadar port was to become the heart of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

The agency said he had attempted to smuggle 100 migrants to the UK in small boats and trucks.The number of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats has soared in recent years as individuals fleeing war, the effects of climate change, and economic uncertainty have sought a better life in Britain.They pay smugglers thousands of dollars for the crossing, hoping to reunite with family members or find work in a country where immigration enforcement is seen as weak and where migrant groups from all over the world can easily blend into society.Last month, the UK Parliament approved controversial legislation allowing the government to deport to Rwanda those who enter the country illegally. Hours later, five people, including a 7-year-old girl, died while crossing the English Channel in an overloaded inflatable boat.Many of the would-be migrants hail from Iraqi's northern Kurdish region.While the region is relatively more prosperous and stable than other parts of the country, increasing unemployment and corruption issues are driving many young Kurds to undertake the dangerous journey.In November 2021, 16 Iraqi Kurds were among a group of 27 people who died while attempting to cross the channel.","Barzan Majeed, known as ""the Scorpion,"" was arrested in the area of Sulaymaniyah.

US considers sending another patriot missile battery to Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-considers-sending-another-patriot-missile-battery-to-ukraine/articleshow/110132411.cms,"The Biden administration is working to send an additional Patriot air-defense battery to Ukraine , people familiar with the matter said, as the US and its allies scramble to meet the country’s demand for more air defenses to repel an intensified Russian assault.The US is seeking to send a single battery along with radars, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.Ukraine’s European allies are also working on plans to send Kyiv additional air-defense systems from their stocks, the people said.This week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is visiting Kyiv, that his country needed two Patriot systems just for Kharkiv, the location of a new Russian offensive.Spokespeople for the White House National Security Council and Pentagon didn’t immediately comment.The Zelenskiy government has appealed to several allies for more of the $1 billion Patriot batteries and other air-defense systems. The US announced in 2022 it was sending one Patriot battery and has kept up a steady supply of missiles to supply what’s believed to be two other systems in the country as well. Germany committed last month to send another Patriot system.The Patriot is costly to make and maintain, and most of the dozens of systems in use are already spoken for. That’s provoked growing frustration from Ukrainian officials, who have argued that European allies especially ought to be able to spare some of the systems.“I feel myself hitting the wall with my own head, although I’m a diplomat, and that means I have to dismantle the wall brick by brick,” Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the Washington Post in April. “But since this kind of diplomacy doesn’t work, I feel like hitting the wall. I just don’t understand why it’s not happening.”A Patriot battery includes radars and control stations to identify, track and target enemy weapons, missile launchers and support vehicles. The system’s missiles are manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp., while Raytheon Technologies Corp. makes the radar and ground-control elements of the system.The funds for a new Patriot system would likely come out of the $61 billion assistance package recently approved by Congress.“Patriots and other sophisticated air defenses – they do more than protect soldiers and save civilian lives,” Blinken said in a speech in Kyiv on Tuesday. “They create umbrellas of safety under which Ukrainian workers and entrepreneurs can adapt, innovate, build, and attract more foreign investment.”“That’s why we’re working relentlessly with allies and partners to procure more air defense, and to do it fast,” he said.The US has been nudging allies to send Patriots to Ukraine as “a matter of utmost priority,” Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, said Monday.“And beyond Patriots, we’re looking for other systems, as well, because we believe that there are a number of allies who have capabilities they could share and ways in which the United States could help them with their air defense needs as a backfill,” Sullivan said.Strengthening Ukraine’s air defenses has been a priority for the White House since Congress passed the national security package.","The US is seeking to send a single battery along with radars, people say.

Michael Cohen says he and Trump discussed porn star payment plot at White House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/michael-cohen-says-he-and-trump-discussed-porn-star-payment-plot-at-white-house/articleshow/110126702.cms,"'A total disaster'

NEW YORK: Donald Trump 's former fixer Michael Cohen told jurors on Tuesday about a 2017 Oval Office meeting where the then-newly elected US president confirmed a plan to reimburse Cohen secretly for a hush money payment to a porn star.Cohen, the prosecution's star witness at Trump's criminal trial in New York, also acknowledged lying on multiple occasions - including under oath - but emphasized that he did so out of loyalty to Trump, as prosecutors sought to pre-empt an expected defense attack on Cohen's credibility.In his first day as a witness on Monday, Cohen laid out in painstaking detail how Trump ordered him just before the November 2016 election to pay the adult film actress Stormy Daniels - ""Just do it,"" Cohen remembered Trump saying - to keep her story about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter under wraps.Cohen's $130,000 payment in October 2016 is at the heart of Trump's historic trial, now in its fifth week.Trump, 77, the 2024 Republican presidential candidate, has pleaded not guilty and denies any sexual encounter with Daniels. He has characterized the case as a partisan attempt to interfere with his campaign to take back the White House he lost in 2020 to Democratic President Joe Biden.Prosecutors say Trump paid Cohen back after the election by creating false records indicating they were for legal fees. Those disguised reimbursements provide the basis for the 34 counts of falsifying business records that Trump faces.In testimony on Tuesday, Cohen recounted an Oval Office meeting in February 2017 where Trump told him that Cohen would soon receive the first monthly installments of a bonus package, which Cohen said included reimbursements for the Daniels payment.Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger walked Cohen through a series of invoices and checks - some signed by Trump himself - that Cohen said were falsely marked as paying to retain him for legal services.""There was no retainer agreement, was there?"" Hoffinger asked.""No, ma'am,"" Cohen replied.Cohen, 57, said he lied multiple times to Congress during an investigation into Trump's Russia ties, eventually pleading guilty to perjury. He also told jurors he lied repeatedly about the payment to Daniels, telling journalists Trump had no involvement.In 2018, after the Justice Department began investigating the Daniels payment, FBI agents raided Cohen's home. He said he called Trump in a panic.""He said to me, 'Don't worry, I'm the president of the United States, there's nothing here, everything is going to be OK, stay tough, you're going to be OK,'"" Cohen said. That was the last time they spoke directly, Cohen added.Instead, Cohen testified, a lawyer named Robert Costello who was close to Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani offered a ""back channel"" to Trump. In emails shown to jurors, Costello passed along Giuliani's assurances that he was loved and had ""friends in high places.""Meanwhile, Trump was defending Cohen on social media and decrying the idea that he might ""flip"" and cooperate with prosecutors. It all added up to a ""pressure campaign"" to keep Cohen in line, he said.But he eventually decided to cooperate after speaking with his family. ""It was about time to listen to them, to be loyal to my daughter, my wife, my son and the country,"" Cohen said.Cohen pleaded guilty to federal crimes in 2018, including offenses related to the Daniels payment, and said Trump - who was not charged - directed him to make the payment.His checkered history is sure to draw a bruising cross-examination from Trump's lawyers, who have already cast him as a liar and convict who cannot be trusted.A day after several Republican lawmakers attended the trial in support of Trump, US House Speaker Mike Johnson joined him and later criticized the case outside the court.While Cohen testified on Tuesday, a mid-level appeals court denied Trump's latest effort to throw out a gag order that Trump asserted violated his right to free speech.The order, imposed by Justice Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the trial, prohibits Trump from making public comments about jurors, witnesses, and families of the judge and prosecutors if meant to interfere with the case.On Monday, Cohen said Trump approved multiple payments to keep damaging sex-scandal stories out of the public eye, lest they torpedo his presidential campaign.""Everything required Mr. Trump's sign-off,"" Cohen said.Cohen said that he, Trump and tabloid publisher David Pecker had secretly agreed in 2015 to help Trump's campaign.That arrangement included a $150,000 payment from Pecker's company to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to buy her story about a year-long affair she said she had with Trump, Cohen said. Trump has also denied that relationship.As with Daniels, the intent was to acquire the rights to the story only to bury it, a practice Pecker called ""catch and kill.""In October 2016, Cohen said, he learned Daniels was shopping her story to tabloids. At the time, the Trump campaign was in crisis mode after the release of an audio recording in which Trump bragged about grabbing women's genitals.""He said to me, 'This is a disaster, a total disaster. Women are going to hate me,' Cohen told jurors Trump had said.Cohen testified that Trump was solely concerned about the impact Daniels' story could have on his White House bid - and not, as Trump's lawyers have suggested, about the effect on his wife and family. That distinction is crucial to the prosecution's case.Under New York law, falsifying business records can be elevated from a misdemeanor to a felony if the crime helped conceal another offense. In Trump's case, prosecutors have argued that the payment was effectively a secret contribution to his campaign, violating federal and state laws.The Manhattan trial is considered less consequential than three other criminal prosecutions Trump faces, all of which are mired in delays.The other cases charge Trump with trying to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat and mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Trump pleaded not guilty to all three.","Donald Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen told jurors on Tuesday about a 2017 Oval Office meeting where the then-newly elected US president confirmed a plan to reimburse Cohen secretly for a hush money payment to a porn star.

Biden bans Chinese bitcoin mine near US nuclear missile base,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-bans-chinese-bitcoin-mine-near-us-nuclear-missile-base/articleshow/110126602.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Monday ordered a company with Chinese origins to shut down and sell the Wyoming cryptocurrency mine it built a mile from an Air Force base that controls nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles.The cryptomining facility, which operates high-powered computers in a data center near the FE Warren base in Cheyenne, ""presents a national security risk to the United States ,"" the president said in an executive order, because its equipment could be used for surveillance and espionage.The New York Times reported last October that Microsoft, which operates a nearby data center supporting the Pentagon, had flagged the Chinese-connected cryptocurrency mine to the federal Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, warning that it could enable the Chinese to ""pursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations."" An investigation by the committee identified risks to national security, according to the president's order.The order did not detail those risks. But Microsoft's report to the federal committee, obtained last year by the Times, said, ""We suggest the possibility that the computing power of an industrial-level cryptomining operation, along with the presence of an unidentified number of Chinese nationals in direct proximity to Microsoft's Data Center and one of three strategic-missile bases in the US, provides significant threat vectors.""Now, the mine must immediately cease operations, and the owners must remove all their equipment within 90 days and sell or transfer the property within 120 days, according to the order, which cites the risks of the facility's ""foreign-sourced"" mining equipment. A vast majority of the machinery powering cryptomining operations across the United States is manufactured by Chinese companies.Cryptomining operations are housed in large warehouses or shipping containers packed with specialized computers that typically run around the clock, performing trillions of calculations per second, hunting for a sequence of numbers that will reward them with new cryptocurrency. The most common is bitcoin, currently worth more than $60,000 apiece. Crypto mines consume an enormous amount of electricity: At full capacity, the one in Cheyenne would draw as much power as 55,000 homes.Chinese-owned cryptocurrency mines have boomed in the United States since the facilities were effectively banned in China in 2021. While some cryptomining has since restarted in China, Chinese crypto entrepreneurs are drawn to the United States for its relatively cheap electricity and well-developed legal system.The Times found Chinese-owned or -operated bitcoin mines in at least 12 states, including Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming, that together use as much power as 1.5 million homes. Some are owned by people or companies with links to the Chinese government or the Communist Party. Until recently, the main supplier of equipment for the mines operated from an office in a Communist Party facility on Hainan Island, the Times found.Biden's order comes on the heels of his signing a bipartisan bill in late April banning the social media app TikTok in the United States unless its Chinese owner sells it.This is also the second time in recent weeks that Chinese-owned cryptomining operations have been targeted by elected officials.This month, Arkansas' Republican governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders , signed two laws restricting foreign ownership of cryptomining operations in the state. The legislation prohibits cryptomine ownership by foreign nationals from China, Iran, Cuba and other countries subject to State Department rules known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.Arkansas has seen a large influx of bitcoin mining operations in recent years. In October, the Times reported that Chinese investors with ties to the authoritarian government were operating at least three mines in Arkansas. A former employee connected to the operations wrote of scouring ""over 200 target mining sites"" in more than 10 states.The laws restricting ownership of cryptomining operations in Arkansas are intended to amend last year's so-called Right to Mine law, which offered broad protections to the industry by limiting local regulation, and set off a fierce backlash among residents near the mines. One of those operations, with connections to the Chinese nationals, is the target of a lawsuit by residents who say the incessant whine from the thousands of fans cooling the computers has ruined their lives and depressed property values. In addition to new restrictions on noisy operations, the amended law requires cryptomines owned in any part by foreign nationals subject to the arms regulations to completely divest within one year.Biden's order is directed at an offshore company called MineOne Partners Limited and related MineOne entities registered in Delaware. A lawsuit against MineOne filed by a Wyoming cryptocurrency company compelled the disclosure of its owners, which included Chinese nationals. In 2022 Bit Origin Ltd., a former Chinese pork producer that pivoted to cryptocurrency mining, became a partner in a MineOne entity and built the mine, which began operating in early 2023.Li Jiaming, president of Bit Origin Ltd., was not immediately available to comment. In an interview last year, Li said investors had chosen the site because they had secured a contract with the local power company to supply its electricity, not because of its proximity to the base or the data center.","Chinese-owned cryptocurrency mines have boomed in the United States since the facilities were effectively banned in China in 2021.

First crewed flight of Boeing spacecraft delayed again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/first-crewed-flight-of-boeing-spacecraft-delayed-again/articleshow/110126586.cms,"WASHINGTON: The first crewed launch of Boeing 's Starliner spaceship to the International Space Station has been postponed again due to a technical snafu, the company said Tuesday.The next attempt will be May 21 at the earliest.The high-stakes mission was already called off last week, with two astronauts strapped in and ready to fly.That was because engineers detected a problem with a valve that regulates liquid oxygen pressure on the Atlas V rocket meant to propel Starliner into orbit.The valve was replaced and a new launch date of May 17 was set.But a new problem emerged -- a small helium leak in a part of Starliner called the service module, which holds instruments used to control and operate the spacecraft .Engineers need to carry out tests as they try to fix the problem, Boeing said in a statement.""Helium is used in spacecraft thruster systems to allow the thrusters to fire and is not combustible or toxic,"" Boeing said.Liftoff from Florida is now scheduled for 4:43 pm (2043 GMT) on May 21.Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have returned to Houston as teams work to fix this new glitch and will return to Florida over the next few days, Boeing said.The mission has already faced years of delays and comes at a challenging time for Boeing, as a safety crisis engulfs the century-old aerospace titan's commercial aviation arm.NASA is banking on Starliner's success in order to achieve its goal of certifying a second commercial vehicle to carry crews to the International Space Station.Elon Musk's SpaceX achieved the feat with its Dragon capsule in 2020, ending a nearly decade-long dependence on Russian rockets following the end of the Space Shuttle program.","The first crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner spaceship to the International Space Station has been postponed again.

"Trump hush money trial: Appeals court upholds gag order, Cohen gives more testimony",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-hush-money-trial-appeals-court-upholds-gag-order-cohen-gives-more-testimony/articleshow/110125906.cms,"NEW YORK: New York appeals court on Tuesday upheld the gag order in Donald Trump's hush money trial , finding that the judge ""properly determined"" that Trump's public statements ""posed a significant threat to the integrity of the testimony of witnesses and potential witnesses in this case as well."" Trump had asked the state's intermediate appeals court to lift or modify the gag order, which bars him from commenting publicly about jurors, witnesses and others connected to the case, including Judge Juan M.Merchan's family and prosecutors other than District Attorney Alvin Bragg.At an emergency hearing last month, just days before the trial started, Trump's lawyers argued that the gag order is an unconstitutional curb on the presumptive Republican nominee's free speech rights while he's campaigning for president and fighting criminal charges.In its ruling, the five-judge appeals panel noted that Trump wasn't claiming that the gag order had infringed on his right to a fair trial. Rather, Trump's lawyers argued that prohibiting him from commenting restricted his ability to engage in protected political speech and could adversely impact on his campaign.The appeals court ruled that Merchan ""properly weighed"" Trump's free speech rights against the ""historical commitment to ensuring the fair administration of justice in criminal cases, and the right of persons related or tangentially related to the criminal proceedings from being free from threats, intimidation, harassment, and harm.""Trump's fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen returned to the witness stand Tuesday, testifying in detail about how the former president was linked to all aspects of the hush money scheme that prosecutors say was an illegal effort to purchase and then bury stories that threatened his 2016 campaign.Trump, the first former U.S. president to go on trial, was joined at the courthouse by an entourage of GOP lawmakers that included House Speaker Mike Johnson and others considered vice presidential contenders for Trump's 2024 campaign. Their presence was a not-so-subtle show of support meant not just for Trump, but also for voters tuning in to trial coverage and for the jurors deciding Trump's fate.As proceedings began, Johnson held a news conference outside the courthouse, using his powerful pulpit to attack the U.S. judicial system. It was a remarkable moment in American politics as the person second in line to the presidency sought to turn his political party against the rule of law by declaring the Manhattan criminal trial illegitimate.""I do have a lot of surrogates, and they're speaking very beautifully,"" Trump said before court as the group gathered in the background. ""And they come ... from all over Washington. And they're highly respected, and they think this is the greatest scam they've ever seen.""Cohen, meanwhile, resumed his place on the witness stand as prosecutor Susan Hoffinger worked to paint him as a Trump loyalist who committed crimes on behalf of the former president.Cohen told jurors that he lied to Congress during an investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign to protect Trump. He also described for jurors the April 2018 raid by law enforcement on his apartment, law firm, a hotel room where he stayed and a bank where he stashed valuables.""How to describe your life being turned upside-down. Concerned. Despondent. Angry,"" he said.""Were you frightened?"" Hoffinger asked.""Yes, ma'am.""But he said he was heartened by a phone call from Trump that he said gave him reassurance and convinced him to remain ""in the camp.""He said to me, Don't worry. I'm the president of the United States. There's nothing here. Everything's going to be OK. Stay tough. You're going to be OK,'"" Cohen testified.Cohen told jurors that ""I felt reassured because I had the president of the United States protecting me ... And so I remained in the camp.""But their relationship soured, and now Cohen is one of Trump's most vocal critics. His testimony is central to the Manhattan case.Cohen testified that after paying out $130,000 to porn actress Stormy Daniels in order to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual encounter, Trump promised to reimburse him. He said Trump was constantly apprised of the behind-the-scenes efforts to bury stories feared to be harmful to the campaign.Jurors followed along as Hoffinger, in a methodical and clinical fashion, walked Cohen through that reimbursement process. It was an attempt to show what prosecutors say was a lengthy deception to mask the true purpose of the payments. As jurors were shown business records and other paperwork, Cohen explained their purpose and reiterated again and again that the payments were reimbursements for the hush money. They weren't for legal services he provided or for a retainer, he said.It's an important distinction, because prosecutors allege that the Trump records falsely described the purpose of the payments as legal expenses. These records form the basis of 34 felony counts charging Trump with falsifying business records. All told, Cohen was paid $420,000, with funds drawn from a Trump personal account.""Were the descriptions on this check stub false?"" Hoffinger asked.""Yes,"" Cohen said.""And again, there was no retainer agreement,"" Hoffinger asked.""Correct,"" Cohen replied.Trump has pleaded not guilty and also denies that any of the encounters took place.During his time on the witness stand, Cohen delivered matter-of-fact testimony that went to the heart of the former president's trial: ""Everything required Mr. Trump's sign-off,"" Cohen said. He told jurors that Trump did not want Daniels' account of a sexual encounter to get out. At the time, Trump was especially anxious about how the story would affect his standing with female voters.A similar episode occurred when Cohen alerted Trump that a Playboy model was alleging that she and Trump had an extramarital affair. ""Make sure it doesn't get released,"" was Cohen's message to Trump, according to testimony. The woman, Karen McDougal, was paid $150,000 in an arrangement that was made after Trump received a ""complete and total update on everything that transpired.""""What I was doing, I was doing at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump,"" Cohen testified.Prosecutors believe Cohen's insider knowledge is critical to their case. But their reliance on a witness with such a checkered past - Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payments - also carries sizable risks with a jury.The men, once so close that Cohen boasted that he would ""take a bullet"" for Trump, had no visible interaction inside the courtroom. The sedate atmosphere was a marked contrast from their last courtroom faceoff in October, when Trump walked out of the courtroom after his lawyer finished questioning Cohen during his civil fraud trial.Throughout Cohen's testimony Tuesday, Trump reclined in his chair with his eyes closed and his head tilted to the side. He shifted from time to time, occasionally leaning forward and opening his eyes, making a comment to his attorney before returning to his recline. Even some of the topics that have animated him the most as he campaigns didn't stir his attention.Trump's lawyers will get their chance to question Cohen as early as Tuesday, when they're expected to attack his credibility. He was disbarred, went to prison and separately pleaded guilty to lying about a Moscow real estate project on Trump's behalf.","An appeals court finds that the judge ""properly determined"" that Trump's public statements ""posed a significant threat to the integrity of the testimony of witnesses and potential witnesses in this case as well"" Trump had asked the state's intermediate appeals court to lift or modify the gag order, which bars him from commenting publicly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110125924,imgsize-112408,width-400,resizemode-4/110125924.jpg"

The individual and Russian companies involved are now sanctioned.Strabag is one of Europe's biggest construction firms and built the Olympic stadium for the Sochi winter games and luxury apartments in Moscow.Two years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, RBI's continued Russian presence underlines the ties between Moscow and Vienna - whether via Russian gas pipelines or Vienna serving as a hub for cash from Russia and former Soviet states.","The step concerns a recently aborted bid by Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International to buy a roughly $1.5 billion euro industrial stake linked to Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska.

China dismissed the case as a fabrication.Britain said on Tuesday it had summoned China's ambassador to say cyberattacks and reports of espionage links were not acceptable.Keast-Butler, who was appointed GCHQ chief last year, echoed Sunak in saying the next few years would be dangerous and transformational.""Russia and Iran pose immediate threats, but China is the 'epoch-defining' challenge,"" she said.US National Cyber Director Harry Coker told the conference that Chinese military hackers were circumventing US defences in cyberspace and targeting US interests at an ""unprecedented scale"".""In a crisis or conflict scenario, China could use their pre-positioned cyber capabilities to wreak havoc in civilian infrastructure and deter US military action,"" he said.US officials confronted Beijing last month about a sweeping cyberespionage campaign dubbed ""Volt Typhoon"" in which Chinese hackers broke into dozens of American critical infrastructure organisations, using a vast global network of compromised personal computers and servers.FBI Director Christopher Wray suggested it was linked to China's broader intent to deter the US from defending Taiwan. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Volt Typhoon was unrelated to China's government.The arrest of alleged Chinese spies, and accusations Chinese state-backed hackers stole data from Britain's elections watchdog and carried out surveillance operations, have increased strains in relations between Britain and China.Sunak said last month Chinese state-affiliated actors had conducted "" malicious cyber campaigns "" against British lawmakers and British media, citing government sources, said China was behind a hack on the British armed forces' payments system. Beijing said the accusations were absurd.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a press conference on Tuesday that Britain had repeatedly hyped allegations about Chinese spies and cyberattacks.","US and British officials warn of growing cyber threat from China.

Pak protestors call off march in PoK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-protestors-call-off-march-in-pok/articleshow/110126325.cms,"ISLAMABAD

: Protesters seeking subsidised wheat flour and reduction in electricity tariffs called off their demonstration in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) on Tuesday after days of clashes with police and Rangers, a paramilitary force, in which four people were killed and over 100 injured.The Awami Action Committee (AAC), an alliance of civil rights groups in the region, said the govt has accepted all its demands and called on protesters to return to their homes and businesses.On Monday, Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved $82.6-million to help meet most of their demands, which included subsidies on flour and electricity prices.Shaukat Nawaz Mir, the alliance’s head, however, demanded financial compensation for the families of three protesters and a police official who were killed in the violence that lasted for four days. The protesters were killed on Monday evening after the Rangers, en route to Muzaffarabad, opened fire on them when they were attacked, a local govt official said.The recent protests coincided with the visit of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission to negotiate a new long-term loan with Pakistan. The global lender has already warned that social unrest triggered by high cost of living could weigh on policy implementation, adding that fiscal slippages could present a challenge for the govt.","Protesters were seeking subsidised wheat flour and reduction in electricity tariffs.

Pakistanis own properties worth USD 12.5 billion in Dubai: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistanis-own-properties-worth-usd-12-5-billion-in-dubai-report/articleshow/110125151.cms,"ISLAMABAD: With cash-strapped Pakistan running from pillar to post to get loan, its rich nationals own between 17,000 to 22,000 properties worth USD 12.5 billion in Dubai, according to the leaked data used by an international consortium of journalists to access details of properties in Dubai, it emerged on Tuesday. According to Dawn.com, the leaked data provides a detailed overview of hundreds of thousands of properties in Dubai and information about their ownership or usage, largely from 2020 and 2022.It was obtained by the Centre for Advanced Defence Studies (C4ADS), a non-profit organisation based in Washington, DC, that researches international crime and conflict.The data was then shared with Norwegian financial outlet E24 and the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which coordinated an investigative project with media outlets from around the world. Titled 'Dubai Unlocked', the collaboration includes 74 partners from 58 countries.The website reported that the details of ""an astounding volume of leaked property data that includes over 17,000 properties listed as belonging to Pakistani nationals up to the spring of 2022"" were known to journalists from scores of media outlets around the world.It stated that while 17,000 Pakistani citizens are listed owners in the 2022 leak, academics using the data and additional sources put the actual number of Pakistani owners of residential property in Dubai at 22,000.They further estimate that the apartments and villas may have been worth more than USD 10 billion at the start of 2022, but with the more than 25 per cent increase in property prices over the last two years, the real worth of Pakistanis' residential properties in Dubai could now be well above USD 12.5 billion.""If we have the data you are talking about, as well as the information on residence status, we will make sure those who are eligible to pay tax in Pakistan on rental income or capital value are doing so,"" Malik Amjed Zubair Tiwana, chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), was quoted as saying by the news portal.""It may be a sensitive matter, and perhaps the law will have to change, but with political will we will go all out against tax evaders. The government is prepared for this.""He added that ""citizenship has no importance in tax law"" as taxation is linked to residence status. ""We have been trying to get information from the immigration department of Dubai to determine tax status, but it has not materialised.""Ali Rahim, tax lawyer and former Karachi Tax Bar Association president, said that the entire world income of resident Pakistanis is liable to be taxed in Pakistan, but they can get credit against their total tax payment for any taxes paid abroad.Pakistani residents (those in the country for more than 183 days per year) with assets abroad have to value them at the current exchange rate and pay one per cent tax on that if the value of the asset is more than Rs 100 million. This law is being challenged in the high courts and the Supreme Court.Non-resident or overseas Pakistanis are only liable to pay tax on income generated in Pakistan. They are not required to file a wealth statement or declare overseas assets.Dawn also clarified that a mere mention of someone in the data is not evidence in itself of financial crime or tax fraud. Nor does the data contain information such as residence status, sources of income, tax declarations of rental income or capital gains. In fact, several of those approached for comment on their properties said they were declared to the tax authorities.""But it does paint an astonishing picture of contrasts. Pakistan, a developing country teetering on the edge of economic collapse, begging international lenders and friendly countries for lifelines in single digit billions, features prominently in the data,"" according to the website.","Leaked data shows Pakistanis own between 17,000 to 22,000 properties worth USD 12.5 billion in Dubai.

Imran Khan asks Pak Army chief to apologize him for his 'illegal' abduction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khan-asks-pak-army-chief-to-apologize-him-for-his-illegal-abduction/articleshow/110121489.cms,"LAHORE : Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan , who has been in jail since August last in different cases, on Tuesday asked Army chief General Asim Munir to apologize to him for his ""illegal"" abduction and for backing the 'London Plan' and vowed not to cut a deal with the powerful military. ""On the morning of May 9, 2023, my illegal abduction from the High Court was part of the London Plan (to topple the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government and impose a hybrid system led by the Sharif family on the country), for which General Asim Munir should apologize to me,"" Khan said on X.It is believed that his family is running his social media account.Criticising Gen Munir, Khan said: ""It is the misfortune of this country that a self-proclaimed King (Gen Munir) has taken hold of all the decision-making. I am currently in prison because if I am free, it will challenge the power of that one person.""Khan said the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) - the media wing of the armed forces - and the Chief of Army Staff are making threatening political statements and involving the army in politics which is tarnishing the image of the army.The powerful Army, which has ruled the coup-prone country for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy.ISPR DG Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharif last week said that any dialogue with the PTI could happen only if it ""earnestly apologizes publicly in front of the nation, promises to adopt constructive politics, and forgoes politics of anarchy"".Khan said when political statements and press conferences are held, political parties have the right to respond to them.""When the government is given to people lacking democratic mandate, the country becomes an epicenter of corruption and chaos. The chaos that is seen in (Pakistan-occupied) Kashmir today is likely to spread across Pakistan. Form 47 (fake result) non-democratic governments have been established in the entire country.""When a government is elected democratically, it is backed by the people. People value their elected government and if any issues arise, it is resolved through dialogue,"" he said, adding that people place no trust in the imposed governments in Gilgit-Baltistan, PoK, Punjab, and Pakistan; hence the widespread unrest and frustration.He said further backlash will ensue against Form 47 governments when the budget is announced.He further said an artificial set-up has been imposed on the people in the country.""This government has absolutely no authority. An unconstitutional institution like SIFC (Special Investment Facilitation Council, an initiative of the army) has been imposed on Pakistan and no one dares to question it. It was established with the sole purpose of bringing investments, while the Pakistan Business Council has openly stated that investors are withdrawing their investments instead of investing in the country.""On the one hand, the nation was misled with the false hopes of the agricultural revolution and on the other hand, wheat importation to embezzle billions of rupees, has devastated the wheat farmer economically,"" he added.Khan said in this bogus setup, the government is given to those who have all their wealth lying outside in the form of dollars.""A leader has to make sacrifices and this group of Nawaz and Zardari will not sacrifice under any circumstances nor will they bring their money back to the country. General Musharraf and later ISI provided details to everyone including me on their looted money and today they have been imposed on us and their corruption charges are being cleared. The purpose of imposing this fake system on the nation is only to increase the power of this one man (Gen Munir) who has destroyed the entire country for his personal power,"" he said and vowed not to cut a deal with the military.""This country is my country and I will never leave it. Moreover, any deal is also out of the question. Pakistan is being run in a dictatorial manner. Our total revenue is 13.9 trillion rupees, while we have to pay 9.8 trillion rupees annually as interest. The country can never progress with such a punitive use of coercive measures,"" Khan said.","Imran Khan has been in jail since August last in different cases. He has asked Army chief General Asim Munir to apologize to him for his ""illegal"" abduction. Khan said the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) and the Chief of Army Staff are tarnishing the image of the army.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110121730,imgsize-37074,width-400,resizemode-4/110121730.jpg"

The paramilitary Rangers, which were called in to maintain law and order in the disputed region, came under attack while moving out of the region, the Dawn newspaper reported.Instead of exiting via Brarkot, the village bordering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the 19-vehicle convoy, including five trucks, chose to exit the region from Kohala, it said.As the convoy reached Muzaffarabad in a ""charged atmosphere"", it was pelted with rocks near Shorran da Nakka village, to which they responded with teargas and firing, the report said.After entering the city through the Western Bypass, the Rangers were welcomed with rocks again, prompting them to use teargas and bullets. The shelling was so intense that the entire neighbourhood reeled from it, the report said.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had yesterday approved a Pakistani Rs 23 billion subsidy for immediate release to the region after the negotiations between the protesters and the regional government ended in a deadlock.However, the government's decision to dole out the subsidy failed to pacify the region, the report said.The disputed region also witnessed clashes on Saturday between the police and activists of a rights movement, leaving at least one police officer dead and injuring over 100 people, mostly policemen. A completestrike has also been observed in the territory since Friday, bringing life to a halt.Shortly before the violence, Prime Minister Sharif and the disputed region's 'prime minister' Anwarul Haq after a meeting had approved the release of Pakistani Rs 23 billion for the region on account of power and wheat subsidies.The subsidised rate for 40kg flour will be Pakistani Rs 2,000, down from Pakistani Rs 3,100. The electricity tariff was reduced to Pakistani Rs 3, Rs 5 and Rs 6 per unit for up to 100, 300, and more than 300 units, respectively, the Dawn reported.The protest is led by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee ( JAAC ), which has traders at the forefront in most parts of the region, who have been seeking the provision of electricity as per hydropower generation cost in the region, subsidised wheat flour and an end to the privileges of the elite class.A long march led by the JAAC left for Muzaffarabad, the capital of PoK , on Monday as the wheel-jam strike entered its fourth day.The movement announced its march on Muzaffarabad after the talks between the JAAC core committee and Chief Secretary of the region Dawood Bareach ended in a stalemate.Expressing deep concern over the violent clashes between the police and the protesters, Prime Minister Sharif on Sunday said that there should be ""absolutely no tolerance for taking the law into one's own hands"".""I urge all parties to resort to a peaceful course of action for resolution of their demands. Despite the best efforts of detractors, the matter will hopefully be settled soon,"" he said.As part of his efforts to calm down tensions, President Asif Ali Zardari urged all the stakeholders to exercise restraint and resolve the issues through dialogue and mutual consultation.","Security forces open fire on protesters in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir's capital Muzaffarabad.

The Saudi ministers, seemingly, have convinced the crown prince that political situation in Pakistan is not stable, tensions run high between the military and jailed ex-PM Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), and it would be unwise for him to visit the country in the current situation,” said Shehbaz Gill , a PTI functionary and Imran’s former principal staff officer.Last month, PTI functionary Sher Afzal Marwat had alleged that Saudi Arabia was a “conduit” in the US-led operation to oust Imran’s govt in April 2022. Following his claim, PTI removed him from its core and political committee, also issuing a show-cause for trying to harm relations with Saudi Arabia.Recently, Marwat blamed the “Saudi influence” for his party dropping his name for chairmanship of public accounts committee (PAC) of parliament.While foreign ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said the revised schedule of the visit is still being worked out, govt sources maintained that there were some points on the economic front that still needed to be cleared between both sides before MBS finalised his tour.They said Saudi investors and businessmen, who recently toured Pakistan, are interested in some projects but the terms of the agreement have not yet been finalised.PM Shehbaz Sharif had extended an invitation to the crown prince to visit Pakistan during his official tour to Saudi Arabia.

Taiwan's government says that Beijing has no right to speak for or represent Taiwan on the international stage.Speaking to lawmakers at parliament, Wu said the WHO's director general should take the initiative to invite Taiwan to attend this month's WHA as an observer.The WHO should also ""let Taiwan fully participate in all the WHO's meetings, activities and systems, to put into effect the WHO's charter that health is a basic human right and achieve at an early date the 'Health for All' goal"", he added.He separately told reporters that Taiwan faced a ""very high level of difficulty"" in taking part in this year's WHA, but said it was winning more and more support from countries for its bid to be invited this year.The WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Earlier this month, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said the United States ""strongly encourages"" the WHO to reinstate Taiwan's invitation.This year's WHA starts May 27, just a week after Taiwan president-elect Lai Ching-te takes office. China has a strong dislike of Lai, who it believes is a ""dangerous separatist"" and has rebuffed his repeated calls for talks.Taiwan, which is allowed to attend some technical WHO meetings, says its exclusion hindered efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.",Taiwan is excluded from most international organisations because of objections by China.
