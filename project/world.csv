"Scorching, rocky planet twice Earth's size found to have thick atmosphere",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/scorching-rocky-planet-twice-earths-size-found-to-have-thick-atmosphere/articleshow/109963070.cms,"A thick atmosphere has been detected around a planet that's twice as big as Earth in a nearby solar system, scientist reported Wednesday. The so-called super Earth - known as 55 Cancri e - is among the few rocky planets outside our solar system with a significant atmosphere, wrapped a blanket of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Exact amounts are unclear.Earth's atmosphere is a blend of nitrogen, oxygen, argon and other gases.""It's probably the firmest evidence yet that this planet has an atmosphere,"" said Ian Crossfield, an astronomer who was not involved with the research, published in the journal Nature. Super Earth refers to a planet's size - bigger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. The boiling temperatures on this planet - which can reach as hot as 2,300C - mean that it is unlikely to host life.Instead, scientists say the discovery is a promising sign that other such rocky planets with thick atmospheres could exist that may be more hospitable. The exoplanet 41 light years away is eight times heavier than Earth and circles its star Copernicus so closely that it has permanent day and night sides. A light-year is nearly 9.7 trillion kms. Its surface is encrusted with magma oceans.To identify the makeup of its atmosphere, researchers studied Webb Space Telescope observations before and after the planet passed behind its star. They separated the light emitted from the planet versus its star and used the data to calculate the planet's temperature. There's evidence the planet's heat was being distributed more evenly across its surface - a party trick atmospheres are known for. Gases from its magma oceans may play a key role in holding its atmosphere steady. Exploring this super Earth may also yield clues to how Earth and Mars might have evolved. ""It's a rare window,"" said Renyu Hu from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab, who was part of the research.","55 Cancri e is among the few rocky planets outside our solar system with a significant atmosphere, wrapped in a blanket of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.

"After backlash, public drug use is back being a crime in Canada's British Columbia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/after-backlash-public-drug-use-is-back-being-a-crime-in-canadas-british-columbia/articleshow/109963062.cms,"OTTAWA: Canada govt on Tuesday walked back part of a programme allowing people in British Columbia to possess small amounts of drugs, including heroin and cocaine, without fear of criminal charges . At the request of the province and after public and political backlash, people in the province are no longer permitted to use drugs in public places.Under the changes, which went into effect immediately, adults will still be allowed to possess small amounts of drugs.But they will now have to use them in legal residences, at safe injection sites and at other harm reduction centres established by health authorities. The recriminalisation of public drug use in British Columbia underscores the difficulties that govts face as they grapple with the opioid crisis. Even in a province that has been a global pioneer of the harm reduction movement, an approach that seeks to reduce risky behaviour rather than to punish drug users, there are no easy answers. The province's coroner estimated that there were a record 2,511 toxic drug deaths last year. The goals of decriminalising possession were to enable police officers to focus their time on large drug distributors rather than users and encourage users to be open to treatment.","Canada govt on Tuesday walked back part of a programme allowing people in British Columbia to possess small amounts of drugs.

The US and others have long worried that the new pier at the Ream Naval Base, built with Chinese funding, could serve as a new outpost for the Chinese navy on the Gulf of Thailand, but Cambodia has said that would not happen. Asked about why the two ships had been there for five months, defence ministry spokesperson Gen Chhum Socheat said they were due to take part in a joint Cambodian-Chinese military exercise later this month, and that they were also involved in training Cambodian sailors. ""We have been clear that Cambodia is not allowing any foreign forces to be deployed on its territory,"" he said.He said the ships were also ""testing"" the new pier, and that they were on show for Cambodia, which was considering purchasing similar warships for its own navy. ""The ships are docked for the training period only, they are not staying permanently.""Controversy over Ream Naval Base initially arose in 2019 when Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of an agreement would allow China 30-year use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.

NEW DELHI: The trial of Kazakhstan’s former economy minister Kuandyk Bishimbayev for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova, has shocked the nation, with thousands calling for harsher penalties for domestic violence .CCTV footage depicted the minister dragging his wife by her hair, and subsequently punching and kicking her. Following the recorded incident, Nukenova succumbed to brain trauma.The footage, spanning eight hours, also captured Bishimbayev breaking down a door as Nukenova attempted to seek refuge in a bathroom.Nukenova, aged 31, was discovered dead in November within a restaurant owned by one of Bishimbayev’s relatives. Initially denying involvement, Bishimbayev confessed in court on Wednesday to assaulting her and inadvertently causing her demise.Bishimbayev's legal team contested medical evidence suggesting Nukenova died from repeated head trauma . They attempted to portray her as prone to jealousy and violence, despite no evidence from the restaurant's security cameras showing her attacking Bishimbayev.Bishimbayev, 44 years old, once celebrated as a modern, Western-educated figure within the Kazakhstani government under former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, was incarcerated for bribery in 2018. He was later granted a pardon, less than two years into his sentence.A 2018 study supported by UN Women revealed approximately 400 women in Kazakhstan die annually due to domestic violence, with many cases going unreported.In 2017, Kazakhstan decriminalized certain forms of domestic violence, categorizing them as causing ""minor"" physical damage, punishable by fines or brief imprisonment. This move mirrored Russia's actions that year, provoking outrage among advocates for women’s rights. Kazakhstan has since reversed this legislation, intensifying penalties for offenders and introducing new criminal charges, including harassment of minors.","Kuandyk Bishimbayev is on trial for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova.

US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall flew a fighter jet on Friday that was piloted by AI over the deserts in California, as reported by Fox news.Last month, Kendall announced his intention to pilot an AI-controlled F-16 to the US Senate appropriations committee’s defense panel, discussing the future of air warfare relying on autonomously operated drones.On Friday, the senior Air Force leader carried out his plans, achieving what might be one of the most significant advancements in military aviation since the introduction of stealth planes in the early 1990s.According to Fox news, the US Air Force plans to have more than 1,000 AI-flown planes in commission, with the first in operation by 2028Kendall traveled to Edwards Air Force base, which is the same desert facility where Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, to observe and participate in AI flight in real time.""It’s a security risk not to have it. At this point, we have to have it,"" the secretary said.The F-16, controlled by artificial intelligence and named Vista, flew Kendall in maneuvers that reached speeds exceeding 550 mph, exerting a pressure on his body equivalent to nearly five times the force of gravity.A human-piloted F-16 was flying alongside Vista and Kendall. The two jets raced within 1,000 feet of each other, performing twists and loops in an attempt to make their opponent surrender.He said that he had seen sufficient evidence to have faith in the AI technology when determining whether to use weapons in a war.Kendall said that human oversight will always be involved in the consideration of weapons.The US Air Force plans to have a fleet of more than 1,000 AI-operated drones, with the first one expected to be operational by 2028.In March, the Pentagon announced its plans to develop new artificial intelligence-guided planes. It offered two contracts to several private companies for them to compete against each other to win.The CCA project, known as the Collaborative Combat Aircraft project, is a component of a program worth $6 billion.The companies that are competing for the contract are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Atomics, and Anduril Industries.The Pentagon is interested in pursuing the project because cost-cutting is one of the elements of AI that appeals to them.In August 2023, deputy secretary of fefense Kathleen Hicks said deploying AI-enabled autonomous vehicles would provide ""small, smart, cheap and many' expendable units to the US military, helping overhaul the ""too-slow shift of US military innovation.""","US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall flew a fighter jet on Friday that was piloted by AI over the deserts in California.

Meanwhile, his critics said that he has eliminated his political rivals, initiated a devastating conflict in Ukraine, and consolidated all power under his control.He began his fifth term in a ceremony that was boycotted by the United States and many Western countries due to Russia's war on Ukraine.Putin, who has been in office for nearly 25 years since 1999 and is the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, will remain in power at least until 2030, with the option to run for another six years as per the constitution of Russia.During the inauguration ceremony, Putin told officials that leading Russia is a ""sacred duty"", and that Russia will emerge ""stronger"" after ""difficult"" period.""We will pass through this difficult period with dignity and become even stronger,"" Putin said, adding: ""We are a united and great nation, and together we will overcome all obstacles, realise everything we have planned, and together, we will win.""In a short speech, Putin also said that Russia was open to developing relations with other countries he described as ""the world's majority"".""Russia's state system must be resistant to any threats and challenges,"" he said.Russia has transformed from a nation recovering from economic collapse to a pariah state that poses a threat to global security under Putin's leadership. Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which has become Europe's largest conflict since World War II, Russia has faced severe sanctions from the West and is turning to other regimes like China, Iran, and North Korea for support.The main concern now is what the 71-year-old Putin will do over the next six years, both domestically and internationally. Russian forces are making progress in Ukraine, employing scorched-earth tactics as Kyiv struggles with shortages of men and ammunition.

Explainer: Why US is stopping some bomb shipments to Israel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explainer-why-us-is-stopping-some-bomb-shipments-to-israel/articleshow/109964243.cms,"What specific types of weapons has the US blocked from being sent to Israel?

Why is the US blocking these bombs now?

What was Israel's response to the US decision?

Has the US ever withheld military aid from Israel before?

American President Joe Biden has warned that the US would not provide offensive weapons to Israel for a potential full-scale assault on Rafah, a critical Hamas stronghold in Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Biden affirmed the US's commitment to Israel's defense by continuing to supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive equipment. However, he made it clear that if Israeli forces were to enter Rafah, the US would withhold supplying weapons and artillery shells.Biden reiterated the conditional nature of US military support: ""I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem."" Biden's stance marks a significant policy shift, emphasizing a strategic withdrawal from supporting offensive operations in such densely populated areas, saying, ""We’re not walking away from Israel’s security.We’re walking away from Israel’s ability to wage war in those areas.""Here is all you need to know about why the US is stopping some bomb shipments to IsraelThe US has paused a shipment that includes 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs. These are significant because their use in densely populated areas like Rafah can lead to high civilian casualties. President Biden expressed this concern clearly: “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers.""The decision comes amidst escalating violence in Gaza, particularly in Rafah, where the potential for civilian casualties is substantial due to the dense population. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated, ""We've been very clear...from the very beginning that Israel shouldn't launch a major attack into Rafah without accounting for and protecting the civilians that are in that battlespace."" The concern is that the large bombs could cause excessive damage and civilian deaths in such settings.Israel's US ambassador, Gilad Erdan, described the US decision to pause the bomb shipment as ""very disappointing,"" even frustrating, suggesting it might be a result of political pressure on Biden. Despite this, Erdan expressed confidence that the US would not completely stop supplying arms to Israel.Yes, there have been instances in the past where the US has withheld military aid from Israel. For example, in 1982, President Ronald Reagan imposed a six-year ban on cluster weapons sales to Israel following reports that they were used in populated areas during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Such decisions are often influenced by concerns over the use of US supplied weapons in conflict zones and their impact on civilian populations.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Joe Biden has warned that the US would not provide offensive weapons to Israel for a potential full-scale assault on Rafah, a critical Hamas stronghold in Gaza.

"Biden says US won't supply weapons for Israel to attack Rafah, in warning to ally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-says-us-wont-supply-weapons-for-israel-to-attack-rafah-in-warning-to-ally/articleshow/109960538.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he would not supply offensive weapons that Israel could use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah — the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza over concern for the well-being of the more than 1 million civilians sheltering there.Biden, in an interview with CNN, said the US was still committed to Israel's defense and would supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms, but that if Israel goes into Rafah, “we’re not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.”The US has historically provided enormous amounts of military aid to Israel.That has only accelerated in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 in Israel and led to about 250 being taken captive by militants. Biden's comments and his decision last week to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel are the most striking manifestations of the growing daylight between his administration and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Biden has said that Israel needs to do far more to protect the lives of civilians in Gaza.The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) bombs and 1,700 500-pound (225-kilogram) bombs, according to a senior US administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. The focus of US concern was the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban.“Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,"" Biden told CNN. “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.”Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin earlier Wednesday confirmed the weapons delay, telling the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on defense that the US paused “one shipment of high payload munitions.”“We’re going to continue to do what’s necessary to ensure that Israel has the means to defend itself,” Austin said. “But that said, we are currently reviewing some near-term security assistance shipments in the context of unfolding events in Rafah.”It also comes as the Biden administration is due to deliver a first-of-its-kind formal verdict this week on whether the airstrikes on Gaza and restrictions on delivery of aid have violated international and US laws designed to spare civilians from the worst horrors of war. A decision against Israel would further add to pressure on Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel’s military.Biden signed off on the pause in an order conveyed last week to the Pentagon, according to US officials who were not authorized to comment on the matter. The White House National Security Council sought to keep the decision out of the public eye for several days until it had a better understanding of the scope of Israel’s intensified military operations in Rafah and until Biden could deliver a long-planned speech on Tuesday to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day.Biden’s administration in April began reviewing future transfers of military assistance as Netanyahu’s government appeared to move closer toward an invasion of Rafah, despite months of opposition from the White House. The official said the decision to pause the shipment was made last week and no final decision had been made yet on whether to proceed with the shipment at a later date.US officials had declined for days to comment on the halted transfer, word of which came as Biden on Tuesday described US support for Israel as “ironclad, even when we disagree.”Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, in an interview with Israeli Channel 12 TV news, said the decision to pause the shipment was “a very disappointing decision, even frustrating."" He suggested the move stemmed from political pressure on Biden from Congress, the US campus protests and the upcoming election.The decision also drew a sharp rebuke from House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who said they only learned about the military aid holdup from press reports, despite assurances from the Biden administration that no such pauses were in the works. The Republicans called on Biden in a letter to swiftly end the blockage, saying it “risks emboldening Israel's enemies,” and to brief lawmakers on the nature of the policy reviews.Biden has faced pressure from some on the left — and condemnation from the critics on the right who say Biden has moderated his support for an essential Mideast ally.“If we stop weapons necessary to destroy the enemies of the state of Israel at a time of great peril, we will pay a price,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., his voice rising in anger during an exchange with Austin. “This is obscene. It is absurd. Give Israel what they need to fight the war they can’t afford to lose.”Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Biden ally, said in a statement the pause on big bombs must be a “first step.”“Our leverage is clear,” Sanders said. “Over the years, the United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Israel. We can no longer be complicit in Netanyahu’s horrific war against the Palestinian people.”Austin, meanwhile, told lawmakers that ""it’s about having the right kinds of weapons for the task at hand.”""A small diameter bomb, which is a precision weapon, that’s very useful in a dense, built-up environment,” he said, “but maybe not so much a 2,000-pound bomb that could create a lot of collateral damage.” He said the US wants to see Israel do “more precise” operations.Israeli troops on Tuesday seized control of Gaza’s vital Rafah border crossing in what the White House described as a limited operation that stopped short of the full-on Israeli invasion of the city that Biden has repeatedly warned against on humanitarian grounds, most recently in a Monday call with Netanyahu.Israel has ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from the city. Israeli forces have also carried out what it describes as “targeted strikes” on the eastern part of Rafah and captured the Rafah crossing, a critical conduit for the flow of humanitarian aid along the Gaza-Egypt border.Privately, concern has mounted inside the White House about what’s unfolding in Rafah, but publicly administration officials have stressed that they did not think the operations had defied Biden’s warnings against a widescale operation in the city.The State Department is separately considering whether to approve the continued transfer of Joint Direct Attack Munition kits, which place precision guidance systems onto bombs, to Israel, but the review didn’t pertain to imminent shipments.Itamar Yaar, former deputy head of Israel’s National Security Council said the US move is largely symbolic, but a sign of trouble and could become more of a problem if it is sustained.“It’s not some kind of American embargo on American munitions support, but I think its some kind of diplomatic message to Mr. Netanyahu that he needs to take into consideration American interests more than he has over the last few months,"" he said. ""At least for now it will not impact Israeli capability but it’s some kind of a signal, a ‘be careful.’”The US dropped the 2,000-pound bomb sparingly in its long war against the Islamic State militant group. Israel, by contrast, has used the bomb frequently in the seven-month Gaza war. Experts say the use of the weapon, in part, has helped drive the enormous Palestinian casualty count that the Hamas-run health ministry puts at more than 34,000 dead, though it doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians.The US-Israel relationship has been close through both Democratic and Republican administrations. But there have been other moments of deep tension since Israel's founding in which US leaders have threatened to hold up aid in attempt to sway Israeli leadership.President Dwight Eisenhower pressured Israel with the threat of sanctions into withdrawing from the Sinai in 1957 in the midst of the Suez Crisis. Ronald Reagan delayed the delivery of F16 fighter jets to Israel at a time of escalating violence in the Middle East. President George H.W. Bush held up $10 billion in loan guarantees to force the cessation of Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories.",President Joe Biden says he will not supply offensive weapons that Israel could use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah. Biden's comments and his decision last week to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel are the most striking manifestations of the growing daylight between his administration and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109961542,imgsize-909637,width-400,resizemode-4/109961542.jpg"
US paused Israel weapons shipment due to Rafah: Defense secretary Lloyd Austin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-paused-israel-weapons-shipment-due-to-rafah-us-defense-secretary/articleshow/109956898.cms,"Pressure

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden 's decision to hold up delivery of high payload munitions to Israel was taken over a possible Israeli offensive in Rafah that Washington believes could put Palestinian civilians at risk, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Wednesday.Austin was the first senior Biden administration official to publicly explain what appeared to be a possible shift in US policy towards arming Israel.Biden had pledged his complete support for Israel following the October 7 attack on the country by Palestinian militant group Hamas, and he sent Washington's closest Middle East ally weaponry worth billions of dollars.Austin stressed that the US commitment to Israel's defense remained ""ironclad"" and that the decision on suspending the munitions shipment was not final.Still, he said the US preference would be that ""no major combat take place in Rafah"" and that at a minimum any Israeli operation must safeguard civilian lives.""We've been very clear... from the very beginning that Israel shouldn't launch a major attack into Rafah without accounting for and protecting the civilians that are in that battlespace,"" Austin told a Senate hearing.""And again, as we have assessed the situation, we have paused one shipment of high payload munitions,"" he told a Senate hearing.""We've not made a final determination on how to proceed with that shipment.""Israel has threatened a major assault on Rafah to defeat thousands of Hamas fighters it says are holed up there, but Western nations and the United Nations say a full-scale attack on the city would triggger a humanitarian catastrophe.Hamas' October 7 attack killed about 1,200 people with about 250 others abducted, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.Israel's campaign to destroy Hamas has led to a seven-month-long military campaign that has so far killed a total of 34,789 Palestinians, mostly civilians, the Gaza Health Ministry said.The conflict has also left many of Gaza's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the US demanding that universities and Biden withdraw support for Israel - including the provision of weaponry. Biden is also under pressure from Democrats, including lawmakers in his party, to put more pressure on Israel.A senior US official, speaking on Tuesday on condition of anonymity, said Washington had carefully reviewed the delivery of weapons that might be used in Rafah, and as a result paused a shipment consisting of 1,800 2,000-lb bombs and 1,700 500-lb bombs.Austin did not detail the size or number of the munitions involved.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham was among the Republicans who rebuked the Biden administration over the decision.""This is obscene. It is absurd. Give Israel what they need,"" Graham said, adding it wasn't for Washington to second-guess how Israel fought a war against Hamas militants bent on Israel's destruction.US senator Deb Fischer, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called on Biden to drop ""his politically-motivated hold"".""American support for Israel cannot be in doubt, especially now,"" she said.For its part, the Israeli military appeared on Wednesday to play down the arms shipment hold-up, saying the allies resolve any disagreements ""behind closed doors"".Speaking at a conference hosted by the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper as the Gaza war entered its eighth month, chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari described coordination between Israel and the United States as reaching ""a scope without precedent, I think, in history"".",President Joe Biden's decision to hold up delivery of high payload munitions to Israel was taken over a possible Israeli offensive in Rafah that Washington believes could put Palestinian civilians at risk.

Moreover, the firm also has significant sales of internet and phones in rural parts of the US. These networks interest intelligence agencies due to the data they carry.The Washington Post reported that US experts on the matter fear that these devices may be more susceptible to infiltration by Chinese intelligence agencies. And the report further claims that, despite years of US efforts to stymie its advance, Huawei was still the world's No. 1 company in 2023 in terms of the number of patent applications filed. It is also still the world's top seller of the pipes that make up internet and phone networks, and remains a major player in consumer gadgets like smartphones.Separately on Tuesday, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announced USD 420 million in grants for companies from the United States and ally nations to build phone network gear that can compete against Huawei's. The NTIA included a requirement for grant recipients to pair up with a network operator to help ensure their products can secure a major buyer when they go to market, according to the report.The initial bans and sanctions on Huawei were introduced under the Trump administration, as US vendors were allowed to make sales, which at that time had forced the company to switch to China-based manufacturers for their demand. However, US companies were allowed to sell Huawei the components that were deemed less sensitive following the laws made during the Trump administration.","The US Commerce Department on Tuesday restricted the sale of American technology to China's leading high-tech firm, Huawai Technologies.

The judge overseeing the case, Justice Juan Merchan , had to remind prosecutors about the excessive detail Daniels was going into, which he deemed unnecessary.Daniels' testimony included vivid descriptions of a 2006 encounter with Trump at a Lake Tahoe hotel suite, where she humorously recounted an incident of spanking Trump with a magazine bearing his face. This part of her testimony, despite its salacious nature, drew smirks from the jury, though they managed to keep their composure when Daniels described the sexual act itself.Wearing a black kimono-like garment, Daniels spoke quickly and with gestures, visibly frustrating Trump, who was present in the courtroom. Her revelations about their night together painted a picture of a brief and regretful encounter, which she was encouraged to pursue by her publicist for the sake of an interesting story.The former adult film actress also touched on sensitive topics such as Trump's disregard for his then-recent marriage to Melania Trump , claiming he assured her not to worry about his wife as they did not share the same bedroom. These comments prompted visible reactions from Trump, including head shakes and discussions with his defense attorney, Susan Necheles.This high-profile trial, centered on accusations that Trump arranged a hush-money payment to Daniels to prevent her from disclosing their affair during the 2016 presidential campaign, continues to draw significant media attention and public scrutiny. Trump has vehemently denied the allegations, dismissing the case as a politically motivated witch hunt.As the trial progresses, it remains to be seen how the detailed and controversial testimonies, like that of Daniels, will influence the jury's perspective and the final outcome of the case.","Daniels' testimony included vivid descriptions of a 2006 encounter with Trump at a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.

Representative Ken Calvert, chair of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, expressed concerns over the strategic use of space by rival nations during his speech at the Hill & Valley Forum on AI Security .Calvert emphasized the importance of maintaining American leadership in space, labeling it the new ""high ground"" in the rivalry among great powers. He highlighted the critical role of satellite networks in US military operations, including targeting. ""Ultimately, we need to be sure we’re leading in that,"" Calvert said.The representative also voiced strong concerns about Russia’s alleged plans to position nuclear weapons in space, accusing Moscow of attempting to use these capabilities as ""blackmail against the world if something happens that they don’t agree to."" Russia has firmly denied these claims, calling them a hoax by the White House aimed at securing more funding for Ukraine.In terms of proactive measures, Calvert noted that while Nasa plans to return to the moon by 2025 or 2026, he suspects delays might push this timeline back. However, he believes the US military, including the Space Force, will be crucial in securing a lunar presence. ""Space Force will be actively involved in, I think, in going to the moon at some point and that discussion is ongoing...

Cosmic 'seeds': James Webb Space Telescope unravels early universe mysteries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cosmic-seeds-james-webb-space-telescope-unravels-early-universe-mysteries/articleshow/109946964.cms,"Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has made groundbreaking observations of the light from stars surrounding some of the earliest supermassive black holes in the universe, as they existed less than a billion years after the Big Bang. These findings come from a research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ), who are exploring the rapid growth of these cosmic titans that anchor the hearts of galaxies and are as massive as millions or even billions of suns.The observations target the puzzle of how these supermassive black holes, observed feeding insatiably on material surrounding them, managed to acquire such immense masses so quickly. This process lights up their accretion disks, powering the luminous quasars at the centers of active galaxies—some of which shine brighter than all the stars in their galaxies combined, a report in Space.com said.This conundrum is intensified by the fact that supermassive black holes are seen so early in the universe’s 13.8 billion-year history, suggesting a rapid formation that current theories, like continuous black hole mergers, cannot fully explain. The MIT team's use of the JWST to observe faint stellar light from six ancient quasars has provided new evidence supporting the theory that these black holes grew from ""heavy seed"" black holes.“These black holes are billions of times more massive than the sun, at a time when the universe is still in its infancy,” explained Anna-Christina Eilers, an assistant professor of physics at MIT. She suggests that ""supermassive black holes might have gained their mass before their host galaxies did, and the initial black hole seeds could have been more massive than today.""The intense brightness of quasars, which led to their initial misidentification as star-like points in the 1960s, is now known to stem from massive amounts of matter accreting to supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. The JWST’s capabilities have now allowed researchers to differentiate the light of these quasars from the fainter stellar light, solving a problem akin to spotting the light of fireflies on a lighthouse from a mile away, the Space.com report said.By analyzing the light emissions from the quasars over various wavelengths, the team, including postdoc Minghao Yue from MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, could determine the mass distribution in these early galaxies. “We are able to reveal the light from these stars by very carefully modeling JWST's much sharper images of those quasars,” Yue stated.Their results indicate that the supermassive black holes are about 10% as massive as the stars in their galaxies—a significant figure when compared to modern galaxies where black holes are just 0.1% the mass of their stars. “This tells us something about what grows first: Is it the black hole that grows first, and then the galaxy catches up? Or is it the galaxy and its stars that first grow, and they dominate and regulate the black hole’s growth?” Eilers posed.The findings, published in the Astrophysical Journal, hint at a universe where black holes grew rapidly and possibly before their galaxies, providing tantalizing evidence of how these cosmic behemoths came to be.",Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has made groundbreaking observations of the light from stars surrounding some of the earliest supermassive black holes in the universe.

Star witness

Mistrial request

Salacious details

Cross-examination

Donald Trump ’s intimate moments with an adult film star spilled out into open court on Tuesday as Stormy Daniels described her alleged affair with the former president in a highly-anticipated moment of his hush-money trial.The testimony everybody was waiting for arrived Tuesday morning in Manhattan as Daniels took the stand to tell her story of a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.“He was wearing silk or satin pajamas that I immediately made fun of,” Daniels said as a prosecutor questioned her about the encounter. “‘Does Hugh Hefner know you stole his pajamas?’” she recalled asking Trump.Her vivid and often graphic testimony included fresh details on a story that has been pored over for years. The scene injected a tabloid-ready moment into the trial, with the adult-film actress confronting the former president before a jury of New Yorkers who will determine his fate.During a break, Judge Juan Merchan privately warned Trump’s lawyer that the ex-president could be heard uttering vulgarities during the testimony, which the judge said he would not tolerate. The day before, Merchan had threatened to jail Trump for continuing to violate a gag order barring him from publicly discussing potential witnesses.“I understand that your client is upset at this point, but he is cursing audibly, and he is shaking his head visually and that’s contemptuous,” Merchan told attorney Todd Blanche, according to a transcript. “It has the potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that.”The private and potentially embarrassing details about the night they met — including her mocking of Trump’s silk pajamas and the manner in which he allegedly initiated sex — are likely to infuriate the former president, who has denied the affair and is deeply protective of his public image. What’s less clear is how damaging the revelations will be to his case or his campaign.The remarkable testimony is the latest example of how Trump’s dealings with women are coming back to haunt him in court. Last year, a federal jury in Manhattan found Trump liable for sexually assaulting New York writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s. Another jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages to punish Trump for defaming her by denying her allegation of rape.Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee for the November election even after Carroll prevailed in court in her sexual-abuse lawsuit, and his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton followed a string of damaging revelations about his dealings with women. That included the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape in which he boasts about sexual assault.Daniels is at the center of a case in which Trump is accused of falsifying business records to conceal the nature of a $130,000 payment to her to keep her quiet before the 2016 election. Her testimony is crucial because the Manhattan district attorney, who brought the case last year, must convince jurors that Trump tried to conceal Daniels’s story before the election.If Daniels can convince jurors that a sexual encounter took place, it can bolster the district attorney’s argument about Trump’s motivation to make the hush-money payment.Many of the details Daniels gave the jury Tuesday have been public for years, but her answers under questioning by prosecutors included new claims that angered the defense, including a suggestion that Daniels felt pressured to have sex with Trump due to a “power imbalance.”Daniels delivered much of her testimony in a colorful demeanor that sometimes bordered on humorous, eliciting frequent laughs from spectators. Daniels avoided looking directly at Trump, even when she walked right by him. For his part, Trump appeared to keep his eyes closed for much of her testimony.Trump and his lawyers mostly let Daniels testify uninterrupted. It wasn’t until after the lunch break, when Trump’s lawyer Blanche seized the opportunity to ask the judge for a mistrial, arguing that the detailed testimony by Daniels had gone too far and prejudiced the jury.Merchan denied the mistrial motion but even so, agreed some of Daniels’s testimony had gone too far. He asked Daniels to stay focused and avoid providing “unnecessary details” in her testimony. He also chided Trump’s lawyers for not objecting to it earlier.Before the jury came back from the break, Judge Merchan told prosecutor Susan Hoffinger that “we don’t need this level of detail, like the color of the floor.”Daniels described how she first met Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite, where she’d been invited after meeting the real estate mogul at a celebrity golf tournament sponsored in part by the adult-film company where she worked. Trump’s bodyguard invited her to Trump’s hotel for dinner and when she arrived at the room, she found Trump in his silk pajamas.Speaking rapidly during her testimony, Daniels was frequently asked to slow down by the judge. She detailed her banter with Trump, describing him as “arrogant.” That prompted Trump to suggest she should spank him, she said.Daniels said she asked Trump about his wife, Melania. He told her not to worry about that and that they “don’t even sleep in the same room.” She said she excused herself to go to the bathroom, and found Trump waiting for her on the bed when she returned.She regretted her decisions that had led her there that night, and said she didn’t disclose her affair with Trump because she felt “ashamed.” The consensual tryst left her shaken, Daniels said, but she stayed in touch with Trump because he promised he’d help her get on his reality TV show, The Apprentice.Daniels said hundreds of people knew of her relationship with Trump, but few knew they had sex. Her story briefly became public in a 2011 gossip blog post. But by 2016, she decided to accept a $130,000 payment from Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen to keep quiet about the affair.Extorting money from Trump, as the former president has suggested, wasn’t her goal, Daniels testified.“My motivation wasn’t money,” Daniels said. “It was to get the story out.”Trump’s team used cross examination to portray Daniels as a liar who wanted to make money off a fake story about the former president.Trump lawyer Susan Necheles accused Daniels at one point of making up her testimony as she went along, pointing to evidence that she’d told a Los Angeles lawyer she didn’t have sex with Trump, and that she told some entertainment news outlets that the story about the affair was false.“You’re making it up as you sit there, right?” Necheles said.Necheles suggested that Daniels was an extortionist and someone determined to avoid paying Trump more than $500,000 in legal fees she owed him.“You’re looking to extort money from President Trump, right?” Necheles asked.“False,” said Daniels.The lawyer at one point got Daniels to say she hates Trump and that she hopes he’ll go to jail, seeking to convey to the jury that Daniels has biased feelings about Trump.“Am I correct that you hate President Trump?” Necheles asked.“Yes,” Daniels said.“And you want him to go to jail?” Necheles asked.“I want him to be held accountable,” Daniels said.",Stormy Daniels testifies about a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. The vivid and often graphic testimony included fresh details on a story that has been pored over for years.

This completes the NA’s total strength of 336 seats.In March, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had ruled that SIC was not eligible for reserved seats and decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries. The verdict was rejected by PTI as unconstitutional and the alliance had filed a plea against the electoral watchdog’s decision in the Peshawar HC, but it rejected the appeal.In response, SIC moved the Supreme Court last month urging it to allot the party the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and set aside the Peshawar HC ruling.Accepting SIC’s appeal for a hearing, the apex court clarified that the Peshawar HC order upholding ECP’s decision was suspended to the extent of the remaining reserved seats distributed among other parties.After losing the extra reserved seats, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government had lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities.

However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.

NEW DELHI: Imran Khan, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has accused Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa of bias against his party and called upon the courts to hasten the hearings of his case.From Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, Khan emphasized the need for timely proceedings, labeling the delays in court decisions as unjust.He asserted that all cases against him were false and baseless.Referring to CJP Isa's statement, Khan said,""He stated that there is no pressure on him, but pressure comes to those who refuse to indulge in wrongdoing. You are behaving like [government's] B-team against PTI.""Khan highlighted the unresolved issues regarding PTI's electoral symbol, alleged rigging during general elections and the status of PTI's petitions , behind his allegations of PTI being denied level playing field.He criticized the judiciary for what he perceived as coerced decisions and urged Supreme Court judges to emulate the stance of high court judges in rejecting wrongful decisions.Expressing a willingness to engage in dialogue, Khan conditioned it upon the return of what he claimed was a 'stolen mandate' and the release of imprisoned party workers. He stressed that dialogue typically occurs with adversaries, hinting at a potential negotiation with PTI's perceived adversaries.Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry had suggested that if Khan struck a deal with the establishment, he would effectively become Shehbaz Sharif.Chaudhry's remarks surfaced amidst discussions surrounding alleged talks between PTI and the establishment, which were initiated by senior PTI leader Shehryar Afridi. PTI leader Shehryar Afridi said that his party will hold ""dialogue with the chief of army staff (COAS) and the director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI) soon"" instead of speaking to ""rejected people"" who reached parliament through Form 47.Chaudhry expressed skepticism about Khan's likelihood of striking such a deal, asserting that Shehbaz Sharif's current threats originate not from within his party but from external forces.","Imran Khan, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has accused Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa of bias against his party.
