North Korea claims it discovered the remains of a South Korean drone in its capital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-claims-it-discovered-the-remains-of-a-south-korean-drone-in-its-capital/articleshow/114364942.cms,"North Korea claims it discovered the remains of a South Korean drone in its capital (KCNA photo via AP)

SEOUL: North Korea said Saturday it found the remains of a South Korean drone during a search in its capital, Pyongyang , claiming the drone proved the South’s military was behind the alleged drone infiltrations over the city’s skies earlier in the month.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff in a statement described the North Korean claim as “unilateral” and “unworthy of responding.”The North’s official Korean Central News Agency released photos showing a seemingly damaged aircraft with wide, V-shaped wings and winglets.It said a joint investigation by North Korea’s military and state security agencies concluded that the aircraft, which it said was found on Oct. 13, was the same type of drone that appeared in a South Korean military parade earlier in October.North Korea accused South Korea of flying drones over the night skies of Pyongyang three different times this month to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets. It threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again.The aircraft allegedly found in Pyongyang was likely one of the drones that were used to drop leaflets, North Korea’s Defense Ministry said, but further examinations were needed to verify that.Should South Korea deny that the aircraft was used to drop leaflets, that would only confess to a separate infiltration of North Korea’s airspace by the South’s military, the ministry said. If North Korea confirms another violation of its territorial ground, airspace and waters by the South’s military, that will be regarded as a “declaration of war and an immediate retaliatory attack will be launched,” the ministry added.South Korea’s defense minister initially made a vague denial after the North's Oct. 11 accusation that the South sent drones over Pyongyang. The South’s military adjusted its response hours later, saying it couldn’t confirm whether or not the North’s claims were true.Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are now at their worst in years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ramps up his weapons tests and threats, and expands military cooperation with Russia, with South Korea claiming the North dispatched troops to support Russia’s war against Ukraine.The animosity has been exacerbated by Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns between the Koreas in recent months.Since May, North Korea has sent thousands of balloons carrying paper waste, plastic and other trash to drop on the South. The South’s military has responded by using loudspeakers at the border to broadcast propaganda and K-pop to North Korea.North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of Kim’s authoritarian government and his family’s dynastic rule.","North Korea claims it found the remains of a South Korean drone during a search in its capital, Pyongyang.

The cabinet shuffle is not expected to happen imminently and could even wait until after the US polls, according to officials.Other ministers have already stepped down from Trudeau’s cabinet. In the past few months, Seamus O’Regan quit his job as labour minister as he didn’t intend to run again and Pablo Rodriguez left as transport minister in order to run for the leadership of Quebec’s provincial Liberal party. Trudeau is under pressure to show his caucus a plan to erode the dominant polling lead enjoyed by Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre , who’s been ahead by around 20 percentage points for over a year now.There have been reports over past week that some Liberal lawmakers intend to challenge Trudeau at next week’s caucus meeting, either calling on him to resign as leader or to make a bigger shakeup in the people around him.","The four ministers expected to leave cabinet — Carla Qualtrough, MarieClaude Bibeau, Dan Vandal and Filomena Tassi — are not in major portfolios.

Democrat presidential nominee and vice president Kamala Harris highlighted concerns regarding 78-year-old Donald Trump and his physical stamina to serve as president during her campaign in Michigan on Friday.""It should be a concern. If he can't handle the rigours of the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job?"" she asked reporters before a rally in Grand Rapids. The question arose particularly after reports indicated he skipped interviews due to fatigue and opted out of a second debate with her.In response, Trump rejected the allegations, saying, ""I've gone 48 days now without a rest.I'm not even tired. I'm really exhilarated. You know why? We're killing her in the polls."" He pointed to polls in competitive states showing the race effectively tied.On Thursday, Harris accused Trump of 'gaslighting' the American people about the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack by Trump supporters. Trump recently called the attack 'a day of love' during his Univision town hall.Seeking support from Arab Americans in Michigan disappointed with Democrats, Trump visited a campaign office in Hamtramck. Where the city's first Muslim mayor, Amer Ghalib praised him for his efforts. Trump emphasised on the need for peace in the Middle East, asserting that it could be achieved quickly with the right leadership.""We all ultimately want one thing. We want peace in the Middle East. We're going to get peace in the Middle East. It's going to happen very fast. It can happen with the right leadership in Washington,"" he said.Later, Trump held a rally in Detroit, the largest city in Michigan, where he reiterated his Detroit statement, he claimed that the US would resemble Detroit if Harris won.Meanwhile, Harris continued her campaign across Michigan, targeting the state's Arab-American, senior, union, and working-class voters.Harris has shifted her strategy to appeal to more Republicans and men, by enlisting former first lady Michelle Obama to join her campaign efforts in Michigan on October 26.Recent public and internal polls show extremely narrow margins for both candidates in Michigan, a crucial battleground state with 15 Electoral College votes.","Kamala Harris questions Donald Trump's physical stamina to serve as president.

I won't pay the bill""The malfunction marks the second time in a week that one of Trump’s events was interrupted. Earlier in the week, he ended a town hall early due to medical emergencies in the crowd.Prior to the microphone mishap, Trump attacked his Democratic opponent as ""grossly incompetent"" and vowed to ""save"" Detroit, as Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned in Oakland County.

When can we expect the

Robotaxi Network

?

Just when it seemed like Elon Musk had achieved the impossible after his SpaceX caught a booster rocket, we now have the a fully self-driving cab without a driver, a pedal, a steering wheel, or any other sort of manual intervention. Tesla’s much-anticipated Cybercab was unveiled in California, offering a preview of what could be the future of urban transport .The event, held at Warner Bros. Discovery studios, featured the self-driving vehicle navigating an artificial city environment, specially designed for the showcase. Although the Cybercab is not yet ready for public roads, its reveal sparked excitement and raised questions about the future of autonomous technology .The Cybercab’s design immediately stands out, with its sleek, pod-like shape and futuristic butterfly doors that open upward. The interior, completely devoid of traditional controls like a steering wheel or pedals, feels like something straight out of a science fiction film. Its spacious, minimalist cabin is controlled through a touchscreen interface, further enhancing its futuristic appeal.Despite its sci-fi aesthetic, there are practical concerns about how the vehicle will handle the unpredictability of real-world driving. In the controlled environment of the studio, the Cybercab moved effortlessly, gliding through streets that mimicked a real city.However, it’s unclear how well the vehicle would perform in a more chaotic setting with unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians or cyclists.During the demonstration, the Cybercab did show signs of situational awareness , stopping instantly when someone stepped into its path, indicating that it can detect and respond to its surroundings. This suggests that Tesla has made significant progress toward achieving full autonomy, though there is still a long way to go before such vehicles are ready for widespread use.While the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are clear, including reduced human error and greater accessibility for those unable to drive, concerns remain. Questions about how these vehicles will handle complex, split-second decisions in real-world scenarios persist. Additionally, the ethical and safety implications of allowing machines to take full control of the driving process are still being debated.Tesla’s Cybercab represents a bold step towards the future of transportation. While it offers a glimpse of what might be possible, there are still many challenges—both technical and societal—that must be addressed before fully autonomous vehicles become a part of everyday life. For now, the Cybercab serves as a compelling vision of a future where mobility is redefined, but its role in that future remains to be determined.Tasha Keeney, ARK Invest ’s Director of Investment Analysis & Institutional Strategies, has suggested that Tesla’s Robotaxi Network could launch as early as 2025 or 2026. Keeney believes that Tesla might not need to wait for the Cybercab to roll out its Robotaxi Network.Both Keeney and Cathie Wood, ARK Invest’s CEO, attended Tesla’s “We, Robot” event on 10th October, where they waited to ride in the newly revealed Tesla Cybercab , which is intended to be central to the Robotaxi Network.However, Keeney and her colleagues at ARK Invest are of the view that Tesla could launch the network without the Cybercab. She argued that Tesla already possesses a fleet of vehicles equipped with Hardware 3 and 4, which could achieve full autonomy via over-the-air software updates.Even if Tesla opts to wait until the Cybercab is ready for fully autonomous rides, ARK Invest has suggested that the company could still introduce the Robotaxi Network using human drivers. In 2020, ARK Invest released an article explaining why it would be advantageous for Tesla to launch the network with human drivers first.ARK argued that a ride-hailing network would boost Tesla’s profitability before the robotaxi service becomes operational. Furthermore, they suggested that launching the robotaxi service would not require significant engineering resources, aside from crucial tasks such as routing, payment integration, and other necessary functions.ARK also noted that a vertically integrated ride-hailing service using highly efficient electric vehicles would increase the proportion of miles driven on electric platforms, furthering","Tesla’s much-anticipated Cybercab was unveiled in California, offering a preview of what could be the future of urban transport.

The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Who was Yahya Sinwar?

Born in 1962 in a refugee camp in Khan Younis, Gaza.

A founding member of Hamas, joining the group in 1987.

Nicknamed “The Butcher of Khan Younis” for his role in killing suspected collaborators.

Arrested by Israel in the late 1980s, he was sentenced to four life terms but was released in 2011 as part of a prisoner exchange.

Became the head of Hamas in Gaza, working closely with Iran to bolster the group’s military power.

Was instrumental in the October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing conflict.

Yahya Sinwar's Last Message To Israel On Al-Aqsa Mosque | His Rise From Israeli Jails To Gaza

Israel said on Thursday that it had successfully killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar , a key figure behind the 7 October attack on Israel. His body was discovered among the rubble in Gaza, where Israeli forces had unknowingly come across him during a battle in Rafah. His identity was later confirmed through DNA, dental records, and fingerprints.Sinwar's remains were reportedly found with a bulletproof vest, grenades, and 40,000 shekels, according to Israeli military officials.Footage released by the Israeli military shows Sinwar’s final moments, captured by a drone deployed to survey the area. The footage showed the Hamas leader, visibly injured, attempting to throw a piece of wood at the drone in a desperate attempt to avoid detection. Moments later, another strike on the building caused it to collapse, killing Sinwar and two other militants.Sinwar’s involvement in the 7 October attack, which left over 1,200 people dead and resulted in the kidnapping of around 250 Israelis, made him one of Israel’s most-wanted individuals. He played a crucial role in orchestrating the surprise assault that triggered the current conflict between Israel and Hamas.His death is being celebrated by Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who described it as a major victory against Hamas.Netanyahu said, “Hamas will no longer rule Gaza.

TOI Correspondent from London

: US Republicans have accused Britain of foreign interference in their elections after it emerged that 100 former and current Labour party members have gone to the US to campaign for Kamala Harris A LinkedIn post by Sofia Patel, head of operations at the Labour party, was widely circulated on Thursday. She wrote: “I have nearly 100 Labour Party staff (current and former) going to the US in the next few weeks heading to North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia.I have 10 spots available for anyone to head to the battleground state of North Carolina — we will sort your housing.” She then provided her email address as labourforkamala@gmail.com and asked people to email her if they are interested.An earlier post by her, in Aug, stated: “I’m planning a trip for Labour party staff to help our friends across the pond elect their first female president. If you worked for the Labour party during the general election, have now left, but are interested, please drop me an email to my work address. I will be going for the final two weeks of the election. Let’s show the Democrats how to win election!”Patel’s entire LinkedIn account has now been deleted.TOI’s own enquiries have found the posts did exist and these Labour party staff have gone to the US to campaign for the Democratic nominee.Republican politician Marjorie Taylor Greene said that Labour was breaking Federal Election Commission laws. “Foreign nationals are not allowed to be involved in anyway in US elections . Please go back to the UK and fix your own mass immigration problems that are ruining your country,” she wrote on X.Leader of Reform UK Nigel Farage said: “This is direct election interference by the governing Labour Party, and particularly stupid if Trump wins. Who is paying for all of this?”Former UK PM Liz Truss wrote on X: “President Trump is definitely going to win now”, whilst Elon Musk branded it as “illegal” and Conservative activist Robby Starbuck branded it as “foreign election interference”. ""Now you know why they invented Russia collusion,” he said.It is understood that the trips to the US are for individuals in a personal capacity, funded by themselves and on their own time. They are not organised or funded by the Labour party. The accommodation is being arranged by volunteers campaigning for the Democrats.The Federal Election Commission directed TOI to its website, which states: “Although foreign nationals may not make contributions or expenditures in connection with any federal, state or local election, an individual who is a foreign national may participate in campaign activities as an uncompensated volunteer. In doing so, the volunteer must be careful not to participate in the decision-making process of the campaign.”On Sept 29, Labour MP Ruth Cadbury posted a photo of herself on X campaigning in New Hampshire with the Harris-Walz team. She wrote: “I’ve taken myself to do my bit to stop Trump winning. Door-knocking yesterday with the #HarrisWalz team in (swing state) New Hampshire, along with State Senate candidate Wayne Haubner.” Sam Forster, who works in regional comms for Labour, posted a photo of himself holding Harris-Jacky Rosen flyers on 10 Oct and wrote: “What happens when two Labour staffers go on holiday to a swing state?”","100 former and current Labour party members have gone to the US to campaign for Kamala Harris.

"Pannun assassination plot: Ex-RAW agent Vikash Yadav's indictment US signal to China, Russia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/yadavs-indictment-us-signal-to-china-russia/articleshow/114360543.cms,"TOI Correspondent from Washington

: The statement accompanying the indictment filed by US department of justice against former RAW operative Vikash Yadav in connection with the alleged plot to assassinate pro-Khalistan extremist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York also suggested Washington is making an example of the episode to broadcast a larger message to other nations, notably China and Russia, which have also been accused of conducting transnational operations against dissenters they regard as anti-national.Today's charges are a grave example of the increase in lethal plotting and other forms of violent transnational repression targeting diaspora communities in the United States, the statement said, adding: To the govts around the world who may be considering such criminal activity and to the communities they would target, let there be no doubt that the DoJ is committed to disrupting and exposing these plots and to holding the wrongful actors accountable no matter who they are or where they reside.According to the indictment, in or about May 2023, Yadav recruited Nikhil Gupta , an Indian national allegedly involved in international narcotics and weapons trafficking, to orchestrate Pannun's assassination. At Yadav's direction, Gupta contacted an individual whom Gupta believed to be a criminal associate, but who was in fact a confidential source (CS) working with the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), for assistance in contracting a hitman to murder the victim in New York City.The CS then introduced Gupta to a purported hitman, who was in fact a DEA undercover officer, it said. Yadav subsequently agreed, in dealings brokered by Gupta, to pay the hitman $100,000 to murder the victim, of which $15,000 in cash was delivered to the undercover agent as an advance. The indictment contained a close-up photo of the money changing hands.The indictment said Nikhil Gupta also instructed the undercover agent not to commit the murder around the time of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's official state visit to the US, which was scheduled to begin on June 20, 2023. Yadav's recruitment of Gupta to orchestrate the hit job was in exchange for assistance in securing the dismissal of a criminal case against Gupta in India, it said.Gupta was arrested in Prague earlier this year and extradited to the US, where he has pleaded not guilty ahead of an expected trial.","Indictment filed by US department of justice against former RAW operative Vikash Yadav in connection with alleged plot to assassinate pro-Khalistan extremist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York.

He said he was amazed that Harvey Weinstein got his due because Democrats usually protect their own. Calling Weinstein 'king of the woke', Trump said it's interesting that he got hit so hard.“Democrats don’t have to be honest, they really don’t have to be honest, because they will never be accused of anything.It’s interesting,” Trump said. “I was so amazed that Harvey Weinstein got schlonged, he got hit as hard as you can get hit. Because he was sort of the king of the woke, right? And yet he got hit and I figured, maybe, he wouldn’t get hit so hard.”“But boy — you don’t know him well, I don’t know him well, but I watched that and it was amazing. So when they do get hit, they get hit. But that’s the only one I can think of, normally they protect everybody,” he continued. “What they did was Adams, I think, is very suspect.”Complaints against Harvey Weinstein started the Me Too movement in 2017 and in 2020, the film mogul was found guilty of rape but the conviction was overturned in 2014.Earlier, Donald Trump said he never liked Weinstein as he worked against Trump's candidacy in 2016. ""So I was never a fan of Harvey Weinstein, as you know. In fact, he said he was gonna work hard to defeat me in the election,"" Trump said after Weistein's conviction ""How did that work out, by the way? I’m trying to figure that out. He was a person I didn’t like, never liked. I don’t know too much about the case because, you know, between traveling and being at meetings almost every hour of the day, every minute of the day, I haven’t really been able to see too much of it.""After his Dan Bongino comment, Dems said Donald Trump was actually bemoaning that Weistein got punished but Trump was slamming the Democrats and the wokes.This is not the first time Trump has used the term “Schlonged” in this manner. In 2015, he used it in reference to Hillary Clinton losing her primary run in 2008, among other past instances.","Donald Trump said he was amazed that Harvey Weinstein got his due because Democrats usually protect their own.

In the ad, Ms. Williams states, ""Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine."" The state called the ad ""false,"" and at least one station stopped airing it after receiving the department's letter.Lauren Brenzel, the director of the ""Yes on 4"" campaign, praised the court's decision, calling it ""a triumph for every Floridian who believes in democracy and the sanctity of the First Amendment."" She emphasized that the government cannot silence the truth about Florida's extreme abortion ban.Governor Ron DeSantis has pledged to defeat Amendment 4 and has used state power to oppose the measure, leading to several legal challenges. While courts had previously declined to intervene, Judge Walker's order was met with criticism from the governor's office. Julia Friedland, Mr. DeSantis's deputy press secretary, claimed that the ads are false and put the lives and health of pregnant women at risk, asserting that Florida's heartbeat protection law always protects the life of a mother and includes exceptions for victims of rape, incest, and human trafficking.The campaign is seeking a preliminary injunction against the state, with a hearing scheduled for Oct. 29. A separate lawsuit, filed by opponents of Amendment 4 and seeking to remove the measure from the ballot, is currently pending in state court.","A federal court on Thursday ordered a Ron DeSantis led Florida administration to stop threatening television stations with criminal prosecution for airing a political ad in favor of enshrining abortion rights in the state's Constitution.

Former White House physician Jeffrey Kuhlman told Axios that Donald Trump never smoked but he is overweight. He said Trump appears to be in good health for his age but raised concerns about his cognitive ability for critical decision making. Kuhlman never examined Donald Trump. Donald Trump is 6 feet 3 inches tall, according to records. His weight is 244 pounds (110 kg). He is medically obese. However, there are many records of Trump's height and weight. He self-reported his weight as 215 pounds (97.5 kg) in 2020. Another record from 2018 said his weight was 239 pounds (108 kg). In 2018, it was revealed that he had high cholesterol which dropped by 2020, Axios reported. Trump has parental history of dementia as his father Fred Trump was diagnosed with dementia in 1991 when he was 86. Fred was later found to have Alzheimer's disease. In 2018, it was reported that Trump had a common form of heart disease which was easy to address if he increased the dose of his cholesterol-lowering medication. This was diagnosed by the Mayo Clinic.

Former president Donald Trump who will be the oldest president in history to be inaugurated if he wins the election has not revealed his detailed medical report -- a ground on which the Kamala Harris campaign has upped its attack on the GOP. Vice president Kamala Harris released her full health record where she had been deemed as fit to be the president. The vice president asked her opponent to do the same and questioned his mental agility as there are only three weeks left for the election.Donald Trump is 78-year-old and his team has Kennedy Jr who wants to Make America Healthy Again.Trump boasts of doing well as a cognitive test though it is not certain which one he speaks about.

Donald Trump: US Presidential Election Top 10: Is Trump the orator back from the dead?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-al-smith-dinner-orator/articleshow/114357736.cms,"After the only debate between Trump and Harris, this author had argued that Donald Trump, the orator, was finished. Yours truly had argued: “It became apparent to all viewers – whether MAGA supporters or members of the K-Hive – that the Donald Trump of old was gone, as the verve and vivacity that once made Trump such an avant-garde speaker with his stream-of-consciousness style were missing.Perhaps this is why he avoided the Republican primaries, where Vivek Ramaswamy stood out as his surrogate and attack dog. Before the Harris debate, Trump claimed: ‘Donald Trump is probably the greatest political debater we’ve ever had in American history.’ Reality begged to differ.”However, it would appear that the old powers have returned, perhaps bolstered by his improved performance in polls that is inversely proportional to Kamala Harris ’s interviews. Or, to put it in Catholic terms: Trump, the orator, has risen again.At the Al Smith Dinner – held in honour of the first Catholic presidential nominee – it was vintage Donald Trump. The Trump of yore that chewed up the entire Republican nominees before the 2016 election, weaving like James Joyce and spitting like Eminem.Trump was the best comedian on stage, which is saying something given the fact that MC Jim Gaffigan , who plays Tim Walz on SNL, was in top form, mocking the Democrats for being so concerned for democracy that they staged a coup to remove Biden and wondered why Harris was missing the most important Catholic dinner (22% of Americans identify as Catholic) but had time to attend the coitus-obsessed Call Her Daddy Podcast.Trump had a joke for everyone.For New York Mayor Eric Adams, he told him to stay strong before pointing out that for a vegan, he loved turkey too much. He praised the powers of prayer, stating that sometimes it took “three-and-a-half years” and a George Clooney op-ed. He poked fun at White Dudes for Harris, stating that their wives and their wives’ lovers would be voting for him. He pointed out his normal audience was a lot younger and had more energy, but this crowd had more cash, echoing George W. Bush’s iconic comment that the audience was a collection of “haves and have lots,” his base.He even cracked a joke about loving being anywhere in New York without a subpoena, jested with Chuck Schumer that his party was so woke that he could still be the first female President if Kamala lost, and said that Tim Walz was missing but would still say he was there. He kidded that there was no point in making self-deprecating jokes about himself given other people were already shooting at him.Piers Morgan, who had earned the ire of the MAGA crowd by saying Harris won the debate comfortably, praised Trump, saying: “This speech was absolutely hilarious. Trump at his funniest and most entertaining. And the fact Kamala ducked the event was cowardly and a massive mistake.” It was objectively funnier than most late-night comedy shows. The only ones who were displeased were mainstream media. The BBC actually had a heading that said: “Trump and Harris roast each other for charity event...” The pre-recorded video that Harris gave, with Molly Shannon playing her SNL character Marty Katherine Gallagher, was barely a skit, let alone a roast. The Harris campaign released a statement claiming “he struggled to read and lashed out at the crowd,” a claim that will be seen as objectively false to anyone who watched the entire thing and doesn’t suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome.The last Presidential nominee to miss the event was Walter Mondale , who managed to lose every state except Minnesota and Washington DC against Nixon in 1984, the most lopsided election result in American history, giving us a map that could’ve been called Red Red Redemption.Currently, Harris is stuck in what Silicon Valley BC David Sacks called an “interview Doom Loop.” He had argued: “She’s going to have to abandon this basement strategy of not doing interviews. The problem is, she’s not good at interviews. And if she does more interviews, she’s going to fall further behind in the polls, and it could cause a doom loop.” Since Harris started giving interviews, first with Walz, and then solo, her gap has decreased from 3.5 to 2.4 (538 poll of polls). The fact is that, at this moment, things are looking more up for Trump compared to Harris, who is clawing away at the post-debate gains. The return of Trump, the orator, could be further bad news.Also read: Top 10 stories","The Donald Trump of old was gone, as the verve and vivacity that once made Trump such an avant-garde speaker with his stream-of-consciousness style were missing.

This copy is one of about 100 printed by Charles Thomson, the Congress secretary, with only eight known to exist today. The other seven are publicly owned.The document was discovered two years ago during the clearing of a property in Edenton, North Carolina, which was once owned by Samuel Johnston , North Carolina's governor from 1787 to 1789. It was found in a metal filing cabinet in a neglected room.This Constitution copy includes a letter from George Washington urging ratification. He wrote about the need for compromise and the importance of a strong central government.Other high-value items at the auction included a 1776 draft of the Articles of Confederation sold for $1 million and a 1788 Journal of the Convention of North Carolina fetched $85,000.Auction officials were unsure of the document's value due to the lack of comparable sales.

The records, spanning from September 2017 to August 2018, were acquired after legal challenges against Trump's former accounting firm, Mazars USA.According to the report, the Secret Service paid higher prices for room rentals compared to customers who booked similar rooms on the same nights, using taxpayer funds. For instance, on Nov. 28, 2017, ""the room records produced to the Committee by Mazars show that, on that night, among the rooms the Secret Service rented, several were charged at the $600 rate. Notably, that very night, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., rented out more than 80 rooms at rates less than $600 per room, including a dozen rooms rented to theInner Mongolia Yitai Coal Co , Ltd.—which is headquartered in China—for $338.85 each.""Further, the report said that on February 22, 2018, the Secret Service paid more than four times the government per diem rate for rooms at the Trump Hotel, representing ""an astounding markup of more than 450% of the per diem rate.""""The room records provided by Mazars show that, among the rooms the Secret Service rented, two rooms were charged at $895 each,"" while ""the room records also show that former President Trump's DC hotel rented out more than 100 rooms that evening at rates of less than $895—including at least one room rented out for just $150,"" the report said.The report alleges that by accepting these payments from the Secret Service, former President Trump violated the Constitution's Domestic Emoluments Clause , which prohibits a president from receiving any payments from the federal government apart from their salary.""By accepting the payments that he imposed on the Secret Service, former President Trump violated the Constitution's Domestic Emoluments Clause—which provides that a president may not receive any payments from the federal government other than a salary,"" the report said.","House Democrats obtained hotel billing records from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC.

LAHORE: Describing foreign minister S Jaishankar ’s visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting as a positive development that should provide an opening for more substantive engagements between the 2 countries, former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi saying the latter’s decision to visit Sharif’s home in 2015 was not an ordinary gesture. Sharif sought progress in ties saying the relationship should not be held captive by the past.Sharif, a 3-time PM and elder brother of Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.“Achhe bhare talukkat ko tabah aur barbad karne waali baat ki (he worked to destroy a healthy relationship). I would have never used that kind of language. We believe in certain values that must be respected,” said Sharif, adding he had fond memories of Modi’s only visit to Pakistan on December 25, 2015, Sharif’s birthday.As then Pakistan PM, Sharif had received Modi at his home in Lahore. “I got a call from him saying he was in Kabul and wanted to visit me on his way back to India. I told him he was most welcome. He also met my mother during the visit. What he did wasn’t a chota (small) gesture,” said Sharif, in a meeting with Indian journalists in Lahore who travelled to Pakistan to cover Jaishankar’s engagements. The former PM is also the leader of the ruling PMLN party. His daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Sharif was also present in the interaction.Khan’s personal attacks against Modi after India revoked the special status of J&K only led to further deterioration of relations between the 2 countries. Sharif did not comment on India’s recent actions in the union territory as he said this wasn’t the occasion to discuss it. PM Shehbaz too had avoided raking up the Kashmir issue even in a roundabout manner at the SCO meeting.Sharif also called upon both sides to look ahead and not be held back by the past even though he didn’t make any specific commitment on resumingtrade ties or reappointing high commissioner. He did say that if there’s an opening, cheezein niklengi (things will emerge).Asked about his 2015 peace initiative with Modi that was scuttled quickly by the Pathankot terror attack, Sharif said it’s important to ensure any such effort is not disrupted. “India is our hamsaya (neighbour) mulk and we can’t change that even if we want it. We would have liked Modi to come (for SCO) but it’s good Jaishankar came. We have tried and tried again (to normalise ties). We lost the past 75 years and it’s important we don’t lose another 75 years,” said Sharif, who is known to share a close personal rapport with Modi.“Both sides have their giley-shikwe (grievances). It will be better if we can bury the past,” he added. When asked if he would play the role of building bridges, he said he was doing it.Sharif also backed SAARC, trade and cricket ties with India, saying neither country gains anything by not allowing their teams to play each other. He also recalled how former Indian PM A B Vajpayee had approached him to buy electricity from Pakistan. “I would allow my team to play. If there’s a cricket tournament on India and Pakistan and India are playing in the final, I’ll travel to India to watch it. There should be progress. SAARC or any such opportunity should not be missed. It’s important to make full use of it,” he said.“I believe we are a potential market for each other. Why should Indian and Pakistani farmers and manufacturers go outside to sell their products. Goods now go from Amritsar to Lahore via Dubai. Who is benefitting from this? What should take 2 hours takes 2 weeks,” he added.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi.

Lahore, Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday dismissed allegations of an on-campus rape incident at a Lahore college as fabricated, accusing Pakistan's jailed former premier Imran Khan's party of using the false claim to incite widespread student protests and create unrest in the province. She also demanded that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party be treated in the same way as ""banned organisations"" in the country.Maryam, daughter of former three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, claimed that the rape incident was fabricated to create unrest in Punjab. She accused political opponents, particularly PTI, of using students and the media to propagate false information for political gains.On Wednesday, a large number of students held demonstrations in Jehlum, Faisalabad, and Gujrat, demanding justice for the alleged rape victim.However, the chief minister stated that no incident of rape took place at the Punjab College for Women in Lahore. She alleged that PTI and its media supporters spread the fake news to destabilise the province by manipulating innocent students.On Monday, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured during clashes with police over the alleged rape incident. Protesters claimed that the college administration had deleted CCTV footage to cover up the case.Maryam accused PTI of attempting to destabilise the government by spreading false narratives, particularly during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which portrayed Pakistan positively on the global stage. The two-day SCO summit concluded on Wednesday.She warned of strict action against those spreading fake news, including media personnel. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said, adding that the girl in question had suffered a back injury, not a rape, and was in the hospital ICU since October 2, contradicting the circulated claims.Addressing PTI founder Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail for the last 15 months, she remarked, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are.""The chief minister also accused certain individuals from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and abroad of fuelling the controversy through fake news.""The issue isn't social media, but rather PTI, which needs to be controlled...and everything will be fine. They are operating through fake accounts,"" she alleged.Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has launched a probe against those involved in spreading disinformation through social media platforms about the alleged on-campus rape incident.A seven-member team headed by Deputy Director Cybercrime Lahore Waqas Saeed will identify individuals responsible for the disinformation campaign and the subsequent law-and-order situation.","Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz dismisses rape claims as fabricated.

ISLAMABAD: External affairs minister S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days even though there was no formal bilateral meeting between the foreign ministers on the margins of the SCO heads of government summit in Islamabad, diplomatic sources said. The fact that the first visit by an Indian foreign minister to Pakistan in almost 9 years went off without a hitch was seen as a positive development by the Indian government.As he departed after a 24-hour stay in Islamabad from the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, Jaishankar, who had said recently India isn’t passive on Pakistan and will react to positive and negative developments accordingly, thanked Shehbaz and Dar in a post on X for the hospitality and courtesies.While Indian government sources described the talks as casual conversations, Pakistan officials said there was a brief pull aside, which lasted for 5 to 7 minutes, between Jaishankar and Dar on the sidelines of the dinner hosted by Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday evening. Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), is learnt to have joined Jaishankar and Dar.A source speaking on condition of anonymity said Pakistan suggested resumption of bilateral cricketing ties as a way of “breaking the ice”. Naqvi was later quoted as saying that Jaishankar’s visit was an ice-breaker even though neither side proposed a bilateral meeting. Pakistan is looking to host the Champions Trophy next year and would like India to participate.The relationship between the 2 countries has remained in deep-freeze since the abortive bid to resume the dialogue process in 2015 under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. Things only worsened after Pakistan recalled its high commissioner in August 2019, following India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K.Indian government sources appreciated the fact that Shehbaz didn’t rake up any bilateral issue in his remarks as the host of the summit.While Jaishankar’s remarks on terrorism were seen as a message for Pakistan, Indian sources said the minister had only spoken about issues that the SCO has identified as key challenges and that other member-states can also relate to.Jaishankar is learnt to have had another extended conversation with Dar at the SCO lunch table on Wednesday where both were seated next to each other. “It wasn’t initially planned that way but later they sat together and spoke over lunch in the presence of other delegates,’’ said.Both sides denied that there was any proposal for resumption of dialogue. Shehbaz and Indian PM Narendra Modi are expected to come face to face next month at COP29 in Azerbaijan but for any substantive engagement, India will want Pakistan to first reappoint high commissioner.After his return from Pakistan, Jaishankar said in another post on X that India made a positive and constructive contribution to the talks in Islamabad and identified 8 takeaways from India’s perspective from the documents that were signed. These included upholding fair and balanced connectivity projects in accordance with international law, the goals and principles of the UN Charter and SCO Charter and a fair, open, inclusive and transparent multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.Significantly, another Pakistan minister, Ahsan Iqbal, had told visiting Indian journalists on Tuesday that Pakistan wants the 2 countries to return to the 1999 Lahore Declaration that called upon both sides to refrain from intervening and interfering in each other’s internal affairs. Shehbaz’s brother Nawaz Sharif, who reached the agreement with then Indian PM A B Vajpayee, has repeatedly accused former president Pervez Musharraf of scuttling the Declaration through his Kargil adventurism.","S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days.

He said attaining these original SCO objectives was even more important in an uncertain world marred by conflicts and debt.“It is axiomatic that development and growth requires peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the three evils,’’ said the minister.In a message to both China and Pakistan, the minister also said SCO cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and connectivity must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. “It should recognize territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas,’’ said the minister, adding cooperation can’t progress if global practices are cherry-picked, especially of trade and transit.India was again the only country in SCO to not endorse China’s BRI in the SCO joint statement. BRI’s flagship China Pakistan Economic Project ( CPEC ) passes through PoK, which India sees as under illegal occupation of Pakistan. Since it became a full member of SCO in 2017, India has repeatedly reminded member-states that it’s important for them to respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. China was represented by Premier Li Qiang in the meeting.The minister also spoke about the need to make the UN Security Council more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable. “The SCO must be in the lead of advocating such change, not hold back on a matter of such importance,’’ said the minister. China is the only P5 country not to publicly declare support for India’s UNSC permanent membership bid.“While we each make our contribution, the world order is more than the sum of its parts. As it changes, global institutions do need to keep pace. That is why the case for ‘reformed multilateralism’ gets stronger by the day.

Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party

Senior directors of a Pakistan college stated on Wednesday that there was no evidence to support claims of a student being raped on campus, despite reports circulating online that led to several days of protests. The allegations, which spread through social media posts, claimed that a woman was raped in the basement of a Punjab College for Women campus in Lahore .In response to the posts, hundreds of students, mostly male, engaged in protests that involved smashing windows and burning school buses. These demonstrations reflect a growing concern in Pakistan regarding safety, harassment, and sexual violence.Arif Chaudry, the Lahore director of the private Punjab Group of Colleges , which operates the women's college, was quoted by AFP during a press conference saying, ""The incident does not exist. I will resign and I will leave this profession and stand with the students if the incident took place.""Another director of the group, Agha Tahir Ijaz, urged students not to believe misinformation during the same news conference.As the anger grew over the alleged incident, police arrested a security guard who was identified in the online posts. However, they reported that no victim had come forward and that they were unable to verify the incident.The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has initiated an investigation targeting individuals responsible for disseminating the information via social media channels which is now claimed to be false.The protests, which began at two of the college's campuses on Monday afternoon, quickly spread to several other colleges throughout the city and continued for three days and resulted in injuries to at least 28 people.As the college denied the claims, Maryam Nawaz , the chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab also addressed the alleged rape incident, asserting that the accusations were 'fabricated'.Nawaz further claimed that the political party led by Imran Khan , Pakistan's former prime minister who is currently imprisoned, exploited the false allegation to provoke extensive student demonstrations and cause instability throughout the province.The Punjab government has closed the college campus where the alleged rape was said to have occurred until further notice. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said while warning that those responsible for spreading the false posts would face punishment. Addressing PTI founder Imran Khan, the CM added, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are."" She then claimed that the girl in question had suffered a back injury and had been receiving treatment in the hospital's intensive care unit since October 2 and was not raped.","Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party for 'fabricated' rape claims.

In May this year, Imran Khan was granted bail in land corruption cases but has been languishing in jail as he is serving time in two other cases.On Tuesday, Imran Khan's personal physician Dr Asim Hussain was not allowed to examine the former prime minister. Dr Hussain arrived at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi but had to leave without checking him.",Former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith made a long post on X expressing concern over the recent developments.

Islamabad 'lockdown' greets Chinese PM amid aftershocks of Karachi suicide attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/islamabad-lockdown-greets-chinese-pm-amid-aftershocks-of-karachi-suicide-attack/articleshow/114231377.cms,"ISLAMABAD: PM Li Qiang of China arrived in Islamabad Monday to a 21-gun salute and a security overdrive that included shutting schools and businesses in the capital city for three days as Pakistan pulled out all stops to avoid any safety slip-up during the first visit by a Chinese premier to the country in 11 years.Li's four-day trip to oversee the signing of bilateral trade and economic agreements, inaugurate an international airport in the southwestern port city of Gwadar, and attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit comes just over a week after a suicide attack near Karachi airport in which two Chinese engineers died and 11 others were wounded.As PM Shehbaz Sharif and members of his cabinet received Li at the Chaklala airbase in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, adjacent to Islamabad, news arrived of at least three cops and as many militants being killed during an attack on the district police headquarters in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.A wave of violence has swept Pakistan lately, including 21 miners being shot and killed in Balochistan, where the new Gwadar airport is located. Li is likely to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-funded airport in the southwestern province, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.Neither side commented on the reason for a virtual inauguration, but sources cited heightened security concerns following the recent Karachi attack for Li being advised against travelling to a restive region.Islamabad, too, has sought to temporarily curb the movements of Chinese nationals in the country, citing fears of violence from armed groups. Officials said the Karachi blast is likely to figure in talks between Li and his Pakistani counterpart.“We will review progress on existing initiatives, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), and also explore new avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation. The Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership is the cornerstone of regional stability and prosperity,” Shehbaz wrote on X.According to the foreign office, Li will also call on President Asif Ali Zardari and hold meetings with parliamentary members and the senior military leadership.The two-day SCO meeting starts Tuesday in Islamabad. The administration announced a three-day public holiday in the capital city, beginning Monday, with contingents of police, army and paramilitary forces out on the streets in what appeared to be a veritable lockdown.The SCO participants include the PMs of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India's foreign minister, S Jaishankar, and Iran's vice-president, Mohammad Reza Aref, are also expected at the summit.Jaishankar has already stated that he wouldn't discuss bilateral ties with Pakistan during his visit, the first in nearly a decade.The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan announced a protest Tuesday in Islamabad if the govt did not allow his family members, lawyers and doctors to meet him in prison.","PM Li Qiang of China arrived in Islamabad Monday to a 21-gun salute and a security overdrive that included shutting schools and businesses in the capital city for three days.

Lahore college protest: 28 students injured in clashes with police over alleged rape,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/lahore-college-protest-28-students-injured-in-clashes-with-police-over-alleged-rape/articleshow/114225040.cms,"Representative Image

At least 28 students, including girls, from various campuses of a well-known private college in Lahore, were injured during clashes with the police as they protested against the alleged on-campus rape of a female student, police said on Monday. The protests erupted Monday morning across at least four boys' and girls' campuses of the Punjab Group of Colleges , owned by the Dunya media group , following reports that a female student at the Gulberg girls' campus in Lahore was raped allegedly by a security guard in the institution's basement.As news of the alleged rape spread on social media, students from various campuses began protesting, accusing the college administration of negligence in the matter.A large number of students, including girls, set fire to college furniture and chanted slogans against the administration. As the protests escalated, with students blocking roads, the police resorted to baton charges to disperse the demonstrators.""During the clash, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured. One student's condition is critical,"" a Rescue 1122 official said, adding that the injured students are receiving treatment at Services Hospital.Sharaz Abbas, a student at Punjab College, told PTI that they were protesting to demand justice for the victim.""The Punjab police brutally assaulted us both inside and outside the campus. Even the girl students were not spared,"" he said, adding that the students would continue their protests until justice is served for the victim.A list of 28 injured students shows that their age ranges between 16 and 25.Talking to reporters, senior police officer Faisal Kamran said the police were forced to use batons. He said the students were demanding the custody of the college principal, and had the police not intervened in time, the protesting students might have harmed the principal and other staff members.Kamran also confirmed that the suspect has been arrested, but noted that the victim or her family is yet to report the incident.""So far, the claims related to the alleged rape have not been verified, but an investigation is underway,"" he said.Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said no formal rape report has been filed with the college.""Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz is closely monitoring the situation. Instead of politicising the plight of innocent girls, we urge anyone with verified information or knowledge of the victim to share it with the Punjab government,"" the minister said. She also expressed regret over the sensationalism surrounding the suffering of these young women and confirmed that the suspect security guard has been in police custody since Sunday.",Protests erupted Monday morning across at least four boys' and girls' campuses of the Punjab Group of Colleges.

"Pakistan to repay over $30 billion debt in FY25, says central bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-repay-over-30-billion-debt-in-fy25-says-central-bank/articleshow/114208042.cms,"Representative Image

Cash-strapped Pakistan 's central bank has revealed the country is scheduled to repay a total of USD 30.35 billion in maturing foreign debt and interest payments in 12 months (August 2024 to July 2025) including those significant loans which bilateral creditors roll over every year.The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, cited by a JS Global report, showed that the payments from August 2024 to July 2025 include significant loans that bilateral creditors roll over annually.The Express Tribune reported that Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.Under the latest USD 7 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Pakistan's repayments and interest payments are fully secured for the 37-month loan period. Despite the rising repayments and interest payments, the foreign debt-to-GDP ratio has decreased from 27.6 per cent in August of the previous year to 20.2 per cent in August 2024, due to the expansion of Pakistan's economy in FY24 compared to the contraction in FY23.The data highlights the increasing foreign debt repayments and interest payments each year, emphasizing the need for economic managers, planners, and parliamentarians to explore ways to boost foreign income and reduce external expenditures. Compared to the USD 21.2 billion (including rollovers) paid by Pakistan over the past 12 months (August 2023 to July 2024), the current 12-month period's repayment and interest payment sum of USD 30 billion is significantly higher, according to JS Global.The increase in repayments and interest payments for the ongoing 12 months can be attributed to fresh loans provided by Saudi Arabia, UAE, and IMF in late June and July 2023, amounting to around USD 4 billion, as well as an additional USD 2 billion lent by IMF between August 2023 and April 2024. These loans have increased the repayment pressure (including significant rollover) in the coming years.Topline Research, citing the latest IMF documents, reported that Pakistan's gross external financing requirement has dropped to a 9-year low of USD 18.8 billion (excluding expected rollovers and contained current account deficit) for the ongoing fiscal year (July 2024 to June 2025). However, another researcher mentioned that Pakistan is also expected to add fresh foreign loans amounting to USD 3 billion to USD 4 billion in the current fiscal year (FY25).A third researcher emphasized the need for Pakistan to reduce its external expenditures through import substitution. Implementing such measures would help improve the country's ability to make external payments and increase foreign exchange reserves, as reported by The Express Tribune.","Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.
