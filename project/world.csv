"Unprecedented solar activity could light up US skies, disrupt power and communications",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/aurora-borealis-northern-lights-unprecedented-solar-activity-could-light-up-us-skies/articleshow/110024569.cms,"An intense solar storm , one of the strongest in over two decades, made its presence felt on Earth this Friday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The solar outburst, which arrived earlier than anticipated, is expected to cause disruptions in power and communications throughout the weekend and into the next week.NOAA has issued a severe geomagnetic storm warning and has advised operators of power plants and spacecraft to take necessary precautions.Rob Steenburgh, a scientist at NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center, emphasized, ""For most people here on planet Earth, they won’t have to do anything,"" suggesting that the immediate impact on everyday life might be minimal for the general public.However, the geomagnetic disturbance is potent enough to produce visible northern lights far south in the U.S., reaching as far down as Alabama and Northern California. Steenburgh noted that while the auroras might not display the dramatic curtains of color typically seen in polar regions, they could still present ""splashes of greenish hues.""Mike Bettwy, operations chief for the prediction center, encouraged the public to document this rare event, saying, ""Snap a picture of the sky and there might be actually a nice little treat there for you."" This phenomenon could mirror the historical auroras seen during the 1859 Carrington Event, although experts like NOAA's Shawn Dahl have clarified that this storm, while strong, is not expected to reach those levels.The solar storm has been categorized as level 4 on a 5-point scale, posing risks primarily to high-voltage transmission lines and satellites, which could affect navigation and communication services on Earth. The 2003 geomagnetic storm, which had similar strength, resulted in significant power disruptions in Sweden and damage to power transformers in South Africa.As the sun nears the peak of its 11-year cycle, increased solar activity has been observed, with multiple solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) detected since Wednesday. These CMEs carry billions of tons of plasma and magnetic fields, potentially leading to more disturbances in the coming days.Nasa has reassured that the International Space Station's crew, including seven astronauts, is safe, with plans in place to mitigate increased radiation levels. The space agency, along with other space-focused organizations, remains vigilant, monitoring the ongoing solar activity.The storm provides a unique opportunity for scientific observation and public engagement with space weather phenomena. As the storm continues, authorities recommend that residents in affected areas prepare for potential power outages and enjoy the natural spectacle safely.(With inputs from agencies)","NOAA has issued a severe geomagnetic storm warning and has advised operators of power plants and spacecraft to take necessary precautions.

New Russian space weapon raises alarm in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-russian-space-weapon-raises-alarm-in-us/articleshow/109919862.cms,"NEW DELHI: US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia 's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, which could potentially transform Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) into a perilous battleground. The discussions about this emerging threat were highlighted by Mallory Stewart, the US assistant secretary of state for arms control, and John Plumb, the assistant secretary of defense for space policy, underscoring the serious implications of such developments.The ASAT weapon in question, allegedly already tested by Russia in high radiation orbits under the guise of electronic testing, diverges from typical scientific satellite protocols. This weapon is designed to disrupt a wide array of satellite operations spanning civilian, commercial, and military sectors by detonating in LEO, which extends approximately 100 to 1200 miles above the Earth, a report in Asia Times said.While there is no immediate deployment, the indiscriminate nature of such a weapon could severely damage satellites and impair critical global services including communication, weather forecasting, and security operations. The US officials emphasized the widespread implications of deploying such technology, noting its potential to make LEO unusable for any satellite operations.The concept of using nuclear weapons in ASAT roles isn't new and harks back to Cold War anxieties. Historical precedents like the US's Project 437 during the Kennedy administration, which was later abandoned due to its potential to damage both enemy and US satellites and infrastructure indiscriminately, illustrate the complexities and risks associated with such weapons.Recent simulations, such as those conducted by Chinese military scientists, have explored the effects of a nuclear detonation at altitude on satellite functionality. These studies show that while a high-altitude nuclear explosion would not create a traditional explosive cloud due to the absence of air, it would generate a belt of high-energy particles trapped by Earth’s magnetic field, posing a significant risk to spacecraft.In response to the decisive role satellite constellations like Elon Musk’s Starlink have played in modern warfare, evidenced by their utility in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, both Russia and China have hinted at developing ASAT capabilities to counter these systems. Reports suggest that these nations view the neutralization of such satellite networks as crucial to diminishing their adversaries' operational effectiveness.US and allied commercial satellites, including those like Starlink which have been pivotal in supporting Ukraine, have been identified by Russian officials as potential targets in the event of escalating hostilities. This stance highlights the broader strategy of using space capabilities as a means of asserting dominance and the potential shift towards militarization of space, despite international treaties like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which seeks to bar such activities.The development and potential deployment of nuclear ASAT weapons pose not only a technological or tactical challenge but also a diplomatic and strategic one, threatening the fabric of international space law and the peaceful use of outer space.",US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite weapon.

But civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the Fortson family, has accused the deputy of going to the wrong apartment and said the shooting was unjustified.The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating.At Thursday's news conference, Chantemekki Fortson held a large framed portrait of her son in dress uniform. He joined the Air Force in 2019, the same year he graduated from Ronald McNair - a majority Black high school in metro Atlanta's DeKalb County where roughly half of students don't graduate in four years.Air Force service was a lifelong dream, and Fortson rose to the rank of senior airman. He was stationed at Hurlburt Field near Fort Walton Beach.""Where we come from, we don't end up where Roger ended up,"" his mother said.Fortson, a gunner aboard the AC-130J, earned an Air Medal with combat device, which is typically awarded after 20 flights in a combat zone or for conspicuous valor or achievement on a single mission. An Air Force official said Fortson's award reflected both - completing flights in a combat zone and taking specific actions during one of the missions to address an in-flight emergency and allow the mission to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details that had not been made public.But his service, like almost everything else he did, had a larger purpose.""He was trying to help his family have a better life,"" Crump said Thursday.That meant serving as a role model for his 16-year-old brother, his mom said, saving up to try to buy her a house, and getting her a new car. His nickname was ""Mr. Make It Happen.""Chantemekki Fortson recalled that her son, then in high school, accompanied her in an ambulance to the hospital when she was giving birth to her daughter and tried to tell the doctor how to deliver the baby.The girl and his brother were always in his thoughts. Fortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons.Chantemekki Fortson said her son was injured while loading a plane and was in such severe pain he thought he would die. But he told his mom he had to push through for his brother and sister.He was also by her side when she got into an accident a short time later and needed to go to the emergency room.""That's the kind of gift he was,"" she said. ""They took something that can never be replaced.""","Roger Fortson, 23, was a gunner aboard the AC-130J.

""Please, leave me alone,"" he shouted, asking, ""What did I do wrong?"" Mucus had crusted in his beard. A pair of stained pants hung off his slender frame. ""Come on,"" a officer said as he stumbled forward, disoriented and agitated.""We've got to leave the station."" The team then handcuffed him and dragged him out of the station.The police officers were part of a team led by a medical worker whose job is to move - by force, if needed - mentally ill people, who are often homeless, out of New York City's transit system. The intervention teams are part of an expansive effort to make the subway safer after a string of shocking crimes. Part of the plan involves finding solutions to one of the transit system 's most frustrating problems: people experiencing mental health issues and homelessness living on trains and in stations.Officials with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which operates the subway, said they were doing what was necessary to help troubled people while keeping them away from passengers. In survey after survey, riders have said they would use mass transit more often if they saw fewer people behaving erratically and more cops.But some advocates for mentally ill people believe the teams use heavy-handed tactics that do more harm than good. In defence, MTA officials said that the agency's officers must sometimes restrain people who are suffering from severe psychiatric distress.Launched last fall, the programme, called Subway Co-Response Outreach, or SCOUT, has removed at least 113 people from the subway. Most go willingly to shelters, or to hospitals for medical treatment, according to transit officials.There is no data to suggest that people with mental illness are more likely than others to commit violent crimes. But some New Yorkers were put on edge by a series of high-profile attacks carried out by mentally ill homeless people in recent months.",The intervention teams are part of an expansive effort to make the subway safer after a string of shocking crimes.

In November last year, US federal prosecutors charged Indian national Nikhil Gupta with working with an Indian government employee in the foiled plot to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.Pannun, wanted in India on terror charges, holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada. He has been designated as a terrorist by the Union Home Ministry under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.""When I was referring to a relationship that might have bumps along the road, this would be potentially the first big fight in a relationship,"" Garcetti said in response to a question at an event organised on Thursday by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), a top American think-tank.""And so far, knock on wood, I would say the administration is satisfied with the accountability that we've demanded on this, because this is a red line for America, for our citizens,"" he said.He said it was an ongoing criminal case.""There's an indictment that's been brought. And if there is any connection to State actors in that, there has to be accountability. We expect that not only from our side, but we expect India to have that accountability,"" he said.""So, there's been a commission of inquiry that India has brought together and that we expect, while we do the criminal case that is about American justice, that there need to be consequences and shared information,"" he said.""So far, one of the most difficult things you can do as an ambassador in diplomacy, I have been satisfied with what they have done. I think the administration is, but we have many steps still to go,"" Garcetti said.Garcetti appeared in a discussion with Michael Froman, the former US Trade Representative under the Obama Administration.Froman said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is about to be re-elected, which everyone is reassuming.Responding to a question on concerns being raised in certain quarters in the US about the human rights situation in India, Garcetti said this is not America's responsibility.""It is not America's responsibility to fix India. It is America's responsibility to engage with India, to promote our interests, and also to reflect our values,"" Garcetti said.""I can tell you it's very strong. I think people from the outside say, they want a strategic relationship with India, so everybody's looking the other way when it comes to human rights issues and stuff. It's actually not true,"" he said.Whether it's human rights reports or religious freedom reports, the US always discusses it with India.""For instance, there's been violence in a state called Manipur in India, where there is fighting between two different ethnic groups. I was asked in my second month or third month in India, what do you think about the violence there?""I answered...because there are some horrible images we saw, women being dragged through the streets, people being killed and shot, churches and temples being burned, said, our hearts break as human beings when we see suffering, point one,"" Garcetti said.The second point, he said that this is an Indian issue for India to resolve.""And point three is that America is here to support and help in any way if asked.

A crowd outside the camp began gathering and chanting pro-Palestinian slogans but were dispersed by 6 a.m.At the University of Arizona in Tucson, campus police in riot gear fired tear gas late Thursday at protesters before tearing down an encampment that included wood and plastic barriers on campus. In statement, the University of Arizona said it made the decision because the encampment violated school policy.""A structure made from wooden pallets and other debris was erected on campus property after 5 p.m. in violation of the policy,"" the school said in a statement. ""University officials issued warnings to remove the encampment and disperse. The warnings were ignored.""The school also said that police vehicles were spiked, and rocks and water bottles thrown at officers and university staff.In Philadelphia early Friday, police detained people who were at an encampment that has been in place at the University of Pennsylvania for more than two weeks. Officers moved in after giving protesters a warning to leave campus or face possible arrest.Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the United States and in Europe. Some colleges cracked down immediately, while others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in the police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.The protest movement began nearly three weeks ago at Columbia University in New York City. It has since swept college campuses nationwide, with demonstrators generally seeking to draw attention to the deaths in the Israel-Hamas war or calling for their schools to stop doing business with Israel or divest from companies that support its war efforts. More than 2,500 people have been arrested.The move at MIT comes several days after police first attempted to clear the camp only to see protesters storm past barriers and restore the encampment, which includes about a dozen tents in the heart of the campus in Cambridge.Before removing the encampment, MIT earlier in the week had started suspending dozens of students involved in the encampment, meaning they wouldn't be able to take part in academic activities nor commencement.Protesters insisted the move would not stop them from demanding that MIT end all ties to the Israeli military. They encampment had been up for at least weeks and especially angered Jewish students, who have held counter protests near the camp.""This is only going to make us stronger. They can't arrest the movement,"" Quinn Perian, an undergraduate student at MIT and organizer for MIT Jews for Ceasefire, said. ""We are going to continue and won't back down until MIT agrees to cut ties with the Israeli military. MIT would rather arrest and suspend some students than they would end their complicity with the genocide going in Gaza .""The encampment had been up for at least two weeks and especially angered Jewish students, who have held counterprotests nearby. They covered a lawn with small Israeli flags and put up posters of some of the people abducted by the militants in the attack that ignited the war in Gaza.MIT President Sally Kornbluth, working to strike a balance between recognize the suffering in Gaza but concerns about the ""safety of our community"" warned Monday the encampment would have be removed.""This prolonged use of MIT property as a venue for protest, without permission, especially on an issue with such sharp disagreement, is no longer safely sustainable,"" she wrote to the MIT community.","Police in riot gear encircled the MIT camp and gave protesters about 15 minutes to leave.

2024 will be last election ‘decided by US citizens’: Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/2024-will-be-last-election-decided-by-us-citizens-elon-musk/articleshow/110012482.cms,"NEW DELHI: Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and a prominent tech figure , recently ignited a political debate with his claim that the 2024 US presidential election could be the last to be decided by American citizens alone. This provocative statement, shared on his own social media platform X, reflects his concerns about the influence of illegal immigrants on electoral outcomes—a topic that has long been a point of contention in US politics.Musk's comment was in response to a new bill passed by House Republicans that aims to include a citizenship question in the national census, a move opposed by the White House and unanimously by Democrat legislators.As per a report in the Independent, the bill, known as the Equal Representation Act, is designed to alter how congressional seats are allocated by excluding non-citizens from the population counts used in electoral apportionment. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson defended the legislation, arguing that it is common sense that ""only American citizens should be counted for electoral apportionment.""This legislative change, if implemented, would potentially impact states with large immigrant populations—both Democrat and Republican-leaning—by possibly reducing their representation in Congress. Critics of the bill argue that it contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment, which mandates counting the ""whole number of persons"" in each state for census purposes. The Biden administration has expressed strong opposition to the bill, emphasizing a commitment to maintaining the census's accuracy and its historical tradition of non-political interference.Musk's statements highlight a deepening divide in American society and politics over immigration and its implications for democracy. He frames the issue as one of electoral integrity, suggesting that the Democratic Party's opposition to the bill is part of a broader strategy to increase their electoral base through immigration, thus ""disenfranchising"" US citizens. This aligns with a broader narrative among some Republicans who view immigration as a threat to the electoral process.However, this perspective is highly contested.Research and data from organizations like the American Immigration Council show that a significant portion of the US immigrant population is comprised of naturalized citizens eligible to vote, countering the argument that non-citizens are improperly influencing US elections.",Elon Musk said the 2024 US presidential election could be the last to be decided by American citizens alone.

The incident, which unfolded three hours into the 12-hour journey, began over a seating dispute and escalated into a physical confrontation.According to EVA Air's statement to CNN, the skirmish started when one passenger, who was coughing, prompted another to seek a different seat.However, this attempt to change seats led to a conflict as the chosen seat was already occupied, resulting in a physical altercation between the two men involved.The quick response by the three female flight attendants, with support from other passengers, helped deescalate the situation, allowing the flight to proceed and land on time in San Francisco. The airline emphasized its ""zero-tolerance policy towards incidents of passenger nuisance"" and commended the crew for their effective handling of the situation.Upon landing, the disruptive passengers were handed over to the San Francisco police for further questioning. EVA Air also noted that it plans to reward the crew members for their actions during the incident.This incident marks another notable event for EVA Air following a 2019 controversy involving inappropriate demands made by a passenger towards female flight attendants. Since then, EVA has revised its hiring policies to include male cabin crew members, aiming to prevent similar issues in the future.","A mid-air altercation between two passengers aboard EVA Air Flight BR08 was promptly resolved thanks to the intervention of three flight attendants.

About the survey

NEW DELHI: A recent survey reveals significant shifts in global approval ratings for the United States, China, and Russia , with America's standing notably declining in the Middle East and parts of Europe. The Democracy Perception Index 2024, conducted by the German firm Latana for the Alliance of Democracies, reflects these changes based on responses from 53 countries.The US has experienced a downturn in approval particularly in the Middle East and Europe, largely due to its support for Israel amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza.""US popularity has taken a hit globally in 2024, particularly in MENA countries but also in Europe. At the same time, attitudes towards China and Russia have become more positive all around the world outside of Europe and the US,"" the report said.""Attitudes towards the EU have become more negative in a handful of countries since 2023, particularly in many Muslim-majority countries (Egypt, Iran, Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia), but also Poland and Ukraine,"" the report added.Frederick DeVeaux, a senior researcher at Latana, noted, ""For the first time since the start of the Biden administration, many Western European countries have returned to net negative perceptions of the US."" This decline is especially pronounced in Germany, Austria, Ireland, Belgium, and Switzerland.Conversely, Russia and China have seen improvements in their international images. In regions outside of Europe, sentiments toward these nations have become increasingly positive. This is in contrast to the US, where approval has suffered.The survey also highlights differing global perspectives on economic relations and sanctions. While the European region continues to support cutting economic ties with Russia due to the Ukraine conflict, other parts of the world prefer maintaining business relationships with Moscow. Similarly, there is a division between Western countries and others regarding potential sanctions against China in the event of an invasion of Taiwan.The Democracy Perception Index is an annual survey that canvasses opinions on democracy, geopolitics, and global power players. This year's study involved approximately 63,000 respondents from various countries, providing a broad overview of current global attitudes towards these major nations.","A recent survey reveals significant shifts in global approval ratings for the United States, China, and Russia.

Pakistan rights body voices concern over increasing 'political polarisation',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-rights-body-voices-concern-over-increasing-political-polarisation/articleshow/109978365.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed concerns over increasing political polarisation in the country, resulting in greater restrictions on civil and political rights, Pakistan-based Dawn reported. The HRCP demanded economic justice and protection of civil rights and stressed the importance of upholding democratic principles and the rule of law.In its annual report, 'State of Human Rights 2023', released on Wednesday, the HRCP noted with concern that irreparable political divisions led to public acts of arson and violence on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan.""What followed was flagrant disregard for the Constitution as unelected forces tightened their grip on the country's democratic structures and civic spaces shrank to an all-time low,"" the report read, according to Dawn.According to the report, the state's response to the May 9 riots was to quell dissent by resurrecting military courts to try civilians, perpetrating enforced disappearances, ordering mass arrests and allegedly orchestrating public disassociation from the PTI among many senior party leaders.The report noted that the right to freedom of expression and assembly took a particular hit during the year. According to the report, the rule of law was poor, with six-year high in fatalities related to terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations. The report noted that the practice of extrajudicial killings continued while street crime and the incidence of mob lynchings witnessed a rise.According to the report, journalists, activists and political workers were subjected to enforced disappearances across the country, like what happened in previous years, Dawn reported. The report noted that young Baloch women held a long march from Turbat to Islamabad to protest against alleged extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.The report said that religious minorities reported an increasing climate of fear, particularly following the attack in Jaranwala, in which scores of churches and homes were torched and looted by mobs after allegations of blasphemy against a Christian man.The report said that Afghan nationals were rounded up in police raids and sent to deportation centres. Speaking at the launch of the report, HRCP secretary-general Harris Khalique said the economic crisis in 2023 had 'pushed tens of millions of ordinary citizens to the brink of desperation.'Speaking on incidents of enforced disappearances, Harris Khalique condemned the role and performance of the Commission of Inquiry of Enforced Disappearances and termed it 'disgraceful,' Dawn reported.HRCP chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt called it critical for the state to fulfil people's rights to education, livelihood and health. He also expressed concern over the low rate of trade unionisation.

This completes the NA’s total strength of 336 seats.In March, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had ruled that SIC was not eligible for reserved seats and decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries. The verdict was rejected by PTI as unconstitutional and the alliance had filed a plea against the electoral watchdog’s decision in the Peshawar HC, but it rejected the appeal.In response, SIC moved the Supreme Court last month urging it to allot the party the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and set aside the Peshawar HC ruling.Accepting SIC’s appeal for a hearing, the apex court clarified that the Peshawar HC order upholding ECP’s decision was suspended to the extent of the remaining reserved seats distributed among other parties.After losing the extra reserved seats, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government had lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities.

However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.

KABUL: At least 50 people, mainly women and children, were killed Friday in flash flooding that ripped through northern Afghanistan , official said, in a country highly vulnerable to climate change .A disaster management official in the northern province of Baghlan said heavy seasonal rains sparked the flooding, and residents were unprepared for the sudden rush of water.""So far, the number of dead is 50 as per the hospital authorities of Baghlan-e-Markazi district,"" said Hedayatullah Hamdard, the head of the provincial natural disaster management department, adding the toll could rise.Emergency personnel were ""searching for any possible victims under the mud and rubble, with the help of security forces from the national army and police"", Hamdard told AFP late Friday.""The weather is very gloomy right now and it might pour again,"" he added.Dozens of tents, blankets and food were provided to those who lost their homes, the official said.Video footage seen on social media showed huge torrents of muddy water swamping roads and bodies shrouded in white and black cloth.In one video clip, children are heard crying and a group of men are looking at floodwaters, in which bits of broken wood and debris from homes can be seen.Since mid-April, flash flooding and other floods have left about 100 people dead in 10 of Afghanistan's provinces, with no region entirely spared, according to authorities.Farmland has been swamped in a country where 80 percent of the more than 40 million people depend on agriculture to survive.Rains on Friday also caused heavy damages in northeastern Badakhshan province and central Ghor province, officials said.Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said authorities would provide support to those impacted by the flooding across the country.The government ""expresses its deep sympathy with the families of dead and wounded, and instructs the ministry of natural disaster management, ministries of defence and interior, and provincial authorities to spare no resource in rescue efforts"", he said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.The provincial director of natural disaster management in Badakhshan said the mountainous province had seen ""heavy financial losses in several areas... due to floods"".He added that casualties were feared in Tishkan district, where flooding had blocked a road and cut off access to an area where some 20,000 people lived.Afghanistan -- which had a relatively dry winter, making it more difficult for the soil to absorb rainfall -- is highly vulnerable to climate change.The nation, ravaged by four decades of war, is one of the poorest in the world and, according to scientists, one of the worst prepared to face the consequences of global warming .Afghanistan, which is responsible for only 0.06 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, ranks sixth on the list of countries most at risk from climate change, experts say.Half of Afghanistan's population lives under the poverty line, and 15 million people are experiencing food insecurity, according to the World Bank.","At least 50 people, mainly women and children, killed in flash flooding in Afghanistan.
