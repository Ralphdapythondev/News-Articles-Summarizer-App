Robert Fico: All you need to know about Slovak PM targeted in assassination attempt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-robert-fico-all-you-need-to-know-about-slovak-pm-targeted-in-assassination-attempt/articleshow/110162816.cms,"Who is Robert Fico?

Fico, who is serving as a premier for the third time, along with his leftist party Direction – Social Democracy (Smer), emerged victorious in Slovakia’s parliamentary elections held on September 30, 2023. This victory marked a political resurgence for him, as he campaigned on a platform supporting Russia and opposing America.

Critics were concerned that under Fico, Slovakia might deviate from its pro-Western path and align with the direction taken by Hungary under the populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

The victory in 2023 signifies Fico serving his fourth term as the prime minister, after previously occupying the position from 2006 to 2010, from 2012 to 2018, and once more from 2023. Fico's political career is remarkable due to his achievement as the prime minister with the longest tenure in Slovakia's history, spanning more than ten years.

Rise to political prominence

In 1992, Fico started his political career by winning a seat in the Slovak Parliament when Czechoslovakia was still united.

In his early career, he was appointed to the Council of Europe, where he acquired valuable political experience. In 1999, Fico established the Direction – Social Democracy (Smer) party, a political movement that he has been leading since it started.

Fico rose to power after his party won the 2006 parliamentary election, resulting in the establishment of his initial cabinet. His political position is commonly characterized as populist, attracting a wide range of voters through a combination of social welfare policies and nationalistic language.

After the 2010 parliamentary election, Fico moved into a position as a member of parliament in the opposition, ultimately becoming the leader of the opposition. His political strength was shown in 2012 when a vote of no confidence in the Iveta Radičová cabinet resulted in early elections. Fico's Smer party achieved a significant win, obtaining 83 seats and establishing a government with an overwhelming majority, the first of its kind in Slovakia since the end of communism in 1989.

In 2013, Fico announced that he was running for the 2014 presidential election. However, he lost to his political rival Andrej Kiska in the second round of voting. Despite this defeat, Fico continued to be an important figure in Slovak politics.

Fico's third term as prime minister ended suddenly in March 2018 during a political crisis that occurred after the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak. This crisis resulted in extensive protests and demands for government accountability. As a response, Fico stepped down, and Deputy PM Peter Pellegrini took over.

The parliamentary election of 2023 signified the comeback of Fico to a position of authority. His campaign centered on ending military assistance to Ukraine during the Russian invasion, a position that struck a chord with a large segment of the voters. Smer emerged victorious in the election, securing the highest number of votes at 22.95% and 42 seats.

Fico established a coalition government with Voice – Social Democracy (Hlas) and the Slovak National Party, commencing his fourth tenure as prime minister on October 25, 2023.

In his current term, the government led by Fico has adopted a controversial position on global matters, particularly by declining to participate in a coalition led by the Czech Republic consisting of approximately 20 countries to offer military assistance to Ukraine.

Europe on edge

In a disturbing incident that has sent shockwaves across Europe, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was targeted in an assassination attempt that left him seriously injured. The event unfolded on a seemingly ordinary day in Handlova, Slovakia, when Fico was approached by a gunman as he was engaging with supporters. The assailant fired five times at close range, critically wounding the prime minister.The PM's bodyguards swiftly intervened, tackling the gunman and whisking Fico away in a government vehicle.He was subsequently airlifted to a hospital for emergency medical treatment.""I was very shocked ... fortunately as far as I know the operation went well - and I guess in the end he will survive ... he's not in a life-threatening situation at this moment,"" Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Environment Minister Tomas Taraba told the BBC's Newshour.The attacker, identified as 71-year-old Slovak poet Juraj Cintula, was arrested at the scene. The motivations behind the attack appear to be politically charged, reflecting deep divisions within Slovakia and broader regional tensions. Cintula reportedly made a ""confession"" in custody, blaming Fico's media policies for his drastic actions.A seasoned figure in Slovakian politics, Fico was born in 1964 and began his political career as a member of the Communist Party before Slovakia became its independent nation. With a law degree and vast experience in legal and governmental roles, Fico has been a dominant force in Slovak politics.Fico's political journey is marked by significant milestones, including his first election to Slovakia's parliament in 1992 and his subsequent rise to become the chairman of the Smer (Direction) party in 1999. His tenure is characterized by a left-populist ideology, though comparisons have been drawn with right-wing leaders like Viktor Orbán of Hungary.After a hiatus, Fico reclaimed the prime ministerial position last year, marking his third term and establishing him as the longest-serving head of government in Slovakia's history. His recent electoral victory was fueled by a platform that controversially aligned more closely with pro-Russian stances and criticized US and Nato policies, especially regarding the situation in Ukraine.This assassination attempt occurs against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tension. Fico, known for his pro-Putin stance, has been a controversial figure in European politics, especially regarding his opposition to supporting Ukraine against Russian aggressions.Starting his fourth term as prime minister, Fico administration stopped arms shipments to Ukraine, and critics are concerned that he might steer Slovakia — a Nato member with a population of 5.4 million — away from its pro-Western trajectory towards a path similar to that of Hungary under populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.Russian President Vladimir Putin , who has shown support for Fico in the past, condemned the attack. Describing the shooting as a ""monstrous"" crime, Putin said in a telegram sent to Slovakia's President Zuzana Caputova: ""I know Robert Fico as a courageous and strong-minded man. I very much hope that these qualities will help him to survive this difficult situation.""The implications of this attack are far-reaching, raising concerns about the stability of not only Slovakia but the entire European region. Fico’s policies and his alignment with Russia have been divisive, and this incident may further inflame political tensions.World leaders, including US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , have condemned the attack. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized that such acts of violence undermine democracy and have no place in society.Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of UK's 1st Royal Tank Regiment, expressed his concerns to Daily Mail, saying, ""There are high stakes in Europe and the threat of a wider war only benefits Putin.""He further warned, ""This is yet another wake-up call to the West.

Xi Jinping is now Vladimir Putin's 'big brother': How Russia-China ties changed over the years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/xi-jinping-is-now-putins-big-brother-how-russia-china-ties-changed-over-the-years/articleshow/110162516.cms,"Driving the news

This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and the second in just over six months to China.

However, this is Putin's 19th visit to China since he became the Russian president.

In February 2022, China and Russia announced a ""no limits"" partnership during Putin's visit to Beijing, occurring just days before he deployed tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, sparking the most severe land conflict in Europe since World War Two.

Putin's decision to choose China for his first overseas visit after being inaugurated for a new six-year term, extending his leadership until at least 2030, underscores the significance he places on his bond with Xi and his global strategic priorities.

In a discussion with China's Xinhua news agency, Putin commended Chinese President Xi Jinping for fostering a ""strategic partnership"" between Russia and China, which he described as rooted in national interests and profound mutual trust.

Zoom in

This visit is not just a routine diplomatic engagement but a strategic display of defiance against Western pressures.

The frequency and depth of military collaborations, such as joint naval drills near strategic global areas, signal a growing military camaraderie.

However, these maneuvers signal more about the depth of their partnership than actual operational military alliances. The joint naval patrols near American waters and the inclusion of Russia in Chinese-led military drills are significant developments that the West views with increasing concern.

Moreover, the economic interdependence, highlighted by China’s role as a critical supplier to Russia’s defense sector, showcases the depth of their bilateral ties, which are becoming increasingly consequential in the global arena.

Why it matters

The strengthening bond between China and Russia is pivotal as both nations seek to assert their power on the global stage against a backdrop of American dominance.

This alliance is particularly critical for Russia as it continues to face extensive economic sanctions from the West.

China’s support not only bolsters Russia’s economy but also enhances its military capabilities through joint exercises and technology transfers.

As per a report in the Economist, the flow of Chinese technology and other valuable goods to Russian weapons manufacturers has become a significant concern for the United States. According to US secretary of state Antony Blinken China was the ""top supplier"" of various items considered be ""dual use,"" including machine tools, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose, a vital component in artillery shells. These items have both civilian and military applications.

""Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China's support,"" Blinken said. In a later conversation with Borge Brende, the president of the World Economic Forum, Blinken said that over the past year, Chinese technology had been facilitating Russia's production of weapons and ammunition, such as missiles and tanks, at an unprecedented rate in its modern history, surpassing even the levels seen during the Cold War era, the Economist report added.

What they are saying

""It was the unprecedentedly high level of the strategic partnership between our countries that determined my choice of China as the first state that I would visit after officially taking office as president of the Russian Federation,"" Putin said.

""We will try to establish closer cooperation in the field of industry and high technology, space and peaceful nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy sources and other innovative sectors,"" Putin said.

""This is Putin's first trip after his inauguration, and it is therefore intended to show that Sino-Russian relations are moving up another level,"" independent Russian political analyst Konstantin Kalachev told AFP.

""The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it,"" Xi told Putin.

""China is willing to ... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world,"" said Xi.

""The United States still thinks in terms of the Cold War and is guided by the logic of bloc confrontation, putting the security of 'narrow groups' above regional security and stability, which creates a security threat for all countries in the region,"" the joint statement said. ""The US must abandon this behaviour.""

The 'big brother' role reversal

The relationship between Russia and China has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, with Moscow becoming increasingly dependent on Beijing as it faces Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine.

Once a partnership of equals, the Russia-China dynamic has become increasingly asymmetrical, with China holding the upper hand. While China accounts for around 33% of Russia's overall trade, Russia makes up only 4% of China's trade, according to data provider CEIC Data.

China has emerged as a critical source of essential goods for Russia, supplying everything from electronics to washing machines to tractors.

However, Russia's arms exports to China have fallen precipitously in recent years, while China has become a significant provider of optics, microelectronics, drone engines, and other materials that enable Russia's weapons production. The energy trade between the two countries has also shifted in China's favor.

""It's a strategic partnership where both sides need each other but it's increasingly asymmetrical in China's favor,"" Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, told the Wall Street Journal. ""China is not only the more powerful partner, but also the one that has many more options than Russia and the war has exacerbated that.""

Russia, with its oil and gas now shunned in Europe, has had to sell at significant discounts to China.

China’s upper hand is evident in negotiations over new projects like the Power-of-Siberia 2 gas pipeline, where Beijing's reluctance to finalize terms highlights its leverage over Moscow.

Putin, who is sometimes known for his haughty displays of making other leaders wait during their visits to the Kremlin, has adopted a noticeably deferential tone towards Xi Jinping, a LA Times report said.

No wonder, an Economist report described the visit as ""Vladimir Putin will meet his big brother in Beijing.""

What next

China, once the junior partner of Moscow in the global Communist hierarchy, has emerged as by far the most powerful of Russia's friends in the world.

Consequently, in the evolving personal relationship between the two ""presidents for life"", Xi has emerged as the ""big brother"" to Putin.

At the same time, the strengthening ties between China and Russia represent a significant shift in global alliances and power structures. The implications of their collaboration will undoubtedly extend far beyond their own borders, challenging the current international order and testing the diplomatic resilience of the Western powers.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a two-day state visit to China, underscoring the solidarity between the two allies as Russia continues its new offensive in Ukraine.Upon his arrival at dawn, Putin was greeted by an honor guard from the People's Liberation Army, the military branch of China's ruling Communist Party.His motorcade, flanked by a brigade of military police on motorcycles, proceeded into the city. Putin is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior officials.(With inputs from agencies)",Putin's decision to choose China for his first overseas visit after being inaugurated for a new six-year term underscores the significance he places on his bond with Xi and his global strategic priorities.

As the region begins the recovery process on Saturday, it will do so under a smog warning and rising temperatures across southern Texas. The national weather service in Houston has cautioned that with temperatures reaching around 90 degrees (32.2 C) this weekend, people should be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion and advised, ""Don't overdo yourself during the cleanup process.""The warm weather is a concern in a region where more than half a million homes and businesses remain without electricity as of Saturday morning, a significant decrease from the nearly 1 million initially affected, according to PowerOutage.us.The fierce storms on Thursday, with winds of up to 100 mph (161 kph), caused extensive damage, including blown-out windows in downtown Houston and a tornado touching down near the northwest suburb of Cypress.Harris County sheriff Ed Gonzalez reported three storm-related fatalities, including an 85-year-old woman whose home caught fire after being struck by lightning and a 60-year-old man who attempted to use his vehicle to power his oxygen tank.

At press conference in Harbin during his two-day trip to China Putin said that, Washington aims to prevent strong competitors from entering the American market, describing the US approach as “unfair competition.”“Unfortunately, the way the world works today, sometimes situations arise related to unfair competition .This is how the Americans recently imposed tariffs on Chinese electric transport, on electric cars,” he said.“Why? Because Chinese cars have gotten better.”Putin claimed that as soon as another country emerges as a manufacturing power and becomes more competitive, it is suppressed by the US and the EU alike.US officials have repeatedly described China as America’s top “competitor” while tightening economic restrictions against the country.Earlier this week, Washington increased tariffs on $18 billion worth of Chinese goods, including EVs, batteries, semiconductors, steel, aluminum, critical minerals, solar cells, ship-to-shore cranes, and medical products. This is in addition to the tariffs on over $300 billion worth of goods imposed by former President Donald Trump.Tariffs on Chinese goods were significantly hiked under Trump, who initiated a trade war in 2018. His successor, President Joe Biden, has continued this approach, adopting several policies aimed at the Chinese economy.Chinese officials have repeatedly denounced US trade and tech policies, describing them as “economic bullying.” In retaliation, the Chinese government has implemented countermeasures, including restrictions on exports of strategic raw materials used in defense technologies, electronics, and clean energy.The International Monetary Fund warned last week that the escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing poses a threat to global economic growth.","Russian President Vladimir Putin said that US authorities have imposed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) because they have become better.

US ambassador to Japan visits southern islands at the forefront of China tension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-ambassador-to-japan-visits-southern-islands-at-the-forefront-of-china-tension/articleshow/110223509.cms,"TOKYO: May 18 (AP) The US ambassador to Japan stressed Friday the importance of increased deterrence and his country's commitment to its key ally as he visited two southwestern Japanese islands at the forefront of Tokyo's tension with Beijing. Rahm Emanuel visited Yonaguni , Japan's westernmost island just east of Taiwan, a self-governed island also claimed by China.He later visited another Japanese island, Ishigaki , home to Japan Coast Guard patrol boats defending the disputed East China Sea islands and Japanese fishermen from armed Chinese coast guard ships that routinely enter Japanese waters.Japan has been making a southwest shift of its defense posture, and is further accelerating its military buildup under a 2022 security strategy that focuses on counter-strike capability with long-range cruise missiles.Emanuel was the first US ambassador to visit Yonaguni. Escorted by Mayor Kenichi Itokazu, he looked toward Taiwan, only 110 kilometres (68 miles) away. He met with Japanese Self Defense Force service members at a local base installed in 2016 and where a missile defense system is planned.The ambassador said the main purpose of his visit was to show US support for the local fishing community. He also met with a local fisherman who was among those affected by China's increasingly assertive actions in the regional seas.China fired five missiles into Japan's exclusive economic zone in 2022 after the visit to Taiwan of then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Emanuel said the fisherman told him he could not sell his fish for about a week after the Chinese action.""If they don't have deterrence, that's going to be worse,"" Emanuel told The Associated Press from Ishigaki, the second island he visited Friday. ""If you have a very robust deterrence, it ensures that there is peace, ensures that there is security, ensures economic prosperity. Without that, it's more likely to be a green light to those that want to use economic coercion and confrontation as their only means of expression.""Emanuel said Yonaguni fishers still catch fish for a living, supporting the local economy and helping reinforce Japanese territorial rights. ""That's what a real win looks like - economic security,"" he said on social platform X.In Ishigaki, Japan's coast guard protects fishing boats in the disputed waters around the Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea that Tokyo calls Senkaku. Beijing also claims the islands and calls them Diaoyu, and its coast guard ships often face off with their Japanese counterparts.Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi welcomed the ambassador's trip to the islands, saying it was ""meaningful"" for the ambassador to improve his understanding of Tokyo's efforts in reinforcing its security in the southwestern region, where additional military units and missile defense systems are being deployed.While local officials back the reinforcement of Japanese troops on the islands, local residents staged a small protest amid concerns they may be the first to be affected in a possible US-China conflict.Okinawa's Gov. Denny Tamaki supports the Japan-US security alliance but has called for a reduction in the number of American troops housed on the island. About half of the 50,000 American troops in Japan are based in Okinawa.Tamaki also criticized the use of Yonaguni's commercial airport by a US military aircraft used by the ambassador.","US ambassador to Japan stresses importance of increased deterrence and commitment to key ally.

Here's how Robert F Kennedy Jr could make the first debate stage under stringent Biden-Trump rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/heres-how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-could-make-the-first-debate-stage-under-stringent-biden-trump-rules/articleshow/110224101.cms,"PHOENIX: Robert F Kennedy Jr has long argued that the biggest hurdle of his presidential campaign is the perception that independent candidates can't win. He has looked to the debates as a singular opportunity to stand alongside Joe Biden and Donald Trump in front of a massive audience.But to make the first debate stage, he'll have to secure a place on the ballot in at least a dozen more states and improve his showing in national polls in one month.With a famous name and a loyal base, Kennedy has the potential to do better than any third-party presidential candidate since Ross Perot in the 1990s. Both the Biden and Trump campaigns, who fear he could play spoiler, bypassed the nonpartisan debate commission and agreed to a schedule that leaves Kennedy very little time to qualify for the first debate.Publicly, Kennedy is expressing confidence that he will make the stage.""I look forward to holding Presidents Biden and Trump accountable for their records in Atlanta on June 27 to give Americans the debate they deserve,"" he posted on the X platform.CNN has said candidates will be invited if they've secured a place on the ballot in states with at least 270 votes in the Electoral College , the minimum needed to win the presidency, and have to hit 15% in four reliable polls published since March 13. The criteria mirror those used by the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group that has organized debates since 1988, except the commission's first debate would have been in September, giving Kennedy more time.Kennedy doesn't appear to have met the polling criteria yet, although he has reached 15% or higher in at least two polls meeting CNN's standards.The ballot access hurdle is even tougher.State officials have confirmed Kennedy's place on the ballot in Delaware, Oklahoma, and Utah, which have just 16 electoral votes. In California, Hawaii, and Michigan, minor parties have selected Kennedy as their nominee, in effect offering up existing ballot lines, though the states have not formally affirmed Kennedy's position. Adding them would bring Kennedy's total to 89 electoral votes, though it's unclear that his position in those states would meet CNN's criteria.Kennedy's campaign says he has collected enough signatures in Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas, states with 112 electoral votes in total. However, he has either failed to submit the signatures or they are yet to be verified by state election officials.Those states still only add up to 201 electoral votes.Independent candidates like Kennedy face a labyrinth of laws that vary wildly from state to state but generally require hundreds or thousands of signatures and compliance with strict deadlines.The patchwork of laws is littered with pitfalls. The Democratic National Committee has pledged to scrutinize Kennedy's submissions for mistakes that could keep him off the ballot or at least tie up his campaign's time and money.Kennedy, in turn, has resorted to secrecy and creative tactics in a sort of cat-and-mouse game to get on the ballot before his critics can thwart him. In California, Delaware, and Michigan, Kennedy allied with less-known existing parties and received their nominations. He formed his political party in Hawaii to nominate himself and pursued a similar strategy in Mississippi and North Carolina.Elsewhere, he's waiting to turn in signatures until the deadline to limit the time for critics to pore over them in search of errors. Getting on the debate stage next month would almost certainly require him to change his strategy and submit the petitions he's sitting on as soon as possible.Signatures are due in New York by May 28, which would get Kennedy 28 votes closer if they're affirmed in time. He could then try to make an all-out push in a bunch of states with relatively easy requirements many require 5,000 or fewer signatures, but they generally don't bring many electoral votes - or focus on bigger states, such as Illinois with 19 electoral votes or Florida with 30.Further complicating matters, some states aren't yet accepting filings from potential independent candidates and won't before the first debate.Kennedy's vice presidential nominee, Nicole Shanahan, who is divorced from Google co-founder Sergei Brin, committed $8 million from her personal fortune for ballot access, the campaign announced Thursday, declaring their $15 million effort ""fully funded.""","Kennedy's campaign says he has collected enough signatures in Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.

Donald Trump: Trump falsely claims victory in Minnesota and predicts win in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-falsely-claims-victory-in-minnesota-and-predicts-win-in-2024/articleshow/110223860.cms,"MINNESOTA: Donald Trump falsely claimed on Friday that he won the 2020 presidential election in Minnesota and he said he would win this year in the state that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate in over 50 years.During an address to the Minnesota Republican Party's annual Lincoln-Reagan Dinner in St Paul, Trump repeated the unfounded claim that the last presidential election, which he lost to Joe Biden , a Democrat, was tainted by widespread fraud.""I know we won (Minnesota) in 2020,"" Trump said to applause. ""We've got to be careful. We've got to watch those votes.""Ahead of their November presidential rematch, Trump campaign officials have publicly and privately insisted that Trump can beat Biden in Minnesota. While an upset in the state appears possible, available polling and the state's political history indicate that the former president faces an uphill battle.Major independent polls show Biden with a slim but consistent lead in Minnesota - typically between 2 and 4 percentage points. A Trump campaign official would not say directly whether they planned to dedicate resources to the state.While Minnesota's rural areas have swung towards Republicans over the last decade, suburban areas around Minneapolis have moved toward Democrats, reflecting broader nationwide trends.During the speech, Trump repeated his calls for a ""massive deportation"" of immigrants in the country illegally, and he doubled down on promises to construct a new missile defense system, likening it to Israel's ""Iron Dome"" program.He also again hinted that North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, a former primary rival who introduced Trump on Friday evening, was a top contender to be his vice-presidential running mate.""A lot of people think it's that guy right there,"" Trump said of Burgum. ""He's very good.""As with other recent speeches, Trump took personal and even profane jabs at Biden throughout the evening, at one point saying the president was ""full of shit.""During presidential campaigns, it is common for major candidates to insist they can capture states that appear to be a reach. Biden officials say they have a shot at taking Florida, though he is trailing by around 10 points there in most polls.","Donald Trump falsely claimed on Friday that he won the 2020 presidential election in Minnesota.

Korean War veteran finally awarded Purple Heart after 73 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/korean-war-veteran-finally-awarded-purple-heart-after-73-years/articleshow/110223638.cms,"ST. PETER: After 73 years and a long fight with the US Army , a Korean War veteran from Minnesota who was wounded in combat finally got his Purple Heart medal on Friday.The Army notified Earl Meyer, 96, of St. Peter, last month that it had granted him a Purple Heart, which honors service members wounded or killed in combat. Meyer, who still has shrapnel in his thigh that continues to cause him occasional pain, had the medal pinned to his chest at a ceremony at Gustavus Adolphus College in St.Peter.Afterward, Meyer recalled being at an earlier ceremony for veterans when Purple Heart honorees were asked to rise so they could be honored. Now, said Meyer, ""I can stand up with them guys.""Understated and quick to deflect praise, he added: ""It is nice. No doubt about that.""An Army review board had rejected Meyer's application several times due to a lack of paperwork, but it reversed course after a campaign by his three daughters and their attorney. US Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also intervened on his behalf along with the service's top noncommissioned officer, the sergeant major of the Army. A federal judge ordered the review board to take another look.Meyer's case showcases the challenges for wounded veterans to get medals they've earned when the fog of war, the absence of records and the passage of time make it challenging to produce proof.Klobuchar presented Meyer a certificate after the medal was pinned, while one of her former aides who worked on the case sang the national anthem.""Our safety is what Earl fought for. Minnesota, our country and our world are better because of you, Earl,"" Klobuchar told the crowd. ""Thank you. And congratulations. Finally.""Meyer's daughter, Sandy Baker, of New Buffalo, Michigan, described combat veterans like her father, who is known to friends as ""Sonny,"" as ""a different breed"" and said he was reluctant to push for the recognition. She said he ultimately became convinced his effort would help other soldiers win overdue recognition.""He's excited and he's very honored. Incredibly honored. But he said at coffee this morning, 'I don't know why we're making such a big deal out of this,'"" she said.Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael Weimer wasn't able to attend, but he sent a latter of gratitude for Meyer's ""selfless service and dedication."" And in a handwritten addition at the bottom of the letter Weimer said: ""Thank you for not giving up on us! Long overdue!""Weimer sent Command Sgt. Major Jason Ross, from the Army National Guard, in his place. He described the grueling fighting that Meyer endured.""He saw his close friends wounded, killed in action, and he engaged in continuous, sustained combat with the enemy and in wartime conditions for several days,"" Ross said. ""He believed and understood he could actually die in combat.""Few men in Meyer's unit who witnessed the mortar attack in 1951 survived. Only a few members of his platoon made it out unharmed. He didn't even realize at first that he had been wounded. He said he thinks the medic who treated him on the battlefield was killed before he could file the paperwork. And he wasn't thinking then about a medal anyway - he just wanted to survive.When the Army denied Meyer's first applications for the medal, it said his documentation was insufficient. It had been burned in a fire, said Baker, who is Meyer's daughter.Klobuchar's office helped the family obtain additional documents and an Army review board finally concluded last month that the new evidence ""establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was wounded in action in early June 1951.""The board cited records from the Department of Veterans Affairs, where doctors concluded the shrapnel in his thigh had to be from a combat injury. The board also cited a recent memo from Weimer, who said he believed Meyer's account was accurate, and that his medal request deserved another review.Meyer's American Legion coffee buddy, Dave Johnson, who delivered the prayer, described Meyer as ""more than humble."" He said Meyer's tends to downplay it and say, ""Oh, this happened. I was part of this, and I guess I still have shrapnel in me.""But Johnson said it is important for the rest of the community to remember.""People have to recognize what it takes to have a country like this, and it takes people like Sonny and his efforts, what he's accomplished and what he did on those particular days. Very few people have that opportunity to say, 'I did this for our country.'""","Earl Meyer, 96, of St. Peter, Minnesota, was wounded in combat in 1951.

The development comes after Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa on Tuesday while hearing an appeal by the government against annulment of certain changes in the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) laws by the previous government had ordered the authorities to present Khan virtually for his statement.Khan, 71, had challenged the tweaks in the NAB laws and the top court in September last year had accepted his plea which reopened dozens of cases of alleged corruption against some leading politicians, including Nawaz Sharif.A five-member Supreme Court larger bench, headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi heard the case.Khan appeared as a petitioner through video link in the case, but the hearing was not live streamed unlike the current practice, which had been in vogue since the top judge started it last year after becoming the chief justice.Consequently, Khan's followers could not see him live for the first time since he was arrested in August last year.However, his party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) shared a picture of the purported video call, with a laptop screen showing Khan seated in a room wearing a light-blue shirt, and seemingly uninterested as he rested his face on his hand.The party in a statement said that there was no live stream from the apex court as the registrar maintained that it was the prerogative of the bench to decide if or not the hearing is to be broadcasted live.""Judicial process demands fairness and openness, (and) transparency can only be ensured through public view of proceedings.

"Pakistanis own 23,000 properties worth $11 billion in Dubai, reveal property leaks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistanis-own-23000-properties-worth-11-billion-in-dubai-reveal-property-leaks/articleshow/110156743.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Prominent Pakistani politicians, retired generals, bureaucrats, bankers and money launderers have been named in the latest property leaks containing details of individuals who own residential properties in upscale areas of Dubai. The combined value of these properties is around $11 billion.“Dubai Unlocked”, an investigative project by over 70 media outlets around the globe, has revealed ownership of hundreds of properties of prominent global figures, including corrupt politicians,money launderers and drug lords, in Dubai.The data covers records of residential properties from 2020 till 2022.Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaksowning 23,000 properties in Dubaiare President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly, former PM Nawaz Sharif’s son Hussain Nawaz, home (interior) minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife, and several national and provincial lawmakers.While Zardari’s elder daughter, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, is a Dubai resident, his son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and daughter, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, were listed as owners of four properties. Through her lawyers, Aseefa said that all assets owned by her in Dubai have been duly declared to the relevant authorities in Pakistan, including the electoral watchdog.The Pakistani list also features the late former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, former PM Shaukat Aziz, ex-army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa’s son, and more than a dozen retired army generals as well as a police chief, an ambassador and a scientist, all of whom owned properties either directly or through their spouses and children.The Altaf Khanani network, which was sanctioned by the US for involvement in money laundering, has also surfaced in the leaks. Moving illicit funds for organised crime groups, including drug cartels and violent terrorist organisations, the network raked in an estimated turnover of between $14 billion and $16 billion annually. Altaf Khanani, the international face of the organisation, was ultimately convicted and spent nearly six years in a US prison; he was blacklisted by the US on money-laundering charges along with his son, Obaid Khanani, and nephew, Hozaifa Khanani. In Dubai, a country where, reportedly, investing in real estate with bags of cash raises few questions, the Khananis are listed owners of a massive real estate portfolio. Obaid himself is linked to around 30 properties, while the family as a whole were listed owners of 85 properties in early 2020, including around a dozen villas.Notably, several Pakistani families involved in politics and business were absent from the data, despite it being well known that they have bases and family residences in Dubai. This underscores that although the data is solid, it is neither a historical record of property ownership nor a comprehensive representation of all properties purchased by Pakistanis in Dubai . Many owners, according to data, still remain undetected, especially those who purchased property via a third party, or lesser-known company.","Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaks are President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly.
