UK PM Sunak promises to work 'as hard as ever' after disastrous local elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-sunak-promises-to-work-as-hard-as-ever-after-disastrous-local-elections/articleshow/109857373.cms,"NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Sunday vowed to persevere ""as diligently as ever"" following a dismal election outcome that witnessed his Conservative party losing ground across various local authorities and even relinquishing a mayoral stronghold in England's West Midlands region.The British Indian leader expressed his disappointment as Andy Street, the Conservative Party's well-liked mayor of West Midlands, narrowly succumbed to Labour opponent Richard Parker by a mere 1,508 votes, prompting a recount for the closely contested outcome.This outcome leaves Sunak with a solitary glimmer of optimism in Ben Houchen, who managed to retain the party's mayoralty in Tees Valley on Friday amidst a near-complete dominance by Opposition parties, spearheaded by Labour.""It's been disappointing of course to lose dedicated Conservative councillors and Andy Street in the West Midlands, with his track record of providing great public services and attracting significant investment to the area, but that has redoubled my resolve to continue to make progress on our plan,"" British PM said in a statement.""So we will continue working as hard as ever to take the fight to Labour and deliver a brighter future for our country,"" he said.As Tory rebels gather momentum, their focus appears to be shifting from replacing Sunak as party leader to pressuring him to take a tougher stance on core party issues, such as implementing a cap on legal migration and significantly reducing taxes. Leading this push is former home secretary Suella Braverman, who delivered a scathing critique in 'The Daily Telegraph,' urging Sunak to transition away from ""managerialism"" and demonstrate resolute leadership.""Let me cut to the chase so no one wastes time over-analysing this: we must not change our leader. Changing leader now won't work: the time to do so came and went. The hole to dig us out is the PM's, and it's time for him to start shovelling,"" expressed the sacked Indian-origin ex-minister, who is at the forefront of the backbench rebellion.""Either we start fighting to win now, or we'll have no one else to blame when this week's political earthquake is made to look like a mere tremor come the general election night,"" she said.Others have joined in to urge Sunak to ""wake up and smell the coffee,"" pointing to the local election results indicating that the Labour Party is poised for success in an upcoming general election, anticipated later this year.Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer has celebrated his party's ""phenomenal result,"" highlighted by Labour's Sadiq Khan securing a historic third term as London Mayor on Friday.However, Starmer also reached out to voters who expressed discontent over the party's perceived inadequacy in addressing the Israel-Gaza conflict. Analysis revealed that Labour faced setbacks in areas with significant Islamic populations, where voters opted for independents and the anti-war Worker's Party of Britain.""I have heard you. I have listened. And I am determined to meet your concerns and to gain your respect and trust again in the future,"" said Starmer.Overall, the Labour camp will be rejoicing this weekend as it virtually dominated the mayoral elections across England, securing victories in Liverpool, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and Greater Manchester.With the majority of results now tallied from Thursday's local council elections, Labour appears poised to claim over 1,100 seats. The Liberal Democrats surpassed the Tories, securing over 500 seats, while the Conservatives suffered losses of around 400 previously held seats of local councillors. These councillors oversee day-to-day matters such as waste collection, roads, local infrastructure, and crime prevention.(With inputs from agencies)","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak vows to persevere ""as diligently as ever"" British Indian leader expressed his disappointment as Andy Street, the Conservative Party's well-liked mayor of West Midlands, narrowly succumbed to Labour opponent Richard Parker.

"China is buying gold like there's no tomorrow, jacking up prices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-is-buying-gold-like-theres-no-tomorrow-jacking-up-prices/articleshow/109866107.cms,"Often considered a safe investment during times of geopolitical and economic turmoil, gold has soared in price in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the war in Gaza But gold's climb to record highs above $2,400 per ounce has proved more resilient, and lasted longer, because of China. Chinese consumers have flocked to gold as their confidence in investments like real estate or stocks has faltered.At the same time, the country's central bank has steadily added to its gold reserves, while whittling away at its holdings of US debt. And throwing fuel on the fire are Chinese speculators betting there is still room for appreciation.China already held considerable sway in gold markets. But the country's influence has become more pronounced during this latest bull run - a nearly 50% increase in the global price since late 2022. It continued to scale new heights despite factors that traditionally make gold a comparatively less appealing investment: higher interest rates and a strong US dollar. Last month, gold prices vaulted higher even after the US Federal Reserve signalled that it would keep higher interest rates for longer. And it has continued to appreciate even as the dollar has risen against almost every major currency in the world this year.Prices have pulled back to around $2,300 per ounce, but there is a growing sentiment that the gold market is governed no longer by economic factors but by the whims of Chinese buyers and investors. ""China is unquestionably driving the price of gold,"" said Ross Norman, CEO of MetalsDaily, a precious-metals information platform based in London. Gold consumption in the country rose 6% in the first quarter from a year earlier, as per China Gold Association. It came on the heels of a 9% rise last year.Gold investing became more alluring as traditional investments turned lackluster. China's real estate sector remains in crisis. With few better alternatives, money flowed into Chinese funds that traded in gold, and many young people took to collecting beans in tiny quantities as an affordable investment. Another major buyer of gold in China is the country's central bank. In March, the People's Bank of China added to its gold reserves for a 17th straight month. Last year, the bank bought more gold than any other central bank in the world, adding more to its reserves than it had in nearly 50 years. Beijing is buying up gold to diversify its reserve funds and reduce its dependence on USD. China has been reducing its US treasury holdings for more than a decade. As of March, China had about $775 billion worth of US debt, down from about $1.1 trillion in 2021.When China increased its gold holdings in the past, it bought domestically using yuan, said Guan Tao, global chief economist at BOC International in Beijing. But this time, he said, the bank is using foreign currencies to buy gold - effectively reducing its exposure to the USD and other currencies. Many central banks, including China, started acquiring gold after the US took the rare step of freezing Russia's dollar holdings under sanctions imposed on Moscow. Other US allies have imposed similar curbs.Although Beijing has been buying up gold, the metal accounts for only 4.6% of China's foreign exchange reserves. In percentage terms, India holds nearly twice as much of its reserves in gold.","Gold has soared in price in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the war in Gaza.

However, the Hamas officials planned to return to the Egyptian capital on Tuesday, two Egyptian security sources said.Israeli officials have not travelled to Cairo to take part in indirect diplomacy, but on Sunday Netanyahu reiterated Israel's aim since the start of the war nearly seven months ago: to disarm and dismantle Hamas for good or else endanger Israel's future security. The PM said Israel was willing to pause fighting in Gaza in order to secure the release of hostages still being held by Hamas, believed to number more than 130. ""But while Israel has shown willingness, Hamas remains entrenched in its extreme positions, first among them the demand to remove all our forces from the Gaza Strip, end the war, and leave Hamas in power,"" he said.""Israel cannot accept that.""

""We are observing worrying signs that Hamas does not intend to reach an agreement with us.""Israel has been warning for months it plans to send troops into Rafah, the southern city bordering Egypt where more than half of Gaza's 2.3 million residents now have taken refuge. Israel believes thousands of Hamas fighters are holed up in the city, along with potentially dozens of hostages.

NEW DELHI: The trial of Kazakhstan’s former economy minister Kuandyk Bishimbayev for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova, has shocked the nation, with thousands calling for harsher penalties for domestic violence .CCTV footage depicted the minister dragging his wife by her hair, and subsequently punching and kicking her. Following the recorded incident, Nukenova succumbed to brain trauma.The footage, spanning eight hours, also captured Bishimbayev breaking down a door as Nukenova attempted to seek refuge in a bathroom.Nukenova, aged 31, was discovered dead in November within a restaurant owned by one of Bishimbayev’s relatives. Initially denying involvement, Bishimbayev confessed in court on Wednesday to assaulting her and inadvertently causing her demise.Bishimbayev's legal team contested medical evidence suggesting Nukenova died from repeated head trauma . They attempted to portray her as prone to jealousy and violence, despite no evidence from the restaurant's security cameras showing her attacking Bishimbayev.Bishimbayev, 44 years old, once celebrated as a modern, Western-educated figure within the Kazakhstani government under former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, was incarcerated for bribery in 2018. He was later granted a pardon, less than two years into his sentence.A 2018 study supported by UN Women revealed approximately 400 women in Kazakhstan die annually due to domestic violence, with many cases going unreported.In 2017, Kazakhstan decriminalized certain forms of domestic violence, categorizing them as causing ""minor"" physical damage, punishable by fines or brief imprisonment. This move mirrored Russia's actions that year, provoking outrage among advocates for women’s rights. Kazakhstan has since reversed this legislation, intensifying penalties for offenders and introducing new criminal charges, including harassment of minors.","Kuandyk Bishimbayev is on trial for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova.

London mayor Khan wins historic third term as Tories routed in local polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/london-mayor-khan-wins-historic-third-term-as-tories-routed-in-local-polls/articleshow/109848853.cms,"'Spirit and values'

'Change course'

LONDON: London's Labour mayor Sadiq Khan on Saturday secured a record third term, as the party swept a host of mayoral races and local elections to trounce the ruling Conservatives just months before an expected general election.Khan, 53, beat Tory challenger Susan Hall by 11 points to scupper largely forlorn Tory hopes that they could prise the UK capital away from Labour for the first time since 2016.The first Muslim mayor of a Western capital when initially elected then, he had been widely expected to win as the opposition party surges nationally and the Tories struggle to revive their fortunes.Hours later in the West Midlands, Conservative mayor Andy Street -- bidding for his own third term -- unexpectedly lost to Labour's Richard Parker, dealing a hammer blow to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.That narrow loss left the beleaguered leader with only one notable success in Thursday's votes across England, after Tory mayor Ben Houchen won in Tees Valley, northeast England -- albeit with a vastly reduced majority.In a dismal set of results, Sunak's party finished a humiliating third in local council tallies after losing nearly 500 seats.""People across the country have had enough of Conservative chaos and decline and voted for change with Labour,"" its leader Keir Starmer said shortly after confirmation of Parker's victory.He called the result ""phenomenal"" and ""beyond our expectations"".Writing earlier in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, Sunak had conceded ""voters are frustrated"" but tried to argue Labour was ""not winning in places they admit they need for a majority"".""We Conservatives have everything to fight for,"" Sunak insisted.Labour, out of power since 2010 and trounced by Boris Johnson's Conservatives at the last general election in 2019, also emphatically snatched a parliamentary seat from the Tories.Starmer has seized on winning the Blackpool South constituency and other successes to demand a general election.Sunak must order a national vote be held by January 28 next year at the latest, and has said he is planning on a poll in the second half of 2024.Labour has enjoyed double-digit poll leads for all of his 18 months in charge, as previous Tory scandals, a cost-of-living crisis and various other issues dent his party's standing.On Thursday, it was defending nearly 1,000 council seats, many secured in 2021 when it led nationwide polls before the implosion of Johnson's premiership and his successor Liz Truss's disastrous 49-day tenure.In the end, they lost close to half and finished third behind the smaller centrist opposition Liberal Democrats.Meanwhile Labour swept crunch mayoral races across England, from Yorkshire, Manchester and Liverpool in the north to contests across the Midlands.In London, Khan netted 44 percent of the vote and saw his margin of victory increase compared to the last contest in 2021.""It's truly an honour to be re-elected for a third term,"" he told supporters, accusing his Tory opponent of ""fearmongering"".""We ran a campaign that was in keeping with the spirit and values of this great city, a city that regards our diversity not as a weakness, but as an almighty strength -- and one that rejects right hard-wing populism,"" he added.If replicated in a nationwide contest, the council tallies suggested Labour would win 34 percent of the vote, with the Tories trailing by nine points, according to the BBC.Sky News' projection for a general election using the results predicted Labour will be the largest party but short of an overall majority.Speculation has been rife in Westminster that restive Tory lawmakers could use dire local election results to try to replace Sunak.Despite the returns being at the worst end of estimates, that prospect has not so far materialised.Ex-interior minister and Sunak critic Suella Braverman warned in the Sunday Telegraph that Sunak's plan ""is not working and he needs to change course"", urging a more muscular conservatism.But she cautioned against trying to replace him, warning ""changing leader now won't work: the time to do so came and went"".Meanwhile, polling expert John Curtice assessed there were some concerning signs for Labour, which lost control of one local authority and some councillors elsewhere reportedly over its stance on the Israel-Hamas war.""These were more elections in which the impetus to defeat the Conservatives was greater than the level of enthusiasm for Labour,"" Curtice noted in the i newspaper.""Electorally, it is still far from clear that Sir Keir Starmer is the heir to (Tony) Blair.""","London's Labour mayor Sadiq Khan secures a record third term.

Russian women prisoners get $2k/mth offer to fight Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russian-women-prisoners-get-2k/mth-offer-to-fight-ukraine/articleshow/109849745.cms,"Berlin: The Russian army is expanding the role of women as it seeks to balance President Vladimir Putin 's promotion of traditional family roles with the need for new recruits for the war in Ukraine .The military's stepped-up appeal to women includes efforts to recruit female inmates in prisons, replicating on a much smaller scale a strategy that has swelled its ranks with male convicts.Recruiters in military uniforms toured Russian jails for women in the fall of 2023, offering inmates a pardon and $2,000 a month - 10 times the national minimum wage - in return for serving in front-line roles for a year, according to six current and former inmates of three prisons in different regions of Russia.Dozens of inmates just from those prisons have signed military contracts or applied to enlist, the women said, a sampling that - along with local media reports about recruitment in other regions - suggests a broader effort to enlist female convicts.It's not just convicts. Women now feature in Russian military recruitment advertisements across the country.A pro-Kremlin paramilitary unit fighting in Ukraine also recruits women. ""Combat experience and military specialties are not required,"" read an advertisement aimed at women that was posted in March in Russia's Tatarstan region. It offered training and a sign-up bonus equivalent to $4,000. ""We have one goal - victory!""Putin has placed women at the core of this vision, portraying them as child-bearers, mothers and wives guarding the nation's social harmony. ""The most important thing for every women, no matter what profession she has chosen and what heights she has reached, is the family,"" Putin said in a speech March 8. These clashing military and social priorities have resulted in contradictory policies that seek to recruit women to the military to fill a need but send conflicting signals about the roles women can assume there.""I have gotten used to the fact that I am often looked at like a monkey - like, 'Wow, she's in fatigues!'"" said Ksenia Shkoda, a native of central Ukraine who has fought for pro-Russian forces since 2014.Some female volunteers do not make it to Ukraine. The convicts who enlisted in late 2023 have yet to be sent to fight, the six former and current inmates said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of possible retribution.","Recruiters in military uniforms toured Russian jails for women in the fall of 2023. They offered inmates a pardon and $2,000 a month in return for serving in front-line roles. Dozens of inmates just from those prisons have signed military contracts or applied to enlist.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109849762,imgsize-98086,width-400,resizemode-4/109849762.jpg"
Amazon and Google suspend US green card applications for immigrants amid tech layoffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/amazon-and-google-suspend-us-green-card-applications-for-immigrants-amid-tech-layoffs/articleshow/109815272.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amazon and Google have halted US green card applications for immigrants for the year 2024, a decision made against the backdrop of recent tech industry layoffs , including those at Microsoft. The intensifying competition is making conditions increasingly challenging for foreign workers, the Daily Guardian reported.The suspension of the green card application process may exacerbate the difficulties faced by overseas candidates seeking employment in the US, particularly within the tech sector.Both Amazon and Google have paused PERM applications until the following year.PERM, administered by the US Department of Labor, is a procedure aimed at securing permanent labor certification. Its primary objective is to safeguard job opportunities, wages, and working conditions for American workers while admitting foreign workers. Often, PERM serves as the initial stage in the green card acquisition process.Amazon made an internal announcement earlier this year stating its decision to halt all PERM filings through 2024 due to operational constraints. Google similarly suspended its PERM applications in January 2023, coinciding with the layoff of 12,000 employees. Employees were informed that the PERM process would not resume until the first quarter of 2025.Ava Benach, founding partner of Benach Collopy, a distinguished immigration law firm in Washington DC, commented that tech companies are following Google's strategy due to its significant influence in the industry.Collopy said that, “With more US workers available for open positions, the labor market test fails and so the process becomes a waste of time and money for these tech companies.” Collopy explained.“If tech companies have done layoffs relatively recently, they also have to notify laid off workers of new positions that may be going to foreign workers. If some of these people say ‘yes, I’m interested,’ then you’re out of luck with the green card application,” she added, according to the Daily Guardian.","Both Amazon and Google have paused PERM applications until the following year.

George Lucas revised 'Star Wars' with tech. Rebel fans 'rescue' the original films,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/george-lucas-revised-star-wars-with-tech-rebel-fans-rescue-the-original-films/articleshow/109866725.cms,"Han shot first at Greedo. No amount of special editions or George Lucas declarations will change that, even if, uh, Lucas actually did change that scene. A rebellion began in 1997, when Lucasfilm first released altered ""special editions"" of the first trilogy, adding new or revised scenes, computer-generated effects and expanded worlds. Ever since, fans have clamoured for high-definition releases of the unaltered movies.Lucas has resisted and has continued altering them, insisting he is fulfilling his vision, which was technologically and financially impossible when they were first madeSo if you want to see the original "" Star Wars "" trilogy - as they were shown in theatres, a bit softer and grainier (and with Han Solo definitely shooting the bounty hunter Greedo first, not in self-defence, as he now does) - you'll have to rely on some rebel fans like Robert Williams. Williams, a Philadelphia-based computer programmer, is part of a group of five people called Team Negative One, one of a few ""Star Wars"" fan groups that, for more than a decade, have collected 35 mm prints of the first ""Star Wars"" movies and laboriously restored them in 4K. Known as Project 4K, the movies are titled by the years they were released: 4K77, 4K80 and 4K83. The restorations are not authorised and come from film reels that were meant to be returned or destroyed after cinemas were done with them. While their legality is in question, fans and preservationists argue public has a right to view art in its original form.In Feb, Team Negative One announced the completion of the trilogy project, with a 4K version of ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Williams said his group's sources for the reels had included eBay and collectors who had them in storage. Once the film is scanned, the team goes through it frame by frame, cleaning, and upgrading it, and finally digitising it.The first restoration was done in 2016 with ""A New Hope"". ""The Empire Strikes Back"" took 7 years because the print was a damaged one.Many of Lucas' edits were cosmetic changes. But some changes shifted character arcs, such as the scene with Greedo and Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford. In the 1977 release - later re-titled ""A New Hope"" - Han shoots and kills the bounty hunter, without provocation, setting up a redemptive arc. Since the 1997 edition, Han fires in self-defence, an edit that drew scorn from some fans, who took up ""Han shot first"" as a battle cry.

His performance added depth to the historical figure, capturing both the nobility and the tragic oversight of the captain.Similarly, in Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, Hill portrayed King Theoden of Rohan. His portrayal of the manipulated monarch's transformation into a courageous leader resonated with audiences, particularly in memorable battle scenes like the Battle of Helm's Deep.Throughout his career, Hill displayed versatility across various genres and platforms, showcasing his dedication to the craft of acting.","British actor Bernard Hill has died at the age of 79.

Pro-Palestinian protesters at USC comply with school order to leave their encampment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-at-usc-comply-with-school-order-to-leave-their-encampment/articleshow/109864138.cms,"Arrests at the University of Virginia

A week of protests

Demonstrations and commencement

Protests at Indiana and Princeton

WASHINGTON: Students protesting the ongoing war in Gaza left a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of Southern California early Sunday after they were surrounded by police and told they could face arrest if they didn't go. The move, days before commencement was set to begin, came after the university said campus safety officers, assisted by the Los Angeles Police Department, were clearing the area.""If you are in the centre of campus, please leave. People who don't leave could be arrested,"" USC said on the social media platform X at about 4:15 am.Livestream video from student journalists showed the encampment had emptied out as police formed a line to move remaining protesters away and stop people from re-entering.The encampment had restarted after the LAPD first arrested 93 people on April 24. The atmosphere on the private university campus had largely remained calm since then, while attention turned to arrests at the University of California, Los Angeles.In Boston, commencement for Northeastern University began peacefully Sunday at Fenway Park. Some students waved Palestinian flags, but those were dotted among flags from India, the US and other nations. Graduate students went first, with undergraduate commencement in the afternoon.Last month, police arrested about 100 protesters at Northeastern when they broke up an encampment on the Boston campus.At the University of Virginia, 25 people were arrested Saturday for trespassing after police clashed with pro-Palestinian protesters who refused to remove tents from campus, and demonstrators at the University of Michigan chanted anti-war messages and waved flags during commencement ceremonies.At the Art Institute of Chicago campus, police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment hours after it was set up Saturday and arrested 68 people. Students, who attend classes in downtown buildings surrounding the museum, want the school to divest from companies profiting from the Israel-Hamas war , among other demands.The institute said the protest grew disruptive and Chicago police were called. Those arrested will be charged with criminal trespass to property, police said.USC, a private university, has been the subject of student protests over the war as well as the administration's decision to cancel a commencement speech by the valedictorian, a Muslim student who had expressed support for Palestinians. The university made that decision last month, citing safety concerns after receiving threats. Some Jewish groups had criticised the student's selection as speaker.Administrators later cancelled the entire main-stage commencement planned for May 10, when 65,000 people were expected to gather. Other commencement activities, including graduation ceremonies for individual schools and colleges, are still scheduled from Thursday through Sunday. Access to the private campus has largely been restricted for people not affiliated with the university since late April.In Charlottesville, Virginia, student demonstrators began their protest on a lawn outside the school chapel Tuesday. On Saturday, video from WVAW-TV showed police in heavy gear and holding shields lined up on campus. Protesters chanted ""Free Palestine,"" and university police said on X that an ""unlawful assembly"" had been declared.As police moved in, students were pushed to the ground, pulled by their arms and sprayed with a chemical irritant, Laura Goldblatt, an assistant professor of English and global studies who has been helping student demonstrators, told The Washington Post.The university administration said in a statement the demonstrators were told the tents and canopies they erected were prohibited under school policy and were asked to remove them. Virginia State Police were asked to help with enforcement, the university said.Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares told Fox News on Sunday the police response was justified because students had been warned repeatedly to leave, were violating the school's conduct code, and that ""outsiders"" who were not students provided protesters with supplies like wooden barriers.""We've seen folks that are not students show up in riot gear with bull horns to direct the protesters on how to flank our officers,"" Miyares said.""We even see them taking water bottles, pouring half of it out, putting bear spray in the water bottles, and throwing them at these officers - basically using them as chemical agents to try to assault our officers,"" he said.It was the latest clash in several tense and sometimes violent weeks at US colleges and universities that have seen dozens of protests and hundreds of arrests at demonstrations over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war; many of the encampments have been dismantled by police.Tent encampments of protesters urging universities to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say support the war in Gaza have spread in a student movement unlike any other this century. Some schools reached agreements with protesters to end the demonstrations and reduce the possibility of disrupting final exams and commencements.The Associated Press has recorded at least 63 incidents since April 18 in which arrests were made at protests across the US Nearly 2,500 people have been arrested on the campuses of 49 colleges and universities. The figures are based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.The University of Michigan was among the schools bracing for protests during commencement this weekend, including Indiana University, Ohio State University and Northeastern. More are slated in the coming weeks.In Ann Arbor, there was a protest at the beginning of the event at Michigan Stadium. About 75 people, many wearing traditional Arabic kaffiyehs along with their graduation caps, marched up the main aisle toward the stage.They chanted ""Regents, regents, you can't hide! You are funding genocide!"" while holding signs, including one that read: ""No universities left in Gaza.""Overhead, planes pulled banners with competing messages. ""Divest from Israel now! Free Palestine!"" and ""We stand with Israel. Jewish lives matter.""Officials said no one was arrested, and the protest didn't seriously interrupt the nearly two-hour event, attended by tens of thousands of people, some of them waving Israeli flags.At Indiana University, protesters urged supporters to wear their kaffiyehs and walk out during remarks by school President Pamela Whitten on Saturday evening. The Bloomington campus designated a protest zone outside Memorial Stadium, where the ceremony was held.At Princeton, in New Jersey, 18 students launched a hunger strike to try to push the university to divest from companies tied to Israel.One of them, senior David Chmielewski said in an email the strike started Friday with participants consuming water only, and it will continue until administrators meet with students about demands including amnesty from criminal and disciplinary charges for protesters. Other demonstrators are participating in ""solidarity fasts"" lasting 24 hours, Chmielewski said.Students at other colleges, including Brown and Yale, launched similar hunger strikes this year before the more recent wave of demonstrations.The protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.","Protesters leave pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of Southern California.

California is so competent” he said.Musk, on the other hand, simply posted a sad, crying emoji to convey his sentiments about the boondoggle, which is reportedly at risk of being scrapped.This is happening even though $11 billion of taxpayers' money have already been invested in the high-speed rail project connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco.This sum includes expenses for the bridge and other developments invested in the first phase of the high-speed route, which spans from Bakersfield, north of Los Angeles, to Merced, approximately 80 miles from the Bay Area.The critics were responding to an earlier post by the rail authority, in which they proudly announced that the Fresno River Viaduct in Madera County is one of the “first completed high-speed rail structures.”The authority in a post on X said, “At nearly 1,600 feet long, high-speed trains will travel over the riverbed and will run parallel with the BNSF Railroad.”In response to reports estimating the total cost of completing the rail line at around $100 billion, Markus fired back, saying, “wow so impressive, can’t wait until year 2400 for this to finish for 700 quadrillion dollars.”According to New York Post, Venture Capitalist Patrick Blumenthal suggested that the authority should refrain from self-praise, sharing a detailed breakdown highlighting the lack of progress made by the rail-line project.“0.3 miles completed. After 15 years. After $11.2 BILLION. $36.96 billion per mile,” Patrick wrote on X.","The California High Speed Rail Authority is facing criticism for celebrating the completion of a high-speed rail bridge that has cost taxpayers $11 billion.

NEW DELHI: An American surfer and Australian brothers duo who were found dead on a surfing vacation in Mexico were likely killed after refusing to surrender their vehicle to a group of carjackers, according to a NY Post report.The bodies of Jack Carter Rhoad, 30, and brothers Callum, 33, and Jake Robinson, 30, were found alongside their charred white pick-up truck nearly a week after they disappeared from Baja California .Authorities have theorized that the once idyllic trip took a tragic turn when local bandits approached the men at their beach camp in the popular surf spot known as La Bocana.“When they tried to get the vehicle, the victims opposed the robbery, the robbers were armed with a firearm and apparently shot the victims,” Baja California’s chief prosecutor María Elena Andrade Ramírez told Australia’s 7News.The perpetrators didn't even take the car they likely targeted the trio for; instead, they chose to set it ablaze at the campsite. While police haven't confirmed the cause of death, they discovered shell casings at the campsite.Firefighters spent several hours recovering three male bodies from the bottom of a well at a nearby ranch. Although Mexican officials haven't officially confirmed the identities of the victims as Georgia resident Rhoad and the Robinson brothers, they stated there was a ""high degree of probability"" they were executed.The fourth body was identified as the property owner who had been reported missing two weeks prior, according to officials.Jesús Gerardo Garcia Cota, also known as El Kekas, along with his partner Ari Gisel García Cota, and Jesus’ brother Cristian Alejandro Garcia, were later apprehended by police in connection with the disappearance of the men. However, they have not yet been charged with murder .Upon their arrest, all three were found in possession of methamphetamine and other illegal narcotics. Local reports indicate that Ari Gisel Garcia Cota, 23, was carrying one of the surfer’s phones at the time of her arrest.The Robinsons and Rhoad were last seen on April 27, enjoying the tropical climate of the coast. However, they were not formally reported missing until several days later when they failed to arrive at an Airbnb they had rented further south.In the hours preceding their disappearance, Callum shared a series of social media posts depicting what seemed to be an exhilarating vacation along the Pacific Coast.The men were spotted wearing wetsuits, savoring local cuisine, and enjoying beers at Rosarito Beach, where they surfed and camped before journeying another 50 miles south to the port city of Ensenada.A snapshot captured the white pick-up truck, believed to be the same one found burned at the abandoned camp.Stevenson University in Baltimore released a statement mourning the loss of Callum Robinson, a 2015 graduate and standout lacrosse player at the school who later played for the Premier Lacrosse League.Despite Baja California being one of Mexico’s most violent states, tourist areas like Ensenada are generally considered safer.","The bodies of Jack Carter Rhoad, 30, and brothers Callum, 33, and Jake Robinson,. 30, were found alongside their charred white pick-up truck nearly a week after they disappeared from Baja California.

This marks the inaugural crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule, with two Nasa pilots on board to evaluate the spacecraft during the test mission and a week-long stay at the space station.Following the retirement of the space shuttles, Nasa turned to American companies to provide transportation for astronauts.While SpaceX , founded by Elon Musk, has completed nine successful crew missions for Nasa since 2020, Boeing has only managed two uncrewed test flights.""There's no doubt about that, but we're here now,"" acknowledged Mark Nappi, Boeing's program manager, expressing his wish that Starliner was further along in its development.The long-awaited crewed demonstration mission is scheduled for launch on Monday night. If the test flight goes smoothly, Nasa plans to alternate between Boeing and SpaceX for future astronaut transportation to and from the space station.The Starliner capsule, adorned in white with black and blue accents, stands approximately 10 feet (3 metres) tall and 15 feet (4.5 metres) in diameter. It has the capacity to accommodate up to seven individuals, although Nasa crews typically consist of four members. The capsule's name, chosen nearly a decade ago, is a nod to Boeing's earlier Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner aircraft.Retired Navy captains and veteran Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have spent months aboard the space station in the past, will be at the helm of this test flight. They stepped in after the original crew had to withdraw due to the mounting delays.Wilmore, 61, hails from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and is a former combat pilot, while Williams, 58, from Needham, Massachusetts, is a helicopter pilot. Both have been closely involved in the development of the Starliner capsule and are confident in its readiness for this mission.","The long-awaited crewed demonstration mission is scheduled for launch on Monday night.

NEW DELHI: Student protests against the Israeli military assault on Gaza have spread to several countries following the unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel , according to an AFP report.Student activists have organized protests at various universities, setting up temporary encampments on campus grounds. The protesters are calling for their schools to sever connections with universities in Israel and businesses that financially benefit from the ongoing conflict.The students have expressed their views through these demonstrations, insisting that their educational institutions should not maintain relationships with entities linked to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.They argue that such ties are inappropriate and that universities should take a stand against the conflict by disassociating themselves from organizations that profit from it.Here's a overview of the countries where pro-Palestine protests are taking place:Across the nation, approximately 2,000 individuals have been arrested during demonstrations that evoke memories of the Vietnam War era, according to US media reports. Law enforcement has aggressively disbanded numerous student sit-ins at various institutions, such as New York University and the University of California, Los Angeles. President Joe Biden finally addressed the demonstrations breaking the period of silence amid election season, asserting that ""order must prevail"".At the University of Virginia, police utilized chemical agents to disperse a pro-Palestinian protest camp.In the past few days, law enforcement has taken action to break up numerous student sit-ins by force, such as the one at New York University, which was done at the behest of the university's administration.Students who had barricaded themselves inside Columbia University, the focal point of the student protests in New York, alleged that police used excessive force when clearing out the faculty. ""Demonstrators barricaded inside Columbia University, the epicentre in New York of the student protests, complained of police brutality when officers cleared the faculty.""At UCLA, law enforcement personnel cleared out an encampment taking over 200 demonstrators into custody.Law enforcement officers, equipped with riot gear, utilized chemical agents to disperse a group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had set up an encampment at the University of Virginia, according to a report by the student-run newspaper, The Cavalier Daily. The article stated, ""Dozens of police in riot gear used chemical sprays to break up a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of Virginia.""After negotiations, Brown University and student protesters reached a compromise. The students agreed to dismantle their encampment on university property, and in return, the administration committed to evaluating the possibility of ""divesting from companies enabling and profiting from the genocide in Gaza"".In Paris, France, law enforcement personnel removed demonstrators who were participating in a sit-in at Sciences Po, resulting in the arrest of 91 people. The interim administrator of the institution declined to acquiesce to a request made by students to investigate the university's associations with academic institutions in Israel. Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, denounced the blockades at the university, stating that they ""prevented debate"".At Sorbonne University, the Union of Jewish Students in France organized a ""dialogue table"" on Friday to engage in discussions.Joann Sfar, a guest speaker and comic-book artist, emphasized, ""Jewish students have their place in this dialogue."" Sfar expressed his understanding of the students' feelings, acknowledging that they were ""outraged by what's going on in the Middle East"".Rima Hassan, a Franco-Palestinian international law expert known for her strong criticism of what she calls ""genocide"" in Gaza, was initially prevented from speaking at a conference at Paris-Dauphine University.University administrators had imposed the ban, citing concerns about potential public disturbances. However, the decision to prohibit Hassan's participation was later reversed by judicial authorities.Law enforcement officials took action on Friday to remove demonstrators who had gathered near Humboldt University, situated in the heart of Berlin.According to the police, several protesters were ""forcibly"" relocated after they declined to move to a different designated area.Kai Wegner, the mayor of Berlin, expressed disapproval of the demonstration. In a statement on X, the platform previously known as Twitter, Wegner emphasized that the city had no desire to witness incidents similar to those that have occurred in the United States or France.In various Canadian cities, including Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver, students have taken to the streets to voice their opposition to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.The most significant and inaugural encampment has been established at McGill University in Montreal, where hundreds of protesters have gathered despite the looming possibility of police intervention. The demonstrators have pledged to maintain their presence until the university severs all monetary and scholarly connections with Israel.On Wednesday, the university's administration expressed their desire for the immediate removal of the encampment, claiming that some of the protesters were not affiliated with the student community.Supporters of both Gaza and Israel, numbering in the hundreds, confronted each other at Sydney University on Friday. The two groups engaged in slogan-shouting and flag-waving to express their opposing views.Despite some tense moments, the demonstration and counter-demonstration remained largely peaceful, with only a handful of heated verbal exchanges taking place.For the past 10 days, pro-ceasefire activists have been staging a sit-in on a grassy area in front of the university. ""They want it to cut ties with Israeli institutions and reject funding from arms companies.""Students at Trinity College Dublin initiated a sit-in protest on Friday, expressing their support for Palestine by referring to the demonstration as a ""solidarity encampment with Palestine"".Students from Mexico's largest university, UNAM, established a camp in the nation's capital on Thursday to protest against Israel's actions in Palestine. The students chanted slogans such as ""Free Palestine"" and ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will overcome"".The protesters are demanding that the Mexican government cut all ties with Israel in response to the ongoing conflict in the region.Approximately 100 students have been staging a sit-in at the entrance of a building at Lausanne University since Thursday. The students are demanding an academic boycott of Israel and ""an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.""The peaceful protest is set to continue until Monday.","Student protests against the Israeli military assault on Gaza have spread to several countries.

By Saturday, the situation had escalated, with WVAW-TV footage showing police in heavy gear and holding shields, lined up on the campus in Charlottesville. The protesters chanted ""Free Palestine,"" and the university police declared an ""unlawful assembly"" in the area via the social platform X.As the police intervened, students were subjected to forceful measures, including being pushed to the ground, pulled by their arms, and sprayed with a chemical irritant, according to Laura Goldblatt, an assistant professor of English and global studies who has been assisting the student demonstrators. Goldblatt expressed concern for the safety of the students while to the Washington Post, stating, ""Our concern since this began has been the safety of our students. Students are not safe right now.""The university administration issued a statement explaining that the demonstrators were informed that the tents and canopies they had erected were prohibited under school policy and were requested to remove them. To enforce this policy, the university sought assistance from the Virginia State Police.This incident is the latest in a series of tense and occasionally violent confrontations at colleges and universities across the country, where dozens of protests and hundreds of arrests have taken place in response to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war . The Associated Press has documented at least 61 incidents since April 18, resulting in more than 2,400 arrests on 47 campuses.At Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, a group of approximately 75 staged a protest as the event commenced. Many of the protesters wore traditional Arabic keffiyehs in combination with their graduation caps as they proceeded up the main aisle, heading towards the graduation stage.The protesters chanted in unison, ""Regents, regents, you can't hide! You are funding genocide!"" while carrying signs, one of which bore the message: ""No universities left in Gaza.""In the sky above, planes flew with banners displaying contrasting messages. One banner read, ""Divest from Israel now! Free Palestine!"" while another proclaimed, ""We stand with Israel. Jewish lives matter.""At Indiana University, protesters encouraged attendees to don their kaffiyehs and exit during President Pamela Whitten's speech on Saturday evening. The university designated an area outside Memorial Stadium, the venue for the commencement, as a protest zone.Eighteen students at Princeton University in New Jersey initiated a hunger strike to pressure the institution into divesting from companies connected to Israel. Senior David Chmielewski, one of the participants, stated via email that the strike commenced on Friday morning, with strikers consuming only water. He added that the strike would persist until university administrators meet with students to discuss their demands, which include ""amnesty from criminal and disciplinary charges for protesters."" Chmielewski also mentioned that other demonstrators are engaging in 24-hour ""solidarity fasts.""Earlier this week, Princeton students established a protest encampment and staged a sit-in at an administrative building, resulting in approximately 15 arrests. Prior to the recent surge of encampments, students at other universities, such as Brown and Yale, initiated similar hunger strikes earlier this year.However, students at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, peacefully dismantled their encampment on Friday night without any police intervention.","25 people were taken into custody on Saturday for trespassing at the University of Virginia following a confrontation between police and pro-Palestinian protesters.

"Pakistan wheat scam probe: Evasive response of govt raises concerns, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-wheat-scam-probe-evasive-response-of-govt-raises-concerns-says-report/articleshow/109853452.cms,"LAHORE: The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive, despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 's assurance to safeguard farmers ' interests, Dawn reported.While he has pledged unwavering support for farmers, the federal government's reluctance to thoroughly probe the alleged scam and hold accountable those responsible is palpable.Heading the fact-finding committee tasked with unravelling irregularities in the wheat import is Cabinet Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal. However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.

NEW DELHI: Imran Khan, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has accused Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa of bias against his party and called upon the courts to hasten the hearings of his case.From Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, Khan emphasized the need for timely proceedings, labeling the delays in court decisions as unjust.He asserted that all cases against him were false and baseless.Referring to CJP Isa's statement, Khan said,""He stated that there is no pressure on him, but pressure comes to those who refuse to indulge in wrongdoing. You are behaving like [government's] B-team against PTI.""Khan highlighted the unresolved issues regarding PTI's electoral symbol, alleged rigging during general elections and the status of PTI's petitions , behind his allegations of PTI being denied level playing field.He criticized the judiciary for what he perceived as coerced decisions and urged Supreme Court judges to emulate the stance of high court judges in rejecting wrongful decisions.Expressing a willingness to engage in dialogue, Khan conditioned it upon the return of what he claimed was a 'stolen mandate' and the release of imprisoned party workers. He stressed that dialogue typically occurs with adversaries, hinting at a potential negotiation with PTI's perceived adversaries.Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry had suggested that if Khan struck a deal with the establishment, he would effectively become Shehbaz Sharif.Chaudhry's remarks surfaced amidst discussions surrounding alleged talks between PTI and the establishment, which were initiated by senior PTI leader Shehryar Afridi. PTI leader Shehryar Afridi said that his party will hold ""dialogue with the chief of army staff (COAS) and the director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI) soon"" instead of speaking to ""rejected people"" who reached parliament through Form 47.Chaudhry expressed skepticism about Khan's likelihood of striking such a deal, asserting that Shehbaz Sharif's current threats originate not from within his party but from external forces.","Imran Khan, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has accused Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa of bias against his party.

"Pak, with Chinese help, launches maiden lunar mission",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-with-chinese-help-launches-maiden-lunar-mission/articleshow/109825055.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan , in collaboration with China, launched its first-ever lunar mission, iCube-Qamar , from the Chinese city of Hainan on Friday, with authorities saying the satellite will orbit the moon as part of Beijing’s Chang’e-6 space mission.The launch of the satellite on board a Chinese Long March5 Y8 rocket was shown live on Pakistani TV stations and Chinese state television.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Zardari congratulated the nation and its scientists for launching their first lunar orbit mission.Khalil Hashmi, Pakistan’s top envoy in Beijing, who was present at the launch site, confirmed on X that the activity was “successful”. “It (satellite) will be deployed in Moon orbit on May 8,” he added.Authorities said Pakistan’s Institute of Space Technology (IST), in collaboration with China’s Shanghai University and Pakistan national space agency SUPARCO, jointly developed the iCUBE-Q, or CubeSat.CubeSats are miniature satellites typically characterised by their small size and standardised design. They are constructed in cubic shape, often weigh no more than a few kg, and are deployed in space for various purposes.Weighing around 7 kg, the iCUBE-Q orbiter carries two cameras to take images of the lunar surface and has other sensors and apparatus for deep-space communication, altitude control, and other functions.The primary criteria for mission success, officials said, will be achieved with the successful separation of the iCUBE-Q from the Chang’e-6 Orbiter. Following separation, the secondary criteria will involve the satellite receiving a beacon signal that will confirm that the orbiter is working satisfactorily.Finally, the orbiter will take pictures of the Earth, and Moon and try to take pictures of at least two objects together (Earth, Moon, and the orbiter).As part of data collection, authorities said, iCUBE-Q will also collect data on the lunar magnetic field, establish a lunar magnetic field model, and lay the groundwork for future missions and international lunar cooperation.Dr Khurram Khurshid, a senior member associated with Pakistan’s space programme, said the satellite will reach the lunar orbit in five days and will circle the moon for three to six months.He added that different pictures of the surface of the moon will be taken with the orbiter’s help, after which Pakistan will have its own satellite images of the Moon for research.","Pakistan launched its first-ever lunar mission, iCube-Qamar, on Friday.

All that is left for Pak Army is to 'murder me': Imran Khan writes from prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/all-that-is-left-for-pak-army-is-to-murder-me-imran-khan-writes-from-prison/articleshow/109821286.cms,"LONDON/ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country where political leaders like him languish in jail and said all that is left for the powerful military leadership was to ""murder"" him.In a column for the UK's ‘Daily Telegraph' newspaper, penned from the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi where he is being held for disputed corruption charges, the 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician reiterated his previous assertion that if anything happens to him or his wife, General Asim Munir – the Chief of Army Staff, will be responsible.The founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said the cash-strapped country was at a “dangerous crossroads”, with the government a “laughing stock”.“The military establishment has done all they could against me. All that is left for them is to now murder me,” writes Khan.“I have stated publicly that if anything happens to me or my wife (Bushra Bibi), Gen. Asim Munir will be responsible. But I am not afraid because my faith is strong. I would prefer death over slavery,” he says.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy. However, the military has denied meddling in the country's politics.Khan warned that the state was treading the same path it trod in 1971, when it lost East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.“At the same time, it is seeing an upsurge in terrorism and a growing alienation in Balochistan where the issue of enforced disappearances is growing in severity. On Pakistan's borders, India has already admitted to undertaking assassinations inside of Pakistan and the international border with Afghanistan remains volatile,” he notes.Khan notes the military establishment's expectation of “unquestioning support” from the US, in return for the provision of access to airspace and related facilities to the US for military purposes, has been punctured after the publication of the latest US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which highlights the many human rights violations in Pakistan.“With an economy in crisis, spiralling prices and a people politically angry at having their electoral mandate stolen and being economically beleaguered, the state stands isolated,” he writes.Khan hailed the “democratic revenge” of the February 8 general election, during which people came out and “voted overwhelmingly” for candidates supported by his party.“Unfortunately, instead of accepting the people's mandate, the military establishment went into a fit of rage and electoral results were manipulated to bring into power the losers. The same vote tampering was seen in the recent by-elections,” he notes.The PTI founder also praised the six “brave judges” of the Islamabad High Court who have written a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan highlighting instances of harassment and blackmail including of their families by intelligence agencies.“This is unprecedented in our history – although, informally, many knew what was happening to the senior judiciary but for such a letter to have come from these judges shows the level of despair, anger and frustration,” he writes.","Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country.
