'Only stupid people ...': Trump responds to called oldest candidate in US presidential election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/only-stupid-people-trump-responds-on-being-called-oldest-candidate-in-us-presidential-election/articleshow/114332537.cms,"US President Donald Trump

Donald Trump , who has become the oldest candidate to run for president post, has said that ""only stupid people put old"" people in position for the Supreme Court . He seems to have forgotten his age.In an interview with Bloomberg in Chicago , Trump said, ""It’s amazing because I got three in four years. Most people get none. Because, you know, you put them in, they’re young.You tend to put them in young.""See Video:""Only stupid people put old you know you don't put old in because they're there for two years or three years so I got three,"" he added.During his term, Trump appointed Neil Gorsuch was 49 years old when he started, Brett Kavanaugh was 53 years old and Amy Coney Barrett was 48, which are relatively younger than the previous appointments.When the interviewer pointed out Trump's own advanced age, he appeared to dodge the question and instead focused on his successful appointments. He said, ""I think they've been great choices too but I got threejudges and and and you know what they want to do they want to put up they want to now put up up to 25 justices into the Supreme Court, the radical left.""While appointing judges for Supreme Court, Trump suggested people younger than him and he is currently the oldest nominee for president in US history. If elected in November, Trump would be 82 years old when he completes his term in 2029.His age has become a little concern in this election. Trump's mental and health fitness have ramped up on the campaign trail as he has frequently gone on long rants at rallies, ignored or missed questions and, at a Monday town hall, spent the majority of time dancing to music instead of answering questions.Clinical psychologist Dr. Ben Michaelis expressed concerns about Trump's cognitive abilities in an interview with The Independent. Michaelis mentioned the term ""sundowning,"" a symptom associated with dementia that makes it challenging to maintain focus, particularly as the day progresses.""It's very difficult for them to maintain focus on a topic. The idea of being able to maintain that level of focus for that amount of time, that late in the day…you wouldn't think twice about it if that was your grandfather. It's just he happens to be running for president,"" Michaelis stated.","Donald Trump has said that ""only stupid people put old"" people in position for the Supreme Court.

Hezbollah says it will escalate war with Israel after Hamas leader killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-says-it-will-escalate-war-with-israel-after-hamas-leader-killed/articleshow/114332316.cms,"Photo/AP

'Chief obstacle'

No comfort, no compromise

JERUSALEM/CAIRO: Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group said on Friday it was moving to a new and escalating phase in its war against Israel while Iran said ""the spirit of resistance will be strengthened"" after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar Sinwar, a mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war , was killed during an operation by Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday, a pivotal event in the year-long conflict.Western leaders said his death offered an opportunity for the conflict to end, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would go on until the hostages seized by Hamas militants were returned.""Today we have settled the score. Today evil has been dealt a blow but our task has still not been completed,"" Netanyahu said in a recorded video statement after the death was confirmed on Thursday.""To the dear hostage families, I say: This is an important moment in the war. We will continue full force until all your loved ones, our loved ones, are home.""Sinwar, who was named as Hamas' overall leader following the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, was believed to have been hiding in the warren of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza over the past two decades.He was killed during a gun battle in southern Gaza on Wednesday by Israeli troops who were initially unaware that they had caught their country's number one enemy, Israeli officials said.The military released drone video of what it said was Sinwar, sitting on an armchair and covered in dust inside a destroyed building.Hamas has not made any comment itself, but sources within the group have said the indications they have seen suggest Sinwar was indeed killed by Israeli troops.Despite Western hopes of a ceasefire, Sinwar's death could dial up hostilities in the Middle East where the prospect of an even wider conflict has grown.Israel has launched a ground campaign in Lebanon over the past month and is now planning a response to an Oct. 1 missile attack carried out by Iran, ally of Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah.But the demise of the man who planned the attack last year in which fighters killed 1,200 people in Israel and captured more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, could also help push forward stalled efforts to end the war in which Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.US President Joe Biden, who spoke to Netanyahu by phone to congratulate him, said Sinwar's death provided a chance for the conflict in Gaza to finally end and for Israeli hostages to be brought home.The US wants to kick-start talks on a proposal to achieve a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, calling Sinwar the ""chief obstacle"" to ending the war.""That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can't predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one,"" he said. In recent weeks, Sinwar had refused to negotiate at all, Miller said.Iran indicated no sign the killing would shift its support. ""The spirit of resistance will be strengthened"" following the death of Sinwar, its mission to the United Nations said.Hezbollah was also defiant, announcing ""the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel"".US secretary of state Antony Blinken held separate phone calls on Thursday with leaders in Saudi Arabia and Qatar aimed at ending the conflict in the Middle East, the State Department said.Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was a significant achievement, it would not be complete while hostages are still in Gaza.Avi Marciano, the father of Noa Marciano, who was killed in captivity by Hamas, told Israeli broadcaster KAN that ""the monster, the one who took her from me, who had the blood of all our daughters on his hands, finally met the gates of hell.""""A little justice, but no comfort,"" he said. ""There will be comfort only when Naama, Liri, Agam, Daniela and Karina, our girls' friends, return home.""In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, a displaced Palestinian named Thabet Amour told Reuters the Palestinian fight would continue.""This is resistance that does not disappear when men disappear,"" he said. ""The assassination of Sinwar will not lead to the end of the resistance or to a compromise or surrender and raising the white flag.""","Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar Sinwar was a mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war. He was killed during an operation by Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday.

North Korean leader stresses troops to treat South Korea as hostile foreign enemy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korean-leader-stresses-troops-to-treat-south-korea-as-hostile-foreign-enemy/articleshow/114332260.cms,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left on red carpet, visits the headquarters of the North Korean People’s Army’s 2nd Corps at an undisclosed place in North Korea Thursday, October 17, 2024. (AP)

SEOUL: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reminded his troops to treat South Korea as a hostile foreign enemy and insisted that the North wouldn't hesitate to attack its rival if the South infringes upon its sovereignty, state media said Friday. Kim's comments at an army headquarters came after North Korea this week confirmed that it revised its constitution to define South Korea as ""a hostile state"" and blew up front-line road and rail links that were once connected to the South.The steps punctuated Kim's calls for North Korea to abandon its longstanding goals of reconciling with the South and reflect his intent to escalate tensions and increase leverage amid a deepening stalemate in diplomacy. Analysts see increasing risks of possible clashes along the rivals' tense border areas, although it would be highly unlikely for the North to contemplate full-scale attacks in the face of superior US and South Korean forces.Also read: North Korea revises Constitution, declares South Korea as 'hostile State' During a visit to the headquarters of the North Korean People's Army's 2nd Corps on Thursday, Kim stressed to troops the importance of understanding that any use of offensive force against the South would constitute a ""legitimate retaliatory action against the hostile country, not the fellow countrymen.""He said the North's detonation of the border road and rail sections on Tuesday demonstrated the North's resolve to cut off persistent ""evil"" relations with the South, which ""lasted century after century and the complete removal of the useless awareness about fellow countrymen and unreasonable idea of reunification.""He said the event was also a declaration that his troops wouldn't hesitate to use physical force against the South, an ""apparent hostile country,"" if it violates North Korea's sovereignty, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.South Korea had no immediate comment on Kim's remarks.North Korea has been making increasingly provocative threats against rival South Korea in recent weeks, including accusing the South of infiltrating drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang this month and threatening to attack if it happens again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea will face an overwhelming response that would ""end its regime"" if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened.Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have spiked since 2022, as Kim used Russia's war on Ukraine as a window to dial up his weapons testing activities and threats. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have strengthened their combined military exercises in response and took steps to sharpen their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic US assets.South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told the Associated Press earlier this month that North Korea will likely attempt to ramp up pressure with major provocations around the US presidential elections in November, possibly including a long-range missile test or a nuclear test detonation, to grab Washington's attention.",North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reminded his troops to treat South Korea as a hostile foreign enemy.

Australian PM Anthony Albanese buys $4.3million beach pad amid housing crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australian-pm-anthony-albanese-buys-4-3million-beach-pad-amid-housing-crisis/articleshow/114300230.cms,"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese (AP file photo)

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is facing criticism after purchasing a multimillion-dollar waterfront home amid a national housing crisis .The 4.3 million Australian dollar ($2.9 million) clifftop property is located in Copacabana , north of Sydney. Critics argue that the purchase shows Albanese is out of touch with Australians struggling with high interest rates, rising prices, and limited housing supply.Albanese addressed the criticism on Wednesday, stating, ""We want to get on with helping Australians, whether it be public housing , whether it be rentals or whether it be buying their own homes.""Some opposition lawmakers, including Sussan Ley and Angie Bell, questioned the timing of the purchase, calling it ""questionable"" and suggesting it demonstrated how disconnected Albanese is from ordinary Australians.Lawmaker Paul Fletcher added, ""The real issue for Australians is a lot of people want to be able to buy a home, but they're finding it very, very difficult and the current government is doing a very poor job at getting the policy settings in place to make it easier.""However, government lawmakers have defended Albanese. Cabinet minister Chris Bowen commented, “I think the average Australian says, 'Fair enough, leave him alone, I'll criticize his policies or I'll support his policies, I'll criticize or support his government, but I'm not going to criticize or support what he does with his own bank account with his own money.’”Albanese’s Labor Party is seeking a second term in office with elections due by May next year. Monash University political scientist Zareh Ghazarian described the decision as “politically risky” due to housing affordability likely being a top election issue.Albanese maintains that his upbringing in public housing by a single mom has given him an understanding of the financial struggles of low-income families. He explained that he is buying the house in Copacabana because his fiancee Jodie Haydon’s family lives on the Central Coast, and he plans to sell his private Sydney house to help pay for it.""I am much better off as prime minister. I earn a good income. I understand that. I understand that I've been fortunate,"" Albanese said. ""But I also know what it's like to struggle. My mum lived in the one public housing that she was born in for all of her 65 years. And I know what it's like, which is why I want to help all Australians into a home, whether it be public homes or private rentals or home ownership.""","The 4.3 million Australian dollar ($2.9 million) clifftop property is located in Copacabana, north of Sydney.

Kamala Harris Fox News Interview: Kamala Harris vows to be different than Joe Biden in fiery Fox interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-vows-to-be-different-than-joe-biden-in-fiery-fox-interview/articleshow/114298692.cms,"Harris's first formal interview with Fox News ran for nearly half an hour.

Vice President Kamala Harris sought to deflect criticism over the administration’s handling of the border crisis, her stance on transgender rights and her ties to President Joe Biden in a combative interview Wednesday on Fox News .“Let me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency, and like every new president that comes in to office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences and fresh and new ideas,” Harris said.The Democratic presidential nominee’s first formal interview with the outlet ran for nearly half an hour, capping a day where Harris sought to broaden her appeal to conservative voters with an event in suburban Philadelphia featuring dozens of Republican officials who had endorsed her campaign. The interview between Harris and Fox chief political anchor Bret Baier was frequently testy, with both frequently interrupting and speaking over each other.Baier opened the interview by pressing Harris on immigration , which voters have pegged as one of the defining issues of the election.Harris argued that the administration has taken the issue of immigration seriously and that many of the problems they were facing pre-dated her and Biden taking office, and hit at Trump for his role in blocking a bipartisan bill that would have surged resources to address the border surge.“We’ve had a broken immigration system transcending by the way Donald Trump ’s administration even before. Let’s all be honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system,” she said.The vice president said she and Biden had offered legislation to address the immigration system within hours of taking office.“Our focus has been on fixing a problem,” she said.But Baier pressed Harris on the number of undocumented migrants who had entered the country in recent years, and confronted Harris with a video clip of a family member blaming the Biden-Harris administration for the death of a woman murdered by someone in the country illegally.Asked if she would apologize to that family, Harris responded that they were “tragic cases.”“I am so sorry for her loss. I am so sorry for her loss, sincerely,” Harris added. “I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.”But she also insisted that Trump had stymied efforts to find a bipartisan solution to the problem, saying: “Let’s talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions.”During the interview, Baier also played an advertisement from the Trump campaign attacking Harris for statements during the 2020 presidential campaign in which she said she would use taxpayer dollars to pay for gender transition surgeries for prisoners.Harris responded by noting a recent New York Times report that federal prisoners had received gender affirming care during Trump’s administration.“I think frankly that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing you know stones when you’re living in a glass house,” Harris said. “I will follow the law, and it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed.”While Harris earned plaudits from supporters who applauded her vigorous exchange with Baier, one moment during the exchanged seemed destined to become fodder in future campaign ads.When the Fox News host defended Trump by saying the Republican didn’t actively advocate the treatment for transgender inmates, Harris said candidates had to take responsibility “for what happened in your administration.”The line could provide a convenient soundbite for Trump at a moment Harris’ campaign is seeking distance from Biden. Harris devoted significant time during the Fox interview to arguing she represented “a new generation of leadership,” after earning criticism for saying during an interview with The View last week that she could not think of a decision she would have approached differently than the current president.Still, asked what voters should turn the page from - particularly with polls showing many unhappy with the direction of the country — Harris focused her response toward her opponent: “The last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump.”","The Democratic presidential nominee’s first formal interview with the outlet ran for nearly half an hour.

Sean Diddy List: Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/diddy-list-names-of-celebrities-connected-to-sean-combs-viral/articleshow/113609942.cms,"No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

There could be many other reasons for the missing engagement ring such as cleaning or resizing etc.But Meghan's missing engagement ring tells an altogether different tale. During her solo appearance at Greater Santa Barbara, Meghan was seen wearing various pieces of jewelry but not the engagement ring. This was not the first time that Meghan was seen without her engagement ring. She was seen without it at the Invictus Games last year but at that time the ring was ""being fixed"". After that, she was seen wearing the ring at a recent film premiere but it was not there at her recent outing. Instead, she wore her wedding band.Reports said Meghan and Harry are living separate lives and have a blueprint ready for how it will be going forward. Meghan Markle wants to devote her time in her Hollywood projects and entrepreneurship works while Prince Harry wants to be busy in his charitable works. Prince Harry concluded his solo trip in New York, London and then in Africa while Meghan was on her own in California. Whether this separation is only for work or whether they are headed for a divorce is not really known but speculations are rife.Megan's engagement ring underwent several transformation over the years.

'Don't want to have that experience again': China says it prefers Kamala Harris over Trump as US president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-want-to-have-that-experience-again-china-says-it-prefers-kamala-harris-over-trump-as-us-president/articleshow/114332562.cms,"Kamala Harris (left), and Donald Trump

A senior member of the Chinese national advisory body, Jia Qingguo , said on Thursday that China would prefer Kamala Harris over Donald Trump as the next US president, considering the deterioration of bilateral ties during the latter's presidency, which led to serious confrontation.Although the Chinese government refrains from commenting on the US presidential election to avoid accusations of interfering in American domestic politics, Jia, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), shared his views while talking to BBC.""I would prefer Harris because of the bad experience with Trump. We don't want to have that experience again,"" Jia said. However, the views of the Chinese general public are divided over Harris and Trump, he added.He said that during Trump's presidency, relations between the two countries declined sharply, resulting in serious confrontation. From China's perspective, Jia noted that ""US vice president Kamala Harris, who has worked under President Biden, represents the continuity.""Jia, who also serves as the director of the Institute of Global Cooperation and Understanding at Peking University, pointed out that Trump was quite emotional and spread a lot of misinformation about China during his presidency.While acknowledging that China has ""problems with the Biden admiration too"", Jia noted that Biden inherited many tough measures initiated by Trump against China.However, he said that under Biden, US policy towards China is more stable and predictable, with officials from both sides re-engaging and discussing issues, which helps stabilize the relationship.Despite following a tough policy towards China, including challenging Beijing's claims over the disputed South China Sea and Taiwan, and restricting China's ambitious move to export its electric vehicles, Joe Biden has maintained regular dialogue with China's President Xi Jinping to keep tensions under control.The relations between the two top economies hit a low point under Trump, particularly after the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan in 2019. Trump alleged that the virus responsible for the pandemic leaked from a bio lab in Wuhan, prompting China to launch a massive propaganda campaign to counter his accusations.Trump's threat to impose 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods if he gets elected is a concern for Beijing, as it may severely impact China's economy, which is already experiencing a slowdown. The former president had levied tariffs on flourishing Chinese exports to the US to force Beijing to provide more access to American goods.The Biden administration continues to maintain these tariffs, with Chinese exports to the US amounting to over $500 billion last year, compared to around $148 billion in American exports to China.","Jia Qingguo, a senior member of the Chinese national advisory body, said on Thursday that China would prefer Kamala Harris over Donald Trump as the next US president.

'Future of civilization at stake': Musk at his first solo rally for Trump in Philadelphia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/future-of-civilization-at-stake-musk-at-his-first-solo-rally-for-trump-in-philadelphia/articleshow/114333009.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Thursday held his first solo rally in support of Donald Trump and talked about the stakes of the upcoming election, claiming the future of American democracy hangs in the balance. Speaking at an event organised by the America PAC , Musk warned that four more years of a Democratic administration could lead to a permanent one-party state, akin to California.“I think if there's four more years of sort of the sort of puppet regime, they're actually going to legalise so many illegals in the swing states that there won't be swing states anymore,” he said at a rally in Philadelphia, urging the audience to vote early in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania.""Anyone who is against those things is fundamentally anti-American,"" he said, igniting a strong reaction from the audience. Despite Musk's passionate plea for early voting, some attendees expressed confusion, questioning why they should vote early. When one supporter shouted ""Why?"" Musk did not provide a clear answer.Among the audience, concerns over election integrity were prevalent. John and Linda Bird, who attended the rally, expressed hesitation about early voting. John planned to vote on Election Day, while Linda noted the unpredictability of events on that day, saying, “Anything can happen.”Musk’s rally also touched on voter fraud , an issue Trump has frequently highlighted despite a lack of evidence. Musk sarcastically referenced Dominion voting machines, which have been at the centre of conspiracy theories, hinting at their use in key battleground states.Musk’s newfound political activism is notable, as he stated, “I haven't been politically active before. I'm politically active now because I think the future of America and the future of civilisation is at stake.”As part of his commitment to support Trump, Musk has pledged over $70 million to the America PAC, which is focused on mobilising Republican voters, particularly those who typically do not vote. Trump’s campaign strategy has shifted towards energising this base rather than courting independents or moderates, indicating a high-stakes election ahead in November.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk held his first solo rally in support of Donald Trump on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: United States on Thursday charged a second Indian, former intelligence officer Vikash Yadav , in an alleged plot to kill terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who holds US and Canadian citizenship.The US justice department announced that while Yadav is not in custody currently, the 39-year old faces charges of conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering.Yadav worked for Cabinet Secretariat, which includes the Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ), the country's foreign intelligence service.Sikh separatist Pannun is linked with Sikhs for Justice, a New York-based group advocating for the secession of Punjab from India. The justice department said Yadav directed the plot and hired Gupta to find a hitman.Earlier, Nikhil Gupta, 53, pleaded not guilty after being extradited from the Czech Republic in June. The justice department claimed that Gupta contacted someone he believed was a criminal associate, who turned out to be a confidential source working with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).Anne Milgram, the DEA chief, stated, ""Yadav, an employee of the Indian government, used his position of authority and access to confidential information to direct the attempted assassination of an outspoken critic of the Indian government here on US soil.""The justice department press release said that in June 2023, Yadav provided Gupta with personal information about Pannun, including his address in New York City, phone numbers and details on day-to-day activities, which Gupta then passed to an undercover officer of DEA. ""Yadav directed Gupta to provide regular updates on the progress of the assassination plot , which Gupta accomplished by forwarding to Yadav, among other things, surveillance photographs of the victim. Gupta directed the undercover to carry out the murder as soon as possible, but Gupta also specifically instructed the undercover not to commit the murder around the time of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s official state visit to the United States on June 20, 2023,"" said US.This comes amid souring of diplomatic relations between India and Canada over terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was murdered outside a Gurudwara in British Columbia.US further claims that a day after Nijjar murder, Gupta told the undercover officer that Nijjar 'was also the target' and 'we have so many targets.' ""Gupta added that, in light of Nijjar’s murder, there was 'now no need to wait' on killing Pannun. Yadav then sent Gupta a news article about the victim and messaged Gupta, “[i]t’s [a] priority now.”Attorney general Merrick Garland added, “As alleged, last year, we foiled an attempt by Vikash Yadav, an Indian government employee, and his co-conspirator, Nikhil Gupta, to assassinate an American citizen on US soil. Today’s charges demonstrate that the justice department will not tolerate attempts to target and endanger Americans and to undermine the rights to which every US citizen is entitled.”The United States reported on Wednesday that India had informed them that the accused intelligence operative was no longer in government service. State department spokesman Matthew Miller said, ""They did inform us that the individual who was named in the Justice Department indictment is no longer an employee of the Indian government. We are satisfied with the cooperation.""","Vikash Yadav, 39, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering.

'Fantastically attractive' Trump compliments female senator during women-only town hall event; says explained IVF to him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fantastically-attractive-trump-compliments-physical-attributes-of-female-senator-says-explained-ivf-to-him/articleshow/114327747.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former US President Donald Trump came under fire after he complimented a female senator's physical appearance as “young” and “fantastically attractive” in his attempt to garner women votes at a a Fox News town hall.During the event in Cumming, Georgia, Trump was asked a question by a pro-life mother-of-three who said she was concerned about abortion bans impacting access to IVF treatment.In his response, Trump said shared an anecdote of a phone call he had with Republican Alabama Senator Katie Britt.The Republican candidate then admitted he asked Britt to “explain IVF” to him: “And I said, ‘Explain IVF very quickly.’ And within about two minutes I understood it. I said, ‘No, no, we’re totally in favor of IVF.’”“So, I got a call from Katie Britt, a young, just a fantastically attractive person from Alabama. She’s a senator. And she called me up like, ‘Emergency, emergency,’ because an Alabama judge had ruled that the IVF clinics were illegal and they have to be closed down – a judge ruled. And she said, ‘Friends of mine came up to me and they were, oh, they were so angry. I didn’t even know they were going.’ You know, they were, it was fertilization” Trump said.“I didn’t know they were even involved in, nobody talks about that, they don’t talk about it. But now that they can’t do it, she said, ‘I was attacked.’ In a certain way, ‘I was attacked,’ he added.Social media users reacted strongly to a clip of Trump's remarks, labeling him a ""misogynist"" and ""creepy."" Many criticized his focus on Britt's appearance, arguing that it was irrelevant and that all women matter, regardless of their physical attributes.According to a report in The Independent, Trump's campaign national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, defended the former president, stating that he is ""loved by millions of women across the country"" and that those who know him personally would describe him as ""supportive, generous, and kind.""Abortion and IVF have become crucial issues in the current election. While Trump claims to support fertility treatment, Democrats caution that the overturning of Roe v Wade and the rollback of abortion rights could lead Republicans to target IVF access next. In February, Alabama's state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos had the same rights as children, causing some IVF clinics in the state to suspend treatment.",Former US President Donald Trump came under fire after he complimented a female senator's physical appearance as “young” and “fantastically attractive” in his attempt to garner women votes.

There's never been (anyone).""""And that doesn't mean I don't want to help him, because I feel very badly for those people.

However, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal last month, the war has claimed the lives of or wounded a million soldiers on both sides.As one of Ukraine's primary supporters, the United States has provided Zelensky's government with more than $64.1 billion in military assistance since the beginning of the conflict.Despite Kyiv being a US ally and Moscow being considered an adversary, Trump highlighted his positive relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin during a face-to-face meeting with Zelensky in September.It is worth noting that Trump faced impeachment for withholding crucial weaponry from Ukraine following Russia's smaller-scale invasion in 2014, as he pressured its government to announce investigations into Biden, who was then his election rival.Furthermore, a federal investigation uncovered numerous connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, which was found to have interfered in the 2016 US election to benefit the Republican candidate.Criticism surrounding Trump's apparent closeness to Putin intensified last week due to allegations that, while serving as president, he sent the Russian leader Covid tests despite a shortage in the US, and that Trump and Putin may have been in contact numerous times since 2021.","Former US president Donald Trump blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia.

'She’s not as strong ... ’: What Biden and Obama talked about Kamala Harris in an off-mic conversation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shes-not-as-strong-as-me-what-biden-and-obama-talked-about-kamala-harris-in-an-off-mic-conversation/articleshow/114326147.cms,"NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden and Barack Obama were reportedly seen engaging in a private conversation over Vice President Kamala Harris' strength as Presidential candidate for the upcoming US elections.According to the New York Post , President Biden, in an off-mic conversation caught on camera, complained to former President Barack Obama that ""she"" is ""not as strong as me."" Former President Barack Obama agreed with Biden's assessment and responded, ""I know … that's true,"" and added, ""We have time."" Biden responded, ""Yeah, we'll get it in time.""Earlier in the conversation, Obama mentioned, ""it's important that we have some time together,"" possibly alluding to campaigning alongside Harris.The dialogue was translated by Jeremy Freeman, a London-based forensic lip reader who has served as a certified expert witness for 16 years.The exchange, which took place during Ethel Kennedy 's memorial service, was deciphered by Jeremy Freeman, a professional lip reader. Freeman noted that the conversation was supportive and lacked any tension between the two presidents, despite speculation based on Obama's head-shaking gesture.Meanwhile, Democratic sources had mixed reactions to the translation. Some believed it was an honest assessment of the 2024 race, while others expressed disbelief and questioned the accuracy of the script. One source noted the widespread concern that Harris was not a strong alternative to Biden, who was seen as a ""sinking ship."" Two former Biden White House officials working to support Harris' candidacy were stunned by the translation and doubted its accuracy, the New York post reported.“Democrats essentially robbed Peter to pay Paul and are now stuck with a less likable sinking ship,” it added.Harris, 59, experienced a surge in polling after replacing Biden as the Democratic candidate against former President Donald Trump. However, she has since fallen behind in critical swing-state polls. The RealClearPolitics average shows Harris trailing Trump, 78, in several key states. Trump has outperformed polls in the past two presidential elections.Initially, Biden argued that he had earned the nomination with over 14 million votes and minimal opposition in the state nominating contests. However, he ultimately decided to drop out and endorse Harris amidst growing pressure from Democrats who questioned his mental acuity following a June 27 debate with Republican nominee Donald Trump.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) helped lead the mutiny, citing bleak polling that suggested Biden could harm down-ballot Democrats. Actor George Clooney, a friend of Obama's, also wrote a scathing New York Times op-ed detailing his concerns about Biden's cognitive fitness.","US President Joe Biden and Barack Obama were reportedly seen engaging in a private conversation over Vice President Kamala Harris' strength.

MAGA supporter questions Vivek Ramaswamy's Hindu faith: Check out his answer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-supporter-questions-vivek-ramaswamys-hindu-faith-check-out-his-answer/articleshow/114325526.cms,"Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy addressed questions about his faith during an event where a MAGA supporter accused him of drawing parallels between Hindu gods and Jesus Christ while avoiding publicly declaring his religion.The supporter expressed concerns that Ramaswamy's omission of specifying the God he referred to throughout his lecture could mislead the predominantly Christian audience into thinking he was talking about Jesus Christ.The supporter emphasized the incompatibility of Hinduism with America and challenged Ramaswamy to clarify which God he was referring to in his speeches.""I've got a couple of observations that I want to make, and then I was wondering if you would respond to them. So the first one is that throughout the course of the lecture, you talked an awful lot about God and faith . And there were some men that came up here and they asked you about your hindu religion. But my suspicion is if they didn't mention that, you would have omitted who that God was throughout the course of the entire lecture. And most of the people in this Room here would leave thinking you were talking about the only true God, Jesus Christ,"" a student asked Ramaswamy.""So my big question is, and you've talked about being forthright and transparent, my suspicion is that you would have omitted who that God was when you were speaking here tonight had you not explicitly been asked about Hinduism. So my challenge to you going forward would be to say who this God is?"" he added.In response, Ramaswamy said that he has been forthright about his identity, despite the ease of adopting a different name and pretending to be a Christian, as some other candidates have done. He dismissed the supporter's suspicion as baseless, citing his numerous campaign speeches over the past year.""You run for US President at the age of 37. As somebody who's been in business, who's actually easiest thing to call myself, some Vic Ramsey, and pretend to be a Christian, got other people on that debate stage last time who shortened their names and called themselves to be a Christian too, I man up and tell you who I am, and believe me, your suspicion is off base. Listen to any number of the campaign speeches. I gave over thousands of them over the course of the last year. So we can take the disingenuous accusation off the table, but level with what I do think is an interesting coming,"" Ramaswamy said.Further, Ramaswamy referenced Thomas Jefferson , who was not a traditional Christian but a deist, and asked the supporter if he considered Jefferson an enemy of Christianity.""So watch about the last presidential campaign of last year. And you apparently have had your head stuck in the sand where it need not belong. Now, what I think we need more of in our American politics is less of questioning the motivations of what somebody is and get to the content of where there's an actual difference of opinion. So the question of whether or not somebody of a non Christian faith can embody and lead the United States of America at any meaningful level is an open question. Thomas Jefferson is on the other side of this question from you. Thomas Jefferson was not a traditional Christian. Do you know what the Jefferson Bible is?"" he added.Earlier during his campaigning, Ramaswamy opened up about his 'Hindu' faith, emphasizing that it provides him with freedom and has motivated him to undertake this presidential campaign as a moral obligation.Ramaswamy said, ""My faith is what gives me my freedom. My faith is what led me to this presidential campaign. I am a Hindu. I believe there is one true God. I believe god put each of us here for a purpose. My faith teaches us that we have a duty, a moral duty to realise that purpose. Those are God's instruments that work through us in different ways, but we are still equal because God resides in each of us. That's the core of my faith"".","Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy addressed questions about his faith during an event where a MAGA supporter accused him of drawing parallels between Hindu gods and Jesus Christ while avoiding publicly declaring his religion.

US woman accused of killing and cooking mother's body parts arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-woman-accused-of-killing-and-cooking-mothers-body-parts-arrested/articleshow/114325349.cms,"In a chilling case that has stunned the small town of Mount Olivet , Kentucky , a 32-year-old woman, Torilena May Fields , has been arrested for the brutal murder and dismemberment of her mother, Trudy Fields .Fields, an aspiring actress who went by the stage name Naomi Navarre during her time in California, is accused of not only killing her mother but also cooking parts of her body, including the severed head.She is facing multiple charges, including abuse of a corpse, evidence tampering, and obstruction.Police were called to Trudy Fields' home on October 9 after a worker discovered a disemboweled human torso in the backyard. The scene was so horrifying that authorities were forced to initiate an 11-hour standoff before Fields was apprehended. Investigators later found severed body parts — including a charred head, hands, and feet—inside a pot in the oven that was still warm, as reported by Fox56.According to the Robertson County grand jury indictment, Fields allegedly shot her mother in the head, stabbed her repeatedly, and dismembered the body. She is also accused of killing the family dog in what investigators describe as an unprovoked and intentional act. Evidence found at the scene, including blood-soaked mattresses and drag marks leading to the backyard, added to the horror.The worker who initially discovered the remains described a bizarre encounter with Fields. “She was casting spells on me,” he reportedly told 911 operators, alluding to Fields' erratic behavior.For many who knew her, Fields' actions are difficult to comprehend. Once a hopeful actress with roles in two films — The Desert Project and A Dance Story in 2019 — her life had taken a dark and disturbing turn. Fields had not posted on social media since September 2022, but family members suggest that a motorcycle accident in California may have contributed to her mental unraveling.Olivia Brock, Fields' cousin, was reportedly quoted as saying that the accident left her with a traumatic brain injury. “She was an actress and doing her thing out there,” Brock explained. “I guess we were told a couple of months ago that she was in a bad motorcycle accident and sustained a brain injury. I wonder if that’s what caused this.”Other family members share similar sentiments. Todd Brock, Fields' uncle, expressed disbelief at her actions. “I think somebody has lost control of their mind,” he said. “The girl in the mug shot? That’s not the girl we know.” He also mentioned hearing rumors that Fields had been involved in witchcraft or Satanism, adding a disturbing layer to the case.Fields was reportedly under the influence of drugs when she was arrested, though police have yet to specify the substances involved. She is currently being held on a $1.5 million bond at the Bourbon County Detention Center, awaiting trial for the gruesome murder.As the community grapples with the horrifying details, the Fields family is left to mourn both the tragic death of Trudy and the unraveling of a once-promising young woman.","Torilena May Fields, 32, has been arrested for the murder and dismemberment of her mother, Trudy Fields.

US says it is 'satisfied' with India's cooperation in alleged plot to kill Pannun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-says-it-is-satisfied-with-indias-cooperation-in-alleged-plot-to-kill-pannun/articleshow/114323956.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

Taking a more measured and lowkey approach than Canada in the matter of purported transnational hit jobs, the Biden administration on Wednesday said it is ""satisfied"" with the cooperation it is getting from New Delhi in the US investigation into the alleged foiled assassination plot targeting Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Pannun .""It continues to be an ongoing process. We continue to work with them on that, but we do appreciate the cooperation, and we appreciate them updating us on their investigation as we update them on ours,"" state department spokesman Matthew Miller said at the daily briefing, following a meeting with the visiting Indian team probing the matter.Characterising it as a ""productive meeting,"" Miller said the visiting Indian team informed the US that the individual named in the Justice Department indictment relating to the alleged plot against Pannun's life is no longer an employee of the Indian Government.The individual, identified as CC1 in the US indictment, is reported to be a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officer on deputation to Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) named Vikram Yadav. According to US accounts, CC1 allegedly recruited Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national, to hire a hitman to eliminate Pannun, who the Indian government has designated as a terrorist. The hitman turned out to be an undercover US agent.Gupta was arrested in Prague earlier this year and extradited to the US, where he has pled not guilty ahead of an expected trial. India has said it does not sanction or condone transnational killing amid suggestions that certain players may have gone rogue.At the same time, New Delhi has also pushed back at US and Canada for adopting a benign attitude -- all in the name of political freedom -- towards violent Khalistani extremists who have attacked Indian diplomatic missions and threatened Indian diplomats and officials.Pannun, a dual citizen of US and Canada, has a free run in both countries and continues to openly threaten Indian officials, most recently sending out an email showing India's ambassador to the US, Vinay Kwatra, in the cross hairs of a rifle in a visual, with the message ""Wanted: Enemy of Sikhs.""While Washington has kept engagement with New Delhi on the issue fairly low-key, Canada has elevated the matter into the public domain, insisting New Delhi has had a hand in the assassination of Sikh separatists, despite by its own admission, not providing evidence for what it calls ""credible allegations."" Canada's political arena is replete with charges that the country Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has stirred up the matter for political survival since his government is dependent on support from Sikh leaders, many of whom are Khalistani separatists.","The Biden administration says it is ""satisfied"" with the cooperation it is getting from New Delhi.

LAHORE: Describing foreign minister S Jaishankar ’s visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting as a positive development that should provide an opening for more substantive engagements between the 2 countries, former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi saying the latter’s decision to visit Sharif’s home in 2015 was not an ordinary gesture. Sharif sought progress in ties saying the relationship should not be held captive by the past.Sharif, a 3-time PM and elder brother of Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.“Achhe bhare talukkat ko tabah aur barbad karne waali baat ki (he worked to destroy a healthy relationship). I would have never used that kind of language. We believe in certain values that must be respected,” said Sharif, adding he had fond memories of Modi’s only visit to Pakistan on December 25, 2015, Sharif’s birthday.As then Pakistan PM, Sharif had received Modi at his home in Lahore. “I got a call from him saying he was in Kabul and wanted to visit me on his way back to India. I told him he was most welcome. He also met my mother during the visit. What he did wasn’t a chota (small) gesture,” said Sharif, in a meeting with Indian journalists in Lahore who travelled to Pakistan to cover Jaishankar’s engagements. The former PM is also the leader of the ruling PMLN party. His daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Sharif was also present in the interaction.Khan’s personal attacks against Modi after India revoked the special status of J&K only led to further deterioration of relations between the 2 countries. Sharif did not comment on India’s recent actions in the union territory as he said this wasn’t the occasion to discuss it. PM Shehbaz too had avoided raking up the Kashmir issue even in a roundabout manner at the SCO meeting.Sharif also called upon both sides to look ahead and not be held back by the past even though he didn’t make any specific commitment on resumingtrade ties or reappointing high commissioner. He did say that if there’s an opening, cheezein niklengi (things will emerge).Asked about his 2015 peace initiative with Modi that was scuttled quickly by the Pathankot terror attack, Sharif said it’s important to ensure any such effort is not disrupted. “India is our hamsaya (neighbour) mulk and we can’t change that even if we want it. We would have liked Modi to come (for SCO) but it’s good Jaishankar came. We have tried and tried again (to normalise ties). We lost the past 75 years and it’s important we don’t lose another 75 years,” said Sharif, who is known to share a close personal rapport with Modi.“Both sides have their giley-shikwe (grievances). It will be better if we can bury the past,” he added. When asked if he would play the role of building bridges, he said he was doing it.Sharif also backed SAARC, trade and cricket ties with India, saying neither country gains anything by not allowing their teams to play each other. He also recalled how former Indian PM A B Vajpayee had approached him to buy electricity from Pakistan. “I would allow my team to play. If there’s a cricket tournament on India and Pakistan and India are playing in the final, I’ll travel to India to watch it. There should be progress. SAARC or any such opportunity should not be missed. It’s important to make full use of it,” he said.“I believe we are a potential market for each other. Why should Indian and Pakistani farmers and manufacturers go outside to sell their products. Goods now go from Amritsar to Lahore via Dubai. Who is benefitting from this? What should take 2 hours takes 2 weeks,” he added.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi.

She also demanded that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party be treated in the same way as ""banned organisations"" in the country.Maryam, daughter of former three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, claimed that the rape incident was fabricated to create unrest in Punjab. She accused political opponents, particularly PTI, of using students and the media to propagate false information for political gains.On Wednesday, a large number of students held demonstrations in Jehlum, Faisalabad, and Gujrat, demanding justice for the alleged rape victim.However, the chief minister stated that no incident of rape took place at the Punjab College for Women in Lahore. She alleged that PTI and its media supporters spread the fake news to destabilise the province by manipulating innocent students.On Monday, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured during clashes with police over the alleged rape incident. Protesters claimed that the college administration had deleted CCTV footage to cover up the case.Maryam accused PTI of attempting to destabilise the government by spreading false narratives, particularly during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which portrayed Pakistan positively on the global stage. The two-day SCO summit concluded on Wednesday.She warned of strict action against those spreading fake news, including media personnel. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said, adding that the girl in question had suffered a back injury, not a rape, and was in the hospital ICU since October 2, contradicting the circulated claims.Addressing PTI founder Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail for the last 15 months, she remarked, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are.""The chief minister also accused certain individuals from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and abroad of fuelling the controversy through fake news.""The issue isn't social media, but rather PTI, which needs to be controlled...and everything will be fine. They are operating through fake accounts,"" she alleged.Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has launched a probe against those involved in spreading disinformation through social media platforms about the alleged on-campus rape incident.A seven-member team headed by Deputy Director Cybercrime Lahore Waqas Saeed will identify individuals responsible for the disinformation campaign and the subsequent law-and-order situation.","Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz dismisses rape claims as fabricated.

"No bilateral but India, Pak ‘break the ice’ with Jaishankar visit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-bilateral-but-india-pak-break-the-ice-with-jaishankar-visit/articleshow/114294074.cms,"Modi, Sharif likely to come face to face at COP29 in Nov



ISLAMABAD: External affairs minister S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days even though there was no formal bilateral meeting between the foreign ministers on the margins of the SCO heads of government summit in Islamabad, diplomatic sources said. The fact that the first visit by an Indian foreign minister to Pakistan in almost 9 years went off without a hitch was seen as a positive development by the Indian government.As he departed after a 24-hour stay in Islamabad from the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, Jaishankar, who had said recently India isn’t passive on Pakistan and will react to positive and negative developments accordingly, thanked Shehbaz and Dar in a post on X for the hospitality and courtesies.While Indian government sources described the talks as casual conversations, Pakistan officials said there was a brief pull aside, which lasted for 5 to 7 minutes, between Jaishankar and Dar on the sidelines of the dinner hosted by Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday evening. Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), is learnt to have joined Jaishankar and Dar.A source speaking on condition of anonymity said Pakistan suggested resumption of bilateral cricketing ties as a way of “breaking the ice”. Naqvi was later quoted as saying that Jaishankar’s visit was an ice-breaker even though neither side proposed a bilateral meeting. Pakistan is looking to host the Champions Trophy next year and would like India to participate.The relationship between the 2 countries has remained in deep-freeze since the abortive bid to resume the dialogue process in 2015 under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. Things only worsened after Pakistan recalled its high commissioner in August 2019, following India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K.Indian government sources appreciated the fact that Shehbaz didn’t rake up any bilateral issue in his remarks as the host of the summit.While Jaishankar’s remarks on terrorism were seen as a message for Pakistan, Indian sources said the minister had only spoken about issues that the SCO has identified as key challenges and that other member-states can also relate to.Jaishankar is learnt to have had another extended conversation with Dar at the SCO lunch table on Wednesday where both were seated next to each other. “It wasn’t initially planned that way but later they sat together and spoke over lunch in the presence of other delegates,’’ said.Both sides denied that there was any proposal for resumption of dialogue. Shehbaz and Indian PM Narendra Modi are expected to come face to face next month at COP29 in Azerbaijan but for any substantive engagement, India will want Pakistan to first reappoint high commissioner.After his return from Pakistan, Jaishankar said in another post on X that India made a positive and constructive contribution to the talks in Islamabad and identified 8 takeaways from India’s perspective from the documents that were signed. These included upholding fair and balanced connectivity projects in accordance with international law, the goals and principles of the UN Charter and SCO Charter and a fair, open, inclusive and transparent multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.Significantly, another Pakistan minister, Ahsan Iqbal, had told visiting Indian journalists on Tuesday that Pakistan wants the 2 countries to return to the 1999 Lahore Declaration that called upon both sides to refrain from intervening and interfering in each other’s internal affairs. Shehbaz’s brother Nawaz Sharif, who reached the agreement with then Indian PM A B Vajpayee, has repeatedly accused former president Pervez Musharraf of scuttling the Declaration through his Kargil adventurism.","S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days.

He said attaining these original SCO objectives was even more important in an uncertain world marred by conflicts and debt.“It is axiomatic that development and growth requires peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the three evils,’’ said the minister.In a message to both China and Pakistan, the minister also said SCO cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and connectivity must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. “It should recognize territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas,’’ said the minister, adding cooperation can’t progress if global practices are cherry-picked, especially of trade and transit.India was again the only country in SCO to not endorse China’s BRI in the SCO joint statement. BRI’s flagship China Pakistan Economic Project ( CPEC ) passes through PoK, which India sees as under illegal occupation of Pakistan. Since it became a full member of SCO in 2017, India has repeatedly reminded member-states that it’s important for them to respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. China was represented by Premier Li Qiang in the meeting.The minister also spoke about the need to make the UN Security Council more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable. “The SCO must be in the lead of advocating such change, not hold back on a matter of such importance,’’ said the minister. China is the only P5 country not to publicly declare support for India’s UNSC permanent membership bid.“While we each make our contribution, the world order is more than the sum of its parts. As it changes, global institutions do need to keep pace. That is why the case for ‘reformed multilateralism’ gets stronger by the day. Comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council, both in the permanent and non-permanent categories, is essential,’’ said the minister.","S Jaishankar said activities across borders characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism would be detrimental to trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges.

Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party

Senior directors of a Pakistan college stated on Wednesday that there was no evidence to support claims of a student being raped on campus, despite reports circulating online that led to several days of protests. The allegations, which spread through social media posts, claimed that a woman was raped in the basement of a Punjab College for Women campus in Lahore .In response to the posts, hundreds of students, mostly male, engaged in protests that involved smashing windows and burning school buses. These demonstrations reflect a growing concern in Pakistan regarding safety, harassment, and sexual violence.Arif Chaudry, the Lahore director of the private Punjab Group of Colleges , which operates the women's college, was quoted by AFP during a press conference saying, ""The incident does not exist. I will resign and I will leave this profession and stand with the students if the incident took place.""Another director of the group, Agha Tahir Ijaz, urged students not to believe misinformation during the same news conference.As the anger grew over the alleged incident, police arrested a security guard who was identified in the online posts. However, they reported that no victim had come forward and that they were unable to verify the incident.The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has initiated an investigation targeting individuals responsible for disseminating the information via social media channels which is now claimed to be false.The protests, which began at two of the college's campuses on Monday afternoon, quickly spread to several other colleges throughout the city and continued for three days and resulted in injuries to at least 28 people.As the college denied the claims, Maryam Nawaz , the chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab also addressed the alleged rape incident, asserting that the accusations were 'fabricated'.Nawaz further claimed that the political party led by Imran Khan , Pakistan's former prime minister who is currently imprisoned, exploited the false allegation to provoke extensive student demonstrations and cause instability throughout the province.The Punjab government has closed the college campus where the alleged rape was said to have occurred until further notice. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said while warning that those responsible for spreading the false posts would face punishment. Addressing PTI founder Imran Khan, the CM added, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are."" She then claimed that the girl in question had suffered a back injury and had been receiving treatment in the hospital's intensive care unit since October 2 and was not raped.","Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party for 'fabricated' rape claims.

Li is likely to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-funded airport in the southwestern province, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.Neither side commented on the reason for a virtual inauguration, but sources cited heightened security concerns following the recent Karachi attack for Li being advised against travelling to a restive region.Islamabad, too, has sought to temporarily curb the movements of Chinese nationals in the country, citing fears of violence from armed groups. Officials said the Karachi blast is likely to figure in talks between Li and his Pakistani counterpart.“We will review progress on existing initiatives, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), and also explore new avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation.

At least 28 students, including girls, from various campuses of a well-known private college in Lahore, were injured during clashes with the police as they protested against the alleged on-campus rape of a female student, police said on Monday. The protests erupted Monday morning across at least four boys' and girls' campuses of the Punjab Group of Colleges , owned by the Dunya media group , following reports that a female student at the Gulberg girls' campus in Lahore was raped allegedly by a security guard in the institution's basement.As news of the alleged rape spread on social media, students from various campuses began protesting, accusing the college administration of negligence in the matter.A large number of students, including girls, set fire to college furniture and chanted slogans against the administration. As the protests escalated, with students blocking roads, the police resorted to baton charges to disperse the demonstrators.""During the clash, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured.

"Pakistan to repay over $30 billion debt in FY25, says central bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-repay-over-30-billion-debt-in-fy25-says-central-bank/articleshow/114208042.cms,"Representative Image

Cash-strapped Pakistan 's central bank has revealed the country is scheduled to repay a total of USD 30.35 billion in maturing foreign debt and interest payments in 12 months (August 2024 to July 2025) including those significant loans which bilateral creditors roll over every year.The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, cited by a JS Global report, showed that the payments from August 2024 to July 2025 include significant loans that bilateral creditors roll over annually.The Express Tribune reported that Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.Under the latest USD 7 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Pakistan's repayments and interest payments are fully secured for the 37-month loan period. Despite the rising repayments and interest payments, the foreign debt-to-GDP ratio has decreased from 27.6 per cent in August of the previous year to 20.2 per cent in August 2024, due to the expansion of Pakistan's economy in FY24 compared to the contraction in FY23.The data highlights the increasing foreign debt repayments and interest payments each year, emphasizing the need for economic managers, planners, and parliamentarians to explore ways to boost foreign income and reduce external expenditures. Compared to the USD 21.2 billion (including rollovers) paid by Pakistan over the past 12 months (August 2023 to July 2024), the current 12-month period's repayment and interest payment sum of USD 30 billion is significantly higher, according to JS Global.The increase in repayments and interest payments for the ongoing 12 months can be attributed to fresh loans provided by Saudi Arabia, UAE, and IMF in late June and July 2023, amounting to around USD 4 billion, as well as an additional USD 2 billion lent by IMF between August 2023 and April 2024. These loans have increased the repayment pressure (including significant rollover) in the coming years.Topline Research, citing the latest IMF documents, reported that Pakistan's gross external financing requirement has dropped to a 9-year low of USD 18.8 billion (excluding expected rollovers and contained current account deficit) for the ongoing fiscal year (July 2024 to June 2025). However, another researcher mentioned that Pakistan is also expected to add fresh foreign loans amounting to USD 3 billion to USD 4 billion in the current fiscal year (FY25).A third researcher emphasized the need for Pakistan to reduce its external expenditures through import substitution. Implementing such measures would help improve the country's ability to make external payments and increase foreign exchange reserves, as reported by The Express Tribune.","Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.

"IMF asks Pakistan to end preferential treatment to agriculture, textile sectors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-asks-pakistan-to-end-preferential-treatment-to-agriculture-textile-sectors/articleshow/114205816.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund has asked Pakistan to swiftly end preferential treatment, tax exemptions and other protections for the agriculture and textile sectors, which it says, have stifled the country's growth potential for decades, a media report said here on Monday. The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ), in its staff report on the diagnosis of the factors behind Pakistan's struggling economy, blamed these two sectors not only for failing to contribute adequately to the national revenue but also for consuming large portions of public funds while remaining inefficient and uncompetitive, The Dawn newspaper said.As part of the recently approved USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the IMF stressed that Pakistan must break from its economic practices of the past 75 years to escape its recurrent boom-bust cycles.The IMF report released on October 10 highlighted the country's significant lag behind similar nations, a stagnation that has compromised living standards and pushed over 40.5 per cent of the population below the poverty line.It said Pakistan had struggled to develop more sophisticated export goods, and the share of knowledge-intensive exports remains low as it failed to innovate. As of 2022, Pakistan ranked 85th in the Economic Complexity Index, the same rank it held in 2000.""With an export basket strongly biased towards agriculture and textiles (cotton yarn, rice, woven fabrics, beef, and leather apparel), the country has struggled to reallocate resources towards more technologically complex products,"" it said.The current focus on agriculture has limited Pakistan's ability to diversify into more technologically complex goods. While Pakistan does export some high-value products, such as medicines, medical instruments and plastic products, these sectors operate in a heavily distorted economic environment, it said.The report highlighted tariffs on intermediate and final goods as barriers to competitiveness and domestic market growth, inhibiting the country's transition towards more advanced manufacturing.""Reallocation, however, is held back by existing microeconomic distortions, including public procurement of agricultural goods, price controls on raw inputs, and fiscal and financial incentives for low productivity sectors,"" it observed.The report identified the textile sector as having the highest tax gap relative to its value added, noting that between 2007 and 2022, the sector benefited from subsidies, favourable pricing on inputs, concessional financing schemes and preferential tax treatment.Earlier, the IMF on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to certain conditions. This USD 1 billion tranche came under an agreement to receive USD 7 billion over 39 months.The latest IMF report pointed out that as of May 2024, 70 per cent of the outstanding concessional central bank loans were tied to the textile sector.The IMF recommended that the government focus on simplifying trade policies under the upcoming National Tariff Policy (2025-29) and urged Pakistan to avoid using tariffs to promote industrialisation or protect inefficient sectors, arguing that such policies weaken exports, hinder participation in global value chains, and incentivise rent-seeking.The report also warned that ""trade policies aimed at promoting specific domestic sectors, including export subsidies and local content requirements, should be discontinued as they are likely to promote resource misallocation and may violate international obligations"".Compared to other regional peers, Pakistan's export growth has been weak, with sales to the world particularly stagnant during the 2010s.It said several complex goods were within likely technological proximity to Pakistan's current export basket, including glassware, paints, chemicals, fabrics for industrial use, paper, cosmetics and rubber products.However, to facilitate the development of such new industries, the country needed a level playing field for business, avoiding targeted policies aimed at picking winners.This includes greater integration into global trade and easier access to imports, both as intermediate inputs for production and as final goods to promote domestic competition, the IMF said, adding, the removal of fiscal incentives would reduce the existing misallocation of resources and promote price discovery across firms.","The International Monetary Fund has asked Pakistan to end preferential treatment, tax exemptions and other protections for the agriculture and textile sectors.

Bangladesh court issues arrest warrant for ex-PM Sheikh Hasina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-ex-pm-sheikh-hasina/articleshow/114309285.cms,"Sheikh Hasina

A Bangladeshi court on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for former prime minister Sheikh Hasina , who has been in exile since fleeing to India in August after being ousted from power by a student-led revolution.The court ordered that Hasina be produced before it on November 18, according to Mohammad Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangladesh 's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT).Hasina, 77, ruled Bangladesh for 15 years, a period marked by widespread human rights abuses , including the detention and extrajudicial killings of political opponents.""Sheikh Hasina was at the helm of those who committed massacres, killings, and crimes against humanity between July and August,"" said Islam, describing the court’s decision as a ""remarkable day.""Since her departure from Bangladesh, Hasina has not been seen in public, with her last known location being a military airbase near New Delhi, India. Her presence in India has sparked tensions between the two countries, leading Dhaka to revoke her diplomatic passport.While Bangladesh and India have an extradition treaty, a clause allows refusal if the charges are of a ""political character,"" raising questions about whether Hasina will be returned to face trial.Hasina’s government established the controversial ICT in 2010 to investigate war crimes committed during Bangladesh’s 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.However, the tribunal has faced widespread criticism from the United Nations and human rights groups for its lack of procedural fairness, and it is widely viewed as a tool used by Hasina to eliminate political rivals .The court is currently investigating multiple cases accusing Hasina of orchestrating the mass killings of protesters during her time in power.","A Bangladeshi court issues an arrest warrant for former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
