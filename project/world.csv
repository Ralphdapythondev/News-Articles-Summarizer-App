So when that is a deep seated belief that they've been hit with, the idea that they wont be able to get an abortion even in extreme circumstances is terrifying, and they will not vote for any candidate who might essentially stop them from getting it -- even in those extreme circumstances. This is the issue that we face. The relentless push in education to terrify girls and women that if they get pregnant their life is over,"" he said.The reality is that there's nothing greater than having kids.

'Don't respect them as soldiers': Trump responds to being called 'most dangerous person ever',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-respect-them-as-soldiers-trump-responds-to-being-called-most-dangerous-person-ever/articleshow/114410203.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump hit back at accusations from two of the most senior military officials who served under him, both of whom now describe him as a significant threat to the nation.During a pointed exchange, Trump was asked to respond to comments from retired General Jim Mattis and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley , both of whom labeled him as ""the most dangerous person ever.""Trump’s response was characteristically direct.""They were not my cup of tea, they were woke,"" he said, dismissing the two generals. ""You know that they were not great generals in my opinion. I was asking them for advice. I didn't agree with the advice.""Citing Milley’s handling of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan , Trump said, ""Look at the advice that Milley gave to Biden on Afghanistan. Move the soldiers out first, no, you have to move the soldiers out last. I don't respect them as soldiers. I never did. I fired them both.""General Mark Milley, who served as Trump’s Joint Chiefs chairman, has become increasingly outspoken, recently calling Trump ""a fascist to the core"" and stating that no individual has ever posed a greater danger to the United States than the 45th president.Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who resigned in 2018 after clashing with Trump over the withdrawal of American troops from Syria, appeared to share Milley’s assessment. According to veteran journalist Bob Woodward, Mattis reportedly agreed with Milley’s grim warning about Trump.The two generals, once key figures in Trump’s administration, have joined a growing chorus of critics concerned about the possibility of a second Trump administration.Mattis had previously distanced himself from Trump following his resignation, calling the former president divisive in the wake of the George Floyd protests in 2020.

"Watch: Trump puts on Apron, works at McDonald's drive-through in latest viral video",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-trump-puts-on-apron-works-at-mcdonalds-drive-through-in-latest-viral-video/articleshow/114409685.cms,"In an unconventional campaign stop that blended fast food with politics, Donald Trump took over the fry station at a Pennsylvania McDonald's on Sunday. Wearing an apron over his suit and tie, the Republican presidential nominee took aim at Kamala Harris ’ long-standing claim of working at the fast-food chain in her college days.With reporters and MAGA aides gathered around, Trump received a crash course in fry-making, eagerly dunking baskets of fries into sizzling oil, salting them, and scooping them into boxes.Trump, a well-known fan of McDonald's, said, ""I don’t even have to touch them with my hands! Incredible!"", grinning as he maneuvered his way around the fry station. “It requires great expertise, actually, to do it right and to do it fast,” he added with a smirk.Trump's impromptu stint behind the counter was more than just a quirky photo op. As Election Day looms just weeks away, the visit was a thinly veiled jab at Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Harris has spoken about her time working at McDonald's during her college years, a story Trump has repeatedly questioned, dubbing her ""Lyin' Kamala.""Seizing the opportunity, Trump claimed he had worked longer at the McDonald's fry station that day than Harris did during her college stint. “Fifteen minutes longer, believe me!” he said. ""I love McDonald's, I love jobs, and I love seeing good jobs,” he added.But the show didn’t stop at the fry station. Trump, apron still on, took to the drive-thru window for an impromptu press conference, leaning out to answer questions from reporters huddled outside. Asked what message he had for Kamala Harris on her 60th birthday, which coincidentally fell on the same day, Trump said, ""Happy Birthday, Kamala! I think I’ll get her some flowers.""Trump’s fry-slinging tour in the battleground state was part of a broader effort to keep Harris’s McDonald's story in the spotlight, continuing to question the legitimacy of her summer job experience. “I could do this all day,” he boasted, poking fun at the notion of Harris having done the same years ago.As the fast-food spectacle wound down, aides nudged Trump to wrap things up, reminding him of his next campaign stop. With a final flourish, he leaned out of the window and declared, “Wasn’t that a strange place to do a news conference?”Before leaving, Trump, who has often sidestepped questions about minimum wage policies, took a moment to praise the McDonald’s crew. “These people work hard. They’re great. I just saw something … a process that’s beautiful.” He sidestepped directly addressing whether his presidency would support wage increases for those manning the fryers.The former president left Pennsylvania, proving that in Trump’s world, even McDonald’s can be a campaign battlefield.","Donald Trump took over the fry station at a Pennsylvania McDonald's on Sunday.

Break the Rules? Deal's Off

WASHINGTON: Panda exchanges , like the one that sent two bears to Washington's National Zoo last week, are governed by closely held contracts. In most nations, they are never released. Lawyers for the Smithsonian , which operates the National Zoo, refused to release a 2020 contract. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, which regulates the import and export of exotic species, provided a San Diego Zoo contract with key passages blacked out.But NYT has found full copies of those documents and others in regulatory filings. The contracts govern two pandas at the National Zoo and two more that arrived in San Diego this summer. Comparing these contracts with past agreements revealed that American zoo administrators are ceding increasing authority to the China Wildlife Conservation Association , a government group.Here are a few of the terms.The arrival of pandas in Washington and San Diego were highly choreographed media events. But zoo administrators have agreed to limit what they tell journalists. Administrators cannot discuss panda illness, death, disease or ""any other important matters"" without first consulting with their Chinese partners, whose views ""shall be fully respected.""Zoos pay up to $1.1 million a year to rent pairs of pandas from China. To raise money, zoos court donations from everyday people and big-ticket philanthropists. China retains ownership of the pandas, and zoos pay for the right to display and breed them for a decade. But the China Wildlife Conservation Association prohibits zoos from discussing the deal in that way. ""Commercial terms such as 'lease,' 'rental,' 'loan agreement' or 'contract' shall not be used"", the contract dictates.Zoos have agreed to pay for Chinese experts to travel to the US regularly to give advice, including airfare, hotels, a daily stipend of $100 to $150 per person.Last year, a panda at the Memphis Zoo, Le Le, died after panda enthusiasts watched him deteriorate on the zoo's live video feed. The zoo's female, Ya Ya, came under scrutiny, too, with animal welfare groups saying that she was too thin and had mangy fur. Some even paid for a billboard in Times Square. Previously, zoos promoted round-the-clock panda feeds. Now, they have agreed to limit their live feeds. Melissa Songer, a Smithsonian conservation biologist, said the National Zoo pushed back. The zoo will offer footage on a delay, Songer said.The China Wildlife Conservation Association can terminate the contract and recall pandas to China for a variety of reasons. The ""unauthorized release of relevant information"" to the public is one example. NYT","The contracts govern two pandas at the National Zoo and two more that arrived in San Diego this summer.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged.

Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein.

Yahya Sinwar's Journey From Israeli Jails To Chief Of Hamas | Who Was He | Watch

Israel has released new footage showing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a tunnel under his home just hours before the deadly October 7 attack on Israel. The video, shared by the Israeli Defence Forces ( IDF ), shows Sinwar moving equipment into the underground hideout, preparing for a prolonged stay as Hamas prepared to launch its assault.The grainy footage, which surfaced on Saturday, reveals Sinwar, his wife, and children walking through the tunnel under their home in Khan Younis.IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari commented during a televised briefing, saying, ""You can see how Sinwar and his family members escape to an underground compound just hours before the brutal massacre."" The footage shows Sinwar in a plain t-shirt, accompanied by his family, moving supplies including food, water, mattresses, and even a plasma screen.According to Hagari, the tunnel system was equipped with toilets, showers, and a kitchen, suggesting that Sinwar had prepared for a long-term stay. The underground bunker, hidden beneath his home, was designed to allow him and his family to evade capture, while the attack on Israeli civilians was underway. Sinwar was one of the masterminds behind the October 7 attack that triggered the current war. He had remained in hiding for over a year, evading several Israeli attempts to capture or kill him. Drone footage, released after his death, shows Sinwar injured, throwing an object at the drone in his final moments.Israeli military officials confirmed that Sinwar was killed by a gunshot to the head. The IDF released footage of the tank strike that targeted the building where he was hiding.Sinwar’s death has not slowed the ongoing conflict. As Israeli strikes continue to hit targets across Gaza, the death toll has soared, with over 100 civilians reported dead in recent bombardments. Tensions have escalated with Hezbollah in Lebanon, as both Hamas and Hezbollah vow to continue their fight against Israel.Israel's military has reiterated its commitment to dismantling Hamas, as evidenced by its Saturday leaflet drops over southern Gaza, proclaiming, ""Hamas will no longer rule Gaza."" Meanwhile, international negotiations for a potential ceasefire remain stalled, despite pressure from Western leaders.On October 7, Hamas launched attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border, resulting in at least 1,200 deaths and the abduction of 252 Israelis and foreigners. Of the 97 remaining hostages, over 30 have been confirmed dead.","Footage shows Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a tunnel under his home just hours before the deadly October 7 attack on Israel.

TOI Correspondent from Washington: MAGA supremo Donald Trump stopped by at a McDonald's fast food outlet in Pennsylvania on Sunday to make french fries for fifteen minutes and hand them out to his supporters at the drive by window . The showboating exercise was ostensibly aimed at challenging Kamala Harris 's claim that she worked a summer job at McDonald's -- which Trump disputes -- to illustrate her middleclass roots.Dressed in his usual suit even though it was a Sunday, Trump exchanged his jacket for an apron and spent about ten minutes before a fryer as a McDonald's worker handheld him through the process. Through the exercise he was obsessed with belittling ""Lyin' Kamala"" (as he denigrates) saying McDonald's had said in a statements that she had not worked with them. There is no record of McDonald's ever issuing such a statement. ""I've now worked 15 minutes more than Kamala at a McDonald's"" Trump gibed.TV footage showed a few hundred MAGA supporters outside the franchise, a crowd Trump claimed was 10,000 strong. About half a dozen customers, all of them clearly Trump supporters -- including an Indian couple -- drove by the pick up window to collect orders, which Trump said was free courtesy him.The grandstanding invited ridicule from trolls on social media who joked about his wearing a suit to McDonald's and said he is so clumsy he'd be fired in 15 minutes if he really worked there. ""He’s been shitting in a gold toilet since birth- he doesn’t represent you. He doesn’t care about you,"" mocked one critic, while another called him a rich plutocrat feeling left out.", MAGA supremo Donald Trump stopped by at a McDonald's fast food outlet in Pennsylvania on Sunday to make french fries for fifteen minutes and hand them out to his supporters.

HYDERABAD: In a public rally on Friday, leading Pakistpolitician Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari warned that if political parties in parliament do not reach a consensus on the 26th constitutional amendment , he will push the amendment through parliament using a brute, or two-thirds majority, Dawn reported. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party which is led by his father Asif Ali Zardari who is the President of Pakistan.Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ) is in coalition with PM Shehbaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N). These two parties along with Fazlur Rehman's Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) have come together to implement the 26th constitutional amendment in Pakistan's constitution.While addressing a PPP rally in Pakistan's Hyderabad city to mark the anniversary of the attack on his mother's homecoming parade in 2007, Bilawal Bhutto said, ""It is my desire to have consensus among all political parties in parliament for this amendment. The second option, which is not my preferred path, is to rely on the majority's vote to pass it,"" Dawn noted.He urged political parties to consider the future and work towards raising the dignity of parliament, adding that they operate within a certain ""political space"".Bhutto noted that while the PPP was unable to establish a constitutional court during its 2008-2013 government, he is committed to fulfilling the promise made by Benazir Bhutto.He acknowledged opposition to the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), particularly fromPTI leaders, but insisted that the new court would ensure equal representation for all provinces.PTI has been protesting across Pakistan against the implementation of the constitutional amendments as the Party alleges that the bill would undermine the powers of judiciary.PTI leaders have also alleged that bribes up to Rs 1 Billion are being offered to lawmakers to garner support for passing the amendment law.In the public rally, Bilawal Bhutto gave out historical justifications for implementation of the 26th amendment saying that even Muhammad Ali Jinnah had called for a separate court for routine justice matters at the 1930 Round Table Conference.The FCC, Bhutto claimed, would protect the rights of provinces by providing equal representation and addressing disputes between the federation and provinces.As per Dawn, Bhutto insisted that his mother and former Pakistan PM Benazir Bhutto had supported the establishment of the FCC because she understood the ""real face"" of the judiciary, which he said had repeatedly legitimised dictatorial rule.""After abolishing the 'One Unit' system in the country through parliament, my mother wanted to eliminate the concept of 'One Unit' in the judiciary as well,"" he added.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: Over 34 universities in Pakistan 's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been facing a financial crisis , with a collective loss of Pakistani Rupees ( PKR ) 15 billion, ARY News reported.According to the details, the financial crisis is due to the significant disparity between the income of the universities and expenditures.

NEW DELHI: Police in Pakistan used tear gas and batons to disperse student protesters on Thursday after they ransacked a college building. The protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger and demonstrations in four cities.Reports of the incident spread on social media, increasing tensions on college campuses. Students in Rawalpindi, Punjab province, burned furniture and blocked a key road before vandalizing a college building.Earlier, a security guard died during clashes between student protesters and police in Gujrat, also in Punjab province. Authorities arrested one person related to the guard's death and another for spreading misinformation about the alleged rape.In Lahore, over two dozen students were injured earlier this week while demanding justice for the alleged victim, who students claim was raped at the Punjab Group of Colleges.In response to the growing unrest, the government banned rallies in Punjab.

LAHORE: Describing foreign minister S Jaishankar ’s visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting as a positive development that should provide an opening for more substantive engagements between the 2 countries, former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi saying the latter’s decision to visit Sharif’s home in 2015 was not an ordinary gesture. Sharif sought progress in ties saying the relationship should not be held captive by the past.Sharif, a 3-time PM and elder brother of Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.“Achhe bhare talukkat ko tabah aur barbad karne waali baat ki (he worked to destroy a healthy relationship). I would have never used that kind of language. We believe in certain values that must be respected,” said Sharif, adding he had fond memories of Modi’s only visit to Pakistan on December 25, 2015, Sharif’s birthday.As then Pakistan PM, Sharif had received Modi at his home in Lahore. “I got a call from him saying he was in Kabul and wanted to visit me on his way back to India. I told him he was most welcome. He also met my mother during the visit. What he did wasn’t a chota (small) gesture,” said Sharif, in a meeting with Indian journalists in Lahore who travelled to Pakistan to cover Jaishankar’s engagements. The former PM is also the leader of the ruling PMLN party. His daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Sharif was also present in the interaction.Khan’s personal attacks against Modi after India revoked the special status of J&K only led to further deterioration of relations between the 2 countries. Sharif did not comment on India’s recent actions in the union territory as he said this wasn’t the occasion to discuss it. PM Shehbaz too had avoided raking up the Kashmir issue even in a roundabout manner at the SCO meeting.Sharif also called upon both sides to look ahead and not be held back by the past even though he didn’t make any specific commitment on resumingtrade ties or reappointing high commissioner. He did say that if there’s an opening, cheezein niklengi (things will emerge).Asked about his 2015 peace initiative with Modi that was scuttled quickly by the Pathankot terror attack, Sharif said it’s important to ensure any such effort is not disrupted. “India is our hamsaya (neighbour) mulk and we can’t change that even if we want it. We would have liked Modi to come (for SCO) but it’s good Jaishankar came. We have tried and tried again (to normalise ties). We lost the past 75 years and it’s important we don’t lose another 75 years,” said Sharif, who is known to share a close personal rapport with Modi.“Both sides have their giley-shikwe (grievances). It will be better if we can bury the past,” he added. When asked if he would play the role of building bridges, he said he was doing it.Sharif also backed SAARC, trade and cricket ties with India, saying neither country gains anything by not allowing their teams to play each other. He also recalled how former Indian PM A B Vajpayee had approached him to buy electricity from Pakistan. “I would allow my team to play. If there’s a cricket tournament on India and Pakistan and India are playing in the final, I’ll travel to India to watch it. There should be progress. SAARC or any such opportunity should not be missed. It’s important to make full use of it,” he said.“I believe we are a potential market for each other. Why should Indian and Pakistani farmers and manufacturers go outside to sell their products. Goods now go from Amritsar to Lahore via Dubai. Who is benefitting from this? What should take 2 hours takes 2 weeks,” he added.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi.

Lahore, Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday dismissed allegations of an on-campus rape incident at a Lahore college as fabricated, accusing Pakistan's jailed former premier Imran Khan's party of using the false claim to incite widespread student protests and create unrest in the province. She also demanded that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party be treated in the same way as ""banned organisations"" in the country.Maryam, daughter of former three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, claimed that the rape incident was fabricated to create unrest in Punjab. She accused political opponents, particularly PTI, of using students and the media to propagate false information for political gains.On Wednesday, a large number of students held demonstrations in Jehlum, Faisalabad, and Gujrat, demanding justice for the alleged rape victim.However, the chief minister stated that no incident of rape took place at the Punjab College for Women in Lahore. She alleged that PTI and its media supporters spread the fake news to destabilise the province by manipulating innocent students.On Monday, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured during clashes with police over the alleged rape incident. Protesters claimed that the college administration had deleted CCTV footage to cover up the case.Maryam accused PTI of attempting to destabilise the government by spreading false narratives, particularly during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which portrayed Pakistan positively on the global stage. The two-day SCO summit concluded on Wednesday.She warned of strict action against those spreading fake news, including media personnel. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said, adding that the girl in question had suffered a back injury, not a rape, and was in the hospital ICU since October 2, contradicting the circulated claims.Addressing PTI founder Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail for the last 15 months, she remarked, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are.""The chief minister also accused certain individuals from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and abroad of fuelling the controversy through fake news.""The issue isn't social media, but rather PTI, which needs to be controlled...and everything will be fine. They are operating through fake accounts,"" she alleged.Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has launched a probe against those involved in spreading disinformation through social media platforms about the alleged on-campus rape incident.A seven-member team headed by Deputy Director Cybercrime Lahore Waqas Saeed will identify individuals responsible for the disinformation campaign and the subsequent law-and-order situation.","Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz dismisses rape claims as fabricated.

"No bilateral but India, Pak ‘break the ice’ with Jaishankar visit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-bilateral-but-india-pak-break-the-ice-with-jaishankar-visit/articleshow/114294074.cms,"Modi, Sharif likely to come face to face at COP29 in Nov



ISLAMABAD: External affairs minister S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days even though there was no formal bilateral meeting between the foreign ministers on the margins of the SCO heads of government summit in Islamabad, diplomatic sources said. The fact that the first visit by an Indian foreign minister to Pakistan in almost 9 years went off without a hitch was seen as a positive development by the Indian government.As he departed after a 24-hour stay in Islamabad from the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, Jaishankar, who had said recently India isn’t passive on Pakistan and will react to positive and negative developments accordingly, thanked Shehbaz and Dar in a post on X for the hospitality and courtesies.While Indian government sources described the talks as casual conversations, Pakistan officials said there was a brief pull aside, which lasted for 5 to 7 minutes, between Jaishankar and Dar on the sidelines of the dinner hosted by Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday evening. Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), is learnt to have joined Jaishankar and Dar.A source speaking on condition of anonymity said Pakistan suggested resumption of bilateral cricketing ties as a way of “breaking the ice”. Naqvi was later quoted as saying that Jaishankar’s visit was an ice-breaker even though neither side proposed a bilateral meeting. Pakistan is looking to host the Champions Trophy next year and would like India to participate.The relationship between the 2 countries has remained in deep-freeze since the abortive bid to resume the dialogue process in 2015 under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. Things only worsened after Pakistan recalled its high commissioner in August 2019, following India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K.Indian government sources appreciated the fact that Shehbaz didn’t rake up any bilateral issue in his remarks as the host of the summit.While Jaishankar’s remarks on terrorism were seen as a message for Pakistan, Indian sources said the minister had only spoken about issues that the SCO has identified as key challenges and that other member-states can also relate to.Jaishankar is learnt to have had another extended conversation with Dar at the SCO lunch table on Wednesday where both were seated next to each other. “It wasn’t initially planned that way but later they sat together and spoke over lunch in the presence of other delegates,’’ said.Both sides denied that there was any proposal for resumption of dialogue. Shehbaz and Indian PM Narendra Modi are expected to come face to face next month at COP29 in Azerbaijan but for any substantive engagement, India will want Pakistan to first reappoint high commissioner.After his return from Pakistan, Jaishankar said in another post on X that India made a positive and constructive contribution to the talks in Islamabad and identified 8 takeaways from India’s perspective from the documents that were signed. These included upholding fair and balanced connectivity projects in accordance with international law, the goals and principles of the UN Charter and SCO Charter and a fair, open, inclusive and transparent multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.Significantly, another Pakistan minister, Ahsan Iqbal, had told visiting Indian journalists on Tuesday that Pakistan wants the 2 countries to return to the 1999 Lahore Declaration that called upon both sides to refrain from intervening and interfering in each other’s internal affairs. Shehbaz’s brother Nawaz Sharif, who reached the agreement with then Indian PM A B Vajpayee, has repeatedly accused former president Pervez Musharraf of scuttling the Declaration through his Kargil adventurism.","S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days.

He said attaining these original SCO objectives was even more important in an uncertain world marred by conflicts and debt.“It is axiomatic that development and growth requires peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the three evils,’’ said the minister.In a message to both China and Pakistan, the minister also said SCO cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and connectivity must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. “It should recognize territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas,’’ said the minister, adding cooperation can’t progress if global practices are cherry-picked, especially of trade and transit.India was again the only country in SCO to not endorse China’s BRI in the SCO joint statement. BRI’s flagship China Pakistan Economic Project ( CPEC ) passes through PoK, which India sees as under illegal occupation of Pakistan. Since it became a full member of SCO in 2017, India has repeatedly reminded member-states that it’s important for them to respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. China was represented by Premier Li Qiang in the meeting.The minister also spoke about the need to make the UN Security Council more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable. “The SCO must be in the lead of advocating such change, not hold back on a matter of such importance,’’ said the minister. China is the only P5 country not to publicly declare support for India’s UNSC permanent membership bid.“While we each make our contribution, the world order is more than the sum of its parts. As it changes, global institutions do need to keep pace. That is why the case for ‘reformed multilateralism’ gets stronger by the day. Comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council, both in the permanent and non-permanent categories, is essential,’’ said the minister.","S Jaishankar said activities across borders characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism would be detrimental to trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges.

Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party

Senior directors of a Pakistan college stated on Wednesday that there was no evidence to support claims of a student being raped on campus, despite reports circulating online that led to several days of protests. The allegations, which spread through social media posts, claimed that a woman was raped in the basement of a Punjab College for Women campus in Lahore .In response to the posts, hundreds of students, mostly male, engaged in protests that involved smashing windows and burning school buses. These demonstrations reflect a growing concern in Pakistan regarding safety, harassment, and sexual violence.Arif Chaudry, the Lahore director of the private Punjab Group of Colleges , which operates the women's college, was quoted by AFP during a press conference saying, ""The incident does not exist. I will resign and I will leave this profession and stand with the students if the incident took place.""Another director of the group, Agha Tahir Ijaz, urged students not to believe misinformation during the same news conference.As the anger grew over the alleged incident, police arrested a security guard who was identified in the online posts. However, they reported that no victim had come forward and that they were unable to verify the incident.The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has initiated an investigation targeting individuals responsible for disseminating the information via social media channels which is now claimed to be false.The protests, which began at two of the college's campuses on Monday afternoon, quickly spread to several other colleges throughout the city and continued for three days and resulted in injuries to at least 28 people.As the college denied the claims, Maryam Nawaz , the chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab also addressed the alleged rape incident, asserting that the accusations were 'fabricated'.Nawaz further claimed that the political party led by Imran Khan , Pakistan's former prime minister who is currently imprisoned, exploited the false allegation to provoke extensive student demonstrations and cause instability throughout the province.The Punjab government has closed the college campus where the alleged rape was said to have occurred until further notice. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said while warning that those responsible for spreading the false posts would face punishment. Addressing PTI founder Imran Khan, the CM added, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are."" She then claimed that the girl in question had suffered a back injury and had been receiving treatment in the hospital's intensive care unit since October 2 and was not raped.","Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party for 'fabricated' rape claims.
