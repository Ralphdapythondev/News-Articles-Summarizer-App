Hush money trial: Michael Cohen's damning testimony against Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-trial-michael-cohens-damning-testimony-against-trump/articleshow/110099765.cms,"What specific role did Donald Trump play in the hush money scheme, according to Michael Cohen?

What were the allegations that prompted the hush money payments?

How did Trump allegedly ensure these stories were suppressed?

What risks does Cohen's testimony pose to Donald Trump?

Has Trump responded to the allegations made during the trial?

What could be the political implications of this trial for Trump?

In a gripping chapter of what could shape the future of a former US President, Donald Trump 's intimate involvement in a hush money scheme has been laid bare by Michael Cohen , his former attorney and fixer. The trial, which revolves around efforts to suppress stories potentially harmful to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, has seen Cohen testifying in detail about the then-candidate's direct engagement with the payment processes.These revelations underscore the legal entanglements facing Trump, as Cohen's testimony connects him to deliberate efforts to influence the election outcome by silencing accusations of past indiscretions.Cohen, once a close confidant of Trump, has transformed into a crucial adversary, delivering testimony that paints a vivid picture of Trump’s command over the secretive payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. This testimony not only highlights the lengths gone to protect Trump's campaign image but also raises significant questions about the legality of these actions. As the trial progresses, the implications of Cohen’s revelations are set to challenge the legal defenses of the former president, potentially altering his political and personal future.Here are all you need to know:Michael Cohen testified that Donald Trump was ""intimately involved"" and that ""everything required Mr Trump’s sign-off."" This included direct approvals and discussions about how payments should be made to suppress damaging stories during the campaign.The payments were aimed at suppressing stories about Trump's past sexual encounters that could harm his presidential campaign in 2016. These included allegations by porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, both of whom claimed to have had affairs with Trump.According to Cohen, Trump orchestrated payments to the individuals through legal and media channels. This involved setting up a shell company and arranging for payments to be made under the guise of legal fees, with Trump personally promising to reimburse Cohen for fronting the money.Cohen's testimony potentially increases Trump's legal exposure. If the jury finds Cohen credible, it could lead to convictions on several charges of falsifying business records, each linked to the payments and their cover-up as legal expenses.Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the sexual encounters with Daniels and McDougal. His defense argues that the payments were personal in nature, intended to protect his family from embarrassment, and not related to the campaign.The trial could significantly impact Trump’s image and his political future, especially as he campaigns for the presidency.

Top Biden official doubts Israel can achieve 'total victory' in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-biden-official-doubts-israel-can-achieve-total-victory-in-gaza/articleshow/110094631.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Biden administration does not see it likely or possible that Israel will achieve ""total victory"" in defeating Hamas in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, US deputy secretary of state Kurt Campbell said on Monday.While US officials have urged Israel to help devise a clear plan for the governance post-war Gaza , Campbell's comments are the clearest to date from a top US official effectively admitting that Israel's current military strategy won't bring the result that it is aiming for.""In some respects, we are struggling over what the theory of victory is,"" Campbell said at a Nato youth summit in Miami. ""Sometimes when we listen closely to Israeli leaders, they talk about mostly the idea of....a sweeping victory on the battlefield, total victory,"" he said.""I don't think we believe that that is likely or possible and that this looks a lot like situations that we found ourselves in after 9/11, where, after civilian populations had been moved and lots of violence that...the insurrections continue.""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to achieve ""total victory"" against Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on October 7 and killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage.In response, Israel unleashed a relentless assault on the Gaza Strip, killing more than 35,000 people, according to the figures of the Gazan health ministry, and reducing the densely populated tiny enclave to a wasteland.Campbell's comments come as Washington is warning Israel not to go ahead with a major military offensive in Rafah, the southernmost city of the Gaza Strip where over a million people who have already been displaced by Israeli attacks are taking shelter.Likening the situation in Gaza to that of a recurring insurgency that the United States faced in Afghanistan and Iraq after its invasions there following the September 11 attacks, Campbell said a political solution was required.""I think we view that there has to be more of a political solution...What's different from the past in that sense, many countries want to move towards a political solution in which the rights of Palestinians are more respected,"" he said.""I don't think it's ever been more difficult than right now,"" he added.","US deputy secretary of state Kurt Campbell says Israel's current military strategy won't bring the result that it is aiming for.

Rafah Bombardments Intensifying: Israel's incursion into Gaza sparks condemnation and humanitarian concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israels-incursion-into-gaza-sparks-condemnation-and-humanitarian-concerns/articleshow/110090358.cms,"CAIRO: Israeli forces pushed deep into the ruins of Gaza 's northern edge to recapture an area where they claimed to have dismantled Hamas months ago, while in the south- tanks and troops pushed across a highway into Rafah.Some of the most intense fighting for weeks is raging in both the north and south. Israeli operations in Rafah, which borders Egypt, have closed a main crossing point for aid, which humanitarian groups say is worsening an already dire situation.Hundreds of thousands of people are being forced to flee again after around half of Gaza's population took sanctuary there after being pushed south by fighting elsewhere.Gaza's health authority appealed for international pressure to reopen access via the southern border to allow in aid and medical supplies.""The wounded and sick suffer a slow death because there is no treatment and supplies and they cannot travel,"" it said.In northern Gaza's Jabalia, a sprawling refugee camp built 75 years ago to house Palestinian refugees from what is now Israel , tanks pushed towards the heart of the district. Residents fled along rubble-strewn streets carrying bags of belongings. Tank shells landed in the centre of the camp and airstrikes destroyed clusters of houses, they said. Health officials said they had recovered 20 bodies of Palestinians killed in overnight airstrikes.""We don't know where to go. We have been displaced from one place to the next... We are running in the streets. I saw it with my own eyes. I saw the tank and the bulldozer. It is on that street,"" said one woman, who did not give her name.Israel's military said in early January that it had ""dismantled Hamas' military framework in Jabalia"", although it expected to return to the area periodically to fight militants.Palestinians say the need to return to earlier battlegrounds is proof Israel's military objectives are unattainable.Israeli troops are seeking to wipe out Hamas, which has said it is committed to Israel's destruction. The militant group burst into Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 and taking more than 250 hostages, by Israeli tallies.Attending a Memorial Day ceremony to mark Israel's fallen soldiers in Jerusalem on Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war against Hamas is a struggle to secure Israel's ""existence, liberty, security and prosperity.""""Our war of independence is not over yet, it continues to these days,"" he said.The Palestinian death toll in the war has now surpassed 35,000, with 57 killed in the past 24 hours, according to Gaza health officials, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and fighters.In Rafah, Israel stepped up aerial and ground bombardments on the eastern areas of the city, killing people in an airstrike on a house in the Brazil neighbourhood.Israel ordered residents out of the east of Rafah last week, and extended that order to central areas in recent days, sending hundreds of thousands of people fleeing in search of safety. UNRWA , the main United Nations aid agency in Gaza, estimated that about 360,000 people had fled the southern city since the Israeli military gave its first evacuation order a week ago.In Gaza city, Al-Ahli Arab Hospital medics said five people were killed in an airstrike on a house.The assault on Rafah has caused one of the biggest splits in decades between Israel and its main ally the United States, which paused some deliveries of weapons for the first time since the war began. Washington says Israel must not assault Rafah without a plan to protect civilians, which it has yet to see.Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant's office said that he had briefed US secretary of state Antony Blinken on the ""precise operation"" in the Rafah area.Hamas' armed wing said its fighters were engaged in gun battles with Israeli forces in one of the streets east of Rafah, and in the east of Jabalia.In Israel, the military sounded sirens several times in areas near Gaza, warning of potential Palestinian cross-border rocket and or mortar launches.Hamas and the armed wing of Islamic Jihad said in a joint statement that they fired mortar bombs against Israeli forces massing inside the Rafah crossing, which Israel captured last week.","Israeli forces push deep into the ruins of Gaza's northern edge to recapture an area where they claimed to have dismantled Hamas months ago.

It has simultaneously sought to join the European Union, welcomed Chinese investment, and remained on largely friendly terms with the Kremlin.It has been reliant for years on support from both Russia and China to prevent the UN from recognizing Kosovo as independent, following its secession from Serbia in 2008.Ukraine has never recognized Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence either.Russia on Monday pummelled more than 30 towns and villages in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region after launching a surprise ground offensive over the border last week.","Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba began an official visit to Serbia on Monday.

"How is Pakistan buying fighter jets, submarines despite the economic crisis?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/how-is-pakistan-buying-fighter-jets-submarines-despite-the-economic-crisis/articleshow/110059597.cms,"Despite facing a dire economic situation with a foreign debt totaling $124.5 billion, equivalent to 42% of its GDP, Pakistan is persistently expanding its military capabilities, notably through substantial arms imports and collaborations with China. A report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) indicates that between 2019 and 2023, China accounted for 82% of Pakistan’s arms imports, reflecting a deepening military relationship between the two nations.""China is strongly contributing to the strengthening of Pakistan’s military by providing fighter jets, warships, missile technology, drones, etc.This is part of China’s strategy to counter the influence and power of Quad-4 (that includes India) and the West’s other regional alliances,"" an opinion piece in the EurAsian Times said.During President Xi Jinping’s 2015 visit to Pakistan, a significant agreement was forged for China to construct eight Hangor-class submarines for Pakistan, enhancing its naval power. ""The submarines will play a pivotal role in maintaining peace and stability in the region. It would add a new dimension to the ever-tested Pakistan-China friendship,” said Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Pakistani Chief of Naval Staff. This deal is part of China's broader strategy to counterbalance the influence of the Quad alliance and Western powers in the region.Amidst this backdrop of military enhancement, Pakistan grapples with an acute economic crisis , exacerbated by last year's devastating floods which led to a severe reduction in the GDP growth projection from 5% to 0.29%. The financial strain is further highlighted by a comment from the Business Standard, noting, ""Pakistan has no food for its people but purchases weapons."" The national budget reflects a 15.4% increase in defense spending, totaling 1804 billion rupees, even as the nation contends with skyrocketing inflation and widespread poverty.The economic hardships have led to public discontent, with Pakistani media reporting severe shortages of basic necessities such as food and medicines. Many believe that the real power in Pakistan lies with the military, which commands a significant portion of the national budget and operates vast revenue-generating enterprises. This perception is reinforced by international discussions, such as those held by the IMF, which highlight the disproportionate allocation of resources to the military at the expense of civil needs, the EurAsian Times report said.Adding to the controversy, recent reports from the BBC and other media outlets have suggested that despite Pakistan’s official stance of neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, there have been covert operations involving the supply of arms to Ukraine. These reports allege that under American pressure, Pakistan engaged in secret deals that not only violated its declared neutrality but also provided substantial profits from arms sales.","Pakistan is persistently expanding its military capabilities, notably through substantial arms imports and collaborations with China.

Russian President Putin removes defense minister Sergei Shoigu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russian-president-putin-removes-defense-minister-sergei-shoigu/articleshow/110061169.cms,"NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin has replaced Sergei Shoigu as defense minister , in a significant Cabinet shakeup coinciding with the start of his fifth term. The move comes as part of a broader restructuring following Putin's recent inauguration.Following protocol, the entire Russian Cabinet resigned post-inauguration, with most ministers expected to retain their positions.However, Shoigu's future had been uncertain until Putin announced his new role as secretary of Russia 's Security Council. Shortly thereafter, Putin proposed Andrei Belousov as Shoigu's successor.Belousov's nomination requires approval from Russia's upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. Alongside this change, other ministerial appointments were proposed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, who was reappointed by Putin.The decision to replace Shoigu, who held the defense minister post since 2012, follows the arrest of his deputy, Timur Ivanov, on bribery charges. This move raised speculation about Shoigu's position, despite his close ties to Putin.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's choice of a civilian for the defense minister role aims to inject innovation and economic efficiency into the defense sector. Belousov, formerly the first deputy prime minister, is seen as fitting this vision due to his extensive experience in finance and economics.Shoigu's shift to the Security Council underscores Putin's strategy of retaining key figures in advisory roles. This tactic aligns with previous appointments, including formerPresident Dmitry Medvedev, who serves as the council's deputy chairman.The reshuffle comes amid ongoing tensions with Ukraine. Recent clashes have resulted in casualties and civilian displacement, with Russian forces making territorial gains in Ukraine's northeast. Analysts suggest Russia's strategy involves exploiting ammunition shortages and intensifying battles to exhaust Ukrainian forces.The situation remains volatile, with reports of a residential building collapse in Belgorod, attributed to Ukrainian shelling. While Russia claims territorial gains, Ukrainian officials have not confirmed these reports, emphasizing the fluidity and complexity of the conflict.Putin's restructuring of key positions reflects his broader agenda for governance and security. As geopolitical tensions persist, the implications of these changes reverberate both domestically and internationally, shaping the trajectory of Russian policy and its regional relations.(With inputs from agencies)",Russian President Vladimir Putin has replaced Sergei Shoigu as defense minister.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urgently appealed for military aid as Ukrainian troops engage in counterattacks to thwart Russian advances.Moscow's defense ministry announced the ""liberation"" of five villages in Kharkiv near the Russian border, along with the seizure of one village in the Donetsk region.This offensive follows Russia's reported incursion into the Kharkiv region, marking small advancements into a border zone from which it had been repelled nearly two years ago.President Zelenskyy, in a televised address, emphasized the imperative of disrupting Russian offensive plans, labeling it as the country's top priority. Heavy fighting has been reported in the border area, prompting the evacuation of 1,775 individuals. Tragically, two men were killed and two others wounded by guided aerial bomb attacks in the town of Vovchansk.Despite assurances from Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov that there is currently no imminent ground operation threat to the city of Kharkiv, residents from border areas have fled in fear. Evacuees, many of whom are elderly, have sought refuge at reception centers near Kharkiv, receiving essential assistance.The situation remains precarious, with aid workers highlighting the challenges of evacuating residents amid ongoing troop movements and heightened danger. Zelenskyy reiterated the urgent need for international support, stressing the importance of timely arms deliveries to bolster Ukrainian defenses.Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks inside Russia and Russia-held territories, targeting energy infrastructure. In a retaliatory strike, a missile hit a restaurant in the Russian-held city of Donetsk, claiming three lives and injuring several others.Analysts speculate that Russia's ground operation aims to establish a buffer zone near its Belgorod region or divert Ukrainian resources from the Donetsk region. Despite Washington's announcement of a $400 million military aid package for Ukraine and assurances of its capability to repel fresh Russian campaigns, the situation on the ground remains volatile.","Moscow's defense ministry announced the ""liberation"" of five villages in Kharkiv near the Russian border.

Michael Cohen testifies he and Trump worked to suppress news that would hurt 2016 campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/michael-cohen-testifies-he-and-trump-worked-to-suppress-news-that-would-hurt-2016-campaign/articleshow/110098258.cms,"Cohen is frequent Trump target

NEW YORK: Donald Trump 's estranged former lawyer Michael Cohen told jurors on Monday that he conspired with the Republican presidential candidate and a tabloid publisher to suppress negative stories that could damage his 2016 campaign, as prosecutors aim to prove that Trump illegally hid a hush money payment to a porn star.Cohen said he learned from the National Enquirer in June 2016 - a month before the Republican National Convention - that former Playboy model Karen McDougal was shopping a story about a year-long affair she said she and Trump had.""Make sure it doesn't get released,"" Cohen recalled Trump saying.Trump and David Pecker, the tabloid's publisher, had already agreed that Pecker would use the newspaper to boost Trump's presidential candidacy while suppressing any negative stories that could hurt his chances, Cohen testified.Cohen described a phone call in which Pecker told Trump that the Enquirer would need to pay $150,000 to lock down McDougal's story.""To which Mr. Trump replied, 'No problem, I'll take care of it,'"" Cohen said.Pecker previously testified at the trial about his role in killing McDougal's story.Once one of Trump's most loyal lieutenants, Cohen is the prosecution's star witness as the trial enters its fifth week in New York state criminal court in Manhattan. Cohen's $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, intended to keep her from speaking publicly about a 2006 sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, is at the center of the case.Prosecutors have said the Daniels payment was part of a broader ""catch and kill"" scheme between Trump, Cohen and Pecker to pay off people, such as McDougal, with potentially negative stories about Trump in violation of campaign finance laws.When Trump was preparing to announce his campaign for president, Cohen said, Trump told him that there would be ""a lot of women coming forward.""Trump is accused of hiding the Daniels payment by reimbursing Cohen with a phony legal retainer fee that was falsely recorded in Trump's real estate company's records. Prosecutors say the altered business records covered up election-law and tax-law violations that elevate the 34 counts Trump faces from misdemeanors to felonies punishable by up to four years in prison.For nearly a decade, Cohen, 57, worked as an executive and lawyer for Trump's company and once said he would take a bullet for Trump, a Republican former president trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in this year's Nov. 5 U.S. election.Cohen said it was fair to describe his role as a fixer for Trump, testifying that he took care of ""whatever he wanted."" Rather than work as a traditional corporate lawyer, Cohen reported directly to Trump and was never part of the Trump Organization's general counsel's office.Among his duties was renegotiating bills from business partners, threatening to sue people and planting positive stories in the press, he said.Trump, he said, communicated primarily by phone or in person and never set up an email address.""He would comment that emails are like written papers, that he knows too many people who have gone down as a direct result of having emails that prosecutors can use in a case,"" Cohen said.Trump offered him a job in 2007, after Cohen presented Trump with a $100,000 bill from his then-law firm for work done for one of Trump's companies.""I was honored. I was taken by surprise, and I agreed,"" Cohen said, adding that Trump never paid the bill.Trump sat slouched in his chair with his eyes closed and lips pursed throughout Cohen's testimony, occasionally shifting his head from side to side.Cohen, who served as Trump's personal lawyer after his presidential term began in 2017, broke with him when federal prosecutors probing Trump's 2016 presidential campaign focused on Cohen. He has become one of Trump's most outspoken critics, frequently disparaging him on social media and on podcasts.On Friday, Justice Juan Merchan urged prosecutors to tell Cohen to stop making public statements about the case after defense lawyer Todd Blanche said Cohen had posted on social media while wearing a T-shirt showing Trump behind bars.Trump has pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts and denies having had a sexual encounter with Daniels. He argues the case is a politically motivated attempt to interfere with his campaign.Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to violating federal campaign finance law by paying off Daniels and testified that Trump directed him to make the payment. Federal prosecutors did not charge Trump with any crime.Trump's defense lawyers have told the 12 jurors and six alternates that Cohen acted on his own when paying Daniels, seeking to distance Trump from the payments at the heart of the case.Cohen has admitted to lying under oath multiple times, providing substantial fodder for the defense to undermine his credibility.He has acknowledged lying to the U.S. Congress in 2017 about a Trump Organization real estate project in Moscow, but has since said he did so to protect Trump.He also pleaded guilty to violating tax law in 2018, but now claims he did not commit that crime.Cohen has been on the receiving end of Trump's vitriolic social media attacks, some of which the judge has said violated a gag order restricting Trump from making statements about witnesses, jurors and families of the judge and prosecutors if meant to interfere with the case.Trump has called the gag order a violation of his right to free speech and has said it is unfair to bar him from responding to attacks by witnesses such as Cohen and Daniels.Merchan has fined Trump $10,000 for repeated violations and warned the former president he could face time in jail if he keeps up his attacks.The case is widely seen as less consequential than three other criminal prosecutions Trump faces, but it is the only one certain to go to trial before the election.The other cases charge Trump with trying to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat and mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Trump pleaded not guilty to all three.","Cohen said he learned from the National Enquirer in June 2016 that former Playboy model Karen McDougal was shopping a story about a year-long affair she said she and Trump had. Trump and David Pecker, the tabloid's publisher, had already agreed that Pecker would use the newspaper to boost Trump's presidential candidacy while suppressing any negative stories.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110098426,imgsize-124234,width-400,resizemode-4/110098426.jpg"
US energy panel approves rule to expand transmission of renewable power,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-energy-panel-approves-rule-to-expand-transmission-of-renewable-power/articleshow/110094538.cms,"WASHINGTON: Federal energy regulators on Monday approved a long-awaited rule to make it easier to transmit renewable energy such as wind and solar power to the electric grid - a key part of President Joe Biden 's goal to eliminate carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050.The rule, under development for two years, is aimed at boosting the nation's aging power grid to meet surging demand fueled by huge data centers, electrification of vehicles and buildings, artificial intelligence and other uses.The increased demand comes as coal-fired power plants continue to be retired amid competition from natural gas, and other energy sources face increasingly strict federal pollution rules, setting up what experts say could be a crisis for electric reliability.The grid is also being tested by more frequent service disruptions during extreme weather events driven by climate change.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the new rule, 2-1, with Chairman Willie Phillips and fellow Democratic commissioner Allison Clements voting in favor. Republican Mark Christie opposed the rule, dismissing it as a gift to solar and wind power operators.The sprawling, 1,300-page rule, which addresses transmission planning and cost allocations, will enhance the country's aging grid and ensure US homes and businesses keep the lights on for decades to come, Phillips said.""This rule cannot come fast enough,'' he said at a packed commission meeting at the agency's Washington headquarters. ""Our grid cannot wait.''The US power grid ""is at a make-or-break moment'' and is being tested every day, Phillips said, citing ""phenomenal load-growth from a domestic manufacturing boom, unprecedented construction of data centers fueling an AI revolution and ever-expanding electrification"" of vehicles and buildings.At the same time, aging infrastructure, shifting economics and a range of state and federal policies are leading traditional resources to retire, he said. ""On top of all of this, extreme weather events have become the norm, and the electric grid is routinely being pushed to the brink.''At the same time, construction of high-voltage power lines declined to a record low in 2022, ""and much of that construction was simply Band-Aid fixes, rather than building a visionary grid of the future,'' Phillips said.Many power companies and Republican-led states don't want to spend money on new transmission lines or upgrades for renewable energy, creating conflicts with Democratic states that have ambitious clean-energy goals.Christie, the lone Republican on the three-member panel, said the rule ""utterly fails to protect consumers″ and ensure reliable, low-priced power for American homes and businesses.""Instead, this rule is a pretext to enact a sweeping policy agenda that Congress never passed,″ he said. The rule will likely result in ""a massive transfer of wealth from consumers to for-profit special interests,″ primarily wind and solar operators, he said.The rule is intended to streamline how power lines are sited and how costs are shared between states. It could accelerate construction of new transmission lines for wind, solar and other renewable power and add huge amounts of clean energy to the grid. Biden has set a goal of a carbon-free power sector by 2035, and net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050.To meet those targets, the US needs to more than double current regional transmission capacity and increase by five-fold the transmission lines between regions, according to an energy department study last year.Under current rules, a large queue of utility-scale renewables cannot be connected to the grid because of a lack of available transmission capacity. The rule updates the agency's planning process and seeks to determine how costs will be divided when transmission crosses state lines and goes through multiple operators of regional power grids.White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said the FERC rule adds momentum to what he called the ″historic progress″ led by Biden on clean energy. The new rule ""will improve regional transmission planning, break down barriers to grid buildout and support the delivery of more affordable and reliable power,″ Zaidi said,The new rule ""is as common-sense as it is historic,'' Clements said, adding that it calls for more advanced planning and consideration of reliability and affordability of new power sources and fosters cooperation with states.""Whether you're planning a family vacation or the nation's electricity system, planning early, taking a clear-eyed view of the options and making smart investment decisions will result in more affordable and reliable outcomes,'' she said.Christie challenged the agency action.Whether the policies promoted in the final rule ""can be described as green, purple, red or blue is irrelevant,'' Christie said. ""The point is that FERC as an independent agency has no business promoting the policies of any one party or presidential administration, especially when the effort to do so goes far beyond FERC's legal authority.''Clements responded by calling the rule ""straight down the middle'' as a legal matter.Democrats and clean-energy advocates hailed the new rule as a way to bring clean and cost-effective electricity onto the grid.""Building more multi-state transmission lines unclogs the traffic jams on America's electricity superhighways and unlocks our ability to keep up with our growing energy needs,'' said Heather O'Neill, president and CEO of Advanced Energy United, which represents renewable providers.Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, senator from New York, said the rule will build on clean-energy incentives in the landmark climate law approved by Democrats in 2022.The law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, has been ""a huge success,'' Schumer said Monday, ""but much of that success would be lost without the ability to bring power from places that generate renewable energy to communities all across the country.'' FERC's actions ""will mean more low-cost, reliable clean energy for the places that need it most,'' he said.","The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the new rule, 2-1. The rule is intended to streamline how power lines are sited and how costs are shared between states.

After the initial crackdown failed to end the encampment, Wisconsin-Madison later came to an agreement with protesters to break down the camp voluntarily before commencement ceremonies over the weekend.Mark Mone, chancellor of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said in a statement Wednesday that the university had exercised ""the widest possible amount of patience and restraint."" But he also indicated that patience had nearly run out, and warned that the school might take action.Under the agreement with the group of protesters, known as the UWM Popular University for Palestine Coalition, the university pledged to join calls for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas; denounce the destruction by Israeli forces of schools and universities in the Gaza Strip; and meet with protest leaders over their concerns about university investments.The university also agreed to encourage the Water Council, a Milwaukee consortium of water technology companies, to cut ties with two Israeli government-owned entities: Mekorot and the Israel Innovation Authority.

Donald Trump: Chinese migrants forming an 'army' in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-chinese-migrants-forming-an-army-in-us/articleshow/110090167.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former President Donald Trump has stirred controversy with claims that Chinese migrants are forming an ""army"" in the United States, a statement that has sparked fears and debates across the nation. ""They’re coming in from China — 31, 32,000 over the last few months — and they’re all military age and they mostly are men,"" Trump declared during a campaign rally .""And it sounds like to me, are they trying to build a little army in our country?""Amid these alarming assertions, Trump's stance on immigration continues to be stringent, advocating for aggressive policies aimed at curtailing what he perceives as a threat. His proposed measures include the reinstatement of the ""remain in Mexico"" policy and the Covid-era Title 42 policy, allowing swift expulsion of migrants. Furthermore, Trump has indicated a readiness to employ the National Guard and potentially federal troops to detain and deport illegal immigrants aggressively.Trump has said he will seek to detain all migrants caught crossing the border illegally or violating other immigration laws, ending what he calls ""catch and release.""Trump focused on building a wall on the Mexico border during his first term and has pledged to close gaps in the border wall if reelected. His administration built 450 miles (725 km) of barriers across the 1,954-mile (3,145-km) border, but much of that replaced existing structures.Trump would introduce a border security and immigration bill as one of the first pieces of legislation, a Time report said.With over 37,000 Chinese nationals arrested at the US-Mexico border in 2023, the influx is notable, but officials like Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell label them as ""economic migrants,"" underlining the absence of evidence to support Trump’s claims of an impending threat.However, Contrary to Trump's portrayal, the actual situation of Chinese immigrants in local communities like Flushing, New York, tells a starkly different story. Early mornings in Flushing see individuals like Wang Gang, a 36-year-old immigrant, and others, gathering in hopes of securing day labor to sustain themselves. Many of these migrants have faced hardship and unemployment, despite having arrived months ago.Wang, who journeyed from Wuhan, China, to the US border, expressed a sentiment common among his peers, countering Trump’s militarization narrative: ""We came here to make money,"" he said, emphasizing the economic motives behind their migration. These migrants often flee from poverty or political repression in China, seeking better opportunities in the US rather than engaging in any form of organized aggression.With over 37,000 Chinese nationals arrested at the US-Mexico border in 2023, the influx is notable, but officials like Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell label them as ""economic migrants,"" underlining the absence of evidence to support Trump’s claims of an impending threat.As the discourse unfolds, Asian advocacy groups worry about the potential for increased harassment and violence toward the Asian community, exacerbated by such inflammatory rhetoric. The real-life struggles of these migrants, striving for a semblance of stability and safety, remain overshadowed by the specter of political narratives.(With inputs from agencies)","Former President Donald Trump has stirred controversy with claims that Chinese migrants are forming an ""army"" in the United States. Trump's stance on immigration continues to be stringent, advocating for aggressive policies aimed at curtailing what he perceives as a threat. Contrary to Trump's portrayal, the actual situation of Chinese immigrants in local communities like Flushing, New York, tells a starkly different story.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110091715,imgsize-1024527,width-400,resizemode-4/110091715.jpg"

So, we expect to have a discussion of the full range of risks, but wouldn't prejudge any specifics at this point,"" a senior administration official told reporters ahead of the meeting when asked if the US would prioritize the nuclear weapons issue.China's rapid deployment of AI capabilities across civilian, military and national security sectors often undermined the security of the US and its allies, the official said, adding the talks would allow Washington to directly communicate its concerns.""To be very clear, talks with Beijing are not focused on promoting any form of technical collaboration or cooperating on frontier research in any matter.

61% of Asian Americans feel hate towards them rising: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/61-of-asian-americans-feel-hate-towards-them-rising-study/articleshow/110089869.cms,"The Asian American Foundation published a report revealing a significant discrepancy between the general public's perception of hate towards Asian Americans and the reality experienced by the community itself.The STAATUS Index 2024 is a comprehensive study that examines the evolving perceptions of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians , and Pacific Islanders (AANHPIs) in the United States.The survey, which included 6,272 participants from across the country, aims to identify the most pressing issues faced by the AANHPI community .“Since its debut in 2021, the STAATUS Index has uncovered hidden perceptions and stereotypes that have given rise to racism against AANHPIs throughout our long history in the US and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Unless we understand and continue to struggle against these deeply rooted views, theywill persist and threaten the wellbeing of AANHPIs when the next crisis emerges,” said Dr Paul Watanabe, AAC ChairDespite only one-third of Americans believing that hate towards Asian Americans has increased, the AANHPI community reports alarming instances of discrimination and violence. Over the past 12 months, 32% of Asian Americans have been called a slur, and 29% have experienced verbal harassment or abuse. These numbers are even higher for certain subgroups, such as Southeast Asian Americans, who report higher incidences of being called a racial slur (40%), verbal harassment or abuse (39%), and threats of physical assault (22%). Furthermore, a significant portion of Asian Americans fear becoming victims of physical attacks (41%) or discrimination (59%) in the near future due to their race, ethnicity, or religion.The study also highlights the impact of discrimination, violence, and lack of representation on the AANHPI community's sense of belonging and acceptance. Only 38% of Asian Americans completely agree that they belong, and an even smaller percentage (18%) feel fully accepted for their racial identity in the US Social media (34%), workplaces, neighborhoods, and educational institutions (31%) are identified as the least welcoming environments for those who do not feel fully accepted or do not fully belong.To address these issues, the study emphasizes the need to break the ""STAATUS quo"" and advocate for and celebrate AANHPI stories beyond Heritage Month. The study also revealed a trend of rising doubts about Asian Americans' loyalty to the US, with 79% of respondents being unsure or in agreement that Asian Americans are more loyal to their countries of origin than to the United States.The lack of awareness and representation of the AANHPI community is evident in the findings, with a majority of Americans (55%) unable to name a single event or policy related to Asian Americans, and more than half (52%) unable to name a famous Asian American. When asked about their favorite movies featuring Asian American characters, half of the respondents (50%) could not name any, despite expressing a desire to see more Asian Americans in dramas (59%) and comedies (60%).To decrease racism, the top three ideas proposed by the study include teaching the history of Asian Americans in K-12 schools and colleges (41%), increasing the visibility of Asian Americans in American society (41%), and providing more opportunities for interaction with Asian Americans (39%). By implementing these measures and raising awareness about the challenges faced by the AANHPI community, the study aims to foster a more inclusive and equitable society for all.Axios also corroborated some of the above findings stating that their survey reveals a stark contrast in perceptions regarding hate crimes against Asian Americans. The majority of the general American population believes that such incidents are decreasing. However, the Asian American community holds a different view. The survey found that ""1 in 3 reported being the subject of hate this past year.""Meanwhile, another recent study conducted by TAAF in March revealed alarming findings regarding the safety of Asian American adults in New York City. The survey, which included a representative sample of 1,000 Asian American adults aged 16 and above, found that ""1 in 5 Asian American adults in New York City reported being physically assaulted in the past 12 months.""","The STAATUS Index 2024 is a comprehensive study that examines the evolving perceptions of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders in the United States.

Pakistan clears cash to calm PoK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-clears-cash-to-calm-pok/articleshow/110093460.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif approved Monday around $82.6 million (Pak Rs 2,300cr) for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to halt violent protests and strikes against escalating electricity tariffs , flour prices and taxes. The protests have left a police officer dead and 90 others, mostly cops, injured in the last few days.The growing unrest poses a grave challenge to Pakistan’s military, which maintains a significant presence in the region to guard the Line of Control with India.On Monday, protesters led by Awami Action Committee (AAC), an activist group that has united people to demand lower rates for essentials, continued a march to regional capital Muzaffarabad after negotiations with the govt ended in deadlock.The stalemate prompted PM Sharif, already under pressure over postponement of Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman’s crucial visit to Pakistan later this month, to clear the grant for PoK at a special meeting in Islamabad. The meeting was attended by PoK’s PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, local ministers and other top figures. Following the meeting, PoK PM Haq announced cuts in bread prices and electricity tariffs.Meanwhile, mobile and internet services suspended in PoK a day earlier have not been restored in most parts. Govt offices, markets, trade centres and educational institutes also remained shut.Although there have been no calls for independence in the current wave of turmoil, locals said the protests reflected a general feeling of discontent with Islamabad. In the past, Islamabad had come under fire for suppressing regional movements that demanded total independence.The recent crisis began Friday when AAC started a Muzaffarabad strike that soon snowballed into violent clashes with law-enforcement officials. The detention of over 70 activists fuelled the unrest. The movement announced its march on Muzaffarabad after talks between AAC’s core committee and PoK’s chief secretary, Dawood Bareach, in Rawalakot ended inconclusively.PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari vowed to address the “genuine demands” of protesters, urging all to exercise restraint and resolve issues through dialogue.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif approved around $82.6 million (Pak Rs 2,300cr) for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to halt violent protests and strikes.

The Saudi ministers, seemingly, have convinced the crown prince that political situation in Pakistan is not stable, tensions run high between the military and jailed ex-PM Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), and it would be unwise for him to visit the country in the current situation,” said Shehbaz Gill , a PTI functionary and Imran’s former principal staff officer.Last month, PTI functionary Sher Afzal Marwat had alleged that Saudi Arabia was a “conduit” in the US-led operation to oust Imran’s govt in April 2022. Following his claim, PTI removed him from its core and political committee, also issuing a show-cause for trying to harm relations with Saudi Arabia.Recently, Marwat blamed the “Saudi influence” for his party dropping his name for chairmanship of public accounts committee (PAC) of parliament.While foreign ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said the revised schedule of the visit is still being worked out, govt sources maintained that there were some points on the economic front that still needed to be cleared between both sides before MBS finalised his tour.They said Saudi investors and businessmen, who recently toured Pakistan, are interested in some projects but the terms of the agreement have not yet been finalised.PM Shehbaz Sharif had extended an invitation to the crown prince to visit Pakistan during his official tour to Saudi Arabia.

IMF doubts Pakistan's ability to repay debts as support team arrives in Islamabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-doubts-pakistans-ability-to-repay-debts-as-support-team-arrives-in-islamabad/articleshow/110028404.cms,"NEW DELHI: International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed serious concerns about Pakistan's ability to repay its debts, particularly to the global lender itself. The IMF 's assessment came as its support team arrived in Pakistan on Friday to discuss a new bailout package under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), following Islamabad's request.The IMF staff report, issued earlier this month, stated that ""Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund is subject to significant risks and remains critically dependent on policy implementation and timely external financing."" The report further highlighted the exceptionally high risks that could jeopardize policy implementation and erode repayment capacity and debt sustainability, including delayed adoption of reforms, high public debt and gross financing needs, low gross reserves, the State Bank of Pakistan's net FX derivative position, a decline in inflows, and sociopolitical factors.The report emphasized that restoring external viability is crucial for ensuring Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund, which depends on strong policy implementation, including external asset accumulation and exchange rate flexibility. Geopolitical instability was also mentioned as an additional source of risk, despite some reduction in uncertainty surrounding global financial conditions since the last review.According to the IMF, Pakistan requires gross financing of USD 123 billion over the next five years, with the country expected to seek USD 21 billion in fiscal year 2024-25, USD 23 billion in 2025-26, USD 22 billion in 2026-27, USD 29 billion in 2027-28, and USD 28 billion in 2028-29.Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the IMF support team will discuss the first phase of the next long-term loan programme with Pakistan's financial team, focusing on data collection from various departments and discussions on the upcoming budget for the fiscal year 2025 (FY2025) with the Ministry of Finance officials. The team is expected to stay in Pakistan for over 10 days.Pakistan has decided to seek a rollover of around USD 12 billion in debt from key allies like China in the 2024-25 fiscal year to address the USD 23 billion gap in its external financing. The Finance Ministry insiders stated that USD 5 billion from Saudi Arabia, USD 3 billion from the UAE, and USD 4 billion from China will be rolled over, with estimates of further new financing from China to be included in the next financial year's budget.The country is expected to receive more than USD 1 billion from the IMF under the fresh loan programme, along with new financing from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. The federal government aims to achieve budget targets before the anticipated arrival of the IMF review mission in Pakistan, with negotiations for a new loan programme expected to commence in mid-May, ahead of the budget presentation in June.Despite narrowly avoiding default last summer and experiencing some economic stabilization, Pakistan continues to face high fiscal shortfalls and stagnating growth, with the external account deficit being controlled through import control mechanisms at the expense of economic growth, which is expected to be around 2 per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","IMF has expressed serious concerns about Pakistan's ability to repay its debts, particularly to the global lender itself.

Instead, Bilawal emphasized the importance of making wheat purchases mandatory.However, some insiders had previously revealed that the ruling PML-N and PPP were close to finalizing a power-sharing agreement, with Bilawal likely to return as the country's foreign minister for the second time. They claimed that Bilawal, who was initially hesitant to join the cabinet, had agreed to take on the role of foreign minister. The two parties were reportedly working on the details and timing of the PPP's formal induction into the federal cabinet.Earlier this month, the premier and Bilawal met at the PM's House to finalize the names of governors for Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan. An official statement indicated that they discussed the overall political situation in the country.Despite the prime minister and other parties in the ruling coalition wanting the PPP to join the cabinet, a PPP leader maintained that the party leadership had not yet decided to change its previous stance on the matter. The leader described the reports suggesting that the PPP would join the cabinet after the budget as ""speculative,"" stating that no such discussion had taken place during the meetings between the two sides.","Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), has decided not to join Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's federal cabinet.

Pakistan rights body voices concern over increasing 'political polarisation',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-rights-body-voices-concern-over-increasing-political-polarisation/articleshow/109978365.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed concerns over increasing political polarisation in the country, resulting in greater restrictions on civil and political rights, Pakistan-based Dawn reported. The HRCP demanded economic justice and protection of civil rights and stressed the importance of upholding democratic principles and the rule of law.In its annual report, 'State of Human Rights 2023', released on Wednesday, the HRCP noted with concern that irreparable political divisions led to public acts of arson and violence on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan.""What followed was flagrant disregard for the Constitution as unelected forces tightened their grip on the country's democratic structures and civic spaces shrank to an all-time low,"" the report read, according to Dawn.According to the report, the state's response to the May 9 riots was to quell dissent by resurrecting military courts to try civilians, perpetrating enforced disappearances, ordering mass arrests and allegedly orchestrating public disassociation from the PTI among many senior party leaders.The report noted that the right to freedom of expression and assembly took a particular hit during the year. According to the report, the rule of law was poor, with six-year high in fatalities related to terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations. The report noted that the practice of extrajudicial killings continued while street crime and the incidence of mob lynchings witnessed a rise.According to the report, journalists, activists and political workers were subjected to enforced disappearances across the country, like what happened in previous years, Dawn reported. The report noted that young Baloch women held a long march from Turbat to Islamabad to protest against alleged extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.The report said that religious minorities reported an increasing climate of fear, particularly following the attack in Jaranwala, in which scores of churches and homes were torched and looted by mobs after allegations of blasphemy against a Christian man.The report said that Afghan nationals were rounded up in police raids and sent to deportation centres. Speaking at the launch of the report, HRCP secretary-general Harris Khalique said the economic crisis in 2023 had 'pushed tens of millions of ordinary citizens to the brink of desperation.'Speaking on incidents of enforced disappearances, Harris Khalique condemned the role and performance of the Commission of Inquiry of Enforced Disappearances and termed it 'disgraceful,' Dawn reported.HRCP chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt called it critical for the state to fulfil people's rights to education, livelihood and health. He also expressed concern over the low rate of trade unionisation. HRCP Islamabad Vice-Chair Nasreen Azhar said religion continued to be 'weaponized for political purposes'.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed concerns over increasing political polarisation in the country.

Bangladesh court limits solitary for death row inmates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-court-limits-solitary-for-death-row-inmates/articleshow/110085680.cms,"DHAKA: A Bangladesh court ruled Monday that death row prisoners could not be held in solitary confinement until their appeals had been exhausted, in what lawyers called a major rights victory for inmates.More than 2,500 convicts in the South Asian nation have been sentenced to death, with most kept in solitary ""condemned cells"" for years on end.Rights activists say the practice is severely detrimental to the mental health of prisoners, who can spend up to 20 years in the cells while appealing their sentences through the country's glacial legal system.The High Court ruled that death row prisoners could only be kept in solitary once they had worked through all their avenues for legal appeals .""It is a landmark verdict,"" Mohammad Shishir Manir, a lawyer for three prisoners who challenged the practice, told AFP.""It means from now on no prisoner can be kept in a condemned cell in solitary confinement just after a trial court verdict.""Manir said that around half of Bangladesh's death row prisoners have historically been exonerated on appeal.""By the time these prisoners are released, they no longer behave like a normal human being. Many suffer from mental problems. Some have major health issues,"" he said.The court gave Bangladesh's chronically overcrowded prisons two years to shift all death row inmates to general wards.The number of death row prisoners has spiked in recent years as hundreds of convicted Islamist extremists have been handed capital sentences in the Muslim-majority nation.Executions remain relatively rare given the size of Bangladesh's death row population, with 20 people hanged since 2018, according to the country's leading rights group Odhikar.""For years we have raised voice over the plight of these death row convicts, whose rights were heavily compromised in the prisons,"" independent rights activist Rezaur Rahman Lenin told AFP.""This is just one step in the right direction,"" he added.
