This dialogue has allowed us to build a deeper awareness of our respective interests,"" Albanese said in opening remarks.Australia and China had complementary economies and shared interests in addressing climate change, he said.""We also have our differences… that's why candid dialogue is so important. For Australia, we consistently advocate the importance of a region and world that is peaceful, stable and prosperous, where countries respect sovereignty and abide by international laws,"" he said.After the meeting, Li told reporters the leaders held a ""candid, in-depth and fruitful meeting and reached a lot of consensus"".""We both agreed to uphold the right characterisation of ourbilateral relationship and consolidate its momentum...and handling this relationship in a positive attitude,"" he said.The two countries would expand cooperation in energy and mining, and China would include Australia in its visa waiver programme, he added.""We both stressed the importance of maintaining communication and coordination to jointly safeguard peace and prosperity in the region and beyond,"" he said.Foreign Minister Penny Wong said earlier in a radio interview that Australia and the United States worked through the QUAD partnership with Japan and India, and the AUKUS defence agreement with Britain, to ""ensure we have a safer and more stable region"", she said.China has criticised the QUAD and AUKUS as efforts to contain it.Protesters and supporters gathered on Monday morning on the lawn outside parliament house in Canberra, where there was a heavy police presence, as a ceremonial welcome was held for Li.Barricades separated Tibetan, Uyghur, Hong Kong and Falun Gong protesters from a large contingent of pro-China supporters.Tibetan Tenzin Wougyal, 37, a Canberra resident, said he came to show Tibet's culture, religion and language are at risk.""Australia should be cautious about what it is doing — don't sacrifice human rights for short term economic business,"" he said.Tan Zhu, 50, said he travelled from Sydney to welcome Li, and was also at Canberra airport when he arrived.""The relationship with Australia has become much better. That's very positive,"" he said.Beginning with some panda and wine diplomacy on Sunday, Li is on a four-day visit which the Chinese leader said showed bilateral relations were ""back on track"".Without China - which receives one-third of Australia's exports and supplies one-fourth of Australia's imports - Australians would pay 4.2% more for consumer items, the Australia China Business Council said on Monday.Trade between Australia and China reached A$327 billion ($215.95 billion) last year as Beijing's trade blocks eased.Australia is the biggest supplier of iron ore to China and China has been an investor in Australian mining projects.Li's visit will likely raise the issue of whether Australia will continue to accept high levels of Chinese investment in its critical minerals sector, as Western security allies push to reduce reliance on Beijing for the rare earths vital to electric vehicles. Australia last month blocked several Chinese investors from increasing stakes in a rare earths miner on national interest grounds.Albanese has said he would raise human rights issues in his talks with Li, including the case of China-born Australian writer Yang Hengjun, whose suspended death sentence was upheld by a Beijing court, his supporters said.They urged Albanese to ask Li to allow Yang's transfer to Australia on medical grounds, saying in a statement it was ""not possible to achieve a stable, respectful bilateral relationship with China while their officials are threatening to execute an Australian political prisoner "".",China's Premier Li Qiang is in Australia for the first time in seven years.

QUITO: Ecuadorian authorities on Sunday reported that a devastating landslide in the city of Banos de Agua Santa, located in the central region of the country, claimed the lives of at least six individuals and left an additional 30 people unaccounted for, based on initial assessments.

The Ecuadorean Secretariat for Risk Management characterised the landslide as being of ""large-magnitude"" in their report. Roberto Luque, Ecuador 's minister of public works, expressed his condolences on the social media platform X, stating, ""My solidarity with all the families that have been affected.""

The landslide was triggered by a severe rainstorm caused by low pressure that affected various regions of Central and South America on Sunday. Several countries issued warnings about the heightened risks of landslides, rock falls, and flooding due to the inclement weather conditions.

In response to the heavy rainfall, El Salvador's civil protection agency declared a red alert throughout the small nation. Meanwhile, in neighboring Guatemala, the ministry of communications, infrastructure and housing reported that several airlines had to divert flights as a precautionary measure.

Why a 3-legged lion and its brother swam across a crocodile-filled river,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/why-a-3-legged-lion-and-its-brother-swam-across-a-crocodile-filled-river/articleshow/111046218.cms,"SURVIVAL: Researchers say the two male lions swam nearly a full mile across the Kazinga Channel, the longest by big cats ever recorded. The reason: Sex. Uganda’s national park’s lion population has fallen to around 40 today from 71 lions in 2018 with males outnumbering females 2 to 1

On a dark night in Feb, two male lions stood in the shallows of the Kazinga Channel in Queen Elizabeth National Park, in Uganda, and looked across the water. Nearly a mile away was the shore on the other side. Hippos and 16-foot crocodiles inhabit the channel, which can be 20 feet deep in places. Barely 12 hours earlier, the two males had lost a battle for territory and were lucky to still be alive. Remaining on this side of the channel was dangerous, and they could probably hear the roars of female lions in the distance.

As with many cat species, lions don't like to swim. And one of the lions, known as Jacob by researchers, has only three legs. He lost a limb in a poacher's trap in 2020. But neither Jacob nor his brother, Tibu, were deterred. The two big cats set out for what the researchers call the longest-recorded swim ever taken by lions. The lions struggled on their first three tries to cross. During the second attempt, the drone that was tracking them picked up a large thermal signature that may have been a crocodile or a hippo in pursuit; the two male lions split into a Y formation before hurrying back to shore. Less than an hour after their first attempt, the two set out again for a third time. The path seemed clear and they kept going until they crossed the channel. ""It was pretty dramatic,"" said Alexander Braczkowski, a conservation biologist who has been studying the lions since 2017.

Lions have been observed swimming in Okavango Delta in Botswana, but rarely farther than 150 feet. In 2012, a lion swam around 330 feet across the Zambezi River, from Zimbabwe to Zambia. In Nov 2023, a young male lion swam across the Rufiji River in Tanzania, crossing as much as 985 feet of water.

But Braczkowski estimated that the two lions swam nearly a full mile. Why would lions make such a dangerous crossing? ""Sex,"" said Craig Packer, who ran the Serengeti Lion Project for 35 years. ""If there's nobody to mate with, what are you doing?"" According to Braczkowski, the park's lion population has fallen to around 40 today from 71 lions in 2018, with at least 17 lions, mostly females, poisoned by nearby residents aiming to protect their livestock. Males outnumber females 2 to 1. ""These males and these swimming events are a symptom of this problem.""

Marine Le Pen: Ready to work alongside Macron,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/marine-le-pen-ready-to-work-alongside-macron/articleshow/111046211.cms,"Marine Le Pen

Marine Le Pen , the leader of the French far-right , said she won't try to push out President Macron if she wins the snap parliamentary election that begins later this month. ""I'm respectful of institutions, and I'm not calling for institutional chaos,"" Le Pen told Le Figaro newspaper. ""There will simply be cohabitation.""

Le Pen is seeking to appeal to mainstream voters as she aims to cement a majority in the next parliament. Her group, the National Rally, is already on track to become the biggest party, a prospect which has caused alarm among investors and France's international partners. Le Pen said that if she can form a majority - either with National Rally lawmakers alone, or with allies - she would lead her party's parliamentary caucus and 28-year-old party leader Jordan Bardella will become PM. The two-round election concludes on July 7.

Le Pen's party is on course to win as many as 270 of the 577 seats in the National Assembly, according to a projection by pollster Elabe, with 289 required for an absolute majority. Macron and his allies are projected to win between 90 and 130.

'Unaware' Netanyahu slams military's tactical pauses plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/unaware-netanyahu-slams-militarys-tactical-pauses-plan/articleshow/111046202.cms,"Israeli PM Netanyahu criticised plans announced by the military on Sunday to hold daily tactical pauses in fighting along one of the main roads into Gaza to facilitate aid delivery into the Palestinian enclave.

The military had announced the daily pauses from 0500 GMT until 1600 GMT in the area from the Kerem Shalom Crossing to Salah al-Din Road and then northwards. ""When the prime minister heard the reports of an 11-hour humanitarian pause in the morning, he turned to his military secretary and made it clear that this was unacceptable to him,"" an Israeli official said. The military clarified that normal operations would continue in Rafah, the main focus of its operation in southern Gaza.

The strange choreography of the messaging became stranger still when the govt suggested that Netanyahu only learned of the military's plan from news reports. But analysts said it was likely that the prime minister was aware of the plan and that each announcement was tailored to different audiences. The whipsaw statements appeared to reflect the competing pressures facing Netanyahu, as he juggles demands from the Biden administration and elsewhere around the world with those of his own hawkish govt. His far-right coalition partners oppose any concessions in Gaza.

National security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who leads one of the nationalist religious parties in Netanyahu's coalition, denounced the idea of a tactical pause, saying whoever decided it was a ""fool"" who should lose their job. The spat was the latest in a series of clashes between members of the coalition and military over the conduct of the war. It came a week after centrist ex-general Benny Gantz quit the govt, accusing Netanyahu of having no effective strategy in Gaza.

Under the plan, there will be a limited off-the-shelf purchase of the Strykers under the foreign military sales (FMS) programme of the US, which will be followed by joint production in India, and finally there will be co-development of its futuristic versions, sources said.All this, however, is contingent on the Stryker meeting the operational requirements of the Army's mechanised infantry battalions as well as a high level of indigenisation and transfer of critical technologies to the Indian co-production partner, which could be a defence PSU or a private firm.""If the Stryker project is finalised, the existing Indian capabilities in ICVs will be taken into account. Strykers will have to be customised and technologically configured for Indian terrain, including operations in high-altitude areas like eastern Ladakh and Sikkim,"" a source said.With the Army having a huge requirement of futuristic wheeled and tracked ICVs to progressively replace its existing fleet of over 2,000 Russian-origin BMP-II vehicles in the years ahead, MoD is also pursuing indigenous projects. "" Army also needs ICVs capable of amphibious operations in large numbers as well. Strykers are not amphibious,"" another source said.The US is hard-selling the Strykers. Ahead of US national security advisor Jake Sullivan's visit to India, secretary of defence Lloyd J Austin cited the ""co-production of armoured vehicles with India"" as yet another indicator of the upward trajectory in the bilateral defence partnership during the Shangri La dialogue in Singapore two weeks ago. The US, incidentally, has bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth around $22 billion since 2007. While the Stryker project is still in the discussion stage, India and the US are conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for inking two mega deals within this financial year.The first is acquisition of 31 armed MQ-9B high-altitude, long endurance drones and associated equipment for $3.9 billion, as reported by TOI earlier. The second is the co-production of GE-F414 jet engines by General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics for the Tejas Mark-II fighters in India, with 80% transfer of tech for around $1 billion.","India and the US are now in an ""advanced stage of talks"" for the proposed joint manufacture of the latest generation of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles.

According to federal authorities, Prieto's goal was to incite a race war ahead of the upcoming presidential election.The indictment follows an extensive investigation by the FBI, which began in October after a confidential source reported that Prieto had expressed a desire to spark a race war prior to the election. The source, who had interacted with Prieto at various gun shows over a three-year period, told authorities that Prieto's comments had become increasingly alarming, including advocating for a mass shooting targeting Blacks, Jews, or Muslims.Prieto allegedly believed that martial law would be implemented shortly after the 2024 election and that a mass shooting should occur beforehand. He reportedly asked the source if they were ""ready to kill a bunch of people,"" indicating his intention to recruit others to assist in the attack, reports NBC.Prieto, a vendor at gun shows in Prescott, allegedly used cash deals and trades to acquire firearms while evading the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives.During the FBI's surveillance of Prieto from January to March, he revealed his plan to the source and an undercover FBI agent at a gun show in Phoenix. Prieto targeted Atlanta because he believed that as crime worsened in other cities, African Americans had moved there, making it less conservative than in the past.He chose a rap concert due to the expected high concentration of African Americans and planned to leave confederate flags after the shooting to send a message of retaliation. Prieto allegedly wanted to show ""no mercy, no quarter"" and stressed the importance of a high body count.Prieto discussed the types of weapons he intended to use and suggested traveling to Atlanta before the attack to store weapons in the area. He specifically mentioned that the attack should occur after Super Tuesday to ensure the election candidates were known. In February, while under surveillance at another gun show in Phoenix, Prieto allegedly sold a firearm to the undercover agent for $2,000.The case against Prieto highlights the ongoing threat of racially motivated violence and the importance of vigilance and cooperation between law enforcement agencies and the public in preventing such attacks.","Mark Adams Prieto, 58, was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges related to an alleged plot to carry out a mass shooting targeting African Americans at a rap concert in Atlanta.

SpinLaunch revolutionises satellite launch with kinetic energy technology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spinlaunch-revolutionises-satellite-launch-with-kinetic-energy-technology/articleshow/111040576.cms,"NEW DELHI: SpinLaunch is revolutionising satellite launches by utilising a massive rotating arm that harnesses kinetic energy to propel 440-pound satellites into low Earth orbit without the need for rocket fuel . The company has already conducted successful tests, with founder and CEO Jonathan Yaney saying, ""This is not a rocket, and clearly our ability to perform in just 11 months this many tests and have them all function as planned, really is a testament to the nature of our technology."" SpinLaunch aims to launch constellations of satellites at altitudes below 600 miles by 2026.Satellites play a crucial role in monitoring Earth's health, including the detection of polluting methane leaks. A more environmentally friendly method of launching them is an exciting development for the scientific community.The concept of using kinetic energy to launch objects has been employed by humans for centuries, with trebuchets and siege machines being historical examples. Today, pumpkin chucking contests, also known as Punkin Chunkin , continue to be a popular way to demonstrate the principles of kinetic and potential energy physics.SpinLaunch's device resembles a giant upright disc with a cylindrical barrel pointing skyward. The 108-foot-long rotating arm spins at an impressive 5,000 miles per hour to achieve optimal launch conditions, with the vehicle reaching speeds of up to six times the speed of sound. The company attributes its success to advancements in low-cost, high-strength carbon fibre and miniature electronics, which enable satellites to withstand the kinetic launch environment, including a vacuum and rapid acceleration.Since its founding in 2014, SpinLaunch has raised tens of millions of dollars in funding and collaborated with organizations such as Nasa , Airbus, and Cornell University. The technology has demonstrated its resilience by enduring forces up to 10,000 times Earth's gravity. If proven reliable, SpinLaunch's system could significantly reduce the amount of fuel required for spacecraft launches, which is particularly important given the growing concerns about the impact of increasing launch frequencies on the ozone layer.Looking ahead, SpinLaunch plans to establish a coastal orbital launch site to further develop its technology. Yaney expressed confidence in the system's reliability, saying, ""It has proven that it's a system that is repeatedly reliable."" As the company continues to innovate and refine its approach, it has the potential to revolutionise the satellite launch industry while minimising its environmental impact.","SpinLaunch aims to launch constellations of satellites at altitudes below 600 miles by 2026.

US military ran covert anti-vax operation during Covid-19 peak to counter China's influence in Philippines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-military-ran-covert-anti-vax-operation-during-covid-19-peak-to-counter-chinas-influence-in-philippines/articleshow/111036442.cms,"Pandemic had hit Philippines especially hard

NEW DELHI: During the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic , the US military undertook a covert operation to counter China's increasing influence in the Philippines, a country severely impacted by the virus.This clandestine mission, which had not been previously disclosed, aimed to create doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and other life-saving aid provided by China, according to a Reuters investigation. Utilising fake internet accounts that impersonated Filipinos, the military's propaganda turned into an anti-vaccine campaign. Social media posts criticised the quality of face masks, test kits, and China’s Sinovac vaccine, which was the first available in the Philippines.The program was initiated under former President Donald Trump and continued for several months into Joe Biden’s presidency. This was despite concerns expressed by social media executives to the new administration, warning that the Pentagon was spreading Covid misinformation. In spring 2021, the Biden administration issued a directive to halt the anti-vaccine effort, which also targeted vaccines made by other rivals, and the Pentagon commenced an internal review.Reuters claimed to have found at least 300 accounts on X (formerly Twitter) that fit descriptions given by former US military officials familiar with the operation in the Philippines. Most of these accounts were created in the summer of 2020 and revolved around the hashtag #Chinaangvirus, which means 'China is the virus' in Tagalog.“COVID came from China and the VACCINE also came from China, don’t trust China!” one tweet from July 2020 read in Tagalog. The message was next to a photo of a syringe beside a Chinese flag and a rising chart of infections.Another post stated, “From China – PPE, Face Mask, Vaccine: FAKE. But the Coronavirus is real.”After Reuters informed X about the accounts, the social media platform removed them, determining they were part of a coordinated bot campaign based on activity patterns and internal data.The US military's anti-vaccine effort began in the spring of 2020 and spread beyond Southeast Asia before being terminated in mid-2021, Reuters revealed. The campaign adapted its propaganda to local audiences across Central Asia and the Middle East, using fake social media accounts on multiple platforms to incite fear of China’s vaccines among Muslims. A significant part of the strategy was to amplify the controversial claim that, because some vaccines contain pork gelatin, China’s shots might be considered forbidden under Islamic law.The US military is prohibited from using propaganda to target Americans, and no evidence was found that the Pentagon targeted US citizens. Officials for both Trump and Biden did not respond to requests for comments regarding the clandestine program.A senior Defense Department official confirmed the US military engaged in secret propaganda to discredit China’s vaccine in the developing world but refused to provide more details.A Pentagon spokeswoman stated that the US military 'uses a variety of platforms, including social media, to counter those malign influence attacks aimed at the US, allies, and partners.” She added that China had started a 'disinformation campaign to falsely blame the United States for the spread of Covid-19.'In an email, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that the US government has a long history of manipulating social media and spreading misinformation.The Philippine embassy in Washington did not respond to Reuters' inquiries, including whether it was aware of the Pentagon's operation. A spokesperson for the Philippines Department of Health, however, commented, “Findings by Reuters deserve to be investigated and heard by the appropriate authorities of the involved countries.” Some aid workers in the Philippines reacted with outrage upon learning about the U.S. military’s propaganda effort.Upon being briefed by Reuters about the Pentagon’s secret anti-vaccine campaign, some American public health experts condemned the program, arguing it jeopardized civilian lives for potential geopolitical gains. They noted that a campaign designed to win hearts and minds ultimately endangered lives.“I don’t think it’s defensible,” said Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine. “I’m extremely dismayed, disappointed, and disillusioned to hear that the US government would do that,” added Lucey, a former military physician who assisted in the response to the 2001 anthrax attacks.In the wake of the US propaganda efforts, then-Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte expressed frustration over the low vaccination rates among Filipinos and threatened to arrest those who refused to get vaccinated.“You choose, vaccine or I will have you jailed,” Duterte said in a televised address in June 2021, wearing a face mask. “There is a crisis in this country … I’m just exasperated by Filipinos not heeding the government.”When Duterte made these remarks, the Philippines had one of the lowest vaccination rates in Southeast Asia. Only 2.1 million out of its 114 million citizens were fully vaccinated—far below the government’s target of 70 million. By this time, Covid-19 cases had exceeded 1.3 million, and nearly 24,000 Filipinos had died from the virus, contributing to the highest death rate in the region.Some Filipino healthcare professionals and former officials were shocked upon learning about the US anti-vaccine effort, which they believe exploited an already vulnerable population. Public concerns about a Dengue fever vaccine introduced in the Philippines in 2016 had already led to widespread skepticism towards vaccinations in general, said Lulu Bravo, executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination. The Pentagon campaign, she said, preyed on these fears.“Why did you do it when people were dying? We were desperate,” stated Dr. Nina Castillo-Carandang, a former adviser to the World Health Organisation and the Philippines government during the pandemic. “We don’t have our own vaccine capacity,” she said, and noted that the US propaganda effort 'contributed even more salt into the wound.'The campaign also played into longstanding suspicions of China, exacerbated by Beijing’s aggressive actions in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Due to these suspicions, Filipinos were reluctant to trust China’s Sinovac vaccine, which first became available in the country in March 2021, said Esperanza Cabral, a former health secretary under President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Cabral mentioned that she was unaware of the US military’s secret operation.","US military launched covert operation to counter China's influence in the Philippines.

The five years coincide with the full term of the current govt led by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) that took office earlier this year.“People come to us and tell us that if Pakistan has to progress, then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,” Iqbal, the minister for planning and development as well as PML-N secretary-general, said.His comments came hours after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif pledged to rid the country of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying the next deal for a bailout package with the global lender would be the last in Pakistan’s history. IMF ties such loans to tough reform measures.According to Iqbal, if Imran came out of jail, “there would be sit-ins and fights again, which the country cannot afford”. “There is a voice of the people that Imran should remain in jail for five years,” Iqbal said. The minister added that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder was an “angry man” and it wasn’t known with whom he had a quarrel.The minister also made a subtle jab at the legal system by claiming Imran always relied on the “shoulder of the judiciary” for support during trying times. The allusion appeared to be to some court orders that went in favour of Imran in recent times.Asked about confrontation between the judiciary and the military establishment, Iqbal replied: “Both should think whether this is better for the country.”Iqbal recalled the past when politicians used to fight the military and vice versa. “Now we must cooperate for the benefit of the nation because fighting between institutions has put the country’s sovereignty at stake,” the minister said.","Ahsan Iqbal says Imran Khan will have to be kept behind bars for five years.

Legal age for marriage in Pakistan

The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72-year-old man named Habib Khan was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town. While the police managed to arrest the groom and the 'Nikah Khwan' (a person who solemnizes the marriage), the girl's father managed to escape.A case has been registered against the girl's father, the 72-year-old man, and the 'Nikkah Khwan' under the Child Marriage Act , according to ARY News. Despite the existence of laws prohibiting child marriage, such incidents continue to occur in various parts of Pakistan.The girl's father, Alam Syed, had reportedly agreed to sell his daughter to the elderly man for PKR 500,000.In recent times, law enforcement agencies have thwarted similar attempts in Rajanpur and Thatta, where young girls were being coerced into marrying older men. In Rajanpur, Punjab, an 11-year-old girl was set to marry a 40-year-old man, while in Thatta, a young girl was forcibly married to a 50-year-old landlord before the police took action and rescued the girl.In another incident on May 6, a 70-year-old man was arrested by the police for marrying a 13-year-old girl in Swat. The girl's father had arranged the marriage, but the police swiftly took the groom and the father into custody. The 'Nikkah Khwan' and the marriage witnesses were also arrested, and the minor girl was sent to a hospital for a medical examination.In Pakistan, the legal age for marriage differs based on gender. While the internationally recognized minimum age for both males and females is 18, the country's laws allow males to marry at 18 but permit females to wed at the younger age of 16.Although Sindh province took a step towards gender equality in 2013 by passing legislation to raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 for both genders, this progressive change has not been adopted and implemented throughout the nation. The disparity in legal marriage age between men and women persists in other parts of the nation.","The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72- year-old man was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town.

Clash between Pakistan judiciary & military establishment intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/clash-between-pakistan-judiciary-military-establishment-intensifies/articleshow/111007675.cms,"Islamabad: The clash between Pakistan’s superior judiciary and the powerful military establishment has intensified as judges have started questioning the conduct of serving army and Inter-Services Intelligence officers over their blatant interference in judicial matters.Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics such as secret surveillance, and even abduction and torture of their family members, to secure favourable outcomes in political cases related to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party and its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.Addressing an event in the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Friday, Lahore high court chief justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad claimed he has received complaints — many verbally — and letters regarding interference in judicial matters by “institutions” (a reference to the army and ISI).“But I have full faith that this interference of the (military) establishment in the judiciary will come to its end very soon,” he asserted.He said he was saying so not just because it was “part of my faith but also includes my experience”.“To get rid of the (military) establishment’s interference, we have to face it with bravery, courage, and without any fear, and with the belief that this interference, God-willing, will end soon,” the Lahore CJ said. “Temporary worries do come but you have to face them eye to eye and not be a target of any of their blackmailing. Do not be hesitant to make any kind of sacrifice,” he added.Justice Ahmad said Pakistan was currently “going through one of the longest periods of a civil government”, adding that the 2007 lawyers’ movement “closed the doors for martial law forever”.On Wednesday, the Lahore HC had summoned Punjab police chief Usman Anwar and other officials on a complaint from a presiding judge of an anti-terrorism court alleging harassment by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.On June 7, the HC registrar’s office had received a special report on district and sessions judge Muhammad Abbas wherein he had said that on May 25, the first day of his new charge, a message was conveyed to him that some ISI authority wanted to meet him in his chamber.Upon refusing to meet the said authority, Abbas alleged that ever since then he had been encountering various incidents, such as firing outside his court in Punjab’s Sargodha city and questioning of family members, among other things.Earlier, in March, six of the eight Islamabad HC judges had penned a startling letter to Supreme Court judges, regarding attempts by the ISI to pressure them through the abduction and torture of their relatives as well as secret surveillance inside their homes. Following the letter, judges from other HCs also acknowledged interference by spy agencies in judicial functions.It led the apex court to take suo motu notice of the matter, with high courts submitting their responses and recommendations as proceedings continued.","Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics.

Pakistan anti-terrorism court judge accuses ISI of harassment to get desired verdicts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-anti-terrorism-court-judge-accuses-isi-of-harassment-to-get-desired-verdicts/articleshow/110978495.cms,"LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court judge , hearing the cases related to attacks on military installations in May last year by workers of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan's party, has accused Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI of harassing him and his family members to get desired verdicts . Muhammad Abbas made the allegation in a letter to Lahore high court chief justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan.

The judge has been hearing the cases against opposition leader in parliament Omar Ayub and other workers of Imran's PTI party in connection with the May 9, 2023 violence related to attacks on military installations in May last year. Ayub had alleged last week at a hearing that the judge was ""hostage"" of the intelligence agencies.

CJ Ahmad Khan summoned Punjab IGP Usman Anwar on Thursday and asked him why the roads leading to anti-terrorism court (Sargodha), some 200 km from Lahore, were closed by police when the judge refused to meet an ISI officer. The IGP replied: ""The roads were closed as the judge was facing serious threats"". The chief justice reserved his verdict on the alleged harassment of the ATC judge by the ISI.

In March, six judges of the Islamabad high court reached out to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) informing alleged intrusion of intelligence operatives in judicial matters.
