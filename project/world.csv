Durov’s background and the future of Telegram

French-Russian tech tycoon Pavel Durov was taken into custody at a Paris airport on Sunday for suspected involvement in activities associated with his messaging app Telegram. The alleged offences include fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and the promotion of terrorism.As per the Moscow Times, Durov was detained at Le Bourget Airport and is scheduled to appear in court on Sunday itself.He could face charges that carry a maximum prison term of 20 years. The arrest has sparked significant discussion and responses within the technology sector and among well-known individuals.France has authorised the arrest of Durov as a part of an initial inquiry into the purported offences. The detention of the founder of Telegram has sparked further debates regarding the platform's policies on regulating content.Renowned for its end-to-end encryption , Telegram permits groups of up to 200,000 members, consequently raising allegations that it enables the proliferation of inaccurate information and detrimental content.The reaction from the tech industry to Durov’s arrest has been swift and vocal. Elon Musk , the founder of SpaceX, was one of the first prominent tech figures to support the “#FreePavel” trend. He expressed concern about the arrest, seeing it as an attack on free speech and suggested wider implications for censorship. Musk highlighted the dangerous direction these actions represent and expressed increased worry about censorship.American entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan also criticised the French government's actions. He suggested that the motives behind the arrest were more about control than actual crime prevention, pointing out the impracticality of holding Durov accountable for user actions on Telegram when the French government itself struggles with domestic crime.Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin voiced apprehensions, noting that while he has previously criticised Telegram's encryption policies, the arrest of Durov raises troubling implications for communication freedom in Europe.Paul Graham, a noted computer scientist and writer, weighed in on the issue, discussing how Durov's arrest could impact France's reputation as a hub for startups. He highlighted the potential negative ramifications for the country’s business environment.Edward Snowden , former NSA intelligence contractor and whistleblower, condemned the arrest on social media. Expressing his dismay on X (formerly Twitter), Snowden stated, “an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association,” adding that it tarnishes France's global reputation.According to the Moscow Times, Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who interviewed Durov earlier this year, made a pointed comparison. “Pavel Durov left Russia when the government tried to control his social media company, Telegram. But in the end, it wasn’t Putin who arrested him for allowing the public to exercise free speech. It was a western country, a Biden administration ally and enthusiastic NATO member, that locked him away,” said Carlson.The Russian Foreign Ministry responded quickly to Durov's detention. “In response to the information about Durov's detention, the Russian Embassy in France immediately took the necessary steps to clarify the situation regarding the Russian citizen, despite the absence of any request from the businessman's [Durov’s] representatives,” the ministry told the state-run TASS news agency.As yet, Telegram has not released an official statement regarding Durov's arrest. Meanwhile, the Russian embassy in France is reportedly working to address the situation, underscoring the diplomatic attention the arrest has garnered.Durov, who now resides in Dubai, holds dual citizenship in France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). He left Russia in 2014 amid government pressure to shut down opposition groups on his VKontakte social media platform. Ranked as the 120th richest person in the world as of August 25, Durov’s swift arrest upon his arrival in France has become a flashpoint for larger debates about free speech, law enforcement, and digital privacy.Telegram, launched by Durov in 2013, is renowned for its secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging services. The platform allows users to create channels to disseminate information rapidly to large audiences, contributing to its widespread international use.The upcoming court appearance will determine the next steps in this unfolding legal drama.","French-Russian tech tycoon Pavel Durov was taken into custody at a Paris airport on Sunday for suspected involvement in activities associated with his messaging app Telegram.

Musk in the White House? Trump floats Elon as US government 'fat cutter' extraordinaire; Watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-in-the-white-house-trump-floats-elon-as-us-government-fat-cutter-extraordinaire-watch-video/articleshow/112791990.cms,"In the latest twist in the ever-evolving relationship between former President Donald Trump and tech titan Elon Musk , Trump has revealed his interest in having Musk help ""cut out some of the fat"" in government if he wins the upcoming election.While it’s unlikely that Musk will serve in a Trump cabinet due to his commitments at Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter), Trump has expressed a desire to involve Musk in some capacity—particularly in streamlining government operations and addressing the challenges of artificial intelligence.During a recent interview with former Navy SEAL Shawn Ryan, Trump discussed Musk’s potential role in his administration. “We have to cherish our geniuses,” Trump said, referring to Musk. “He’s a brilliant guy, and what he really would like to do is get involved in cutting some of the fat.”However, Trump also acknowledged that Musk’s responsibilities with his companies might prevent him from taking on a formal cabinet position. “He’s running big businesses and all that, so I don’t think he could be cabinet,” Trump said, suggesting instead that Musk could serve as a consultant.Trump highlighted Musk’s potential contributions in the realm of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the importance of staying competitive with other global powers. “He could consult on AI ... It’s very important for the country. If we don’t do it, China’s gonna do it, or somebody else,” Trump said.So, what exactly would Musk do? According to Trump, Elon would serve as a sort of high-level consultant, focusing on streamlining government operations and tackling the ever-looming AI challenge. “He could consult on AI... It’s very important for the country. If we don’t do it, China’s gonna do it, or somebody else,” Trump warned, leaning into the competitive narrative that has increasingly defined his pitch to voters.“Elon and I have a great relationship. He’s great,” Trump also said, adding with typical flair, “He’s a totally unusual character...But he is a brilliant guy.”This marks a significant development in the relationship between Trump and Musk, who had previously engaged in public disagreements but have since aligned more closely, particularly as Musk has become more involved in right-wing politics. Musk recently endorsed Trump and played a role in forming a pro-Trump super PAC earlier this year.","Former President Donald Trump has expressed interest in having tech titan Elon Musk help ""cut out some of the fat"" in government if he wins the upcoming election.

"JD Vance says Trump ‘would veto’ abortion ban, Sen. Warren tells GOP VP pick ‘women are not stupid’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/warren-to-vance-women-are-not-stupid-as-gop-vp-pick-says-trump-would-veto-abortion-ban/articleshow/112791074.cms,"Senator Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass, criticized Senator JD Vance , R-Ohio, on Sunday for his assertion that former President Donald Trump would veto a federal abortion ban if re-elected. Warren's comments came during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, where she challenged Vance’s claims about Trump’s stance on abortion rights.“American women are not stupid,” Warren said, expressing skepticism about Vance's claims.“We’re not going to trust the futures of our daughters and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion.”Vance, the GOP vice-presidential nominee, had earlier suggested that Trump would reject a nationwide abortion ban, arguing that the former president prefers to leave abortion regulation to individual states. “I think he would,” Vance said when asked if Trump would veto a federal ban . “He’s said that explicitly that he would.”Warren dismissed Vance’s statements, arguing that even if Trump did not sign a federal ban, his administration would still restrict abortion rights. She highlighted the Comstock Act, a historic law banning the mailing of abortion-related materials, which some Republicans have suggested reviving to impose nationwide restrictions. “Don’t buy it? Just read it,” Warren advised. “JD Vance actually sent a letter last year to the Department of Justice saying, enforce the Comstock Act. And remember he did that, and then Donald Trump picked him to be his vice president.”Trump has recently reiterated his belief that abortion rights and restrictions should be determined by individual states. However, he has often praised his Supreme Court appointees who played a key role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Vance has previously indicated openness to a national abortion ban.In her interview, Warren urged voters to support candidates who will work to restore abortion rights nationwide. “The only way that we’re going to protect access to abortion is to have a Democratic Congress send a bill to Kamala Harris, she will sign it into law, and then we will restore a right to half the population in this country,” Warren said. “No longer will a woman have to go into an emergency room and be told she’s not near enough death to get the medical treatment that she needs.”","Sen.

Democracy on line? Swing state Wisconsin offers a test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democracy-on-line-swing-state-wisconsin-offers-a-test/articleshow/112791499.cms,"APPLETON : Michael Hovde has a lot he dislikes about Donald Trump 's agenda. But when he votes in November in the electorally crucial state of Wisconsin , he believes the stakes are far higher than mere policy issues.""Trump, I think, is an existential threat to democracy ,"" the 36-year-old said as he strolled through the bustling downtown of Appleton, one of the most politically diverse areas of one of the most closely divided US states.He pointed to the ""terrifying"" people around the Republican mogul and to Project 2025, the governing blueprint written for, but publicly disavowed by, Trump that would ram through his hard-right policies.""They aim to truly just bypass and circumvent checks and balances, and really neuter the efficacy of our political system,"" Hovde said.Not far away, past the verdant lawns and elegant Victorian homes in this comfortably middle-class city, Casey Stern, 58, sees the race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris quite differently.Above his neatly tended garden of corn and zucchini flies an imposing ""Trump 2024"" flag. Another banner calls for Biden 's impeachment and says, ""We the People Are Pissed.""If the message is in-your-face, so are the reactions. Stern recounts passers-by shouting profanities, while some critics jot down his address and send him letters.He acknowledged that Trump's ""mean tweets in the middle of the night"" can bother people but believes the country needs a ""strong-willed"" leader to address inflation, immigration and crime.""Every time you go to the grocery store, you can't even afford a steak,"" Stern said.He scoffed at Democrats' charges that Trump puts democracy at risk, accusing President Joe Biden of stifling public debate over the Covid-19 pandemic.""Biden has done more to harm democracy,"" he said.- State of tumult -If there is one state where the Democrats' message on Trump's threat to democracy may mobilize voters, it is Wisconsin.Once known for clean, polite, left-tilting politics, Wisconsin has become an epicenter of partisanship -- an ultimate swing state that could tip the national .Trump stunned complacent Democrats by winning narrowly in 2016. Biden then took back Wisconsin by another razor-thin margin in 2020.A turning point had come in 2010 when Scott Walker, a young Republican who many presumed would respect Wisconsin's mild-mannered political style, was elected governor and unleashed sweeping changes.He stripped power from Wisconsin's once-formidable labor unions, and his Republicans drastically redrew election maps, virtually guaranteeing party control of the state legislature.Democrats hope Republicans will have their comeuppance in the November 5 election, fought on less partisan maps after a ruling by the state Supreme Court's new liberal majority.Kristin Alfheim, a Democrat who is seeking a state Senate seat, said competitive maps benefit democracy.""It brings the opportunity for accountability from both sides, knowing they're going to need to work together,"" she said.- 'Democracy' cuts both ways -Biden and Harris have hammered away on the threat to democracy from Trump, who refused to accept defeat in 2020 and fired up the supporters who attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021.Arnold Shober, a government professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, said the democracy theme carried ""special resonance"" in Wisconsin after its experience with Walker, who was voted out in 2018.But Shober said it cut both ways, with some Republicans still smarting over the boisterous, albeit nonviolent, protests that disrupted the state's capitol when Walker pushed through his anti-union measure, known as Act 10.""When you talk about January 6 in Wisconsin, folks on the right will instantly say, well, what about those Democrats with Act 10?"" Shober said.""They see it almost as an equity issue. You did it -- we can do it, too.""- Countering vitriol -The historic home to giant paper mills and now the base for major white-collar employers, Outagamie County, of which Appleton is the seat, was dominated by Republicans and produced the notorious anti-communist witch-hunter Joe McCarthy.But in a microcosm of the country, an urban-rural split has deepened, with Democrats gaining in an increasingly cosmopolitan Appleton.Outagamie County Chief Executive Tom Nelson, a Democrat sympathetic to socialist Bernie Sanders, has kept winning since 2011 even as he has seen coarseness in politics rising with Trump.""He has animated that vitriol, that contempt, that hatred,"" he said.Nelson said he has successfully reached across the divide on a more basic message.Fundamentally, he said, people want ""to be able to live in a community that is safe, that is healthy, that has a strong and vibrant economy.""","Wisconsin is an epicenter of partisanship -- an ultimate swing state that could tip the national election.

Kamala faces a Kennedy wrinkle on road to Kamalot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-faces-a-kennedy-wrinkle-on-road-to-kamalot/articleshow/112762598.cms,"WASHINGTON: The ardor of a rousing convention in Chicago that Democrats hoped would accelerate momentum for Kamala Harris was impeded to a degree on Friday when independent candidate Robert Kennedy Jr , scion of the famous political dynasty, suspended his campaign for the White House and threw his support behind Donald Trump .Regarded as a third party insurgent who attracted voters disgruntled with both Biden and Trump early in the race, the nearly 15 per cent support for Kennedy at his peak moment had dropped to 5 per cent and was plunging after Kamala Harris became the Democrat nominee.The jury and pollsters are still out on whether he can take his remaining supporters to Trump or whether they will filter into the Kamala bandwagon.There's not enough solid data yet but one poll shows Harris' lead against Trump dropped only marginally by 0.2 per cent (down from 3.3 to 3.1 when Kennedy was taken out of the equation). However the Trump camp believes even a marginal shift in closely-fought battleground state could win them the election.Seen as betraying his political legacy by Democrats and his own siblings, Kennedy literally walked over to the Trump camp, joining the former President at a rally in Arizona on Friday evening just hours after he bailed out of the race. Trump, who with his customary flourish had previously called him a ""radical left"" candidate, opportunistically reversed course and welcomed him, saying he was a well respected candidate who raised important issues during his campaign.Kennedy, 70, is the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of his brother, former attorney general and US senator Robert Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated in the 1960s. He caught the attention of voters with his anti-vaccine crusade in the covid years after years of work as an environmental activist and litigator. Almost all his siblings and cousins are aligned with the Democratic Party and some even spoke at the DNC in Chicago, endorsing Kamala Harris, earlier this week.Kennedy though had expressed various other frustrations with the Democratic Party after being thwarted in his bid for the party nomination, and gradually drifted towards Trump, even having secret conversations with him which were leaked. His campaign started falling apart after a series of bizarre statements he made, including admitting to leaving a dead bear in Central Park and claiming that a worm ate part of his brain.Shortly before walking over to the MAGA camp , he attempted to negotiate a cabinet position in a prospective Harris White House but was rebuffed. Trump on the other hand has indicated he is open to the idea.The Harris camp appears unconcerned by the development, seeing the new alliance as a sign of Trump's weakness and desperation after polls showed him sliding against Kamala after leading against Biden.","Kennedy, 70, is the nephew of President John F.

As Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination, Trump accused her of 'lying' and shared his live reactions on X through his Truth Social account.In anticipation of her address, Trump clearly expressed his intent to denounce Harris by posting on Truth Social, ""I'm getting ready to be fair but critical of Comrade Kamala Harris.My Play by Play will be on TRUTH Social, starting SOON!""As Harris began her speech, Trump wasted no time taking to social media to share his thoughts. He blasted her opening remarks, posting, ""Too many 'Thank yous,' too rapidly said, what's going on with her?""Trump went on tweeting spree on the vice president, focusing on her early remarks about her childhood and career aspirations. He urged her to address other pressing issues, writing, ""A lot of talk about childhood, we've got to get to the Border, Inflation, and Crime!""As Harris made a forceful defence of Ukraine and Nato in her speech, she attacked Trump’s past comments on the war in Ukraine.“As President, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our Nato allies,” Harris declared, highlighting her commitment to international alliances.She also said that five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, she warned President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and helped lead the US diplomatic response, rallying “more than 50 countries” to support Ukraine.In response, Trump defended his record on Nato, tweeting, ""Nato wasn’t paying their Bills, almost every Country was delinquent. When I said, 'If you don’t pay, we’re out, the United States is tired of being a sucker,' the money came rolling in by the BILLIONS, and I saved Nato!""Trump also seized the moment to criticise Harris on domestic issues, particularly immigration. As Harris also addressed about reforming America's broken immigration system in her speech at DNC.He accused her of wanting to grant citizenship to all undocumented immigrants. ""She just called to give all Illegals CITIZENSHIP, SAY GOODBYE TO THE USA! SHE IS A RADICAL MARXIST!"" Trump tweeted.Continuing his social media onslaught, Republican nominee posted, ""She talked about the Rule of Law but, as Border Czar, she allowed 20 Million people into our Country, many of them Criminals, who are MAIMING and KILLING our people!""Trump, with other top Republicans, has frequently labelled Harris a failed ""border czar"" in attacks on social media and during rally speeches, despite the fact that she never officially held this title. In March 2021, President Biden tasked Harris with addressing the ""root causes"" of migration to the US, a role distinct from direct oversight of border enforcement.Kamala Harris also highlighted Trump's past praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her speech, asserting, “I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators.”In reaction, Trump tweeted, ""The Tyrants are laughing at her; she’s weak and ineffective. For three and a half years, she has done nothing but enable them to become STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!""He further criticised Harris, stating, ""There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris because she will lead us into Nuclear World War III! She will never earn the respect of the Tyrants of the World!""Harris on the final night of DNC said that she would “always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself,” while also pressing for the release of hostages and a cease-fire deal.She also acknowledged the dire situation in Gaza, saying, “At the same time, what has happened in Gaza in the last 10 months is devastating, so many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing to safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.”On her statement, Trump criticised Harris's statements on Israel, posting, ""SHE HATES ISRAEL - Wouldn’t even show up to Congress for Netanyahu’s session!"" He also made inflammatory claims, asserting, ""She caused the Attack of October 7th. Iran was BROKE - Didn’t have money for Hezbollah!""Harris took the center stage to officially accept her nomination, nearly a month after she entered the race following President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw.","Former US President and Republican nominee Donald Trump reacted strongly to Kamala Harris's speech during the final night of the Democratic National Convention.

His announcement “should come as no surprise, his candidacy has never been anything other than a spoiler campaign for Trump,” according to the DNC.“He was recruited into the race by MAGA Republicans like Steve Bannon, he was propped up by Trump’s largest donor, and he parroted MAGA attacks on Democrats.” DNC senior advisor Mary Beth Cahill said that “the more voters learned about RFK Jr. the less they liked him.” “Donald Trump isn’t earning an endorsement that’s going to help build support, he’s inheriting the baggage of a failed fringe candidate,” she added.","RFK is pulling out although it's a little murky as he says he's still on the ballot in some but he did say 'I am giving my endorsement to Donald Trump,' Bill Maher said.

In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts that have devastated their populations and infrastructure.To explore and understand which countries face the highest levels of danger, we turn to the Global Peace Index (GPI) compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace.The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations, highlighting those most impacted by war, violence, and unrest.This non-profit organization annually evaluates 163 countries across 23 indicators, including internal conflicts, societal safety, and levels of militarization, providing a comprehensive assessment of global peace and security. Here’s the list of the most dangerous countries in the world.With a 2024 GPI score of 3.397, Yemen continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. Since the onset of civil conflict in 2015, the nation has been plunged into chaos, with widespread famine, disease, and infrastructure collapse exacerbating the situation.The conflict, which started as an internal struggle, has been prolonged and intensified by the involvement of neighbouring countries, each backing different factions. This has only deepened the suffering of the Yemeni people, who face unimaginable hardships daily.Sudan remains one of the most dangerous countries globally, primarily due to ongoing conflicts in regions like Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. In 2024, these conflicts resulted in over 3,000 deaths and displaced nearly 2 million people.The humanitarian crisis is severe, with frequent attacks on civilians by government forces, opposition groups, and militias. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 14 million people in Sudan are in dire need of humanitarian aid.South Sudan, with a GPI score of 3.324, remains one of the world's most perilous countries due to ongoing civil conflict, ethnic violence, and political instability. Since gaining independence in 2011, the country has struggled to maintain peace and stability, with its citizens facing continuous threats from internal strife and external pressures.Afghanistan, with a 2024 GPI score of 3.294, continues to be one of the most dangerous countries worldwide. Decades of conflict, compounded by the Taliban's seizure of power in 2021, have left the nation in a state of constant instability.The risks of terrorism, kidnappings, and widespread violence remain high, making Afghanistan a focal point of international concern.Ukraine has witnessed a significant decline in safety and stability, particularly since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. By 2024, the conflict has claimed over 150,000 lives, with millions more displaced both internally and externally.The destruction of cities and critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals, has created a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions.The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer from one of the deadliest conflicts in African history. The ongoing violence, which has spanned more than four and a half years, has resulted in more lives lost than any other conflict since World War II, according to the International Rescue Committee. The DRC remains a highly dangerous place, with widespread violence and instability threatening the lives of millions.In 2024, Russia's GPI score of 3.249 reflects the nation's increasing danger, exacerbated by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Internally, Russia faces significant challenges, including organized crime and corruption, which undermine law and order.Additionally, environmental concerns, such as industrial accidents and pollution, pose substantial health risks to the population.Since the onset of its civil war in 2011, Syria has been one of the world's most dangerous countries. The conflict has devastated infrastructure, leaving buildings, roads, hospitals, and schools in ruins.The humanitarian situation is dire, with over 13 million Syrians in need of assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced. Food insecurity is rampant, and the healthcare system is in disarray, with many hospitals destroyed or operating at minimal capacity.Mali has been embroiled in armed conflict since January 2012, when Tuareg rebels seized control of the northern territory, declaring the independent nation of Azawad by April of that year. The situation escalated further with a military coup in March 2012, deepening the turmoil in the region. Today, Mali remains one of the most dangerous countries, with ongoing violence and instability threatening the safety of its citizens","The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations.

Campaign adjustments

Military service controversies

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is embroiled in controversy as recent revelations challenge his past claims about his achievements and military career. The spotlight on Walz intensified with the resurfacing of a 2006 letter from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce , casting doubt on his claims of accolades and military rank . As Walz navigates these accusations , his vice-presidential campaign faces mounting scrutiny and attempts at clarification.The controversy erupted when a 2006 letter from Barry L Kennedy, then-president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, resurfaced. The letter, addressed to Walz, refutes his earlier assertion that he received an award from the Chamber in 1993. During his initial Congressional campaign, Walz’s website claimed recognition from the Nebraska Chamber for his contributions to the business sector, as reported by the Post Bulletin in 2006.Kennedy's letter explicitly states, “We researched this matter and can confirm that you have not been the recipient of any award from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce.” He further requested the removal of any reference to the Chamber to avoid implications of endorsement. Kennedy also highlighted that the US Chamber of Commerce had endorsed Walz’s opponent, Congressman Gil Gutknecht, for his support of small business issues.In response to the resurfaced letter, Walz’s campaign promptly updated his website, clarifying that the award in question was from the Nebraska Junior Chamber of Commerce, known as the Jaycees. The campaign labeled the initial reference as a “typographical error,” according to the Post Bulletin.When approached for comment, the Harris-Walz campaign defended Walz’s record, attributing his misstatements to his informal speaking style. “Governor Walz speaks the way real people speak, openly and off the cuff. The American people appreciate that Gov Walz tells it like it is and doesn’t talk like a politician,” the campaign stated. They emphasized the distinction between occasional misspeaking and deliberate falsehoods, contrasting Walz’s approach with that of Donald Trump.The scrutiny surrounding Walz extends beyond the business award . Allegations have surfaced regarding his military service, with critics accusing him of misrepresenting his rank. Walz, a retired Army National Guard member, has faced accusations of falsely claiming a higher rank than he held at retirement. Despite being promoted to Command Sergeant Major during a 2004 deployment, Walz did not complete the requisite coursework at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy to retain that rank upon retirement. Instead, he retired as a Master Sergeant, one rank lower.Retired Navy captain and Republican Virginia Senate candidate Hung Cao criticized Walz, asserting, “For 20 years, they let this guy go by with a lie that he deployed to Iraq, which he didn’t, and that he retired as a command sergeant major, which he did not. I mean, that’s just blatant lies.” Additionally, Walz’s former battalion commander in the Minnesota Army National Guard condemned him for misleading the public about his military title.","Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is embroiled in controversy as recent revelations challenge his past claims about his achievements and military career.

""Who is negotiating for us in the Middle East? Bombs are dropping all over the place!"" Trump posted. He then lashed out at Biden, saying, ""Sleepy Joe is sleeping on a beach in California, viciously exiled by the Democrats, and Comrade Kamala is doing a campaign bus tour with Tampon Tim, her really bad VP pick.

In retaliation, Hezbollah fired hundreds of Katyusha rockets and drones, further intensifying the conflict.Hezbollah dismissed Israel's allegations as ""baseless"" and launched counterattacks, which it described as the ""first phase"" of its response.

We attack and remove Hezbollah threats. Anyone who is near the areas where Hezbollah operates is required to stay away from them immediately,"" Hagari stated.With tensions at a boiling point, the Israeli public remains on high alert, bracing for further escalation as both sides continue to exchange heavy fire.

Forecast and community response

Hurricane Gilma remains a concern

Hurricane Hone passed within 60 miles of Hawaii's Big Island early Sunday, bringing heavy rain , causing power outages for thousands of customers and damaging native vegetation. About 15,000 residents in a region with a roughly 206,000 population were left without electricity.Mitch Roth, the mayor of Hawaii County , reported there were no injuries or major damages.Kazuo Todd, the fire chief for Hawaii County, highlighted that nearly 18 inches of rain had fallen around the southern island volcanoes, although the winds and flooding had not been severe.Adding further, Todd said, “We do live on an island in the Pacific where the water can drain off into the ocean relatively quickly,”.Forecasters anticipated Hone, a Category 1 storm moving westward below the islands, could still deliver up to 20 inches of rain in some regions. The storm’s progression is expected to slow and accumulate moisture over the islands, which could heighten the risk of heavy rainfall and flash flooding statewide.For many residents, Hone did not prompt significant worry. On Saturday evening, a local baseball league primarily composed of older adults held its banquet at Kamehameha Park in Kapaau, shielding attendees from gusts with windscreens.Other residents paid closer attention to the rain. Kumiko Mattison drove from her home in Kaumana to Keaukaha near the water. Despite observing swollen water bodies and rising tides during her drive, she found no damage to wetland areas and fishponds upon her arrival.In Nanawale Estates, roughly 20 miles south, Sean O’Phelan was concerned about potential tree uprootings around his small cabin due to the rain and wind. O’Phelan, who lives off the electrical grid and utilises solar power and a rainwater storage tank, had tree damage his carport during a storm less than a year ago.“We’re all pretty confident that we’ll be able to share aloha with our neighbours and make sure that everybody’s safe,” O’Phelan stated, noting the community’s readiness to support one another during disasters.On Friday, Hawaii Electric, the state’s primary electricity utility , prepared to shut off power in high wildfire-risk areas to prevent potential fires fueled by strong winds. However, by late Saturday, the National Weather Service had lifted the wildfire warning, leading the utility to retract potential power shut-offs.Residents also monitored Hurricane Gilma, a Category 3 storm east of Hawaii, although forecasters expected it to weaken to a tropical depression before reaching the state.Meteorologist Ian Morrison from the National Weather Service in Honolulu expressed hope that Gilma’s rainfall would be distributed over a day or two rather than in a rapid downpour.","Hurricane Hone passed within 60 miles of Hawaii's Big Island early Sunday.

Vance claimed that Trump believes such a ban would exacerbate federal conflict, preferring instead to leave abortion decisions to individual states and their distinct cultural and political contexts.“I can absolutely commit that,” Vance said on NBC's “Meet the Press” whether he could commit that Trump would not impose such a ban.""Donald Trump’s view is that we want the individual states and their individual cultures and their unique political sensibilities to make these decisions because we don’t want to have a nonstop federal conflict over this issue"", he added.“I mean, if you’re not supporting it as the president of the United States, you fundamentally have to veto it,""Vance’s comments come in the wake of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Trump faced sharp criticism for his role in appointing the Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v Wade . This landmark decision ended the constitutional right to abortion in the United States, and Democrats have been vocal about the implications of this shift.During the convention, speakers lashed out at Trump, accusing him of undermining women's reproductive rights. Trump, however, has recently pushed back against these accusations. He has reassured voters that his administration would be ""great for women and their reproductive rights,"" a statement that had been met with skepticism.Anti-abortion advocates have expressed concern over Trump’s apparent ambiguity on the issue. The editor of the conservative National Review has publicly criticised Trump, questioning his commitment to the anti-abortion cause.Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren denounced Trump and Vance’s stance, arguing that trusting Trump and his running mate with reproductive rights is unwise given their track record.Trump’s position on abortion has been notably inconsistent. Before entering politics, he identified as ""very pro-choice,"" but his views have evolved over time. Earlier this year, Trump seemed to waver on whether to support a federal abortion ban but ultimately aligned with the notion that such matters should be determined by states.In a recent CBS News interview, Trump maintained he had ""no regrets"" about the Roe v Wade reversal but clarified that he would not use the Comstock Act to ban medication used in alternative abortions.Abortion remains a central issue for Democrats, particularly since the Roe v Wade decision in 2022. The party is banking on the topic to energize their base for the upcoming election. Vice President Kamala Harris, in her nomination acceptance speech, warned that Trump’s actions have had dire consequences for women, citing numerous personal stories of women denied essential medical care.","Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said that former President Donald Trump, if re-elected, would not support a national abortion ban.
