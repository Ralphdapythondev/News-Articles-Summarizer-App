FAA to investigate after Boeing says workers in South Carolina falsified 787 inspection records,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/faa-to-investigate-after-boeing-says-workers-in-south-carolina-falsified-787-inspection-records/articleshow/109899517.cms,"SEATTLE: The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it has opened an investigation into Boeing after the beleaguered company reported that workers at a South Carolina plant falsified inspection records on certain 787 planes. Boeing said its engineers have determined that misconduct did not create ""an immediate safety of flight issue "". In an email to Boeing's South Carolina employees on April 29, Scott Stocker , who leads the 787 program, said a worker observed an ""irregularity"" in a required test of the wing-to-body join and reported it to his manager.""After receiving the report, we quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating Company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed,"" Stocker wrote.Boeing notified the FAA and is taking ""swift and serious corrective action with multiple teammates,"" Stocker said.No planes have been taken out of service, but having to perform the test out of order on planes will slow the delivery of jets still being built at the final assembly plant in North Charleston, South Carolina.Boeing must also create a plan to address planes that are already flying, the FAA said.The 787 is a two-aisle plane that debuted in 2011 and is used mostly for long international flights.""The company voluntarily informed us in April that it may not have completed required inspections to confirm adequate bonding and grounding where the wings join the fuselage on certain 787 Dreamliner airplanes,"" the agency said in a written statement. ""The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records.""The company has been under intense pressure since a door plug blew out of a Boeing 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, leaving a gaping hole in the plane. The accident halted progress that Boeing seemed to be making while recovering from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019.Those crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which killed 346 people, are back in the spotlight, too. The families of some of the victims have pushed the Justice Department to revive a criminal fraud charge against the company by determining that Boeing's continued lapses violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement.In April, a Boeing whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, testified at a congressional hearing that the company had taken manufacturing shortcuts to turn out 787s as quickly as possible; his allegations were not directly related to those the company disclosed to the FAA last month. The company rejected Salehpour's claims.In his email, Stocker praised the worker who came forward to report what he saw: ""I wanted to personally thank and commend that teammate for doing the right thing. It's critical that every one of us speak up when we see something that may not look right, or that needs attention.""","Boeing says misconduct did not create ""an immediate safety of flight issue"" The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections.

Pakistan SC suspends Peshawar HC order denying reserved seats to Imran-backed party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-sc-suspends-peshawar-hc-order-denying-reserved-seats-to-imran-backed-party/articleshow/109898987.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party aligned with candidates backed by incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities in the national and provincial legislatures.Since the Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was barred by the top court from contesting the Feb 8 elections under its traditional electoral symbol of a cricket bat on technical grounds, the party had subsequently struck an alliance with another party, Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), in an attempt to secure reserved seats in parliament.Under Pakistan’s election rules, political parties are allotted reserved seats — (there are 60 for women and 10 for minorities in the National Assembly) — in proportion to the number of parliamentary seats they win in the election. This completes the NA’s total strength of 336 seats.In March, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had ruled that SIC was not eligible for reserved seats and decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries. The verdict was rejected by PTI as unconstitutional and the alliance had filed a plea against the electoral watchdog’s decision in the Peshawar HC, but it rejected the appeal.In response, SIC moved the Supreme Court last month urging it to allot the party the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and set aside the Peshawar HC ruling.Accepting SIC’s appeal for a hearing, the apex court clarified that the Peshawar HC order upholding ECP’s decision was suspended to the extent of the remaining reserved seats distributed among other parties.After losing the extra reserved seats, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government had lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court suspended on Monday a high court verdict that a political party was not eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities.

Some wore wedding gowns to take public vows of commitment to themselves. Others gathered to watch films made by women about women. The bookish flocked to female bookshops to read titles like ""The Woman Destroyed"" and ""Living a Feminist Life"".Women in Shanghai, and some of China's other biggest cities, are negotiating the fragile terms of public expression at a politically precarious moment.China's ruling Communist Party has identified feminism as a threat to its authority. Female rights activists have been jailed. Concerns about harassment and violence against women are ignored or outright silenced. Prez Xi Jinping has diminished the role of women at work and in public office. There are no female members of Xi's inner circle or the Politburo, the executive policymaking body.

Al Jazeera calls Israeli crackdown 'criminal act'

(With AFP inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Israeli army carried out air strikes on areas in eastern Rafah near neighborhoods that received evacuation orders, as reported by Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV. Israel issued evacuation notices to civilians in parts of southern Gaza on Monday, signaling an impending assault on Hamas strongholds in the city.Palestinian families, informed of the evacuation via Arabic text messages, telephone calls, and flyers, gathered outside despite chilly rain.Israeli forces directed Palestinians to relocate to an ""expanded humanitarian zone"" located 20 kilometers away from the targeted areas.While Israel's military initiated what it termed as a ""limited scope"" operation to encourage Rafah residents to evacuate, it did not specify reasons or hint at any forthcoming offensive actions.The evacuation call coincides with renewed talks of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, scheduled to resume on Monday. However, tensions persist as both sides remain at odds over ceasefire terms amid the seven-month-long conflict.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Sunday that yielding to demands to end the war would equate to defeat. Netanyahu emphasized Israel's resolve not to allow Hamas to regain control of Gaza, rebuild its military infrastructure, or pose a threat to Israeli citizens.""Israel will not agree to Hamas's demands, which mean surrender, and will continue the fighting until all its goals are achieved,"" stated Netanyahu, as conveyed in a statement from his office.Gaza civil defence and aid officials said Monday that Israeli jets struck two areas in eastern Rafah the Israeli military had ordered to be evacuated, ahead of a possible ground invasion of the Palestinian city.""The areas targeted by the Israeli occupation are near the perimeter of Gaza International Airport, the Al-Shuka area, the Abu Halawa area, the Salaheddin street area and the Salam neighbourhood,"" Gaza civil defence agency spokesman Ahmed Ridwan told AFP. Another aid official confirmed the strikes.The Israeli military did not offer an immediate comment, but earlier on Sunday it ordered residents of Al-Shuka and Al-Salam to evacuate and move to a humanitarian area.Osama al-Kahlut from the emergency operations department of the Red Crescent Society told AFP that the bombing was targeting eastern areas of Rafah.""It is clear that it is targeting homes, but we have not received any communications or information about the presence of victims in the targeted areas,"" he said.Eastern Rafah resident Yaqub al-Sheikh Salama, 30, said the bombing was intense in Al-Salam, Al-Shuka, and other areas.""There are massive explosions and terrifying sounds of aerial and artillery bombardments,"" Salam told AFP.""Children and women are scared and don't know where to go,"" he said.Reacting to Netanyahu's statement, Qatar-based Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh accused the Israeli PM of sabotaging the talks.A Hamas official said Sunday the group's delegation for Gaza truce talks was headed to Doha for ""consultations"" after the last round of talks in Cairo failed to produce a breakthrough.Hamas negotiators are then due back in Cairo on Tuesday, said Al-Qahera News, a site linked to Egyptian intelligence services.Israeli air strikes continued to pound Rafah in southern Gaza, where about 12 lakh Palestinians have sought shelter. Sunday bombings in the southern strip killed at least 16 people, hours after Hamas rockets eliminated three Israeli soldiers.Gaza's bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians.Residents of the southern Gaza city said they feared an upsurge in violence if truce talks collapse.Naja Shaat, 59, said she was ""extremely joyful"" when she thought a ceasefire was imminent, ""but today... we are on pins and needles"".The Palestinian civilian toll has strained ties between Israel and its main military supplier and ally the United States. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that ""the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas"".Negotiators met in Egypt's Cairo on Sunday in the absence of the Israeli delegation. In the meeting, Qatari, Egyptian and US mediators proposed a 40-day pause in the fighting and an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, according to details released by Britain.Any truce reached would be the first since a week-long November ceasefire saw a hostage-prisoner swap.As millions of people have pinned hope on truce talk success, Netanyahu faces protests demanding a truce deal to bring Gaza hostages back home. Protestors, some carrying posters with images of the captives, gathered in Tel Aviv on Sunday, as Israel marked national Holocaust Remembrance Day.Israel on Sunday announced its decision to close Qatar-based news channel Al Jazeera's operation in the country. The network went off-air a short time later.Lashing out at the Netanyahu dispensation's decision, Al Jazeera condemned Israel's action as a ""criminal act"", and said it would take legal action.The extreme step came amid Al Jazeera's round-the-clock coverage of the war, which Israel says is one-sided.","Israeli army carried out air strikes on areas in eastern Rafah near neighborhoods that received evacuation orders.

NEW DELHI: The trial of Kazakhstan’s former economy minister Kuandyk Bishimbayev for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova, has shocked the nation, with thousands calling for harsher penalties for domestic violence .CCTV footage depicted the minister dragging his wife by her hair, and subsequently punching and kicking her. Following the recorded incident, Nukenova succumbed to brain trauma.The footage, spanning eight hours, also captured Bishimbayev breaking down a door as Nukenova attempted to seek refuge in a bathroom.Nukenova, aged 31, was discovered dead in November within a restaurant owned by one of Bishimbayev’s relatives. Initially denying involvement, Bishimbayev confessed in court on Wednesday to assaulting her and inadvertently causing her demise.Bishimbayev's legal team contested medical evidence suggesting Nukenova died from repeated head trauma . They attempted to portray her as prone to jealousy and violence, despite no evidence from the restaurant's security cameras showing her attacking Bishimbayev.Bishimbayev, 44 years old, once celebrated as a modern, Western-educated figure within the Kazakhstani government under former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, was incarcerated for bribery in 2018. He was later granted a pardon, less than two years into his sentence.A 2018 study supported by UN Women revealed approximately 400 women in Kazakhstan die annually due to domestic violence, with many cases going unreported.In 2017, Kazakhstan decriminalized certain forms of domestic violence, categorizing them as causing ""minor"" physical damage, punishable by fines or brief imprisonment. This move mirrored Russia's actions that year, provoking outrage among advocates for women’s rights. Kazakhstan has since reversed this legislation, intensifying penalties for offenders and introducing new criminal charges, including harassment of minors.","Kuandyk Bishimbayev is on trial for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova.

A solemn and shy adolescent, he had learned that ordinary activities - riding a bike, going outside on a cold day, playing soccer - could bring on episodes of searing pain. ""Sickle cell always steals my dreams and interrupts all the things I want to do,"" he said. Now he feels as if he has a chance for a normal life.Near the end of last year, the FDA gave two companies authorisation to sell gene therapy to people with sickle cell disease - a genetic disorder of red blood cells that causes debilitating pain and other medical problems. People are born with the disease when they inherit the mutated gene for the condition from each parent.The treatment helped patients in clinical trials, but Kendric is the first commercial patient for Bluebird Bio , a Somerville, Mass., company. Another other company, Vertex Therapeutics of Boston, declined to say if it had started treatment for any patients with its approved CRISPR gene-editing-based remedy.Kendric began his treatment at Children's National Hospital in Washington. Wednesday's treatment was only the first step. Doctors removed his bone marrow stem cells, which Bluebird will then genetically modify in a specialised lab for his treatment. That will take months. But before it begins, Bluebird needs hundreds of millions of stem cells from Kendric, and if the first collection - taking six to eight hours - is not sufficient, the company will try once or twice more. If it still doesn't have enough, Kendric will have to spend another month in preparation for another stem cell extraction. nyt","Kendric Cromer, 12, is the first person in the world with sickle cell disease to begin a commercially approved gene therapy that may cure the condition.

NEW DELHI: Columbia University has announced the cancellation of its large university-wide commencement ceremony amidst ongoing pro-Palestinian protests . However, the university will proceed with smaller school-based ceremonies scheduled for this week and next, according to a statement released by university officials on Monday.The decision to cancel the university-wide ceremony on May 15 was made after discussions with students and considering their feedback.University officials said, ""Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families."" The focus will now shift to Class Days and school-level graduation ceremonies, where students are honored individually alongside their peers.The past few weeks have been described as ""incredibly difficult"" for the Columbia University community. The cancellation of the large ceremony comes in the wake of ongoing protests, including more than 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who were arrested last month after camping out on Columbia's green.Similar protests have taken place at universities across the country, as schools grapple with maintaining safe and inclusive campuses while allowing for free expression. The University of Southern California (USC) recently canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to proceed. At USC, students abandoned their camp after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.The protests are rooted in the conflict that began on October 7, when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel. The ensuing violence has resulted in casualties on both sides, with significant civilian loss of life. The situation remains complex and sensitive, with ongoing efforts to address the underlying issues and achieve a peaceful resolution.",Columbia University cancels its large university-wide commencement ceremony.

The same was also received to temples in upstate New York and on Long Island. The email, received on Saturday, warned of a bomb inside the buildings.“Hello, if you see this email just have notice of a bomb I have set inside of your building,” the email sent Saturday read, law enforcement sources told The NY Post.“This isn’t a threat,” it said. “I have set a bomb in your building, you have a few hours to disarm or else blood will shatter everywhere.” The NY Post Sources said the threat came from a group calling itself “Terrorizers111.”The targets of the threat included 14 synagogues and Jewish centers in Manhattan, five in Queens, and two in Brooklyn. Additionally, two temples upstate and one on Long Island were targeted. The New York Landmarks Conservancy also received a similar threat.These threats occur during a period of increased antisemitism in New York City and beyond. Pro-Palestinian protesters have been demonstrating in the streets and setting up anti-Israeli encampments on college campuses, including Columbia University and City College, in recent weeks.US Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Sunday announced that $400 million in federal assistance would be earmarked to protect houses of worship by funding security guards, cameras and barriers.“Last night’s bomb threats targeting New York City synagogues created immense fear, but sadly, these threats are not a total shock given the rise in antisemitism that we have seen and the overall spike in threats to places of worship,” Schumer said in a statement.“Protecting our nonprofit community spaces, like our synagogues, mosques, churches and more has unfortunately demanded more help at the federal level as the threats have increased,” he said. “These funds are to help lessen the unease across the city in the places where we worship, pray, and learn.”According to the Anti-Defamation League, there were 8,873 antisemitic incidents in the US last year, marking a 140% increase from the 2022 figure.The number surged after October 7, following a deadly attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists, which prompted a significant retaliatory response from Israel in the Gaza Strip.After October 7, there were 5,204 recorded antisemitic incidents. The incidents in 2023 included 1,009 bomb threats against Jewish institutions, as reported by the ADL.The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Saturday’s bomb threats.","Nearly two dozen Jewish sites in New York City received a bomb threat via email.

'Not an example of peaceful protest': Whitehouse condemns violent protests



NEW DELHI: The University of California is all set to resume offline classes from Monday after being shifted online due to clashes on campus between pro-Palestinian protesters and police, according to college authorities.Protests against Israel's attack on Hamas in Gaza have rocked US campuses for weeks, triggering crackdowns, mass arrests, and a White House mandate to restore order.""The campus will return to regular operations (on Monday)... and plans to remain this way through the rest of the week,"" a statement posted on Sunday on the university's website said.""A law enforcement presence continues to be stationed around campus to help promote safety,"" it added.The demonstrations are part of a broader push to protest what they see as injustices in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, aligning with wider protests across the country following Israel’s offensive in Gaza triggered by a Hamas attack on southern Israel.As US universities echoed with the chants of ""free, free Palestine"", pro-Palestine protests spread to several countries. Student activists have organized protests at various universities, setting up temporary encampments on campus grounds. The protesters are calling for their schools to sever connections with universities in Israel and businesses that financially benefit from the ongoing conflict.In Paris, France, law enforcement personnel removed demonstrators who were participating in a sit-in at Sciences Po, resulting in the arrest of 91 people.Law enforcement officials took action on Friday to remove demonstrators who had gathered near Humboldt University, situated in the heart of Berlin.In various Canadian cities, including Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver, students have taken to the streets to voice their opposition to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.At least 200 individuals were detained at UCLA on Thursday, increasing the total number of arrests worldwide to more than 2,000 across dozens of college campuses since police removed an encampment at Columbia University in mid-April, according to an AP tally.Over the previous two weeks, more than 1,000 protestors have been arrested on campuses in Texas, Utah, Virginia, North Carolina, New Mexico, Connecticut, Louisiana, California, and New Jersey, some following clashes with riot police.Calling it an ""absolutely the wrong approach"", Whitehouse condemned the standoffs at Columbia and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where demonstrators took two buildings before officers with batons intervened overnight and arrested 25 individuals.Officials said that the total damage to the northern California school would be more than $1 million.",The University of California is all set to resume offline classes from Monday.

US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall flew a fighter jet on Friday that was piloted by AI over the deserts in California, as reported by Fox news.Last month, Kendall announced his intention to pilot an AI-controlled F-16 to the US Senate appropriations committee’s defense panel, discussing the future of air warfare relying on autonomously operated drones.On Friday, the senior Air Force leader carried out his plans, achieving what might be one of the most significant advancements in military aviation since the introduction of stealth planes in the early 1990s.According to Fox news, the US Air Force plans to have more than 1,000 AI-flown planes in commission, with the first in operation by 2028Kendall traveled to Edwards Air Force base, which is the same desert facility where Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, to observe and participate in AI flight in real time.""It’s a security risk not to have it. At this point, we have to have it,"" the secretary said.The F-16, controlled by artificial intelligence and named Vista, flew Kendall in maneuvers that reached speeds exceeding 550 mph, exerting a pressure on his body equivalent to nearly five times the force of gravity.A human-piloted F-16 was flying alongside Vista and Kendall. The two jets raced within 1,000 feet of each other, performing twists and loops in an attempt to make their opponent surrender.He said that he had seen sufficient evidence to have faith in the AI technology when determining whether to use weapons in a war.Kendall said that human oversight will always be involved in the consideration of weapons.The US Air Force plans to have a fleet of more than 1,000 AI-operated drones, with the first one expected to be operational by 2028.In March, the Pentagon announced its plans to develop new artificial intelligence-guided planes. It offered two contracts to several private companies for them to compete against each other to win.The CCA project, known as the Collaborative Combat Aircraft project, is a component of a program worth $6 billion.The companies that are competing for the contract are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Atomics, and Anduril Industries.The Pentagon is interested in pursuing the project because cost-cutting is one of the elements of AI that appeals to them.In August 2023, deputy secretary of fefense Kathleen Hicks said deploying AI-enabled autonomous vehicles would provide ""small, smart, cheap and many' expendable units to the US military, helping overhaul the ""too-slow shift of US military innovation.""","US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall flew a fighter jet on Friday that was piloted by AI over the deserts in California.

It comes as the Biden administration and Israeli officials remain at odds over Israel's planned military incursion in Rafah.Biden last met King Abdullah at the White House in February and the two longtime allies discussed a daunting list of challenges, including a looming Israeli ground offensive in southern Gaza and the threat of a humanitarian calamity among Palestinian civilians. Jordan and other Arab states have been highly critical of Israel's actions and have been demanding a ceasefire since mid-October as civilian casualties began to skyrocket. The war began after Hamas stunned Israel with a cross-border raid on October 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 252 hostages taken, according to Israeli tallies.Biden last spoke to Netanyahu on April 28 and ""reiterated his clear position"" on a possible invasion of the Gaza border city of Rafah, the White House said. The US president has been vocal in his demand that Israel not undertake a ground offensive in Rafah without a plan to protect Palestinian civilians.With pro-Palestinian protests erupting across US college campuses, Biden faces increasing pressure politically to convince Israel to hold off on an invasion.

"Pakistan wheat scam probe: Evasive response of govt raises concerns, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-wheat-scam-probe-evasive-response-of-govt-raises-concerns-says-report/articleshow/109853452.cms,"LAHORE: The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive, despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 's assurance to safeguard farmers ' interests, Dawn reported.While he has pledged unwavering support for farmers, the federal government's reluctance to thoroughly probe the alleged scam and hold accountable those responsible is palpable.Heading the fact-finding committee tasked with unravelling irregularities in the wheat import is Cabinet Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal. However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.

You are behaving like [government's] B-team against PTI.""Khan highlighted the unresolved issues regarding PTI's electoral symbol, alleged rigging during general elections and the status of PTI's petitions , behind his allegations of PTI being denied level playing field.He criticized the judiciary for what he perceived as coerced decisions and urged Supreme Court judges to emulate the stance of high court judges in rejecting wrongful decisions.Expressing a willingness to engage in dialogue, Khan conditioned it upon the return of what he claimed was a 'stolen mandate' and the release of imprisoned party workers. He stressed that dialogue typically occurs with adversaries, hinting at a potential negotiation with PTI's perceived adversaries.Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry had suggested that if Khan struck a deal with the establishment, he would effectively become Shehbaz Sharif.Chaudhry's remarks surfaced amidst discussions surrounding alleged talks between PTI and the establishment, which were initiated by senior PTI leader Shehryar Afridi.

They are constructed in cubic shape, often weigh no more than a few kg, and are deployed in space for various purposes.Weighing around 7 kg, the iCUBE-Q orbiter carries two cameras to take images of the lunar surface and has other sensors and apparatus for deep-space communication, altitude control, and other functions.The primary criteria for mission success, officials said, will be achieved with the successful separation of the iCUBE-Q from the Chang’e-6 Orbiter. Following separation, the secondary criteria will involve the satellite receiving a beacon signal that will confirm that the orbiter is working satisfactorily.Finally, the orbiter will take pictures of the Earth, and Moon and try to take pictures of at least two objects together (Earth, Moon, and the orbiter).As part of data collection, authorities said, iCUBE-Q will also collect data on the lunar magnetic field, establish a lunar magnetic field model, and lay the groundwork for future missions and international lunar cooperation.Dr Khurram Khurshid, a senior member associated with Pakistan’s space programme, said the satellite will reach the lunar orbit in five days and will circle the moon for three to six months.He added that different pictures of the surface of the moon will be taken with the orbiter’s help, after which Pakistan will have its own satellite images of the Moon for research.","Pakistan launched its first-ever lunar mission, iCube-Qamar, on Friday.

All that is left for Pak Army is to 'murder me': Imran Khan writes from prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/all-that-is-left-for-pak-army-is-to-murder-me-imran-khan-writes-from-prison/articleshow/109821286.cms,"LONDON/ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country where political leaders like him languish in jail and said all that is left for the powerful military leadership was to ""murder"" him.In a column for the UK's ‘Daily Telegraph' newspaper, penned from the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi where he is being held for disputed corruption charges, the 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician reiterated his previous assertion that if anything happens to him or his wife, General Asim Munir – the Chief of Army Staff, will be responsible.The founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said the cash-strapped country was at a “dangerous crossroads”, with the government a “laughing stock”.“The military establishment has done all they could against me. All that is left for them is to now murder me,” writes Khan.“I have stated publicly that if anything happens to me or my wife (Bushra Bibi), Gen. Asim Munir will be responsible. But I am not afraid because my faith is strong. I would prefer death over slavery,” he says.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy. However, the military has denied meddling in the country's politics.Khan warned that the state was treading the same path it trod in 1971, when it lost East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.“At the same time, it is seeing an upsurge in terrorism and a growing alienation in Balochistan where the issue of enforced disappearances is growing in severity. On Pakistan's borders, India has already admitted to undertaking assassinations inside of Pakistan and the international border with Afghanistan remains volatile,” he notes.Khan notes the military establishment's expectation of “unquestioning support” from the US, in return for the provision of access to airspace and related facilities to the US for military purposes, has been punctured after the publication of the latest US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which highlights the many human rights violations in Pakistan.“With an economy in crisis, spiralling prices and a people politically angry at having their electoral mandate stolen and being economically beleaguered, the state stands isolated,” he writes.Khan hailed the “democratic revenge” of the February 8 general election, during which people came out and “voted overwhelmingly” for candidates supported by his party.“Unfortunately, instead of accepting the people's mandate, the military establishment went into a fit of rage and electoral results were manipulated to bring into power the losers. The same vote tampering was seen in the recent by-elections,” he notes.The PTI founder also praised the six “brave judges” of the Islamabad High Court who have written a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan highlighting instances of harassment and blackmail including of their families by intelligence agencies.“This is unprecedented in our history – although, informally, many knew what was happening to the senior judiciary but for such a letter to have come from these judges shows the level of despair, anger and frustration,” he writes.","Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country.
