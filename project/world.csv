During a solo news conference at the Nato Summit , Biden said, ""I am not opposed, if my doctors tell me I should have another neurological exam, I'll do it.""He emphasised that he is surrounded by competent doctors who would advise him if they believed there was an issue.The president expressed frustration with the increasing focus on his age, saying, ""No matter what I did, no one's gonna be satisfied."" He mentioned that he has undergone three brain health checks while in office, with the most recent one occurring in February. Biden asserted that his neurological capacity is tested daily through the decisions he makes and suggested that age brings wisdom.Despite the pressure from fellow Democrats to withdraw from the race, Biden on Thursday in an interaction with reporters reaffirmed his commitment to running for re-election . However, he acknowledged the need to address the concerns of detractors and American voters regarding his fitness for office, particularly following a challenging debate performance.The president highlighted his extensive travel schedule and participation in numerous major events across various states as evidence of his ability to persuade and connect with voters.","US President Joe Biden indicated willingness to undergo a neurological examination if recommended by his doctors.

"Watch: In another slip of tongue, Biden refers to Kamala Harris as 'vice president Trump' in solo press conference",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-in-another-slip-of-tongue-biden-refers-to-kamala-harris-as-vice-president-trump-in-solo-press-conference/articleshow/111674437.cms,"President Biden's solo press conference in Washington on Thursday was marked by a notable gaffe when he mistakenly referred to vice president Kamala Harris as ""vice president Trump"" while responding to the opening question.The president said, ""Look, I wouldn't have picked vice president Trump to be vice president [if] I think she's not qualified to be president,"" confusing Harris with former president, Donald Trump .When a reporter pointed out the error in the final question, asking Biden to comment on the blunder that Trump had used to mock him, the president simply smiled and replied, ""Listen to him,"" before exiting the stage.Earlier, during a Nato event, before the press conference, Biden mistakenly even referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""President Putin"". ""And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin,"" Biden said at the Nato summit in Washington on July 10.The solo press conference, which lasted an hour, was seen as a crucial opportunity for Biden to demonstrate his ability to handle challenging questions and think on his feet in an unscripted setting, especially amidst growing pressure from Democrats for him to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race . This pressure had intensified following his poor performance in the June 27 CNN debate against Donald Trump and his campaign's subsequent inability to address voters' concerns about his health.However, the press conference did not appear to alleviate Democrats' worries. Shortly after Biden left the stage, house representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and house representative Scott Peters, D-Calif, released statements calling for the president to exit the race. Peters said, ""The stakes are high, and we are on a losing course.""Throughout the week and during the press conference, Biden firmly rejected any suggestion that he should or would drop out, maintaining that he was the most capable candidate to defeat Trump in November. He did, however, acknowledge that he would consider leaving the race if his team advised him that there was ""no way"" he could win.Despite his intention to salvage his struggling campaign, the president made several verbal missteps and appeared to lose his train of thought on multiple occasions while answering reporters' questions during the solo news conference. Trump and his campaign shared several clips of Biden's gaffes on Truth Social.In another notable slip, Biden referred to his chief of staff as ""my commander in chief"" before correcting himself. The president said that he -- the American commander-in-chief -- would consult ""my commander-in-chief"" on questions about arming Ukraine.The solo news conference was his first in eight months. Biden's last solo news conference was in November, during a summit with President Xi Jinping of China.","Biden mistakenly referred to vice president Kamala Harris as ""vice president Trump"" While responding to the opening question, Biden said, ""I wouldn't have picked vice president Trump to be vice president [if] I think she's not qualified to be president"" Biden also referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""President Putin"" during a Nato event.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111674518,imgsize-910312,width-400,resizemode-4/111674518.jpg"
US to resume sending shipments of 500-pound bombs to Israel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/us-to-resume-sending-shipments-of-500-pound-bombs-to-israel/articleshow/111674286.cms,"The United States is advancing plans to send 500-pound bombs to Israel, following a pause over concerns about the potential use of 2,000-pound munitions in populated areas, according to a US official. The shipment was halted in early May when Israel appeared to be on the brink of a major ground operation in Rafah , southern Gaza , which the US government strongly opposed.Israel later launched a more limited incursion.""We've been clear that our concern has been on the end-use of the 2,000-pound bombs, particularly in advance of Israel's Rafah campaign which they have announced they are concluding,"" said the US official, speaking anonymously.Due to the way shipments are organized, different munitions are sometimes combined, the official explained. ""Because our concern was not about the 500-pound bombs, those are moving forward as part of the usual process.""Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused President Joe Biden's administration of slowing down weapons deliveries to Israel amid the ongoing Gaza conflict, sparked by the October 7 Hamas attack. US officials denied the allegations, noting that only the single bomb shipment was affected.During a news conference on Thursday, President Biden confirmed that the 2,000-pound bombs would not be sent to Israel. ""I'm not providing the 2,000-pound bombs. They cannot be used in Gaza or any populated area without causing great human tragedy and damage,"" he said.The United States remains Israel's primary military supporter but has expressed frustration over the increasing civilian death toll in Gaza. Since the October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, Israel has conducted extensive operations against Hamas, leading to at least 38,345 deaths, also predominantly civilians, according to Gaza health ministry data. The militants have also taken hostages, with 116 still in Gaza, including 42 presumed dead.","The shipment was halted in early May when Israel appeared to be on the brink of a major ground operation.

Joe Biden Press Conference: Biden's 'big boy' press conference deferred by an hour; 'Past his bedtime',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bidens-big-boy-press-conference-deferred-by-an-hour-past-his-bedtime/articleshow/111669494.cms,"Joe Biden 's first solo press conference later today which the White House billed as the 'big boy' address has been deferred by an hour. According to reports, the adjustment was due to Nato schedule and now be held at 6.30pm instead of 5.30. Donald Trump Jr mocked the rescheduling and said now it has moved past his bed time.This will be the first time he will be facing the press, taking questions from them first time since November -- also first time after the June debate which raised calls from the Democrats to change the candidate.The CNN debacle was followed by the ABC News interview which also did little to control the damage. But amid all these, there were occasions where Biden appeared resolute and defiant.Biden passed the first Nato fitness test as he appeared assertive and coherent on Tuesday in his speech. Thursday is a bigger test for him as he will be closing out the Nato summit and take questions.Biden's health and daily scheduled have come on the radar as his aides defended the dismal performance by saying that Biden functions the best between 10 to 4 daytime window. It was also reported that Biden told Democratic governors that he need to sleep more and that he would limit his public events after 8pm.Some Democrats have suggested that putting Biden into the public eye more often would help ease concerns.Over the course of his three-and-a-half years in office, Biden has held fewer press conferences and interviews combined than presidents dating to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s at the same point in their presidency, data by presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar showed. He has held an average of 10.5 press conferences per year, compared to 22 per year for Trump and 35.5 for George H.W. Bush, according to an analysis by the University of California at Santa Barbara. Reagan had fewer with 5.8 per year.Biden answered more questions than either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, but fewer than either George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, and far fewer than Trump.After Thursday's news conference, Biden's next big interview will be with NBC anchor Lester Holt on Monday.""There will be a lot of eyes on every move Biden makes,"" said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the White House. ""There'll be closer scrutiny - everything he says and does.""Biden's top aides are thinking about performance hurdles and his day-to-day appearances in three phases: Get through a big speech on civil rights in Austin, Texas on Monday, then the Democratic convention in Chicago where Biden is to be formally nominated in mid-August and from there the final push to Election Day on Nov. 5, a source with direct knowledge said.(With agency inputs)","Donald Trump Jr mocked the rescheduling and said now it has moved past his bed time.

""Clooney didn't have eyes on the entire event,"" Kayla said.""I saw Biden three weeks ago at my fundraiser for him.

I’m proud of what my party represents and what it stands for. As part of my participation in the democratic process and in support of my chosen candidate, I have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party’s history. Last month I co-hosted the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden’s re-election.

But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before.

New York auction to sell 150-year-old Stegosaurus skeleton: How much will it cost?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-auction-to-sell-150-year-old-stegosaurus-skeleton-how-much-will-it-cost/articleshow/111649336.cms,"The largest stegosaurus skeleton ever discovered, named Apex , is expected to fetch millions of dollars at a New York auction next week, sparking concerns from paleontologists . The fossil , dating back approximately 150 million years, was unveiled at Sotheby's on Wednesday and will remain on display until its sale on July 17.Apex, standing 11 feet tall and nearly 27 feet long, is described as ""the most complete and best-preserved"" stegosaurus of its size, with 254 fossil bone elements out of an estimated total of 319.This auction is part of a growing trend, criticized by paleontologists who believe such rare finds should be housed in museums or public spaces rather than sold to private collectors.""It's a very, very rare animal, and to find one of this size and this completeness is phenomenal,"" said Cassandra Hatton, head of science and popular culture at Sotheby's.

Project 2025: Inside Trump's plan to reshape America if he wins the presidency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/project-2025-inside-trumps-plan-to-reshape-america-if-he-wins-the-presidency/articleshow/111648390.cms,"Government structure

Social issues and abortion

Immigration

And Climate change

If Donald Trump wins the presidency in November, his administration is likely to follow the roadmap outlined in Project 2025 , a transition plan created by the Heritage Foundation think tank. The plan, nearly 900 pages long, has been labeled as "" authoritarian ,"" ""dystopian,"" and a ""blueprint for destroying our democracy"" by critics.Project 2025 focuses on a wide range of conservative priorities, including restricting abortion access, rolling back LGBTQ+ rights, abandoning efforts to address climate change and income inequality, and implementing sweeping changes to the federal government workforce.Despite Trump's attempts to distance himself from the document, Project 2025 has been spearheaded by former Trump administration officials, including Paul Dans and Russell Vought. More than 100 conservative organizations have contributed to the plan, many of which would hold significant influence in Washington if Republicans regain control of the White House.The recent spike in attention surrounding the document has been fueled by liberal opposition to it, particularly in light of President Joe Biden's poor debate performance and the US Supreme Court decision strengthening presidential immunity.The four main policy aims of Project 2025 are: restoring the family as the centerpiece of American life, dismantling the administrative state, defending the nation's sovereignty and borders, and securing individual rights. However, the document has faced criticism for its potential to undermine democracy and lead to political violence. Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts' comments about a potential ""second American revolution"" have further stoked concerns among Democrats, who accuse Trump and his allies of ""dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America.""The following are some of the main suggestions outlined in Project 2025:In terms of government structure, the plan advocates for the application of the ""unitary executive theory"", which would bring all federal agencies, including the department of justice, under the president's direct authority. This would streamline the decision-making process and enable the president to implement policies more efficiently across various sectors.Furthermore, the proposal seeks to remove job security for many government employees, allowing them to be replaced by individuals appointed based on political affiliations. The document also strongly criticizes the FBI, describing it as a ""bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization"".The Project 2025 policy book outlines several recommendations for the department of health and human services regarding abortion and social issues. One of the key proposals is for the Food and Drug Administration to overturn its long-standing approval of mifepristone, a commonly used abortion pill that has been available for over two decades.Additionally, the policy book advocates for the implementation of stricter regulations surrounding the use of mifepristone. These proposed changes include limiting the timeframe in which the medication can be taken to seven weeks into a pregnancy, as against the current 10-week window.Another significant social issue addressed in the policy book is the participation of transgender individuals in the military. During his first four years in office, Trump banned transgender people from serving in the military. Biden reversed that policy, but the Project 2025 policy book calls for the ban to be reinstated.The document outlines a plan to bolster funding for the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border, which was one of the key promises made by Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign.In addition to the border wall, Project 2025 suggests a significant restructuring of the immigration enforcement apparatus. The plan involves dismantling the Department of Homeland Security and merging its functions with other immigration enforcement units across various agencies.The document also includes several other proposals aimed at tightening immigration policies. These include the elimination of specific visa categories designed for victims of crime and human trafficking, as well as increasing the fees imposed on immigrants.The Republican platform outlines a significant shift in the nation's approach to climate change and energy policy. It advocates for substantial cuts to government funding for research and development in the renewable energy sector. Instead, the document urges the incoming administration to ""stop the war on oil and natural gas,"" signaling a move away from clean energy initiatives.Under the proposed plan, the focus would pivot from reducing carbon emissions to increasing energy production and ensuring energy security for the country.","Project 2025 is a transition plan created by the Heritage Foundation think tank.

However, Globalnews reported that according to one of Ontario’s top doctors, nine people have contracted this contamination and 5 have been hospitalised, in the province.According to the CFIA , it is hard to determine a contaminated food item with Listeria as it doesn’t cause any foul smell or change in appearance. Still, it can cause serious illness in the body.Some common symptoms of Listeria illness mostly include gut-related symptoms like cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In some cases, it can also cause fever, neck stiffness, headache and muscle aches. However, in exceptional cases, it may prove fatal.CFIA further informed people that a food safety investigation was still going on which could cause additional products to be withdrawn.

Slip-ups to addressing health concerns: Key takeaways from Biden's press conference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/slip-ups-to-addressing-health-concerns-key-takeaways-from-bidens-press-conference/articleshow/111674611.cms,"Here are the key takeaways from Biden's first solo news conference:

Slip-up came early

On Kamala Harris being a potential replacement

On Israel-Gaza war

Will Biden drop out of the race?

On health concerns

US President Joe Biden faced the much-anticipated challenge on Thursday - a solo press conference where he was questioned by the White House press corps.The purpose of this news conference was to reassure discouraged Democratic lawmakers, allies, and persuadable voters in the upcoming election that Biden still possesses the strength and stamina required to be president.Biden has blamed his dismal debate performance on ""feeling terrible"" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign.During the press conference, President Biden made a notable gaffe early on when he mistakenly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as ""Vice President Trump."" The slip-up occurred while explaining his decision to choose her as his running mate, believing she could defeat Trump in an election.Prior to the news conference, Biden had already committed a significant blunder at the NATO summit, which instantly lowered expectations for his performance. While introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Biden accidentally said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin."" The mistake immediately elicited gasps from the audience. Realizing his error, Biden quickly corrected himself, turning to Zelenskyy and saying, ""President Putin? You're going to beat President Putin.""When a reporter brought up Biden's reference to ""Vice President Trump"" and pointed out that the presumptive Republican nominee's campaign was already capitalizing on the slip-up, the President remained defiant. ""Listen to him,"" he said before exiting the stage, refusing to engage further with the question or acknowledge the potential impact of his mistake.When asked about Harris' capability to take over his role, Biden affirmed his confidence in her qualifications, stating, ""I wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president,"" and highlighted her experience as a prosecutor and US Senator.However, when questioned further, Biden admitted that he had shifted away from his 2020 campaign promise to serve as a ""bridge"" to a new generation of Democrats.He attributed this change to ""the gravity of the situation I inherited,"" without mentioning his vice president. Biden emphasized his commitment to completing his current responsibilities, repeatedly asserting, ""I've got to finish this job.""Biden announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire framework, although some details still need to be finalized. He mentioned that he had dispatched his team to the region to work out the specifics of the agreement.""That framework is now agreed on by both Israel and Hamas. So I sent my team to the region to hammer out the details,"" Biden said in a news conference.The President also stated that the conflict between Israel and Gaza must end immediately, and that Israel should not occupy the enclave once the war concludes. Additionally, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the outcome of some of his initiatives in Gaza, particularly the planned closure of the US military's humanitarian pier off the coast of Gaza. ""I was hopeful that would be more successful,"" he said.President Biden dismissed concerns about his capability to serve another term, despite stumbling over a reference to Donald Trump early in the press conference.""I'm not in this for my legacy. I'm in this to complete the job I started,"" Biden asserted, emphasizing that his support among voters remained strong and that he would continue his campaign and secure victory.Regardless of any missteps, the president countered all implications that he was slowing down, exhibiting significant signs of decline, or struggling to lead effectively. However, he faced increasing pressure from politicians, public figures, and prominent members of the Democratic Party to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race .""My schedule has been full bore,"" he affirmed. ""So if I slow down and I cant get the job done, that's a sign that I shouldn't be doing it. But there's no indication of that yet — none.""""I'm determined on running but I think it's important that I allay fears — let them see me out there,"" he concluded, expressing his commitment to the campaign while acknowledging the need to address any apprehensions about his candidacy.President Biden has affirmed that his health remains robust and that he is open to undergoing an additional neurological examination to assess his cognitive abilities if his medical team advises it.The President disclosed that he has already undergone three rigorous neurological evaluations, with the most recent one taking place in February. He stated, ""I am in good shape,"" based on the feedback from his physicians. Currently, there are no recommendations from his doctors for him to undergo another such examination.(With agency inputs)","US President Joe Biden held his first solo press conference on Thursday.

Biden mistakenly refers to Zelenskiyy as 'Putin' at Nato event

During a crucial press conference on Thursday, US President Joe Biden , who faces significant scrutiny regarding his mental fitness, made a verbal slip that drew ridicule from former President Donald Trump .On his Truth Social platform, Trump sarcastically said, ""Crooked Joe begins his 'Big Boy' Press Conference with, 'I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president...Great job, Joe!""On Thursday, during a news conference aimed at addressing concerns about his age and ability to run for re-election, President Joe Biden, 81, inadvertently referred to his vice president, Kamala Harris , as ""Vice President Trump.""Biden said, ""Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if she was not qualified to be president. So start there,"" in response to a question from Reuters regarding his confidence in Harris.Earlier that day, at a high-stakes press conference following the Nato summit in Washington, Biden mistakenly referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy as ""President Putin,"" causing gasps from those in attendance. ""And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin,"" Biden said.He quickly corrected himself, saying, ""Going to beat President Putin, President Zelenskiyy. I am so focused on beating Putin.""These gaffes have fueled growing doubts among donors, supporters, and fellow Democrats about Biden's ability to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the November election and effectively lead the country for another four-year term. Biden's campaign has been struggling since his lacklustre debate performance against his 78-year-old Republican rival, Donald Trump.Thus far, 13 out of the 213 democrats in the House and one of the 51 democrats in the Senate have publicly called for the president to withdraw from the race. If Biden's performance at the press conference is unsatisfactory, more Democrats may voice their concerns publicly.","US President Joe Biden, 81, made a verbal slip that drew ridicule from former President Donald Trump.

Thermonuclear blasts & new species: Inside Musk's plan to colonise Mars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thermonuclear-blasts-new-species-inside-musks-plan-to-colonise-mars/articleshow/111674217.cms,"For over two decades, Elon Musk has focused SpaceX , his rocket company, on his lifelong goal of reaching Mars. Over the last year, he has also ramped up work on what will happen if he gets there.Musk, 53, has directed SpaceX employees to drill into the design and details of a Martian city, according to people with knowledge of the efforts and documents viewed by NYT.One team is drawing up plans for small dome habitats, including the materials to build them. Another is working on spacesuits to combat Mars' hostile environment, while a medical team is researching whether humans can have children there. Musk has volunteered his sperm to help seed a colony .The initiatives, which are in their infancy, are a shift toward more concrete planning for life on Mars as Musk's timeline has hastened. While he said in 2016 it would take 40-100 years to have a self-sustaining civilisation on the planet, Musk told SpaceX employees in April he now expects one million people to be living there in about 20 years.""There's high urgency to making life multi-planetary,"" he's said. ""We've got to do it while civilisation is so strong.""Musk has long tried to defy the impossible and has often managed to beat tough odds. But his vision for life on Mars takes his seemingly limitless ambitions to their most extreme - and some might say absurdist - point. No one has ever set foot on the planet. Nasa doesn't expect to land humans on Mars until the 2040s. And if people get there, they will be greeted by a barren terrain, icy temperatures, dust storms, and air that's impossible to breathe.Yet Musk is so wedded to the idea of creating a civilisation on Mars - he once said he plans to die there - that it has propelled nearly every business endeavour he has undertaken on Earth. His vision for Mars underlies most of the six companies he leads or owns, each of which could potentially contribute to an extraterrestrial colony, according to the documents and the people.Musk, worth about $270 billion, has publicly declared that he only accumulates assets to fund his plans for Mars. While Musk has spoken about Mars for years and SpaceX released two basic drawings of a colony around 2018, many specifics and the company's shift toward civilisation planning haven't previously been reported.Musk has been fascinated by Mars since reading Isaac Asimov's 1951 novel, ""Foundation,"" when he was 10. In the book, the protagonist builds a colony across a galaxy to save humanity from the fall of an interstellar empire. But people close to Musk said he was just trying to best Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder who envisions humans living in giant space stations across the solar system.To reach Mars, SpaceX has built Starship, a nearly 400-foot reusable rocket. A future version of Starship may have a living space in its nose. Musk has said he hoped to create his own species on Mars, an idea he has repeated over the years to those close to the company. ""I think it's quite likely that we'd want to bioengineer new organisms that are better suited to living on Mars,"" he said. ""Humanity's kind of done that over time, by sort of selective breeding.""He also has a strategy for warmth. He's said he would tackle icy temperatures with a series of thermonuclear explosions that would warm the planet by creating artificial suns. Hundreds of solar panels will help create energy. The industrial design team has been creating renderings for a city, which will centre on a giant dome for communal living, with smaller domes scattered around it. Musk is particularly concerned with making sure the city looks cool, two people said. In April, Musk told SpaceX employees the Mars colony would be self-sustaining in case something happened to Earth. To achieve that, Musk plans to use Starship as sort of a Noah's Ark, three people said. nyt","Musk, 53, has directed SpaceX employees to drill into the design and details of a Martian city.

US President Joe Biden's first solo press conference since November: Top quotes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-joe-bidens-first-solo-press-conference-since-november-top-quotes/articleshow/111673828.cms,"Here is what Biden said in the press briefing

After opening the news conference by talking about Nato and security for Ukraine, Biden shifted to discussing inflation and border security in the US, and negotiations for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.

in the US, and negotiations for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. The first question of Biden’s press conference was about him losing support among many of his fellow Democrats and key unions, and about Vice President Kamala Harris possibly replacing him on the ticket. Biden was at first defiant, saying the “UAW endorsed me, but go ahead,” meaning the United Autoworkers. But then he flubbed the answer, mixing up Harris and Trump: “I wouldn’t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if she wasn’t qualified.”

Biden was asked how it might hurt his place in the history books if he were to keep running and lose to Trump in November — but insisted he’s not concerned. Instead, his focus, he said, is continuing four more years of policies to grow the economy and help the middle class. “I’m not in this for my legacy,” Biden said. “I’m in this to complete the job I started.”

Biden says he never suggested he needs an earlier bedtime. The president told reporters that, in previous conversations, what he meant was “it’d be smarter to pace myself a little bit.” Biden also vowed that, ahead of his second debate with Trump in September, “I’m not going to be traveling 15 time zones. Pace myself. Pace myself,” he added.

Biden said the best way to reassure anyone who is concerned about him having another “bad night” is “the way I assure myself and that is: ‘Am I getting the job done?’” The president said “there’s no indication yet” that he’s slowing down on that front.

Biden’s press conference shifted largely from questions about if he’s up to continuing his reelection campaign to foreign policy. “There isn’t any world leader I’m not prepared to deal with,” the president said. He also vowed to maintain a hardline against Russian President Vladimir Putin: “If we allow Russia to succeed in Ukraine, they’re not stopping in Ukraine.

US President Joe Biden on Thursday held a solo press conference at the Nato summit , marking his first solo press appearance since November. His remarks coincided with Nato members extending support to Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion that began in February 2022. The United States has been Ukraine's most crucial partner in providing military assistance during the conflict.Although the primary subject matter of the engagement was just-concluded Nato summit, Americans of all hues and interested parties across the world watched every word and gesture to determine if the 81-year President retains the cognitive ability to run for a second term in the White House.","Biden says he never suggested he needs an earlier bedtime.

Officials are calling the boy a "" miracle baby "" due to his incredible endurance and survival in such harsh conditions, New York Post reported.Despite numerous insect bites, the toddler was found to be in good health, according to Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Gary ""Stitch"" Guillory, who shared the miraculous news with the media.The child's identity has not been released. He was feared dead after his older sibling, a four-year-old boy, was tragically found drowned in a lake behind the Interstate 10 welcome center near the Texas border.On Monday night, their mother, Aaliyah Jack, 25, was arrested in Meridian, Mississippi, which is approximately 350 miles away from Lake Charles, where the siblings were found. This underscores the remoteness of the small city in southwestern Louisiana, located about 143 miles east of Houston, Texas, 206 miles west of New Orleans, and just 37 miles from the Texas boundary.A truck driver discovered the toddler crawling along a major road and immediately contacted law enforcement, as reported by the Mirror US. Sheriff Guillory expressed immense relief at the boy's discovery during a press briefing, stating, ""We consider this one-year-old our miracle baby because he was still alive.""He added, ""This child spent two days outside in the elements on the side of the highway. Thank God that trucker saw him."" Hurricane Beryl hit eastern Texas early on Monday, complicating the search with intermittent heavy rain and strong winds.Authorities were preparing to search the waters near where the older boy was found on Tuesday morning when they received the 911 call about the baby.While investigating the death of the four-year-old, authorities learned he had last been seen with his mother on Saturday, and his baby brother had been with them. The family is from Lake Charles.The circumstances of the older boy's death and why the mother fled, leaving her one-year-old son behind, remain unclear. After her arrest on Monday night, Kayla Vincent, a spokeswoman for the sheriff, said the only charge pending against the mother as of Wednesday afternoon was failure to report a missing child.Vincent mentioned no other charges were being pursued against the mother, but the investigation is ongoing. She is to be extradited to Louisiana from Mississippi, with a $300,000 bond set by a Louisiana judge.Online booking records were not available on Wednesday, and it was unclear whether the mother had secured legal representation. Autopsy reports for the four-year-old are pending, and his official cause of death has not yet been disclosed.","A truck driver discovered the toddler crawling along a major road and immediately contacted law enforcement.

Hungary's Viktor Orban to meet Trump at Mar-a-Lago after calling him 'man of peace',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hungarys-viktor-orban-to-meet-trump-at-mar-a-lago-after-calling-him-man-of-peace/articleshow/111670024.cms,"Former US president Donald Trump will meet with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Florida on Thursday, less than a week after he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Chinese President Xi Jinping In Beijing. The visit has led to speculation that the Hungarian leader is working as an intermediary between Putin and Trump.The New York Times reported the meeting, based on information from a Trump campaign official and someone close to the former president.The report did not specify the topics to be discussed at this unexpected meeting. Orban has been traveling extensively since taking on the role of president of the European Union.Orban was in the US this week to attend the multi-day Nato summit , marking the 75th anniversary of the organization. The summit takes place amid ongoing concerns about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the future of the European Union.Hungary’s presidency, part of a rotating leadership scheme, lasts six months and holds limited power. However, Orban quickly used the position to initiate discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping before meeting with Trump.Orban has long admired Trump, even suggesting that Hungary would ""make Europe great again."" Trump previously met with Orban at Mar-a-Lago in March while focusing on US foreign policy.In an interview, Orban stated there is a ""very, very high chance"" that the next American president will not be the current one and avoided commenting on President Biden’s fitness for office. He also praised Trump in generous terms as a “self-made man” who has a “different approach to everything.”""He is the man of peace. Under his four-year term he did not initiate a single war, and he did a lot in order to create peace in old conflicts in very complicated areas of the world.”In Washington , his political director, Balázs Orbán, took to the stage at the rightwing National Conservatism conference, while his foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, told Reuters that, “We see a chance for peace if President Trump is winning. We see a chance for good Hungary-US relationships if President Trump is winning.“I think a very strong external impact must take place in order to make them negotiate at least.

"World population to peak at 10.3b by 2080s, life expectancy returns to pre-Covid levels : UN report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/world-population-to-peak-at-10-3b-by-2080s-life-expectancy-returns-to-pre-covid-levels-un-report/articleshow/111669844.cms,"NEW DELHI: The world’s population is expected to peak within the current century to reach around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s, up from 8.2 billion in 2024. After peaking, it is projected to start declining, gradually falling to 10.2 billion by the end of the century.While in 63 countries, like China and Japan, population peaked before 2024, India and the US are placed among 126 countries where the peak is expected in the second half of the century or beyond 2100.Significantly, one in four people live in a country whose population has already peaked.These findings, part of the ‘ World Population Prospects 2024’ report released by the UN on Thursday, also highlight that since 2022, life expectancy has returned to pre-Covid levels in nearly all countries and areas. After a brief decline during the pandemic, global life expectancy at birth has reached 73.3 years in 2024 (an increase of 8.4 years since 1995) up from 70.9 years during the pandemic.“Further reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average longevity of around 77.4 years globally in 2054. By the late 2050s, more than half of all global deaths will occur at age 80 or higher, a substantial increase from 17% in 1995,” the report shows.By the late 2070s, the number of persons at ages 65 years and higher globally is projected to reach 2.2 billion, surpassing the number of children (under age 18). By the mid-2030s, it is projected that there will be 265 million persons aged 80 years or older, more than the number of infants (1 year of age or less).Even in countries that are still growing rapidly and have relatively youthful populations, the number of persons aged 65 or older is expected to rise over the next 30 years.According to a press statement released from New York, the analysis in the report prepared by the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) shows that the size of the world’s population in 2100 is now expected to be 6% lower — or 700 million fewer — than anticipated a decade ago according to the ‘World Population Prospects 2024’ report released by the UN on Thursday.In 63 countries and areas, containing 28% of the world’s population in 2024, the size of the population peaked before 2024. This category includes countries like China, Germany, Japan and the Russian Federation, and the total population of this group is projected to decline by 14% over the next thirty years.For another 48 countries with 10% of the world’s population, including Brazil, Iran, Türkiye and Vietnam, the population is projected to peak between 2025 and 2054.In the remaining 126 countries, including India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United States of America, the population is expected to increase through 2054 and, potentially, to peak in the second half of the century or beyond 2100.In nine countries of this last group, including Angola, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger and Somalia, very rapid growth is projected, with their total population doubling between 2024 and 2054.The report highlights that rapid fertility declines in populous countries is a likely cause for the global population to peak within this century (80%), contrasting with a decade ago when the probability was around 30%.“The demographic landscape has evolved greatly in recent years,"" said Li Junhua, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. ""In some countries, the birth rate is now even lower than previously anticipated, and we are also seeing slightly faster declines in some high-fertility regions. The earlier and lower peak is a hopeful sign. This could mean reduced environmental pressures from human impacts due to lower aggregate consumption,” Junhua added.“The earlier population peak is due to several factors, including lower levels of fertility in some of the world’s largest countries, especially China. Globally, women are having one child fewer, on average, than they did around 1990,” the analysis shows.The data brings into focus that in more than half of all countries, the average number of live births per woman is below 2.1—the level required for a population to maintain a constant size over the long term without migration—and nearly a fifth of all countries and areas, including China, Italy, the Republic of Korea and Spain, now have “ultra-low” fertility, with fewer than 1.4 live births per woman over a lifetime.On what the journey onwards is expected to look like, the report states that the main driver of global population increase through mid-century will be the momentum created by growth in the past. ""The number of women at ages 15–49 is projected to grow from nearly 2 billion in 2024 to a peak of around 2.2 billion in the late 2050s, driving continued growth even if the number of births per woman falls to the replacement level."" Moreover, today’s youthful age structure, which is a product of past growth, will account for 79% of the population increase through 2054, adding about 1.4 billion people.The analysis also shows that the countries with youthful populations and declining fertility have a limited time to benefit economically from an increasing concentration of population in the working ages. ""In about 100 countries or areas, the working-age population (between 20 and 64 years) will grow through 2054, offering a window of opportunity known as the demographic dividend,"" the UN report states and recommends that to capitalize on this opportunity, countries must invest in education, health, and infrastructure, and implement reforms to create jobs and improve government efficiency.For some populations, immigration will be the main driver of future growth. ""In 50 countries and areas, immigration is projected to attenuate the decline in population size due to sustained low levels of fertility and an older age structure. However, in 14 countries and areas already experiencing ultra-low fertility, emigration is likely to contribute to reducing population size through 2054,"" the report states.The data also shows that early pregnancies remain a challenge, particularly in low-income countries. In 2024, 4.7 million babies, or about 3.5% of the total worldwide, were born to mothers under age 18 – and some 340,000, to girls under age 15 – with serious consequences for the health and well-being of both the young mothers and their children.The UN calls for investing in the education of youth, especially girls, and increasing the ages at marriage and first childbearing in countries where these milestone events tend to occur early will have positive effects on women’s health, educational attainment and labour force participation. ""These efforts will also contribute to slowing population growth and reducing the scale of the investments required to achieve sustainable development while ensuring that no one is left behind,"" the report asserts.","The world’s population is expected to peak within the current century to reach around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s. After peaking, it is projected to start declining, gradually falling to 10.2 billion by the end of the century. In 63 countries, like China and Japan, population peaked before 2024, India and the US are placed among 126 countries where the peak is expected in the second half of thecentury or beyond 2100.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111669848,imgsize-2260147,width-400,resizemode-4/111669848.jpg"
Pakistan's begging business collects $42 billion annually: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-begging-business-collects-42-billion-annually-report/articleshow/111667723.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's economy is in a precarious state, prompting the government to seek financial assistance from other nations and international organizations. This has led to the term 'begging' becoming a significant part of the country's political discourse, with citizens lamenting the need to constantly seek foreign aid .Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged this issue two years ago, stating, ""Today, when we go to any friendly country or make a phone call, they think that we have come to beg for money.""While the government seeks financial help, begging has become an organized industry within Pakistan, with beggars operating in cities and towns and even being exported to other countries.The government has recently decided to block the passports of more than 2,000 beggars for seven years and also restrict the activities of agents who facilitate this overseas begging business . Pakistani beggars primarily operate in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq.A parliamentary probe revealed that a significant number of beggars arrested in foreign countries were of Pakistani origin, with many exploiting pilgrim visas to travel to holy sites. The Interior Ministry has offloaded 44,000 individuals in the past two and a half years, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called for increased screening before issuing passports.Within Pakistan, begging is a highly organized and competitive business, with an estimated 38 million beggars in the country. The average daily amount collected by beggars varies across cities, with Karachi having the highest at Rs 2,000. Annually, beggars extract $42 billion, which is more than 12% of Pakistan's GDP. Turf wars between beggars for lucrative spots are common, with some even resorting to violence.The government has struggled to abolish beggary, and police action against beggars has often been met with resistance. In 2011, hundreds of beggars clashed with police officials in Faisalabad, throwing stones and bricks at the police station. One beggar remarked, ""Since when has begging become a crime in Pakistan? We will stop begging the moment our government stops begging from the IMF and other foreign countries.""","Pakistan's economy is in a precarious state, prompting the government to seek financial assistance from other nations and international organizations.

The ban was clamped on Feb 17 based on ""intelligence reports"".""The hostile elements operating on X have nefarious intentions to create an environment of chaos and instability, with the ultimate goal of destabilising the country and plunging it into some form of anarchy,"" the ministry said.","Pakistan's ISI has received a carte blanche from the Shehbaz Sharif govt to intercept phone calls and messages ""in the interest of national security"" The move comes in the wake of criticism by some Pakistani judges, journalists, opposition politicians and supporters of jailed former PM Imran Khan.

The appeal was filed after the Election Commission of Pakistan rejected the SIC's plea for awarding its share in the 70 reserved seats in the National Assembly and another 156 in the four provincial assemblies.The SIC became prominent after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party-supported candidates joined the party after winning the elections as jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's PTI could not contest the polls and was not eligible to claim the seats reserved for women and minorities.The seats were awarded to the winning parties based on proportional representation .The ECP had rejected the SIC plea for reserved seats as it had not contested the elections and got strength when PTI-backed independently elected candidates joined after the elections.Its appeal against the ECP decision in the Peshawar High Court was also turned down. Subsequently, the party challenged it in the Supreme Court.A 13-member bench headed by Chief Justice Faez Isa and comprising justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Munib Akhtar, Yahya Afridi, Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Athar Minallah, Syed Hasan Rizvi, Shahid Waheed, Irfan Saadat Khan and Naeem Akhtar Afghan heard the case.Chief Justice Isa announced at the conclusion of the proceedings that the panel decided to reserve the verdict for mutual consultation.He did not give any date for the announcement of the judgment, which is expected this week.""We will see if a short judgment can be announced,"" the chief justice remarked while reserving the judgment.Earlier, the Supreme Court on May 6 in a major relief to the PTI, suspended the Peshawar High Court's decision about rejecting the SIC plea.Following the ruling, the ECP on May 14 suspended the victory notifications of 77 candidates who belonged to other parties and were declared successful on the reserved seats.The final ruling by the top court in the case would decide the fate of those 77 reserved seats. Though it may not change the current power structure, the changes in the overall number game in the assemblies may impact the law-making process in the country.The problem of the PTI began when just before the general election, it was deprived of its symbol of cricket bat by the ECP for failure to hold the intra-party election according to its Constitution. It forced PTI to field its candidates as independents.PTI candidates joined the SIC to secure a due share in the reserved seats, but the ECP rejected the SIC plea for reserved seats by saying that it had not contested elections and also did not provide a list of candidates for the reserved seats within the stipulated time, which was mandatory.",Pakistan's Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its judgment in a key petition by the opposition Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party.

More than half a million others escaped Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in 2021, with thousands waiting in Pakistan for resettlement in the United States and elsewhere.Since the widely criticised clampdown started in November, an estimated 600,000 Afghans have returned home.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, who arrived in Pakistan on Sunday, spent two days meeting Afghan refugees.

Pakistan will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue: Finance minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-will-continue-to-seek-imf-bailouts-if-it-fails-to-boost-tax-revenue-finance-minister/articleshow/111580232.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has warned that the cash-strapped country will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue , according to a media report on Monday. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader in an interview with the the UK-based Financial Times newspaper said that he was ""relatively confident"" of reaching a staff-level agreement with the Washington-based global lender this month for an estimated loan of $6-8 billion.Aurangzeb, however, said, ""It will not be our last fund programme if we don't bring our tax revenues up.""Last month, the federal government passed the tax-laden Rs 18,877 billion budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, amidst protests from the Opposition which labelled it as an International Monetary Fund-driven document that was harmful to the public.Weeks after slashing the fuel prices ahead of the Eid ul Adha festival, the cash-strapped Pakistan government on July 1 sharply hiked their prices for the next fortnight as it began the new fiscal year.The tax rises will mostly fall on salaried workers, who comprise a relatively small part of Pakistan's mostly informal economy , as well as some retail and export businesses, Geo News reported.The budget also threatened punitive measures for tax avoiders, including restrictions on mobile phones, gas and electricity access and the ability to fly abroad.""We do not have five years for our programme,"" Aurangzeb warned in the wake of a budget that seeks to reset the country's ailing economy. ""We have to start showing, start delivering, in the next two to three months,"" he said.The finance minister said the direction of travel is positive, and investors are showing confidence in the stock market , referring to the KSE-100 index.Still, the government faces a considerable challenge in putting Pakistan on the path for longer-term growth and debt sustainability , he said.The country's debt has soared since the mid-2000s, as authorities failed to invest the money from loans into productive and export-oriented sectors, Geo News reported.Instead, the country remains reliant on imports, forcing Islamabad to borrow to pay off existing and accumulating debts, Aurangzeb said.""We need to create the capacity to repay loans,"" the finance minister said. ""As long as this economy stays import-based, what happens is the moment it heats up, ""we run out of dollars [and] we have to go back to the lender of last resort on our knees.""Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has travelled recently to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China to solicit investments on top of the IMF programme, which would be Pakistan's 24th with the multilateral lender.","Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb says Pakistan will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue.

Pakistan Public Sector Enterprises: Pakistan's public sector enterprises suffocate under mounting PKR 1.7 trillion debt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-public-sector-enterprises-suffocate-under-mounting-pkr-1-7-trillion-debt/articleshow/111564121.cms,"KARACHI: The Pakistan government's efforts to reform its public sector enterprises (PSEs) have been marred by persistent challenges, as highlighted by recent fiscal data and international funding initiatives, Dawn reported.Despite a substantial loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) aimed at bolstering reforms , the cumulative debt of PSEs has soared to PKR 1.7 trillion, with an additional borrowing exceeding Rs 43 billion in the fiscal year 2024.Economic priorities underscore the urgency of privatising PSEs to alleviate the strain on the national budget, a crucial step also mandated for securing future loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The allocation for PSEs in the 2024-25 budget saw a dramatic increase, reaching PKR 1.267 trillion, largely earmarked for subsidies and grants, marking a 104 per cent surge from the previous fiscal year.The State Bank of Pakistan 's latest report reveals a notable decrease in PSE borrowing during FY23, contrasting sharply with the PKR 43.5 billion borrowed in FY24 alone, adding to the existing debt burden. Despite receiving substantial funding from the ADB, which initiated the USD 300 million Public Sector Enterprises Reform Programme (PSERP) in 2016, aimed at enhancing corporate governance and operational efficiency, meaningful reforms have been elusive.Former finance minister Ishaq Dar, during his tenure, committed to improving PSE performance, particularly in sectors like railways, Pakistan Steel, and Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). However, the political sensitivity surrounding the privatisation of major PSEs, significant employers in a job-scarce economy, has hindered progress on critical economic reforms.""The ADB's support began with a USD 300 million loan for sub-programme one in June 2016, followed by an additional USD 300 million for sub-programme two in 2017, aimed at sustaining and expanding initial reform efforts,"" noted an ADB report. Despite these efforts, the transformation of loss-making entities such as PIA and Pakistan Steel remains a contentious issue, highlighting the challenges of balancing economic imperatives with political realities, according to Dawn.Many PSEs continue to rely heavily on government subsidies and credit guarantees to maintain operations, underscoring persistent governance and accountability deficiencies. The ADB's objectives included enhancing transparency, performance management, and revenue generation in PSEs, aligning their operations with commercial principles to improve service delivery and financial sustainability.The failure to implement comprehensive reforms has perpetuated the financial woes of PSEs, jeopardising fiscal stability and inhibiting broader economic development, Dawn reported.
