'You have to vote' Trump tells US evangelical Christians,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-have-to-vote-trump-tells-us-evangelical-christians/articleshow/111199497.cms,"WASHINGTON: Former US president Donald Trump urged evangelical Christians Saturday to vote en masse for him in November, vowing to ""aggressively"" protect their religious freedom if he is elected.The ex-leader, who rarely appears in church himself, has built a crucial base among the religious right, promising -- and delivering -- on some of their biggest priorities, including by appointing Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the federal right to abortion.""The evangelicals and the Christians, they don't vote as much as they should,"" Trump told hundreds of supporters at a Washington conference put on by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a conservative advocacy group.""They go to church every Sunday, but they don't vote,"" he said, adding in a half-joke that ""in four years, you don't have to vote.

Eight from ship that crashed into Baltimore bridge leave for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eight-from-ship-that-crashed-into-baltimore-bridge-leave-for-india/articleshow/111196518.cms,"WASHINGTON: Eight Indian crew members of the cargo ship 'Dali' that crashed into a famed Baltimore bridge in March left for India on Friday after nearly three months on the mammoth vessel. According to Baltimore Maritime Exchange, four of the 21 crew members are still on board the 984-foot cargo ship MV Dali , which is tentatively scheduled to leave Friday evening for Norfolk, Virginia.

The rest of the crew has been moved to a service apartment in Baltimore and will remain there pending an investigation. Notably, 20 of the crew members were Indian nationals. They were on board the MV Dali Cargo, which struck the pillars of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge resulting in its collapse and the death of six construction workers in the tragic incident. Dali will undergo repair at Norfolk.

The departure of eight Indian crew members including a cook, a fitter and seamen follows a deal approved by the judge. None of these are officers. The rest 13 would remain in the US, mainly because of the pending investigations. ""They're anxious, under considerable stress considering they don't know the future. They don't know when they'll see their family again or how they'll be treated here,"" Rev Joshua Messick, director of the Baltimore International Seafarers' Center and chaplain for the Port of Baltimore told CNN.

None of the crew members have been charged in connection with the disaster. FBI and other federal agencies are conducting the investigations.

39 killed in Israeli strikes across North Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/39-killed-in-israeli-strikes-across-north-gaza/articleshow/111196840.cms,"DEIR AL-BALAH (GAZA STRIP): At least 39 people were killed by Israeli air strikes across northern Gaza on Saturday, according to Palestinian and hospital officials.

Fadel Naem, director of the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, said more than three dozen bodies arrived at the hospital. The Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency group active in Gaza, said it pulled approximately the same number of bodies from a building hit by an Israeli strike in an eastern neighbourhood of Gaza City. Israel said Saturday that its fighter jets struck two Hamas military sites in the Gaza City area but did not elaborate further. The deaths come a day after at least 25 people were killed in strikes.

Israel said Saturday that it was continuing to operate in central and southern Gaza and has pushed ahead with its invasion of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from fighting elsewhere.

A separate Israeli strike Saturday in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley killed a member of the military wing of al-Jamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, a Sunni Muslim faction closely allied with Hamas, according to the group. The member was the seventh killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since the war began.

This attack, which took place on Saturday, aimed at two cement tankers and two cargo ships, was executed using drones, Reuters reported.In a televised statement early on Sunday, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree detailed the operation. Saree specifically noted the ships belonged to companies that ""violated the ban on entering the ports of occupied Palestine.""The Israeli military has not commented on this event. Previously, they had denied a similar claim by the Houthis earlier this month.Saree added that the group had also attacked the Shorthorn Express in the Mediterranean using drones. This was part of the Houthis' ongoing campaign to disrupt shipping in key waterways, as an act of solidarity with Palestinians involved in the Gaza conflict.There has been no independent confirmation of these attacks.The Iran-aligned Houthis have been conducting drone and missile strikes in shipping lanes since November.

DUBAI: An attack by Yemen 's Houthi rebels targeted a commercial ship travelling through the Gulf of Aden but apparently caused no damage, authorities said Saturday, in the latest strike on the shipping lane by the group.

The Houthi attack comes after the sinking this week of the ship Tutor, which marked what appears to be a new escalation by the Iranian-backed Houthis in their campaign of strikes on ships in the vital maritime corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.

Meanwhile, US officials reportedly ordered the USS Dwight D Eisenhower, the aircraft carrier leading America's response to the Houthi attacks, to return home after a twice-extended tour. The captain of the ship targeted late Friday saw ""explosions in the vicinity of the vessel"", the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations centre said. A later briefing by the US-overseen Joint Maritime Information Centre said the vessel reported two explosions off its port side and a third one later. ""It was not hit and sustained no damage,"" the centre said. ""The vessel and crew are reported to be safe and are proceeding to their next port of call.""

The Houthis have launched more than 60 attacks targeting specific vessels and fired off other missiles and drones in their campaign that has killed a total of four sailors. They have seized one vessel and sunk two since November. A US-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say.

In March, the Belize-flagged Rubymar carrying fertilizer became the first to sink after taking on water for days following a rebel attack.ap

Breakthrough in MH370 search: Researchers detect promising new signal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/breakthrough-in-mh370-search-researchers-detect-promising-new-signal/articleshow/111118450.cms,"Initial search and early efforts (2014-2015)

Search Suspension:

Renewed Efforts and Technological Advances (2018-Present)

A newly detected signal might finally provide answers to the long-standing mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 , which vanished nearly ten years ago. British researchers from Cardiff University have identified a fresh clue that could help pinpoint the final resting place of the ill-fated jet.The signal, detected recently, is being hailed as a significant development in the search for MH370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board. Despite extensive searches over the years, the plane's exact location has remained elusive.Richard Godfrey, a British engineer who has been heavily involved in the search efforts, said, ""We have detected a weak signal that could potentially be from the aircraft. This is the first time we have such a lead in years.""The researchers believe the new signal could help narrow down the search area in the southern Indian Ocean, where the aircraft is believed to have ended its flight. The signal's detection comes after years of using advanced technology and simulations to trace the plane's final moments.Experts involved in the search are cautiously optimistic about this development. ""This signal could be the breakthrough we have been waiting for. We hope it will bring closure to the families of those on board,"" said another member of the research team.The disappearance of MH370 has been one of aviation's greatest mysteries, leading to numerous theories and extensive international search efforts. The search for MH370 has been one of the most challenging and complex in aviation history, involving multiple countries, advanced technology, and extensive resources.Following the disappearance, a massive international search operation was launched. Initial efforts focused on the South China Sea but later shifted to the southern Indian Ocean based on satellite data.The first phase involved surface searches by ships and aircraft, covering thousands of square kilometers. Despite the vast efforts, no debris was found in the initial stages.In April 2014, Australia's Ocean Shield vessel, equipped with advanced underwater search technology, was deployed. It searched for acoustic signals from the aircraft's black boxes but found no conclusive evidence.Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) like Bluefin-21 and GO Phoenix were deployed to conduct detailed seafloor searches in the Indian Ocean's search zones, covering areas with depths of up to 6,000 meters.In July 2015, a flaperon from MH370 was discovered on Réunion Island, confirming the aircraft had ended in the Indian Ocean. This discovery spurred new hope and directed the focus on the southern Indian Ocean.Over the next year, more debris washed ashore on islands in the Indian Ocean and African east coast, including parts of the wing, stabilizers, and cabin interior.After covering over 120,000 square kilometers of seafloor without locating the main wreckage, the official search was suspended in January 2017. The challenging underwater terrain, including deep trenches and volcanic activity, hindered efforts.Ocean Infinity Search: In early 2018, private company Ocean Infinity conducted a renewed search using advanced AUVs, covering an additional 112,000 square kilometers. Despite their efforts, no new debris was located.","The signal detected recently is being hailed as a significant development in the search for MH370.

"At least 3,300-year-old ship discovered off the northern Israel coast",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/at-least-3300-year-old-ship-discovered-off-the-northern-israel-coast/articleshow/111159147.cms,"NEW DELHI: A 3,300-year-old ship and its cargo have been discovered by a company drilling for natural gas off the coast of northern Israel . The discovered late Bronze Age ship is seen as one of the oldest known examples of ships sailing far from land.The ship so far out at sea indicates that the navigation abilities of ancient seafarers were more advanced than previously thought because they could travel without a line of sight to land, the the Israel Antiquities Authority told news agency AP.The depth at which the ship was found implies it was left undisturbed by waves, currents or fishermen over the millennia, offering greater scope for research.""The discovery of this boat now changes our entire understanding of ancient mariner abilities. It is the very first to be found at such a great distance with no line of sight to any landmass,"" said Jacob Sharvit, head of the IAA marine unit, adding that two similar ships from the same era had been discovered previously, but only close to shore.A recently discovered wooden ship, approximately 12 to 14 meters long, was found by Energean, a natural gas company, 90 kilometers off Israel's Mediterranean coast. The vessel, unearthed at a depth of 1,800 meters, is over 1,000 years old and was located using a submersible robot. Researchers believe the ship likely navigated by the sun and stars and might have sunk due to a storm or a pirate attack.Energean found the vessel buried under hundreds of ancient jugs, all of which were fully intact. The company encountered the ship about a year ago while conducting routine operations in Israel's territorial waters.Traditionally, researchers assumed that trade during this era was conducted by boats sailing close to the shore. These boats moved from port to port, constantly keeping an eye on the land. However, this new discovery suggests a different navigation practice.""The newly discovered boat's sailors probably used the sun and the stars to find their way,"" said Sharvit.The Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA) confirmed that the boat and its cargo are intact. The ship currently remains on the sea floor, and there are no immediate plans to retrieve it.","A 3,300-year-old ship and its cargo have been discovered by a company drilling for natural gas off the coast of northern Israel.

Who are Hindujas and why is UK's richest family in legal trouble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-hindujas-became-the-richest-family-of-uk/articleshow/111176059.cms,"What are the Hindujas accused of

'Spent more on pet dog than servant'

A Swiss court has sentenced four members of the wealthy Hinduja family to up to four years and six months in jail on Friday for exploiting their domestic workers.The Hinduja family, known for their vast business empire spanning various sectors, tops the Sunday Times list of the UK's 350 richest people with an estimated fortune of £37 billion. However, Gopi Hinduja himself was not named in the case.The Hinduja Group, controlled by the family, has diverse business interests ranging from trucks and lubricants to banking and cable television.The group was founded by Parmanand Deepchand Hinduja, who started his merchant banking and trade businesses in British India before moving to Bombay in 1914 and expanding internationally to Iran in 1919.The brothers later shifted their base to London in 1979, where it remains today, with the group claiming to employ 200,000 people worldwide.Srichand P Hinduja, the eldest son, took over the reins in 1935 and is credited with founding IndusInd Bank. Following his death in May 2023, Gopichand Hinduja assumed the role of Chairman and is recognized for the Group's ventures into the power and infrastructure sectors.The family's wealth and influence have been significant, with Forbes ranking them as the seventh richest in India and the 146th richest globally in recent years.In a recent court case in Switzerland, Indian-born businessman Prakash Hinduja and his family members were found guilty of exploiting workers and providing unauthorized employment. The court dismissed the human trafficking charges, saying that the staff understood the conditions they were agreeing to.The Hinduja family, long-time residents of Switzerland, faced accusations of confiscating workers' passports, paying them in rupees instead of Swiss francs, restricting their movement, and forcing them to work excessively long hours for low wages. This was not Prakash Hinduja's first offense, as he had been convicted on similar, though less severe, charges in 2007. Prosecutors alleged that he continued to employ people without proper documentation despite the previous conviction.It was disclosed last week that the family had reached an undisclosed settlement with the plaintiffs. Swiss authorities have already seized various assets, including precious stones and jewelry, which could be used to cover legal fees and potential penalties resulting from the case.According to Swiss prosecutor Yves Bertossa, the family spent more money on their pet dog than they paid one of their servants.The prosecutor delivered a scathing critique of the Hinduja family's actions, recommending jail sentences of up to five and a half years for those involved. Bertossa's arguments were based on testimonies provided by the staff and the Hindujas themselves, as well as evidence gathered during his investigation into the matter.""They spent more for one dog than one of their servants,"" he said. The prosecutor revealed that the woman was paid as little as 7 Swiss francs ($7.84) for a working day that lasted up to 18 hours, seven days a week. He also pointed to a budget document titled ""Pets"", which demonstrated that the family spent 8,584 Swiss francs in a year on their family dog.","Four members of the Hinduja family sentenced to up to four years and six months in jail for exploiting domestic workers.

""I mean, India has far-right populism,"" he said. ""Just got rejected. Modi just lost those elections big time,"" Bill Maher said. ""Yeah but he has been there for a very long time..."" Joel said.Social media users, mostly from India, schooled Bill Maher for spreading fake news and asked him to stick to American issues without knowing the truth about India.""Oh dude, Modi’s party was BY FAR the single largest party and easily formed the government with its pre-poll alliance without having to stitch a government with any new party. Stick to American issues, Bill,"" a user wrote to the post Bill Maher made.""Mainstream American media is so stupid. Modi won elections, Bill. Get a grip,"" another user wrote.""He can't even google the fact that Modi has won the election the third time. This guy proves how dumb the US audiences have become. He is one of the highest paid hosts in the US,"" another user wrote.For quite some time, Bill Maher has been handing out his ominous predictions for the Democrats for their immigration policies. President Joe Biden recently ordered a crackdown on the US-Mexico border if illegal crossings top 2,500 per day for seven consecutive days.Bill panned the order calling it as a pre-election 'Hail Mary' that won't work. ""If Biden loses this election, it's going to be because of two things: He's old… and immigration. I mean, just on a political level, I don't think they could have handled it worse,"" he opined.""The question that Democrats don't seem to be able to have the balls to answer is just how many is too many?

US top court upholds law that disarms domestic abusers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-top-court-upholds-law-that-disarms-domestic-abusers/articleshow/111197729.cms,"Justice Clarence Thomas, author of the majority opinion in the 2022 decision, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, was the only dissenter

WASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court ruled Friday that the government can take guns away from people subject to restraining orders for domestic violence, limiting the sweep of a blockbuster decision in 2022 that had vastly expanded Second Amendment rights .

Indeed, Friday's decision amounted to a retreat from what had been an unbroken series of major rulings favouring gun rights that started in 2008, when the court first recognized an individual constitutional right to keep firearms in the home for self-defense.

In the 2022 decision, the court established a right to carry guns outside the home and announced a new test to assess all sorts of gun control laws , one that looked to historical practices to judge their constitutionality. That new test has sown confusion in the lower courts, with some judges striking down laws that had been on the books for decades.

The case decided Friday, United States v. Rahimi, asked whether a Texas man could be prosecuted under federal law making it a crime for people subject to domestic violence restraining orders to possess guns. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority in the 8-1 decision, said the answer was yes and that Second Amendment rights have limits.

Infamous Martin Shkreli, also known as 'Pharma Bro', and the 'Most hated man in America' has claimed that he was behind the DJT meme coin. At an X (formerly known as Twitter) space, Shkreli said that he collaborated with Barron Trump to create the token and Andrew Tate pumped its price. There were rumors that DJT had backing from the Trump family as Donald Trump in a recent interview expressed his interest in crypto. Research firm Arkham then offered a $150,000 bounty to anyone who could prove the identity of DJT's creator. It was then that Martin Shkreli floated his story. According to a Fortune report, crypto sleuth ZachXBT claimed the prize by proving that Shkreli had created the token as part of an alleged pump-and-dump scheme.

— ArkhamIntel (@ArkhamIntel) Cameron Roxburgh was another participant in the scheme who was a classmate of Barron Trump. But there is no evidence of Barron Trump being involved in this. After this big reveal, Shkreli joined a live chat on X and claimed that DJT would soon receive an endorsement from Barron Trump or any other Trump-world figure. Shkreli said he was surprised that the president's son approached him through a friends for a meme coin. Barron Trump apparently told Shkreli that his father had approved of the project. In the X Space, Shkreli was asked whether the token was created to raise fund for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. He said it was for Barron Trump. Shkreli's latest tweet on DJT meme coin was defiant. ""I have nothing further to say on $DJT. You will see the official truth soon. I know I'm right and have zero to prove to any of you. Just wait and see,"" he wrote after he was accused of bluffing, engagement farming on social media.

Donald Trump 's automatic Green Card for foreign students graduated in America was not an off the top of his head idea. Trump indicated the policy at a business roundtable meeting last week where Apple CEO Tim Cook was present, Politico reported. ""And when he talked about finding ways to keep American-educated talent at home, some top CEOs, like Apple’s Tim Cook, were seen nodding their heads,"" the report said.""When he spoke to the Business Roundtable last week, some of the titans of the tech industry seemed to breathe a sigh of relief when Trump appeared to support keeping high-skilled immigrants in the United States,"" the report said.Tim Cook has always been a staunch critic of Trump's immigration policy as he terminated DACA, the Obama-era program that shielded some immigrants without documentation from being deported. In 2019, Apple moved the court and said it employed 443 dreamers who were protected by DACA. “Every one of these talented Dreamers should have the same opportunities as Steve did to create, work hard, and help change the world for the better,” Apple said at that time.Come 2024, Donald Trump has taken a considerate view of the immigration situation and announced on ""The all-in podcast"" that foreign nationals who graduate from US colleges and universities should automatically be given a Green Card upon graduation so that the best brains are retained in the US. He mentioned India and China as he rued that fact that bright students from US universities go back to India and China without getting a Green Card in the US and then they become multibillionaires, generate huge employment.Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a statement after Trump's claim explaining that there will an aggressive vetting process to select the candidates for the Green card-- excluding all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges. Only the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America will get the automatic Green Card.The State Department estimated that the United States hosted roughly 1 million international students in the academic year that ended in 2022 -- a majority of whom came from China and India.

Evidence presented in the federal trial revealed that DePape was motivated by right-wing conspiracy theories, including QAnon, Holocaust denial, and political accusations against Hunter Biden and George Soros.Meanwhile, DePape's defense attorneys focused on his state of mind and how he was consumed by conspiracy theories, rather than contesting the evidence.DePape told the federal jury that his original plan was to kidnap and interrogate Nancy Pelosi, and to break her kneecaps if he found her to be lying. However, when he broke in, he found her husband instead and attacked him as a reaction to his plan going awry.

Akhter, a resident, expresses the struggles faced by daily wage workers and labourers, highlighting the impact of soaring prices not only on milk but also on related products such as Ghee (clarified butter).""We can't sustain our households in such inflationary times,"" he laments, urging the government to consider the plight of its citizens amidst these challenging circumstances.Faizan echoes similar sentiments, explaining that milk prices have escalated due to the rising costs faced by dairy farm owners for essentials like fodder, high rents, and water.""They have no choice but to pass on these expenses to consumers,"" he observes, urging the government to prioritise the welfare of the common people regardless of how they came into power.In Karachi, and across Pakistan, the struggle against inflation is not just about economic numbers but about the daily realities faced by the citizens.According to local media reports, the cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers, in collaboration with commissioner Karachi , settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.The decision came after an extensive consultation session that lasted several hours, where the commissioner met with stakeholders from the dairy farming, wholesaling, and retail sectors to discuss and finalise the price adjustment.Following thorough deliberations, all parties reached a consensus to implement the PKR 20 per litre hike, setting the new price of milk at PKR 220 per litre, which represents a significant increase compared to previous rates.","The cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.

The incident unfolded on May 25 in Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, where Nazir and other Christians were accused of blasphemy , sparking violent outrage among locals.After fighting for his life for eight days, Masih succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.The incident showed a troubling pattern in Pakistan where blasphemy accusations lead to violence against Christian communities.HRFP has expressed deep concern over the swift post-arrest bail granted to 52 attackers involved in the Sargodha incident.Despite the First Information Report (FIR) being filed against 44 identified and 400 unidentified suspects under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), progress in police investigations and court proceedings has been slow and inadequate.Compounding the community's apprehensions are threatening videos released by Islamic groups following the incident, exacerbating fears among the Christian community.Drawing parallels with the August 16, 2023, attack in Jaranwala, the HRFP report highlighted similar incidents of mob violence and property destruction against minorities. It underscores a recurring pattern involving provocation, and subsequent violence, often followed by the expedient release of perpetrators.HRFP has called for decisive action, citing intelligence reports linking extremist groups to multiple blasphemy allegations. The organization has also urged stringent measures to address these threats.The report also documented individual cases of violence and harassment against Christians across Pakistan.Farooq Masih's family in Jaranwala continues to face threats. Despite the FIR filed in February, the perpetrators are still at large.Similarly, the case of Saima Bibi, who suffered an assault in April, was downplayed as an 'accident' despite clear evidence of the attack.The plight of Rawal Masih, Romeo Masih, Waqas Masih, Rakhsana Bibi, Asifa Bibi, Shazia Zaulfiqar, and Ahsan Masih, who all were abducted and murdered, also underscores the ongoing oppression faced by PakistChristians.Naveed Walter, president of HRFP, emphasized the ""dire circumstances"" for minorities in Pakistan and urged increased protection and support for the Christian community.

Days after dropping tax bombs that will further eviscerate the struggling masses, the authorities have announced that not only will they be taking more money out of the pay cheques of salaried individuals, they will also be squeezing whatever is left through significantly jacked-up electricity bills ,"" the editorial read.Citing news reports, it said that Nepra (National Electric Power Regulatory Authority) has hiked the uniform national tariff for the base price of electricity by almost 20 per cent to hand over electricity distribution companies almost half a trillion rupees more over the next fiscal year.The average base tariff for a single unit of electricity, which was PakistRupees (PKR) 27.78 in the outgoing year, will be PKR 35.50 from July 1.On top of this, various duties, taxes, and surcharges, as well as fuel and tariff adjustments, will be levied, forcing ordinary citizens to pay through their noses, not just for the fuel and operation and maintenance costs involved in generating electricity, but also for capacity charges that past governments have promised power generation companies, as well as the theft and transmission losses that distribution companies have shown a complete unwillingness to mitigate for many years.The average middle-class bill-paying customer will be forking out between PKR 65-72 for each unit of electricity they use in a month. Meanwhile, the federal government will present this as an 'achievement' in front of the IMF to ask for even more loans to keep a clearly failing system running for a few years longer, the editorial added.However, at the same time, the government has announced a PKR 10.69 per unit 'relief' for the industrial sector to 'make it competitive'. There can probably be no better example of crony capitalism.While the average salaried individual is finding it difficult to meet their ends on a shrinking real wage amidst month after month of unceasing, unchecked inflation, it is the big industries who get a break in the form of cheaper electricity so that they can pad up their profits while paying little back to the country in the form of taxes.""That the government is failing the people seems like an understatement. It is clearly least bothered by their plight. Its financial planning shows that it has no interest in going after those who dodge their dues; it just wants to take the easy route and enjoy the ride for however long it is in power,"" the Dawn editorial stated.","The average base tariff for a single unit of electricity, which was PakistRupees (PKR) 27.78 in the outgoing year, will be PKR 35.50 from July 1.
