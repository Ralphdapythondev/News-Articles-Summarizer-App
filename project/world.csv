Video: Moment Donald Trump was attacked during rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/video-moment-donald-trump-was-attacked-during-rally/articleshow/111723794.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump 's rally in Butler County , Pennsylvania, was abruptly interrupted on Sunday when gunshots rang out, causing a chaotic scene .Donald Trump, donning his signature red ""Make America Great Again"" cap, grimaced and clutched a hand to his ear, with blood visible on his ear and cheek.Video footage showed Trump was swiftly escorted off stage by US Secret Service agents after multiple shots were fired, with one bullet grazing his head.The video captured the moment when panic ensued, with some attendees seen fleeing the area while others sought cover in the stands, some using their cell phones to record the incident. Trump was seen being led away from the site by Secret Service personnel, his fist raised in the air.""It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country,"" Trump said on his TruthSocial platform.One person from the audience lost their life in the shooting, and the perpetrator was also killed.Throughout its history, the United States has witnessed instances of political violence. Consequently, presidents, former presidents, and candidates are provided with tight security.In 1963, while traveling in his motorcade, President John F Kennedy was assassinated. Later, in 1968, his brother Bobby Kennedy was shot dead. President Ronald Reagan survived an assassination attempt in 1981.","Former US President Donald Trump was escorted off stage after multiple shots were fired.

'It sounded like July 4 pops': Witnesses recount chaos at Trump rally after gun attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/it-sounded-like-july-4-pops-witnesses-recount-chaos-at-trump-rally-after-gun-attack/articleshow/111723897.cms,"As the crowd of thousands gathered to listen to former US President Donald Trump during an election campaign rally , a series of pops suddenly sent them diving for cover. Secret Service agents swiftly rushed to protect the 78-year-old Republican, knocking over the lectern bearing his name in the process.Amidst the panic, agents helped Trump to his feet and guided him towards his waiting motorcade.The crowd gasped, with some chanting ""USA, USA"" as an unsteady Trump was escorted down the steps from the stage to his armored SUV, the AFP reported.As Trump, visibly shaken, pumped his fist and waved through the linked arms of his security detail, applause and cheers spread through the rural Pennsylvania fairground.Some attendees criticized the apparent security lapse, while others were visibly emotional, praying and expressing concern for Trump's well-being.""They won't take you down,"" a man in the crowd shouted as Trump's guardsmen formed a human chain to escort him to safety, his fist still raised even as he was helped into the vehicle.Describing the incident, Erin Autenreith, who was sitting in the front row, said, ""I was so excited. I just looked at him. Then I heard these pops. It sounded like a July 4 thing, pop, pop, pop.""When the agents surrounded Trump and put him down, she realized it must have been a real shot. Autenreith, attending her sixth Trump rally and volunteering all day, noticed a little bit of blood on Trump's right cheek as he stood up. Trump later posted on Truth Social that he was ""shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.""A witness named Greg told the BBC that he observed an armed individual on a rooftop just minutes before gunshots were heard at a rally for Donald Trump in Butler County, Pennsylvania. According to Greg, the man had climbed onto the roof of a nearby building, situated approximately 50 feet from the event.Greg said that he alerted the police to the presence of the gunman. ""I'm thinking to myself 'Why is Trump still speaking, why have they not pulled him off the stage'... the next thing you know, five shots ring out,"" he recounted.Greg added that he had noticed the gunman about five minutes into Trump's speech and attempted to alert the authorities for several minutes, but he believes they may have had difficulty spotting the gunman due to the roof's slope.As the gravity of the situation sank in, tensions rose among the crowd. Some Trump supporters hurled insults at the media, while others made vulgar gestures towards the area where the gunshots seemed to have originated. The shooter was reportedly ""outside the grounds,"" according to the Butler County district attorney. Secret Service officers urged the crowd to evacuate, declaring the area an active crime scene.Following the gunshots, Secret Service agents immediately surrounded the former president and escorted him to safety. Trump was later seen with blood on his face and reportedly said that a bullet had grazed his ear. Officials later confirmed that the gunman had been shot and killed.","Shots were heard at a rally for Donald Trump in Butler County, Pennsylvania.

Oli-led Nepal government to be sworn-in on Monday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/oli-led-nepal-government-to-be-sworn-in-on-monday/articleshow/111724071.cms,"KATHMANDU: K P Sharma Oli , set to become Nepal's new Prime Minister, on Saturday held consultations with his alliance partner Nepali Congress in preparing the list of ministers to be inducted into the new coalition government that is likely to be sworn in on Monday. President Ram Chandra Paudel is expected to appoint Oli, 72, as the new Prime Minister of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist ( CPN-UML )-Nepali Congress (NC)coalition on Sunday.""However, the President is likely to administer the oath to the new Prime Minister and other members of the cabinet on Monday morning. A small cabinet is likely to be announced on Monday before the oath-taking ceremony starts,"" said sources close to the NC and UML.Amid political turmoil in the Himalayan nation, CPN-UML chairman Oli, 72, is set to become prime minister once again after incumbent Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' on Friday failed to win a trust vote in Parliament.Late on Friday night, Oli staked his claim to become the next Prime Minister with the backing of NC president Sher Bahadur Deuba and submitted the signature of 165 House of Representatives (HoR) members -- 77 from his party and 88 from the NC -- to form the government under Article 76-2 of the Constitution.Out of a total of 21 ministries, the Nepali Congress will get nine and the UML eight plus the post of Prime Minister, a source close to Oli said.""Key positions such as Home, Foreign, Finance and Energy will be divided between NC and UML. Nepali Congress is likely to get the portfolio of Home while the Finance will go to the UML,"" the source said.Earlier in the day on Saturday, CPN-UML held a high-level meeting to discuss the future course of action and finalise the names of ministers to be included in the new cabinet.However, in the beginning, there will be a small cabinet, which will be expanded later, according to senior leader of the party and Standing Committee member Rajan Bhattarai.Nepali Congress also held its Central Work Performance Committee meeting to discuss and finalise the ministerial list and the policy to be adopted by the party.""The meeting discussed the ongoing political developments and finalised the names to be included in the Oli-led cabinet,"" said former Deputy Prime Minister and senior NC leader Prakash Man Singh.Although Deuba and Oli have already held preliminary discussions regarding the modality of the new coalition and power-sharing, the matter will be finalised by Saturday night.During a crucial meeting last week, Deuba and Oli had agreed to share the post of Prime Minister by turns and that the CPN-UML chief would lead the government for the first 18 months.Besides CPN-Maoist, CPN-Unified Socialist and Rastriya Swotantra Party, which had voted in favour of Prachanda during the floor test, Rastriya Prajatantra Party and other smaller parties are likely to back the NC-UML coalition.Also, smaller parties such as Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP), JSP Nepal, Janamat Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party and Lokatantrik Samajwadi Party are likely to join the Oli-led coalition, according to party sources.Prachanda, 69, chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre (CPN-MC), faced the trust vote as CPN-UML withdrew support from his government last week after inking a power-sharing deal with the largest party in the House, the NC.Prachanda lost the vote of confidence as he received only 63 votes in the 275-member HoR with 194 votes against the motion. At least 138 votes are needed to win the vote of trust.Nepal is facing frequent political instability as the country has seen 14 governments in the past 16 years after the Republican system was introduced.Meanwhile, a leading newspaper in Nepal commented that it takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation.The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases, The Kathmandu Post wrote in an editorial this week.""What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best.""Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act,"" it added, apparently referring to the exit of Prachanda as the prime minister, just 18 months after he assumed office.","K P Sharma Oli, 72, is set to become Nepal's new Prime Minister.

A labour crunch awaits Starmer plan to spur UK housebuilding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/a-labour-crunch-awaits-starmer-plan-to-spur-uk-housebuilding/articleshow/111724262.cms,"Green Skills

More builders needed

Prime Minister Keir Starmer ’s promise to “get Britain building again” will quickly face a shortage of skilled workers in the very industries he’s hoping will power the turnaround.The UK is facing a supply crunch of builders, solar-panel installers and engineers, raising questions about who will carry out Starmer’s mission to radically expand clean power and build 1.5 million homes over the next five years.While the Labour Party has pledged to expand training in key sectors, the scale of the shortages suggest they will slow early efforts to ramp up activity in those sectors.The UK needs about 400,000 workers to meet its net zero targets, 30% more than the oil-and-gas sector staff available to fill those roles, according to a PwC analysis. Meanwhile, the UK’s construction workforce has declined about 14% in the past five years.Green jobs cover a wide range of sectors associated with industries that will help shift the economy away from fossil fuels. Those include wind and solar installations, heat pumps, carbon capture and storage, battery technologies. More broadly defined it can also include project developers and people who manage planning permission.UK businesses in these sectors warn they’re already struggling to find staff as they were particularly badly hit by a mix of Brexit , higher inactivity rates, and a lack of training opportunities. Vacancies per job are still above pre-Covid levels in key policy areas like construction, electricity, gas and education. The fear is that Labour’s plans will supercharge demand and stoke up talent wars, pushing up wages without a matching boost in output.“We welcome the government’s focus on making the UK a clean energy superpower, but the lack of green skills in the UK’s workforce will put this mission at risk,” said Charlotte Eaton, chief people officer at Ovo Energy which employs some 5,000 people across the UK. “The government must urgently map out the regional workforce and identify skills shortages so it can invest where the need is greatest.”In the run-up to Labour’s landslide election victory, the party had frequently cited skills shortages as evidence of what they said was economic mismanagement by the Conservatives’ during their 14 years in power. Starmer has appointed Jacqui Smith, a former home secretary, as minister for skills, further and higher education. Labour plans to link immigration with training policies and also roll out training programs in sectors like health and social care and construction.Bank of England policy maker Jonathan Haskel warned that the UK labor market has gotten worse at matching jobseekers to vacancies, meaning that shortages are set to persist even as unemployment picks up. While the UK’s unemployment rate hit the highest level in 2 1/2 years, strong wage growth remains a concern for the BOE ahead of its meeting in August, when it decides whether to reduce interest rates from a 16-year high.The UK jobs market has shrunk since the pandemic. The number of people in employment has fallen since 2019 after some 800,000 workers dropped out of the labor force mainly due to long-term sickness. Few have returned. Almost a quarter of the UK’s working-age population is economically inactive — out of work and not looking for a job. That’s the most since 2015.Labour has set a target for the country to produce zero fossil-fuel pollution from electricity by 2030. It’s announced a flurry of plans to achieve it, from reforming planning rules to speed up the construction of clean energy infrastructure to a public company that will co-invest alongside the private sector in wind and solar projects, as well as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.This, Labour says, will create 650,000 jobs. But energy bosses worry the UK doesn’t have enough skilled workers to fill them.Axel Thiemann, chief executive officer of renewable energy producer Sonnedix, is building a solar power plant in Durham that will provide about 100 green jobs once completed next year. He’s having difficulty hiring across a wide range of occupations, from construction personnel and to electricity grid technicians and people who can manage building permit applications.“The same people that used to have one project on the desk now see maybe three or four,” Thiemann said. That’s delaying activity, as well as boosting costs and tightening competition for staff, he added.Such concerns are widespread among energy companies whose appetite for green jobs is growing more rapidly than the supply of talent. A PwC analysis estimated the UK needs 400,000 workers to meet its net zero targets, yet it only has about 270,000 staff in the oil and gas sector who can fill those roles. About a third are set to retire by 2030, leaving the UK with a gap of 200,000 workers.A top barrier to installing heat pumps in homes is the lack of engineers with the skills to do the job, according to Nesta, an innovation charity.LinkedIn figures showed just one in eight UK workers had green skills, yet hiring for such roles is growing 30% more rapidly than the overall rate. An even smaller proportion of the youngest workers, who will make up about a third of the labor force by 2030, enter the jobs market with green skills.Sue Duke, head of global public policy at LinkedIn, said the government needs to start delivering large-scale training programs straight away, while businesses have to upskill new joiners and retrain existing workers.“Workers are coming out of education without any green skills, and they’re not getting exposed to green skilling in those early jobs in their career,” Duke said. “There’s a big awareness gap when it comes to acquiring those skills — only one in five know where to go to get these green skills, then there’s an availability of training challenge as well.”Housing is another area where Labour is high on ambitions and short on workers.The government vowed to fix Britain’s housing crisis by building about 300,000 homes every year over the next parliament term. That’s target that hasn’t been met by any government over the last 14 years. At most, builders delivered about 250,000 homes a year in recent times.Even at these subdued levels, the industry has been struggling to get enough builders.“It’s already the category with the fourth biggest tightening in hiring conditions despite the fact that job postings demand hasn’t been particularly strong,” said Jack Kennedy, economist at Indeed, who warned of looming wage pressures. “If that demand starts to take off, then clearly that that squeeze is only gonna exacerbate.”The UK’s construction workforce declined about 14% over the last five years to around 2.1 million in the first quarter of 2024. EU workers left after Brexit, while the number of domestic constructors, who make up the bulk of the workforce, fell by 300,000 over the last five years as many older workers retired early. The sector has also lost its appeal to younger staff who tend to drop out of generally low-paid apprenticeships, according to Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association.“New investment in skills and capacity will initially be needed just to get them back to where they were two to three years ago, before the government even thinks of 300,000 net additional homes per year or more,” Francis said.The government’s net zero target is only exacerbating shortages. In addition to delivering 1.5 million homes, more construction workers are needed to make existing homes more energy efficient, build infrastructure and decarbonize the energy network.“Most sectors are struggling for for labor, but it’s going to be highlighted in construction because of competing demands from housing and developing other technologies,” said Peter Wassell, technical director at Sedgwick, which handles insurance claims on behalf of other companies.","The UK is facing a supply crunch of builders, solar-panel installers and engineers.

"Who is Priscila Barbosa, Brazilian immigrant who made $10,000 a month defrauding rideshare apps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/priscila-barbosa-brazilian-immigrant-uber-and-instacart/articleshow/111666866.cms,"Early days in US

A scheme of epic proportions

A web of deceit: The scheme unfolds

Legal consequences: The fall

In the annals of American dream-chasing, few stories are as dramatic or cautionary as that of Priscila Barbosa . Barbosa’s story began in Sorocaba, Brazil, an industrial city where she grew up as the eldest daughter of a hardworking family. Her parents, an electrician and a postal worker, invested in her education, providing English lessons and ballet classes.She studied IT, taught computer skills, and even ran a successful healthy meal delivery service, Fit Express, until Brazil’s recession hit hard. Desperate to support her family, Barbosa accepted a suggestion from an acquaintance to move to the US on a tourist visa and drive for Uber and Lyft.According to a Wired report, Barbosa's journey to the United States began on April 24, 2018, at New York's JFK International Airport. Standing just outside customs with two suitcases filled with clothes and Brazilian bikinis, she found herself in a predicament when her US contact, who had promised to help her settle and drive for Uber and Lyft, disappeared. With only an iPhone, $117, and no return ticket, Barbosa was determined to make her American dream a reality.As per the Wired report, Barbosa’s journey would eventually lead her to the center of a massive fraud conspiracy involving rideshare and delivery services. Alongside fellow Brazilian national Guilherme da Silveira and 17 other co-defendants, Barbosa was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. They had orchestrated a scheme to create fraudulent driver accounts using stolen identities, which they then rented or sold to unqualified drivers.Using the dark web and other sources, they obtained over 2,000 identities, bypassing stringent background checks required by companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. They exploited referral bonus programs and used ""bots"" and GPS spoofing technology to maximize earnings. According to the indictment, Barbosa's role in creating and managing these accounts was integral to the scheme's success, which netted her over $791,000.Barbosa, with da Silveira, used the stolen identities to create fraudulent driver accounts. They edited driver’s license images to match the photos of the drivers renting or buying the accounts, circumventing facial recognition technology. They advertised these accounts on WhatsApp, targeting Brazilian nationals living in the US, and managed the accounts by collecting rental payments and troubleshooting issues.The scheme was elaborate and far-reaching. They exploited referral bonus programs, used “bots” and GPS spoofing to inflate earnings, and managed to siphon off hundreds of thousands of dollars. The operation was so sophisticated that it exposed glaring vulnerabilities in the gig economy’s security measures, the Wired report said.In May 2021, Barbosa and her co-defendants were charged, and by April 2022, she and da Silveira had pleaded guilty. Barbosa was sentenced to three years in prison, three years of supervised release, and fined $20,000. Sixteen other defendants were arrested, with three still at large.For those who suspect they might be victims of this scheme, resources are available through the IRS and the US Department of Justice’s Victim Assistance Program.","Priscila Barbosa was sentenced to three years in prison, three years of supervised release, and fined $20,000.

Shooting at Donald Trump rally: How attacks on Presidents and candidates have shaped US history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shooting-at-donald-trump-rally-how-attacks-on-presidents-and-candidates-have-shaped-us-history/articleshow/111724299.cms,"Donald Trump

During Trump’s 2016 campaign, a 20-year-old British man attempted to grab a gun from a Las Vegas police officer at a Trump rally there. He later told police he was trying to kill Trump, and pleaded guilty to federal firearms and disruption offenses.

Ronald Reagan

On March 30, 1981, John Hinckley Jr fired six shots at the president in Washington, hitting Reagan and three others. The president was seriously wounded but recovered after emergency surgery. The other three victims also survived. Hinckley was immediately arrested and kept in institutional psychiatric care until 2016, 12 years after Reagan’s death.

Gerald Ford

Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme, a follower of cult leader Charles Manson, attempted to shoot Ford in Sacramento, California on September 5, 1975. Three weeks later, Sara Jane Moore fired a shot at Ford in San Francisco, making the two women the most prominent female would-be assassins in US history.

Robert F Kennedy

Sirhan Sirhan shot and killed Kennedy, then a candidate in the Democratic primaries, in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, less than five years after the assassination of his elder brother. Sirhan was sentenced to life in prison. Kennedy’s son, Robert F Kennedy Jr, is running as an independent presidential candidate in 2024.

John F Kennedy

On November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald shot and killed the president in Dallas, Texas. The assassination continues to spark debates about whether Oswald acted alone, after Oswald was killed by restaurateur Jack Ruby two days later.

Theodore Roosevelt

Roosevelt was a former president campaigning to return to the White House when he was shot giving a speech in Milwaukee on Oct. 14, 1912. Protected by the 50-page text of his speech and a glasses case in his pocket, he continued his address and recovered, eventually losing to Woodrow Wilson. Would-be assassin John Schrank was found legally insane and institutionalized until his death.

William McKinley

McKinley was shot in Buffalo, New York on September 6, 1901, and later died from his wounds, elevating Vice President Roosevelt to the presidency. Anarchist Leon Czolgosz was convicted of the assassination and put to death.

James Garfield

Garfield was shot in Washington July 2, 1881. He died from complications from the wounds two months later. Writer and lawyer Charles Guiteau was convicted of the crime and sentenced to death.

Abraham Lincoln

Lincoln was shot and killed in Washington on April 14, 1865, by John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and Confederate sympathizer, who was killed after a manhunt that lasted nearly two weeks.

The shooting of former President Donald Trump Saturday was only the most recent act of political violence that has often shaped US history.Trump said he was “fine” after a bullet grazed his ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The attacker was killed by Secret Service agents, and one other person at the event died. Authorities are investigating Saturday’s attack as an assassination attempt.The killings of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield and William McKinley eventually led to Secret Service protection, and the assassination of John F Kennedy shocked the nation and resulted in even tighter security around the president.Still, Gerald Ford was the target of two high-profile attempts on his life in the span of 18 days, and Ronald Reagan was seriously wounded by a gunman’s bullet early in his presidency in 1981.Nearly ever modern president has been targeted. The Secret Service has foiled nearly all of those attempts, few of which resulted in injury.Political violence has taken the lives of leaders around the world, as well, including Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme.Even before Saturday’s incident, polls showed voters worried about possible violence surrounding this year’s presidential election. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll of swing-state in May found half harbored those fears, including roughly equal shares of Democrats and Republicans. And they’re even more common among independents, the poll found.Here’s a look at some previous attempts on US presidents’ and presidential candidates’ lives:","Nearly ever modern president has been targeted.

Boeing begins flying 777X with FAA in path to certification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeing-begins-flying-777x-with-faa-in-path-to-certification/articleshow/111724305.cms,"Boeing Co. has started conducting flight trials of its 777-9 aircraft with US regulators on board, achieving a milestone toward certifying its jumbo airliner after years of setbacks.The company announced that it took the initial test flight late Friday with Federal Aviation Administration personnel. Achieving so-called Type Inspection Authorization marks the start of certification flight testing, a key step in one of the most extensive commercial test efforts that Boeing has ever undertaken.“The certification flight test will continue validating the airplane’s safety, reliability and performance,” Boeing said in an emailed statement. “We appreciate our regulator’s rigorous oversight.”The FAA declined to comment on the certification effort, but noted that “safety always drives the timeline.” “Generally this kind of thorough process takes many months,” the regulator said in an emailed statement.The accomplishment, which was first reported by the Air Current, reinforces confidence in Boeing’s prediction that its hulking twin-engine jet is on track to enter the market in 2025 after years of delays. Boeing has logged around 480 orders for the 777-9, and two other planned models: the smaller 777-8 passenger jet and a freight-hauler.Boeing’s pilots have already racked up more than 3,500 flight hours over 1,200 test flights since the first 777X took to the air in January 2020. The planemaker has four dedicated aircraft that are being used to test every aspect of its safety and operations, ranging from stability and control to cabin noise.Touted as a more-efficient replacement to Boeing’s four-engine 737 jumbo jetliner and Airbus SE’s A380, the 777X has been in development for more than a decade and was originally slated to enter the market in 2020. The delays have frustrated customers such as Emirates, Qatar Airways and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, forcing them to refurbish and continue flying aging jetliners they’d intended to replace.The upgraded wide-body was caught up in the tougher regulatory scrutiny of Boeing’s products that followed two fatal crashes of its 737 Max jets in 2018 and 2019 that combined killed 346 people. The FAA and European regulators demanded extensive testing and redesign of several 777X components, including a critical avionics system and actuator-control electronics.The commercial entry of the final two Max models has also been delayed as the FAA required that the planemaker redo engineering studies and redesign an engine deicing system prone to failure in certain conditions.",Boeing's 777-9 aircraft takes its first test flight with US regulators on board. The milestone marks the start of certification flight testing for the jumbo jet.

Ray Kurzweil says humanity well on course to merge with AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ray-kurzweil-says-humanity-well-on-course-to-merge-with-ai/articleshow/111724211.cms,"Sitting near a window inside Boston ’s Four Seasons Hotel, Ray Kurzweil held up a sheet of paper showing the steady growth in the amount of raw computer power that a dollar could buy over the last 85 years. A neon green line rose steadily across the page, climbing like fireworks in the night sky.That diagonal line, he said, showed why humanity was just 20 years away from the Singularity , a long hypothesized moment when people will merge with artificial intelligence and augment themselves with millions of times more computational power than their biological brains now provide.“If you create something that is thousands of times — or millions of times — more powerful than the brain, we can’t anticipate what it is going to do,” he said, wearing multi coloured su spenders and a Mickey Mouse watch he bought at Disney World in the early 1980s.Kurzweil, a renowned inventor and futurist who built a career on predictions that defy conventional wisdom, made the same claim in his 2005 book, “The Singularity Is Near.” After the arrival of AI technologies like ChatGPT and recent efforts to implant computer chips inside people’s heads, he believes the time is right to restate his claim. Last week, he published a sequel: “The Singularity Is Nearer.”Now that Kurzweil is 76 years old and is moving a lot slower than he used to, his predictions carry an added edge. He has long said he plans to experience the Singularity, merge with AI and, in this way, live indefinitely. But if the Singularity arrives in 2045, as he claims it will, there is no guarantee he will be alive to see it. “Even a healthy 20-year-old could die tomorrow,” he said.But his prediction is not quite as outlandish as it seemed in 2005. The success of the chatbot ChatGPT and similar technologies has encouraged many to make extravagant predictions about the future of AI and how it will alter the course of humanity.Many skeptics warn that extravagant predictions about artificial intelligence may crumble as the industry struggles with the limits of the raw materials needed to build AI, including electrical power, digital data, mathematics and computing capacity.The big leap, of course, is imagining how human consciousness would merge with a machine, and people like Kurzweil struggle to explain how exactly this would happen.Born in New York City, Kurzweil began programming computers as a teenager, when computers were roomsize machines. In 1965, as a 17-year-old, he appeared on the CBS television show “I’ve Got a Secret,” performing a piano piece composed by a computer that he designed.While still a student at Martin Van Buren High School in Queens, he exchanged letters with Marvin Minsky, one of the computer scientists who founded the field of artificial intelligence at a conference in the mid-1950s. He soon enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study under Minsky.AI began to rapidly improve in the 2010s as a group of researchers at the University of Toronto explored a technology called a neural network. This mathematical system could learn skills by analysing vast amounts of data. By analysing thousands of cat photos, it could learn to identify a cat.Geoffrey Hinton, the University of Toronto professor who helped develop neural network technology and may be more responsible for its success than any other researcher, once dismissed Kurzweil’s prediction that machines would exceed human intelligence before the end of this decade. Now, he believes it was insightful. “His prediction no longer looks so silly,” said Hinton, who until recently worked at Google, where Kurzweil has led a research team since 2012.Hinton is among the AI researchers who believe that the technologies driving chatbots like ChatGPT could become dangerous — perhaps even destroy humanity.But Kurzweil is optimistic. He has long predicted that advances in AI and nanotechnology, which could alter the microscopic mechanisms that control the way our bodies behave and the diseases that afflict them, will push back against the inevitability of death. Soon, he said, these technologies will extend lives at a faster rate than people age, eventually reaching an “escape velocity” that allows people to extend their lives indefinitely. “By the early 2030s, we won’t die because of aging,” he said.","Ray Kurzweil, a renowned inventor and futurist who built a career on predictions that defy conventional wisdom, made the same claim in his 2005 book “The Singularity Is Near” After the arrival of AI technologies like ChatGPT and recent efforts to implant computer chips inside people’s heads, he believes the time is right to restate his claim.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111724230,imgsize-547222,width-400,resizemode-4/111724230.jpg"

Drawing large television and online audiences, next week’s convention is likely to fire up core Republican supporters ahead of the November election.Trump’s campaign has outlined themes for each day of the convention that riff on his red-hat rallying cry: “Make America Great Again.” Over 50,000 people are expected to attend. That includes some 2,429 “delegates” — a mix of politicians and grassroots activists — who will vote for the candidate who won their state’s nominating contest earlier this year. In almost every part of America, that’s Trump.Meanwhile, Donald Trump, famed for his unpredictable and inflammatory outbursts, is opting for self-censorship in a bid to expand his electorate to more moderate voters ahead of the US presidential election.

This was the last case keeping Khan in prison but he will not walk free as the authorities immediately issued fresh orders for his arrest in three other cases.In a short order, additional sessions judge Afzal Majoka directed authorities to immediately release Khan and his wife if they are not wanted in any other case.After the decision Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said, “Mr Khan has been arrested in three more cases.” The three cases are linked to violence against the military and other state installations after his brief arrest in May 2023.“An anti-terrorism court in Lahore approved the request to arrest Imran Khan in the May 9 case,” the PTI statement read. The party warned that keeping Khan, 71, in jail after Saturday’s decision would lead to another political crisis.Just days before national polls on Feb 8 the couple were sentenced to seven years in jail in the “iddat” case after the court found them guilty of breaking Islamic law by failing to observe the required interval between Bibi’s divorce from her previous husband and her marriage to Khan. The verdict had coincided with his convictions and sentences in the Toshakhana (state treasure store) and cipher cases. His sentences in two alleged graft cases, however, were suspended, while his sentence in the cipher case, linked to leaking of state secrets, was overturned. Various courts have also freed him in several other cases linked to the events of May 9, 2023 when his first arrest had caused riots across the country, following which the state launched a crackdown against him and his party.Ahead of Khan’s acquittal in a fake marriage case , a pair of applications was filed by Khawar Fareed Maneka, Bushra’s previous husband. One application asked the court to carry out a medical checkup of his ex-wife to ascertain her menstrual cycle while the other called on religious scholars for consultation on further deliberation on the duration of “iddat”.Before ordering Khan and his wife’s release, judge Majoka dismissed both applications. “Both petitions seeking the formation of a medical board and consultations with religious scholars are hereby rejected,” the verdict stated.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023.

This case was the only one keeping the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party founder behind bars since August last year.On February 3, just days before the general elections on February 8, an Islamabad court had convicted the couple based on a complaint filed by Bushra Bibi's ex-husband, Khawar Fareed Maneka.Maneka alleged that they had contracted marriage during Bushra Bibi's Iddat period, a mandatory waiting period in Islam that lasts four months after a woman's divorce or the death of her husband.The couple challenged the sentence in a district and session court in Islamabad, where Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Afzal Majoka heard the case. Judge Majoka announced the judgment in the afternoon after reserving the verdict earlier in the day, acquitting Khan, 71, and Bushra, 49.""If they are not wanted in any other case, then PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi should be released [from jail] immediately,"" the judge said after accepting their appeals. However, it was not immediately clear if Khan would be released, as this was the only case for which he was currently imprisoned following the suspension of his Toshakhana corruption case sentence and acquittal in the cipher case.Imran Khan, the cricketer-turned-politician, has been behind bars since August last year after being sentenced in the Toshakhana corruption case and subsequently convicted in other cases ahead of the February 8 elections.Maneka filed the case against the couple in November 2023, alleging that they married without observing the mandatory Iddat period. He sought to have the marriage declared null and void.Khan and Bibi married in 2018, the same year Khan won the general elections and became prime minister. Bibi, who was ostensibly Khan's spiritual guide, divorced her husband of 28 years, with whom she had five children, and developed a romantic relationship with Khan. She is Khan's third wife; during his cricketing career, Khan had a reputation as a playboy.PTI chief Gohar Khan welcomed the verdict, calling it a victory for the independent judiciary. ""All these cases were fake, and he will also get justice in all other cases,"" he said, demanding Imran Khan's immediate release as this was the last case in which he was convicted.This judgment follows a major legal victory for Khan's PTI party.

As a result, over 600,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan since the order was issued last year. Human rights organizations have cautioned that some of those sent back to Afghanistan may face persecution by the Taliban , who took power in 2021 and have implemented strict Islamic laws, denying girls access to higher education and excluding women and girls from many areas of public life.Malala, who grew up in Pakistan's Swat valley and had to relocate to the UK after being shot at the age of 15 for resisting the Pakistan Taliban's ban on girls' education, emphasized the importance of protecting girls and women, given the bleak future they face in Afghanistan. She expressed hope that Pakistan would reverse its policy, stating, ""I hope that Pakistan reverses its policy and that they protect girls and women especially because of the dark future that they would be witnessing in Afghanistan"".On her birthday, recognized by the UN as Malala Day, the activist addressed the challenges faced by Afghan girls, who have been banned from education for over three years.

After the polls, they had joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party to claim a share of reserved seats as independents were not eligible for the extra seats. The electoral body, however, ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim the reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats.”The commission had decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) and the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries with 16 and five additional seats in the National Assembly.Friday’s verdict, however, nullified the Peshawar high court’s order wherein it had upheld the election regulator’s decision denying the reserved seats to the SIC. The top court also declared the ECP’s ruling to be ultra vires to the constitution, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.“It is declared that lack of denial of an election symbol does not in any way affect the right of a political party to participate in an election,” the court order said, adding that PTI was and is a political party.It further stated that the elected members of PTI could not be declared independents or candidates of the SIC and gave the PTI 15 days to submit its list of candidates entitled for reserved seats to the election commission.ECP, the order said, should then publish the list of reserved seats of the candidates on its website within seven days.“The seats allocated to the PTI after this stage will be considered as their seats. Once the PTI gets its seats in parliament, it will be eligible for the reserved seats,” said the ruling.PTI spokesman Raoof Hassan lauded the SC for “breaking the barriers of intimidation”. “This is only the beginning of a long haul till we reach the final destination when Imran Khan shall take over as the Pakistan PM,” he said.The governing coalition still has well over 200 members of the 336-member lower house of parliament but the judgment has effectively denied a two-third majority to them that they were hoping for.

However, the election commission had stated that independents were not eligible for the allocation of 70 reserved seats , which were intended solely for political parties.The SC placed the present petitions before the three-judge committee that determines the constitution of the bench for the reconstitution of a larger bench when attorney general Mansoor Usman Awan highlighted that under Section 4 of the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, the present case should be heard by a larger bench since the issue concerns the interpretation of constitutional provisions, Dawn reported.A day ago, the court had reserved its decision on the matter after closing the hearing on a set of appe­als moved by the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).The SIC had filed a petition demanding that 77 seats for women and minorities, which were originally allotted to PM Shehbaz’s ruling coalition after the February 8 general elections, be reallocated to the alliance. However, in March, the Peshawar high court (PHC) and the election commission rejected the council’s appeal in separate rulings, declaring it ineligible for the reserved seats, as per the Dawn.Although the allocation of 23 reserved seats does not impact PM Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government's parliamentary majority, it does strengthen the political position of Khan's supporters. They have been claiming that the election commission and a pro-military caretaker government that supervised the polls engaged in electoral fraud to prevent them from winning.

He said the tax is expected to increase flour prices by PakistRupees (PKR) 8 per kg.Raza said that he would continue the strike until the demands are met and the strike would adversely affect the supply chain.""The tax measure is unacceptable and impracticable as flour dealers are refusing to lift their consignments instead of sharing their tax details for withholding tax purposes,"" he said.Raza said that the imposition of a PKR 600 tax on a bag of flour worth PKR 11,000 is inappropriate.

Pakistan's begging business collects $42 billion annually: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-begging-business-collects-42-billion-annually-report/articleshow/111667723.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's economy is in a precarious state, prompting the government to seek financial assistance from other nations and international organizations. This has led to the term 'begging' becoming a significant part of the country's political discourse, with citizens lamenting the need to constantly seek foreign aid .Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged this issue two years ago, stating, ""Today, when we go to any friendly country or make a phone call, they think that we have come to beg for money.""While the government seeks financial help, begging has become an organized industry within Pakistan, with beggars operating in cities and towns and even being exported to other countries.The government has recently decided to block the passports of more than 2,000 beggars for seven years and also restrict the activities of agents who facilitate this overseas begging business . Pakistani beggars primarily operate in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq.A parliamentary probe revealed that a significant number of beggars arrested in foreign countries were of Pakistani origin, with many exploiting pilgrim visas to travel to holy sites. The Interior Ministry has offloaded 44,000 individuals in the past two and a half years, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called for increased screening before issuing passports.Within Pakistan, begging is a highly organized and competitive business, with an estimated 38 million beggars in the country. The average daily amount collected by beggars varies across cities, with Karachi having the highest at Rs 2,000. Annually, beggars extract $42 billion, which is more than 12% of Pakistan's GDP. Turf wars between beggars for lucrative spots are common, with some even resorting to violence.The government has struggled to abolish beggary, and police action against beggars has often been met with resistance. In 2011, hundreds of beggars clashed with police officials in Faisalabad, throwing stones and bricks at the police station. One beggar remarked, ""Since when has begging become a crime in Pakistan? We will stop begging the moment our government stops begging from the IMF and other foreign countries.""","Pakistan's economy is in a precarious state, prompting the government to seek financial assistance from other nations and international organizations.

Nepal leader Oli's party pledges 'neutral' foreign policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-leader-olis-party-pledges-neutral-foreign-policy/articleshow/111720322.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nepal under veteran communist leader K P Sharma Oli will follow a ""neutral"" foreign policy focused on securing national interests and territorial integrity , while not allowing anyone to use its territory to target any third country, according to Oli's party CPN (UML). However, Oli will likely press India to address outstanding issues like the border dispute and trade imbalance, a top party functionary told TOI.While the latest round of what has come to be known as Nepal's own Game of Thrones has again thrown up Oli as the head of govt, India may not necessarily be disquieted by the return of the ""pro-China"" functionary.For one, Oli will form a govt with support from India-leaning Nepali Congress (NC), the largest party in House of Representatives with 89 seats. NC and Oli's party, which has 78 seats, struck a power-sharing agreement that will see the three-time PM assuming office again for 21 months, followed by Congress' Sher Bahadur Deuba for the remaining period.Oli's previous term is remembered for the political row with India over Nepal's new map that claims territory in Uttarakhand. However, while India's ties with NC help hedge against unexpected developments in a political environment fraught with rent-seeking and individual interests, Oli himself worked as PM to ramp up economic ties with India, by launching largest hydropower project in the country with Indian PM Modi. Modi, too, visited Nepal twice with Oli as his counterpart.Not having good relations with India is not an option for Nepal, CPN (UML) head of foreign policy dept Rajan Bhattarai told TOI. ""We have multi-dimensional ties with India that has an important role to play in realising (Oli's) 'Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali' goal,"" he said, while ruling out any dramatic shift in Nepal's approach to India or China.According to Bhattarai, however, pending issues related to border, trade deficit, water and transit must be addressed. Nepal's position on dispute over Kalapani area, which is of strategic significance because of its location at India-China-Nepal tri-junction, will remain the same as he said that while Nepal is ready to listen to Indian side and have ""open-minded"" talks, it's important to heed ""historical facts"". Bhattarai reiterated Nepal's position that as per the 1816 Treaty of Sugauli, all territories east of the Kali river, including Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulekh, belong to Nepal.On the row over Nepal's decision to issue a new map showing disputed areas in Nepal, the official said that Oli govt's action was in response to India's new map, issued after reorganisation of J&K, that included Nepal's territory.","Nepal under veteran communist leader K P Sharma Oli will follow a ""neutral"" foreign policy focused on securing national interests and territorial integrity.
