MANILA: The Philippines ' agriculture ministry said it was banning the imports of birds and poultry products from Australia because of a bird flu outbreak in Australian states.

Imports from Australia of wild and domestic birds, including poultry meat, day-old chicks, eggs , and semen will be immediately stopped, the ministry said on Saturday.

As of April, Australia ranked as the Philippines' fourth-largest source of imported chicken meat, accounting for 4% of its total volume of chicken imports.

US is making its biggest push yet to get Israel and Hamas to halt fighting. Is it succeeding?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-is-making-its-biggest-push-yet-to-get-israel-and-hamas-to-halt-fighting-is-it-succeeding/articleshow/110810226.cms,"Going public

Keeping up the pressure

The view from Israel

How about Hamas?

WASHINGTON: In Middle East capitals, at the United Nations, from the White House and beyond, the Biden administration is making its most concentrated diplomatic push of the eight-month-old war in Gaza to persuade Israeli and Hamas leaders to take a proposed deal that would bring a cease-fire and release of more hostages. But one week into the US pressure campaign, the world still is waiting for signs that the cease-fire appeal begun May 31 by President Joe Biden was working, by moving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leaders toward a negotiating breakthrough.For Israel and Hamas, the US diplomatic press has become a public test of whether either side is ready to stop fighting - at least on any terms that fall short of their professed goals, whether it's the complete crushing of the militant group or the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.For Biden, who describes the proposal as Israeli, it's the latest high-profile test of US leadership in trying to convince ally Israel as well as the militant group to relent in a conflict that is killing tens of thousands of people, inflaming regional tensions and absorbing much of the administration's focus.Here's a look at the US-led push for a Gaza cease-fire and where it stands:It wasn't that the cease-fire proposal Biden outlined in a televised address from the White House a week ago was startingly new. It was that Biden laid out the terms to the world and put the full weight of the US presidency behind the appeal for both sides to take this deal.The terms that Biden described for the first of three phases sounded much like the deal that US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators and Israel and Hamas have been haggling over for months.There would be a six-week cease-fire in which Israeli forces pulled back from populated areas of Gaza. In exchange for Israel releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, Hamas would release some women, older people and wounded among hostages it had seized in the October 7 attacks in Israel that set off the war.The proposal calls for a full release of remaining hostages and an Israeli withdrawal in later phases, although the terms are vague.""Everyone who wants peace now must raise their voices and let the leaders know they should take this deal,"" Biden said a week ago.But by Friday, neither Israel nor Hamas had said yes. Netanyahu says the terms of the proposal aren't as they have been described publicly and that Israel will never cease fighting until ""the destruction"" of Hamas' military and leadership.In effect, said Nimrod Novik, a former senior adviser to the late Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, Biden ""decided to out' Netanyahu and let the Israeli public know how serious the potential for bringing all hostages out.""The US aim: ""So Israel would say yes' to its own proposal,"" said Novik, now the Israel fellow at the Washington-based Israel Policy Forum.The Biden administration isn't letting up in its drive to get Hamas and Israel on board.""The US is going to do everything it can in some formulation to keep pushing this. Until there's no place to go any more,"" said Jonathan Panikoff, a former US intelligence official. He's now the director of the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council's Middle East program.At the UN, US diplomats are asking the Security Council to adopt a resolution demanding a permanent cease-fire between Hamas and Israel in Gaza, over Israel's objections. Biden is sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken back to the Middle East next week for his eighth visit since the war began, a lightning tour of Middle East capitals to promote the cease-fire proposal.CIA director Bill Burns and Biden Middle East adviser Brett McGurk also have traveled to the region to garner support for the deal and show key players how it could work.The Group of Seven leading global economies endorsed the proposal. So have countries with hostages held by militants in Gaza. Biden, Blinken and other US officials are working the phones to rally support among Arab governments from Egypt and Qatar to Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Many allies appear to welcome the president's initiative to get the cease-fire talks back on course after weeks of drift, Panikoff said.There's little sign - yet - that the US efforts have been enough to change the political equation in Israel. Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners have vowed to bring down the government if the Israeli prime minister accepts the proposal that Biden outlined.Trailing in opinion polls and facing an ongoing corruption trial, Netanyahu has little incentive to risk heading to another election. Although opposition leader Yair Lapid has offered to give Netanyahu backing for a hostage deal, the two men are bitter enemies and there is little reason to think any alliance would last.Benny Gantz, a centrist member of Netanyahu's war Cabinet, has called a news conference for Saturday, where he is expected to address his earlier threat to resign by this weekend if Netanyahu failed to release a plan for the war and Gaza.Netanyahu will still control a parliamentary majority if Gantz leaves. But the departure of Gantz, a former military chief and defense minister who is respected in Washington, would weaken Netanyahu's international credibility and leave him more dependent than ever on far-right coalition partners, who believe Israel should reoccupy Gaza and oppose the cease-fire proposal.Popular protests could be one of the few scenarios that sway Netanyahu toward a deal, Novik said. Alternatively, Novik contended, just the threat of a public denunciation by Biden could prod Netanyahu toward compromise, given the United States' importance as an ally.Hamas is expected to deliver a formal response in coming days to the proposal that Biden is pushing, according to what the Qataris and Egyptians, who handle the direct communications with Hamas officials in the negotiations, told US officials this week.Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told reporters this week in Beirut that Biden's announcement was ""positive"" but said the group couldn't accept any deal without Israel's guarantee of a permanent cease-fire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, a prisoner exchange and other conditions.While the supreme leader of Hamas and other political figures are based abroad, Hamas also must relay any proposals to Yahya Sinwar - whose opinion is paramount - and other military leaders in Gaza. They inhabit tunnels up to 100 feet (30 meters) or more underground and are believed to have surrounded themselves with foreign hostages to discourage attack.","The world is waiting for signs that the cease-fire appeal begun May 31 by President Joe Biden was working.

He was 90. His son, Greg Anders , confirmed the death to The Associated Press.""The family is devastated,"" Greg Anders said. ""He was a great pilot and we will miss him terribly.""Anders said the photo was his most significant contribution to the space program, given the ecological philosophical impact it had, along with making sure the Apollo 8 command module and service module worked.A report came in around 11:40 am that an older-model plane crashed into the water and sank near the north end of Jones Island, San Juan County Sheriff Eric Peter said.Only the pilot was on board the Beech A45 airplane at the time, according to the Federal Aviation Association.William Anders said in an 1997 Nasa oral history interview that he didn't think the Apollo 8 mission was risk-free but there were important national, patriotic and exploration reasons for going ahead. He estimated there was about one in three chance that the crew wouldn't make it back and the same chance the mission would be a success and the same chance that the mission wouldn't start to begin with. He said he suspected Christopher Columbus sailed with worse odds.He recounted how earth looked fragile and seemingly physically insignificant, yet was home.""We'd been going backwards and upside down, didn't really see the Earth or the Sun, and when we rolled around and came around and saw the first Earthrise,"" he said. ""That certainly was, by far, the most impressive thing. To see this very delicate, colorful orb which to me looked like a Christmas tree ornament coming up over this very stark, ugly lunar landscape really contrasted.""The National Transportation Safety Board and FAA are investigating the crash.","Retired Major General William Anders, who took the iconic ""Earthrise"" photo showing the planet as a shadowed blue marble from space in 1968, was killed Friday when the plane he was piloting plummeted into the waters off the San Juan Islands in Washington state.

Joe Biden says he would not pardon his son in felony gun trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-biden-says-he-would-not-pardon-his-son-in-felony-gun-trial/articleshow/110809473.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden said Thursday that he would not grant Hunter Biden a pardon if he was convicted in his felony gun trial , a rare comment from the president about the legal troubles facing his son.When asked during an interview with ABC News whether he would accept the outcome of the trial of his son, who faces charges including lying on an application to obtain a gun in October 2018, Joe Biden said, ""Yes.""In the wide-ranging interview, the president also defended his border policies and reiterated his support for a cease-fire proposal in the war in Gaza .When the topic turned to former President Donald Trump and his recent felony conviction, Biden said his opponent needed to ""stop undermining the rule of law.""Last week, a New York jury found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn actor, in an unlawful conspiracy to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. He has since repeated his criticism of the judge in the case and suggested he could seek to prosecute his political opponents if elected again. At a campaign rally in Arizona on Thursday, Trump called his trial ""rigged"" and said the charges had been ""fabricated.""Biden took on a sharper edge when asked about his political opponent's broadsides after a recent executive order allowing the suspension of asylum at the US-Mexico border. The former president called the move ""weak and pathetic.""""Is he describing himself -- weak and pathetic?"" Biden said in the interview, which took place on the sidelines of his visit to the beaches of Normandy in France to observe the 80th anniversary of D-Day.Biden added that the White House had supported a Senate bill that would have increased funding for immigration agencies and imposed major restrictions at the border, but Republicans rejected it while taking a cue from Trump, who did not want Biden to secure an election-year win.""We had a deal that was much broader than this, much better, much more accepted across the board,"" Biden said. ""And he got on the phone and told Republicans: Don't support it.""Biden was also asked about the challenge of managing the conflicts that now dominate his foreign policy agenda.The president warned last month that the United States would block certain arms transfers if Israel targeted heavily populated areas in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, but Israel has moved ahead with airstrikes in the city, which borders Egypt.Even though an Israeli airstrike Thursday in central Gaza killed dozens of people at a U.N. school complex, Biden said he believed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was still listening to him. The president said Israel was considering ""going into Rafah full-bore.""""Come into the city, take it out,"" Biden said in the interview. ""They haven't done that.""Biden reiterated that Israel had agreed to a proposal that the president publicly endorsed last week at the White House that could lead to a ""cessation of hostilities permanently."" But neither Israel nor Hamas has taken a definite stance on the proposal since its unveiling.","President Joe Biden says he would accept the outcome of his son's gun trial.

Watch: Sunita Williams dances upon reaching International Space Station after Starliner mission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-sunita-williams-dances-upon-reaching-international-space-station-after-starliner-mission/articleshow/110781478.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Boeing Starliner , piloted by Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore, successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday. This mission marks a historic milestone as Williams becomes the first woman to pilot and test a new crewed spacecraft on its maiden voyage.Upon arrival, Williams celebrated her third trip to the ISS with a joyful dance, a gesture of her excitement and happiness. She was warmly welcomed by the seven astronauts aboard the station, who greeted her and Wilmore with the traditional ringing of a bell. Describing the crew as ""another family,"" Williams expressed her gratitude for the warm reception.After launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, the spacecraft docked with the ISS 26 hours later, despite a one-hour delay due to minor technical issues such as helium leaks. The mission's primary objective was to validate the Boeing Starliner as a viable alternative to the SpaceX Crew Module for ferrying astronauts under NASA's commercial crew program.The astronauts monitored the Starliner as it autonomously navigated a series of maneuvers to dock with the ISS. They also completed crucial tests, including manually flying the spacecraft for the first time in space. During their week-long stay, Williams and Wilmore will assist with tests and conduct scientific experiments.Reflecting on the mission, Williams said, ""It feels like going back home."" She is known for previously carrying an idol of Lord Ganesh and the Bhagavad Gita to space. Before liftoff, Williams, who helped design the Starliner, admitted to some pre-launch nerves but expressed excitement about the spacecraft she had named ""Calypso"" after the ship of the famed French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau.The astronauts' return journey will conclude with a landing on solid ground, unlike previous missions that ended with ocean landings.","The Boeing Starliner successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday.

"Rio Grande: After 34 million years, scientists discover Antarctica's lost river",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/rio-grande-after-34-million-years-scientists-discover-antarcticas-lost-river/articleshow/110775221.cms,"A recently discovered ancient river in Antarctica , referred to as the Rio Grande , is providing new insights into the continent's climatic history. This groundbreaking find is crucial for understanding how climate change has shaped the landscape over millions of years.The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Arizona , led by geoscientist Dr Stewart Jamieson. ""The Rio Grande is unlike anything we have seen in Antarctica,"" Dr Jamieson said. ""This river system was buried under ice for millions of years and offers a unique window into the past.""The Rio Grande, which rivals some of the world's largest rivers, was identified through satellite imagery and radar data. The river's channels stretch over 680 miles, and it likely played a significant role in transporting water and sediment across the continent during a warmer period in Earth's history, a Newsweek report.The presence of the Rio Grande suggests that Antarctica once had a much milder climate, with conditions that could support flowing water. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the continent's glacial history and indicates that parts of Antarctica may have been ice-free during certain periods.""The implications of this discovery are profound,"" said Dr Jamieson. ""It changes our understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet and its stability. Knowing that such a large river system existed implies that the ice sheet was much smaller than we thought.""The research team plans to conduct further studies to determine the age of the river system and the climatic conditions that allowed it to form. These investigations could provide valuable data for predicting future changes in the Antarctic ice sheet in response toglobal warming .The discovery of the Rio Grande also raises questions about the potential for similar hidden river systems in other parts of Antarctica. ""We are just scratching the surface,"" Dr Jamieson noted. ""There could be other river systems buried beneath the ice, waiting to be discovered.""As climate change continues to impact the polar regions, understanding the history of Antarctica's ice and water systems becomes increasingly important. The findings from the Rio Grande will help scientists develop more accurate models of ice sheet dynamics and sea-level rise.This discovery highlights the importance of continued exploration and research in Antarctica. It underscores the need for international collaboration to uncover the secrets of this remote and largely unexplored continent.","The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Arizona.

WHO confirms first fatal human case of H5N2 bird flu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/who-confirms-first-fatal-human-case-of-h5n2-bird-flu/articleshow/110751897.cms,"A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant , the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday. The patient passed away on April 24 after experiencing fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and nausea. Despite having no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, the individual had multiple underlying medical conditions, including chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, according to a statement from Mexico's health ministry.The WHO reported that the patient, who had been bedridden for three weeks prior to developing acute symptoms, was hospitalized in Mexico City and succumbed to the illness the same day. This case marks the first laboratory-confirmed human infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus globally and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico.""Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,"" the WHO said. Mexican health authorities conducted laboratory tests and reported the confirmed case to the UN health body on May 23.In March, H5N2 cases were detected in a backyard poultry farm in Michoacan state, with other outbreaks identified in the State of Mexico. However, establishing a link between the human case and the poultry infections has been challenging. The WHO estimates the risk to the general population as ""low.""The Mexican health ministry emphasized that there is no risk of contagion for the population, noting that all samples from identified contacts of the patient have tested negative. Authorities are closely monitoring farms near the victim's home and have set up a permanent monitoring system to detect other cases in wildlife in the area.Andrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University, highlighted the complexity of the situation, saying, ""How this individual got infected is a big question mark that at least this initial report doesn't really address thoroughly.""The WHO and Mexican health officials continue to investigate the source of the infection. Bird flu has been known to infect various mammals, including seals, raccoons, bears, and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds. Scientists remain vigilant for changes in the virus that could signal its adaptation to spread more easily among humans.In the United States, a different variant of bird flu, H5N1, has been spreading among dairy cow herds, with a small number of human cases reported. However, none of these cases involved human-to-human transmission.Australia also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, with no signs of transmission, while noting more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.Pekosz added, ""Since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus. So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans.""(With inputs from agencies)","A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant.

As the train, part of the Final Spike Steam Tour, approached Hidalgo, the woman positioned herself dangerously close to the tracks to capture a selfie.In the video, she is seen wearing an orange top, and standing near a child, who is believed to be her son. As the train neared, the child ducked down, but the woman dropped to one knee, placing herself in the path of the train.The corner of the train's engine struck her on the back of the head, causing her to fall forward. The child ran away, visibly shocked, while a nearby man rushed to drag the woman's body away from the tracks, narrowly avoiding further harm.Local media reported that the woman was with her son and a group of children from a nearby school. Authorities confirmed that she succumbed to her injuries on the spot.The 'Empress' steam locomotive, built in 1930, had embarked on a journey from Calgary in April, traversing Canada, the United States, and Mexico as part of the tour celebrating the formation of Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC).

A special committee of the Punjab Assembly, led by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan , approved on Thursday amendments allowing lawmakers to address the House in Punjabi, Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati in addition to English and Urdu, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.

Previously a member needed permission from the Speaker to use any language other than English and Urdu, which was not always granted.

The amendment in the assembly rules aimed to enhance accessibility for constituents who speak these languages, fostering a more representative and responsive legislative body, while the change reflects the multilingual nature of the province, enabling legislators to communicate and fully participate in legislative discussions effectively.

The Speaker stated that recognising and incorporating regional languages into official proceedings also demonstrates cultural respect and acknowledgement of the linguistic heritage of Punjab, thereby strengthening the connection between the Assembly and the people.

There is a controversy over whether Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati are just dialects of Punjabi and separate languages. Those using them consider that these were separate languages but hardcore Punjabi brand them as dialects.","Lawmakers in Pakistan's Punjab Assembly would now be able to speak in at least four indigenous languages.

Putin issues dire warning to countries aiding Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-issues-dire-warning-to-countries-aiding-ukraine/articleshow/110775363.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stark warning to countries assisting Ukraine, signaling severe consequences for those who continue to support Kyiv in its ongoing conflict with Moscow. In a public address on Friday, Putin cautioned, ""Anyone who tries to intervene in the Ukraine war will be met with 'lightning-fast' retaliation."" This statement underscores the escalating tensions in the region as international support for Ukraine remains strong.Speaking from the Kremlin , Putin emphasized Russia 's readiness to respond decisively to any foreign involvement. ""We have all the instruments for this, ones that no one can boast of now,"" he stated. ""We will use them if we have to. I want everyone to know that."" The Russian leader's remarks were broadcast during a meeting with lawmakers in St. Petersburg, reflecting his unwavering stance on the Ukraine conflict.Putin's comments come as Ukraine continues to receive significant military and economic aid from Western nations, particularly the United States and European Union countries. This support has been crucial for Ukraine's defense efforts against the Russian invasion, which began in February 2022. Despite international sanctions and diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict, Russia's military actions have persisted, leading to widespread devastation and loss of life.The Russian president's address included a veiled reference to Russia's nuclear capabilities, although he did not explicitly mention nuclear weapons. The warning aligns with previous threats made by Russian officials, who have suggested that any significant interference could escalate to a nuclear confrontation.In response to Putin's warning, NATO and allied countries have reiterated their commitment to supporting Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated, ""Our support for Ukraine remains steadfast. We will not be deterred by threats, and we continue to stand united in defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty.""The international community remains divided on how best to address the conflict. While Western nations continue to supply arms and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Russia has condemned these actions as provocations and escalations. Putin's recent rhetoric suggests that any further support for Ukraine could trigger a severe and unpredictable reaction from Russia.The conflict in Ukraine has drawn global attention, with numerous calls for peace negotiations and ceasefires. However, diplomatic efforts have so far failed to produce a lasting resolution. The war has caused a significant humanitarian crisis, displacing millions and creating widespread instability in the region.As the situation continues to evolve, the risk of further escalation looms large. Analysts warn that Putin's latest comments could signal a new phase in the conflict, with potentially far-reaching implications for global security.""We are at a critical juncture,"" said military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer. ""The stakes are incredibly high, and any misstep could lead to a wider confrontation.""With tensions running high, the international community is watching closely for any signs of escalation or attempts at de-escalation.

Gaza: Judge orders temporary halt to UC academic workers' strike over war in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-orders-temporary-halt-to-uc-academic-workers-strike-over-war-in-gaza/articleshow/110811038.cms,"SANTA ANA: Thousands of academic workers on strike at the University of California were ordered by a state judge Friday to temporarily cease their weekslong strike over the war in Gaza .Orange County Superior Court Judge Randall J. Sherman issued the emergency restraining order after UC lawyers argued that the ongoing strike would cause irreversible harm as students are nearing finals.The university system sued United Auto Workers Local 4811 on Tuesday even though both sides have competing unfair practice labor claims pending before the California Public Employment Relations Board, which declined twice to issue an emergency injunction.The union, which represents 48,000 graduate students who work as teaching assistants, tutors, researchers and other academic employees on the 10-campus UC system, started its strike May 20 in Santa Cruz. The strike has since expanded to UC campuses in Davis, Los Angeles, Irvine, Santa Barbara and San Diego.Melissa Matella, associate vice president for labor relations, expressed gratitude for the order, saying in a statement that the ongoing strike would have set back students' learning and possibly stalled critical research projects. Officials say the strike is not related to employment terms and violates the union's contract.But the union says it is protesting the treatment of its members, some of whom were arrested and forcibly ejected by police in demonstrations calling for an end to the war inGaza .Rebecca Gross, a UC Santa Cruz graduate student and union leader, said Friday they are surveying rank-and-file workers on how to proceed.""The struggle is not over,"" she said. ""It really hasn't been confirmed yet ... that what we're doing here is illegal in any way.""On May 1, police in riot gear ordered the dispersal of more than a thousand people gathered on campus to support Palestine, and warned that those who refused to leave would face arrest. The night before, police had waited to intervene as counter-protesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, causing injuries.Pro-Palestinian protests have roiled campuses across the US and in Europe as students demand their universities stop doing business with Israel or companies that support its war efforts.Police arrested protesters at Stanford University after they occupied the office of the school president for several hours Wednesday. Officials said demonstrators caused extensive vandalism inside and outside the building.","UC lawyers argued that the ongoing strike would cause irreversible harm.

"US-built pier in Gaza reconnected after repairs and aid will flow soon, US central command says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-built-pier-in-gaza-reconnected-after-repairs-and-aid-will-flow-soon-us-central-command-says/articleshow/110802396.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US military-built pier designed to carry badly needed aid into Gaza by boat has been reconnected to the beach in the besieged territory after a section broke apart in storms and rough seas, and food and other supplies will begin to flow soon, US central command announced.The section that connects to the beach in Gaza, the causeway, was rebuilt nearly two weeks after heavy storms damaged it and abruptly halted what had already been a troubled delivery route.""Earlier this morning in Gaza, US forces successfully attached the temporary pier to the Gaza beach."" vice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander of US central Command, told reporters by phone. ""We expect to resume delivery of humanitarian assistance from the sea in the coming days.""Cooper said operations at the reconnected pier will be ramped up soon, with a goal to get 1 million pounds (450,000 kilograms) of food and other supplies moving through the pier into Gaza every two days.The pier was only operational for a week before a storm broke it apart, and had initially struggled to reach delivery goals. Weather was a factor, and early efforts to get aid from the pier into Gaza were disrupted as civilians desperate for food stormed the trucks that aid agencies were using to transport the food to the warehouses for distribution.However, before it broke apart, the pier had been gradually increasing aid movement each day. Cooper said that the lessons learned from that initial week of operations made him confident higher levels of aid throughout could be attained now.A large section of the causeway broke apart May 25 as heavy winds and high seas hit the area, and four army vessels operating there went aground, injuring three service members, including one who remains in critical condition. The damage was the latest stumbling block in what has been a persistent struggle to get food to starving Palestinians during the near 8-month-old Israel-Hamas war The maritime route for a limited time had been an additional way to help get more aid into Gaza because the Israeli offensive in the southern city of Rafah has made it difficult, if not impossible at times, to get anything through land routes that are far more productive. Israel's Rafah military operations and military strikes in northern Gaza had also temporarily halted U.S. airdrops of food. Cooper said the US also expects to resume those airdrops in the coming days.President Joe Biden's administration has said from the start that the pier wasn't meant to be a total solution and that any amount of aid helps.After the May 25 storm damage to the causeway, large sections were disconnected and moved to the Israeli port for repairs. In addition, two of the US Army boats that went aground during the same bad weather near Ashkelon in Israel have been freed.Two other army boats two beached onto the Gaza shoreline took on a lot of water and sand and the Israeli Navy has been helping with the repairs, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said.Biden, a democrat, announced his plan for the US military to build a pier during his State of the Union address in early March, and the military said it would take about 60 days to get it installed and operational. The initial cost was estimated at $320 million, but Singh said earlier this week that the price had dropped to $230 million, due to contributions from Britain and because the cost of contracting trucks and other equipment was less than expected.It took a bit longer than the planned two months for installation, with the first trucks carrying aid for the Gaza Strip rolling down the pier on May 17. Just a day later, crowds overran a convoy of trucks as they headed into Gaza, stripping the cargo from 11 of the 16 vehicles before they reached a UN warehouse.The next day, as officials altered the travel routes of the convoys, aid finally began reaching people in need. More than 1,100 tons (1,000 metric tons) of aid were delivered before the causeway broke apart in the storm, Pentagon officials said.",The US military-built pier designed to carry badly needed aid into Gaza by boat has been reconnected to the beach in the besieged territory.

"US employers added a robust 272,000 jobs in May in a sign of sustained economic health",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-employers-added-a-robust-272000-jobs-in-may-in-a-sign-of-sustained-economic-health/articleshow/110802381.cms,"WASHINGTON: America's employers added a strong 272,000 jobs in May, accelerating from April and a sign that companies are still confident enough in the economy to keep hiring despite persistently high interest rates .Last month's sizable job gain suggests that the economy is still growing steadily, propelled by consumer spending on travel, entertainment and other services. US airports, for example, reported record traffic over the Memorial Day weekend. A healthy job market typically drives consumer spending, the economy's principal fuel. Though some recent signs had raised concerns about economic weakness, May's jobs report should help assuage those fears.Still, Friday's report from the government included some signs of a potential slowdown. The unemployment rate , for example, edged up for a second straight month, to a still-low 4%, from 3.9%, ending a 27-month streak of unemployment below 4%. That streak had matched the longest such run since the late 1960s.President Joe Biden is still likely to point to Friday's jobs report as a sign of the economy's robust health under his administration. The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump has focused his criticism of Biden's economic policies on the surge in inflation , which polls show still weighs heavily in voters' assessment of the economy.Hourly paychecks accelerated last month, a welcome gain for workers though one that could contribute to stickier inflation. Hourly wages rose 4.1% from a year ago, faster than the rate of inflation and more quickly than in April. Some companies may raise their prices to offset their higher wage costs.The Federal Reserve's inflation fighters would like to see the economy cool a bit as they consider when to begin cutting their benchmark rate. The Fed sharply raised interest rates in 2022 and 2023 after the vigorous recovery from the pandemic recession ignited the worst inflation in 40 years.Friday's report will likely underscore Fed officials' intention to delay any cuts to their benchmark interest rate while they monitor inflation and economic data. Though Chair Jerome Powell has said he expects inflation to continue to ease, he has stressed that the Fed's policymakers need ""greater confidence"" that inflation will fall back to their 2% target before they would reduce borrowing costs. Annual inflation has declined to 2.7% by the Fed's preferred measure, from a peak above 7% in 2022.""This report is going to complicate the Fed's job,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist for ZipRecruiter. ""No one's getting those very clear signals that they were hoping for that a rate cut is appropriate in July or September.""Last month's hiring occurred broadly across most of the economy. But job growth was particularly robust in health care, which added 84,000 jobs, and restaurants, hotels, and entertainment providers, which gained 42,000.Governments, particularly local governments, added 43,000 positions. Professional and business services, which includes managers, architects and information technology, grew by 33,000.One potential sign of weakness in the May employment report was a drop in the proportion of Americans who either have a job or are looking for one; it fell from 62.7% to 62.5%. Most of that drop occurred among people 55 and over, many of whom are baby boomers who are retiring.A surge in immigration in the past three years has boosted the size of the US workforce and has been a key driver of the healthy pace of job growth. (Economists have said it isn't clear whether the government's jobs report is picking up all those gains, particularly among unauthorized immigrants.)When the Fed began aggressively raising rates, most economists had expected the resulting jump in borrowing costs to drive unemployment to painfully high levels and cause a recession. Yet the job market has proved more durable than almost anyone had predicted. Even so, Americans remain generally frustrated by high prices, a continuing source of discontent that could imperil Biden's re-election bid.The economy expanded at just a 1.3% annual rate in the first three months of this year, the government said last week, a sharp pullback from the 3.4% pace in last year's final quarter. Much of the slowdown, though, reflected reduced stockpiling by businesses and other volatile factors, while consumer and business spending made clear that demand remained solid.In April, though, consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, declined. That raised concern among economists that elevated inflation and interest rates are increasingly pressuring some consumers, particularly younger and lower-income households.A key reason why the economy is still producing solid net job growth is that layoffs remain at historic lows. Just 1.5 million people lost jobs in April. That's the lowest monthly figure on record - outside of the peak pandemic period - in data going back 24 years. After struggling to fill jobs for several years, most employers are reluctant to lay off workers.","Friday's report will likely underscore Fed officials' intention to delay any cuts to their benchmark interest rate. Hourly wages rose 4.1% from a year ago, faster than the rate of inflation.

NEW DELHI: Several people were hospitalised due to heat exhaustion in Phoenix, Arizona while waiting in line for an event featuring former President Donald Trump , the Phoenix Fire Department responded to the event held at Dream City Church in north Phoenix and sent 11 people to the hospital as reported by The Hill citing ABC15.

The Phoenix National Weather Service recorded temperatures reaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit on Thursday for the first time this year, later tying the daily record high of 111 degrees set in 2016. The region is expected to experience the season's first heat wave following an exceptionally warm summer last year.

Videos and photos shared online depicted several people fainting and requiring medical attention due to the extreme heatwave, as reported by The Hill.

Turning Point Action, a youth-oriented conservative group, sponsored the event to increase voter turnout by promoting early and mail-in voting, a concept previously opposed by Trump. The Arizona Republic noted that this was the second time the former president visited the Dream City Church.

In June 2020, Trump held an indoor event at the church, his second public gathering since the start of the COVID-19 quarantine. The Republic reported that church officials incorrectly claimed the installation of air purification systems capable of killing ""99.9%"" of COVID-19 within 10 minutes. It was also reported that at least eight of Trump's campaign staffers tested positive after his 2020 Tulsa, Oklahoma event, which took place days before the first Dream City Church rally.

Recent polling suggests that Trump leads President Biden by 3.3 percentage points in Arizona.

"First Lady Jill Biden attends son Hunter Biden's gun trial, two more witnesses expected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/first-lady-jill-biden-attends-son-hunter-bidens-gun-trial-two-more-witnesses-expected/articleshow/110800616.cms,"WILMINGTON: First lady Jill Biden has arrived at the courthouse for son Hunter Biden 's federal gun trial . She left France on Thursday evening where she was attending D-Day events with president Joe Biden . She'll return to France for a state dinner.Federal prosecutors are wrapping up their gun case against Hunter Biden, with two more witnesses expected Friday in their effort to prove to jurors that the president's son lied on a mandatory gun purchase form when he said he wasn't ""an unlawful user of, or addicted to"" drugs.Prosecutors were still planning to call a drug expert and an FBI chemist, capping a week that has been largely dedicated to highlighting the seriousness of his drug problem through highly personal and sometimes salacious testimony.Jurors heard from his ex-wife and a former girlfriend who testified about his habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean. They saw images of the president's son bare-chested and disheveled in a filthy room, and half-naked holding crack pipes, and they watched video of his crack cocaine weighed on a scale.Prosecutor say the evidence is necessary to prove that Hunter, 54, was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied when he checked ""no"" on the form. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, has argued Hunter did not think of himself as an ""addict"" when he bought the gun and did not intend to deceive anyone.Meanwhile, president Joe Biden worked to walk the line between president and father, telling ABC in an interview that he would accept the jury's verdict and ruling out a pardon for his son. Earlier this week he issued a statement saying: ""I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.""Biden is in France this week for D-Day anniversary events. First lady Jill Biden, who attended court most of the week, flew from France Thursday to be at the trial again Friday before she will return to France for a state dinner.Hunter Biden been charged with three felonies: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.He has pleaded not guilty. He'd hoped to resolve the gun case and another separate tax case in California with a plea deal last year, the result of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings. The deal had him pleading guilty to lower-level charges that would have resolved both cases and spared him the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. It fell apart after Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned unusual aspects of the proposed agreement and the lawyers couldn't resolve them.Hunter Biden said he got charged because the Justice Department bowed to pressure from Republicans who argued the Democratic president's son was getting special treatment, and who have escalated their attacks on the criminal justice system since Donald Trump's recent conviction in New York City in a hush money case.Lowell said he would call the president's brother James as a witness, but it's unclear yet whether Hunter Biden will testify.But jurors have already heard his voice. Prosecutors have played lengthy audio excerpts in court of his 2021 memoir ""Beautiful Things,"" in which he writes about his lifelong addiction issues and spiraling descent after death of his brother Beau in 2015. The book, written after he got sober, covers the period he had the gun but doesn't mention it specifically.Lowell has said Hunter Biden's state of mind was different when he wrote the book than when he purchased the gun, when he didn't believe he had an addiction. He pointed out to jurors that some of the questions on the firearms transaction record are in the present tense, such as ""are you an unlawful user of or addicted to"" drugs.And he's suggested Hunter Biden might have felt he had a drinking problem at the time, but not a drug problem. Alcohol abuse doesn't preclude a gun purchase.The reason law enforcement raised any questions about the revolver is because Hallie Biden, Beau's widow, found it unloaded in Hunter's truck on Oct. 23, 2018, panicked and tossed it into a garbage can at a nearby market. She testified about the episode Thursday.She told jurors she considered hiding the gun but thought her kids might find it, so she decided to throw it away.""I realize it was a stupid idea now, but I was panicking,"" she said. ""I didn't want him to hurt himself, and I didn't want my kids to find it and hurt themselves.""Hallie Biden, who had a brief romantic relationship with Hunter after Beau died, testified that from the time Hunter returned to Delaware from a 2018 trip to California until she threw his gun away, she did not see him using drugs. That time period included the day he bought the weapon.But much of her testimony focused on Oct. 23, 2018 - 11 days after he bought it. Hunter was staying with her and seemed exhausted. Asked by the prosecutor if it appeared that Hunter was using drugs around then, she said, ""He could have been.""As Hunter slept in her home, Hallie Biden went to check his car. She said she was hoping to help him get or stay sober, free of both alcohol and cocaine. She said she found the remnants of crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia . She also found the gun Hunter purchased in a box with a broken lock that kept it from fully closing. There was ammunition too.She put in a leather pouch put the pouch in a bag and tossed it into in the trash can at Janssen's Market. He noticed it missing and asked her whether she had taken it.""Are you insane?"" he texted. He told her to go back to the market to look for it.Surveillance footage played for jurors showed her digging around in the trash can for the gun, but it wasn't there. She asked store officials if someone had taken out the trash. Hallie testified Hunter told her to file a police report because the gun was registered in his name. She called the police while she was still at the store.Officers located the man who inadvertently took the gun along with other recyclables from the trash and retrieved it. The case was eventually closed because of lack of cooperation from Hunter Biden, who was considered the victim.Jurors also heard from the officers who handled the case, from the man who found the gun and from the store clerk who sold Hunter the revolver.If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.He also faces a separate trial in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes.","President Joe Biden says he will accept the jury's verdict and ruling out a pardon for his son.

Involuntary manslaughter case dropped against 911 dispatcher in Pennsylvania woman's death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/involuntary-manslaughter-case-dropped-against-911-dispatcher-in-pennsylvania-womans-death/articleshow/110797836.cms,"Prosecutors this week dropped an involuntary manslaughter case against a 911 dispatcher in Pennsylvania who had been accused of failing to send an ambulance to the rural home of a woman who was found dead a day later of internal bleeding.Greene county district attorney Brianna Vanata said she acted to end the case against Leon ""Lee"" Price after reviewing an investigator 's report that said he felt charges were not justified in the July 2020 death of 54-year-old Diania Kronk .""There was just no criminal culpability here,"" Vanata said in a phone interview Thursday. She said the decision to pursue charges two years after Kronk died and shortly after her family filed a lawsuit over it was a mistake by the then district attorney, Dave Russo.""I'm not sure what the previous district attorney was thinking,"" Vanata said. ""That's where I'm at.""Price's defense lawyer, Timothy Ross, said Thursday the charges had been a stressful ordeal for his client, who he described as an upstanding employee who had consistently maintained he was innocent of the allegations. In the wake of Kronk's death, Ross said, an investigator had told Price he would not be charged.Ross said Price is ""moving forward, rebuilding his reputation in this community and just happy to put these charges behind him.""Investigators had said Price was reluctant to dispatch help without getting more assurances Kronk would actually go to the hospital.Vanata said she based her decision on an August 2020 memo by Greene county regional police chief Zachary Sams that said Price may not have been trained properly and the investigator felt Price's actions did not ""rise to the levels necessary to facilitate a criminal charge.""On a recording, Price was heard questioning Kronk's daughter Kelly Titchenell for about four minutes. As Titchenell described her mother's condition, Price asked if Kronk was ""willing to go"" to the hospital about a half-hour away from her home in Sycamore. Titchenell assured him she would and said she was concerned her mother might die.Titchenell told the dispatcher Kronk had been drinking heavily for some weeks, she had been losing weight and appeared to be turning yellow.Price said he would send an ambulance but then added that ""we really need to make sure she's willing to go."" Price asked Titchenell to call once she got to Kronk's home, but Titchenell said she could not find her mother's landline and there was not cell service.Titchenell said that when she got to Kronk's home, her mother was nude on the porch and talking incoherently, telling her repeatedly she was Ok. Titchenell said an autopsy attributed Kronk's death to internal bleeding.Titchenell did not call 911 again on her way home, believing that her uncle would soon check on her. The uncle discovered the next day that Kronk had died.Russo said there was ample evidence and called Vanata's move to drop the case a political decision. Russo said Thursday the involuntary manslaughter charge had survived previous defense efforts to have it dismissed.At Vanata's request, a judge withdrew the charges on Monday. Jury selection and trial had been scheduled for next week.Vanata said she approached Price about a potential plea bargain to a lesser charge but he did not take the deal. Titchenell questioned the decision to drop charges.""I feel that there was too much for the new district attorney to go through,"" Titchenell said in a phone interview Wednesday. ""She would have had to put in a lot of time and work to understand this case, to go over everything.

T20 World Cup not Lok Sabha Election: How the other Nitish Kumar made a huge impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/t20-world-cup-not-lok-sabha-election-how-the-other-nitish-kumar-made-a-huge-impact/articleshow/110791314.cms,"Forcing a Super Over against Pakistan





Who is Nitish Kumar?





In the recent Indian General Election, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar ’s performance in the Lok Sabha 2024 Election turned out to be crucial for the NDA. He might have won only 12 seats, but he is now a crucial ally in the NDA. Similarly, his namesake in the USA cricket team played an important role in ensuring the USA slayed Pakistan in the 2024 T20 World Cup .Nitish Kumar might not have been in the best of forms but like his namesake, the small performance made a huge difference. Of course it came in Texas instead of Bihar. Kumar scored only 14 runs in 14 balls, but he scored a crucial boundary to force matters and push the match into a Super over where the US made history by defeating Pakistan. In many ways, it was reminiscent of a bunch of amateur footballers from USA in 1950 defeating England at the World Cup.Co-hosts the United States caused a massive upset in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, stunning former champions Pakistan by five runs in a Super Over after their encounter ended in a tie at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas. Electing to field first, the USA restricted Pakistan to 159/7 and then matched the score, producing a brilliant run-chase to take Pakistan into a Super Over. With Nitish Kumar hitting a boundary off the last ball bowled by Haris Rauf, USA reached 159/3 in 20 overs and tied the scores.In the Super Over, Mohammed Amir was directionless and bowled three wides as Aaron Jones and Harmeet Singh scored 18/1 in six balls. Aaron Jones was run out for 11 off the last ball of the One-Over Eliminator. Saurabh Netravalkar defended that despite being struck for a four off the second ball by Iftikhar. He too bowled two wides. He, however, got Iftikhar out for four with Nitish Kumar picking up a superb catch as Pakistan needed seven runs off the last ball but could manage only two, losing the match by five runs.This is the USA's second victory in Group A after they started with a win against Canada in the tournament lung-opener on June 1. Pakistan lost their first match and will take on arch-rivals India on Sunday in New York. Chasing 160 for victory, opener Steven Taylor departed for 12 (16) in the final over of the Powerplay, as USA scored 44/1. Skipper Monank Patel and Andries Gous put Pakistan on the back foot with a brilliant 69-run partnership for the second wicket that moved the tournament co-hosts into treble figures and seemingly in control of the run chase. Monank was particularly impressive, hitting a classy half-century to give his side hope. He scored an exact 50 off 38 balls, hitting seven boundaries and one six, while Gous scored 35 off 26 balls.However, Pakistan’s four-pronged pace attack hit back, removing both set batters to set up a nervy finale at the Grand Prairie Stadium. Haris Rauf cleaned up Gous (35 from 26) to get the crucial breakthrough. And, an over later, Mohammad Amir had the excellent Patel caught behind for 50 from 38 to give Pakistan hope. Despite a fine knock from Aaron Jones, Pakistan had moved to the brink of victory, thanks to a classic display of death bowling. But USA hammered 11 runs off the final three deliveries of the innings, with Nitish Kumar slamming the last ball for four to force a Super Over and send the home crowd delirious in Dallas.Born in Scarborough, Ontario in 1994, Nitish Kumar is an all-rounder who played almost all of Canada’s matches in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup qualifiers. He holds the record for being the youngest player to debut for Canada in a first-class match when he played in the ICC Intercontinental Cup Fixture against Kenya in August 2009. He is also the second-youngest ODI player (15 years and 273 days), only bettered by Pakistan’s Hasan Raza. Kumar later swapped colours and started representing the US national team. In this year’s T20 World Cup, he is representing the USA.Incidentally, Nitish Kumar’s middle name is Roenick, a tribute to National Hockey League star Jeremy Roenick . Incidentally, Kumar played for Canada in the 2011 World Cup when here became the tournament’s youngest player. Kumar even captained Canada and last played for the team 2019. He recently made his debut for the US national side and is part of the T20 World Cup squad being held in US soil. He is also expected to face off against India when the two nations meet on June 12.With inputs from agencies","Co-hosts the United States caused a massive upset in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, stunning former champions Pakistan by five runs in a Super Over after their encounter ended in a tie.

Russian court begins trial of US soldier arrested on theft charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russian-court-begins-trial-of-us-soldier-arrested-on-theft-charges/articleshow/110788202.cms,"MOSCOW: A court in Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok on Thursday began the trial of an American soldier arrested earlier this year on charges of stealing. Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, 34, flew to Vladivostok, a Pacific port city, to see his girlfriend and was arrested after she accused him of stealing from her, according to US officials and Russian authorities. He faces up to five years in prison if convicted.Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported from the courtroom in the Pervomaisky District Court in Vladivostok that Black agreed to testify in the trial and will respond to the accusations against him later in the proceedings. The report also cited local police as saying that Black is cooperating with the authorities.Black's arrest further complicates US relations with Russia, which have grown increasingly tense as the fighting in Ukraine continues.Russia is holding a number of Americans in its jails, including corporate security executive Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. The US government has designated both men as wrongfully detained and has been trying to negotiate for their release.Others detained include Travis Leake, a musician who had been living in Russia for years and was arrested last year on drug-related charges; Marc Fogel, a teacher in Moscow who was sentenced to 14 years in prison, also on drug charges; and dual nationals Alsu Kurmasheva and Ksenia Khavana.The US State Department strongly advises American citizens not to go to Russia.Under Pentagon policy, service members must get clearance for any international travel from a security manager or commander.The US army said last month that Black hadn't sought clearance for the international travel and it wasn't authorized by the Defense Department. Given the hostilities in Ukraine and ongoing threats to the US and its military, it is extremely unlikely he would have been granted approval.Black was on leave and in the process of returning to his home base at Fort Cavazos, Texas, from South Korea, where he had been stationed at Camp Humphreys with the Eighth Army. Cynthia Smith, an Army spokesperson, said Black signed out for his move back home and, ""instead of returning to the continental United States, Black flew from Incheon, Republic of Korea, through China to Vladivostok, Russia, for personal reasons.""Black's girlfriend, Alexandra Vashchuk, told reporters after the court hearing on Thursday that ""it was a simple domestic dispute ,"" during which Black ""became aggressive and attacked"" her. ""He then stole money from my wallet and I didn't give him permission to do it,"" Vashchuk said.US officials have said that Black, who is married, met his girlfriend in South Korea.According to US officials, the Russian woman had lived in South Korea, and last fall she and Black got into some type of domestic dispute or altercation. After that, she left South Korea. It isn't clear if she was forced to leave or what, if any, role South Korean authorities had in the matter.","Staff Sgt.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently jailed, invoked the case of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal receiving bail ahead of Lok Sabha elections as he protested his mistreatment in jail before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.Appearing on Thursday before a five-member bench led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Khan decried the ""victimisation"" he has faced since being ousted from power in April 2022.The bench, which included Justices Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhel, Athar Minallah, and Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, heard Khan's grievances regarding amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO). Justice Minallah expressed sympathy, acknowledging the misfortune of Khan being in jail despite leading a major political party with millions of supporters, as per reports.Khan, 71, argued that his conviction within five days was a deliberate attempt to sideline him from the general elections held on February 8. He contrasted his situation with that of Kejriwal, who was granted bail by India's Supreme Court, enabling him to campaign. Khan contended that Pakistan is operating under an undeclared ""martial law,"" further oppressing his political activities.Expressing disappointment over the Supreme Court's rejection of a request from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's government for live streaming the case, Khan questioned the judgment's implication that he was engaging in political point-scoring. Chief Justice Isa responded that a judge need not explain their verdicts, advising Khan to file a review petition instead.Khan urged the Supreme Court to appoint a chairman for the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), criticizing the current appointment process as being influenced by a ""third umpire"" when consensus between the Opposition and government fails. Justice Minallah countered, stating there was no justification to invalidate the NAB amendments.The PTI founder called for reforms in NAB, citing ongoing inquiries against him. Justice Minallah's reminder about the Chief Election Commissioner appointment led Khan to argue that restoring the amendment would benefit his NAB cases but potentially bankrupt the country.Chief Justice Isa prohibited Khan from referencing the Islamabad High Court (IHC) verdict in the cipher cases, as appeals might be pending in the Supreme Court. Justice Rizvi questioned Khan's failure to oppose the NAB amendments in Parliament, to which Khan replied that his government was overthrown through a conspiracy, making it futile to engage with the current ""conspiratorial government.""Khan also sought a comparison of his jail conditions with those afforded to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. In response, Justice Mandokhel humorously noted that Sharif is not currently in jail, asking if Khan wished for his incarceration. Chief Justice Isa concluded the session by mentioning the possibility of a surprise visit by a judicial officer to inspect Khan's jail conditions.",Imran Khan appeared before the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday. The former Pakistan Prime Minister is currently jailed for contempt of court. Khan argued that his conviction within five days was a deliberate attempt to sideline him from the general elections held on February 8.

Sharif is currently on a visit to China at the invitation of President Xi Jinping, seeking to upgrade cooperation under the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a key part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative .In a statement, the Pakistan Prime Minister's Office said during the meeting, the two sides discussed the significance of Gwadar as an important pillar of the CPEC and agreed to expedite the timely completion of all related infrastructure projects to transform Gwadar in Balochistan province into a regional economic hub.""They also expressed their firm commitment to protect CPEC from its detractors and adversaries and to upgrade CPEC in the form of enhanced cooperation,"" the statement said.The two leaders reaffirmed unwavering support for each other on core issues and expressed continued commitment and support for the high-quality development of the CPEC, Geo News reported.They also emphasised the timely completion of all ongoing projects with a special focus on industrial development, agriculture modernisation, Science & Technology and the development of Special Economic Zones for mutually beneficial and socio-economic development of Pakistan.Sharif also reaffirmed Pakistan's unflinching resolve to ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel and projects in Pakistan.Chinese investment and financial support since 2013 have been key for the South Asian nation's struggling economy, including the rolling over of loans so that Islamabad can meet external financing needs at a time when foreign reserves are critically low.China has also invested billions in various power projects and road networks in Pakistan under the USD 65 billion CPEC plan, but the implementation of various projects has slowed in recent months.The CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Pakistan's Balochistan with China's Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI is seen as an attempt by China to further its influence abroad with infrastructure projects funded by Chinese investments across the world.The recurring attacks on the Chinese personnel working on the CPEC projects by militant groups in Pakistan have become a major concern for China.In March, five Chinese and one Pakistani nationals were killed in a terrorist attack on their vehicle of the Dasu Hydropower Project undertaken by a Chinese company in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.During the talks, the two leaders discussed the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and discussed regional and global developments of mutual interest.They noted that the Pakistan-China All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership was characterised by mutual trust, shared principles and strategic convergence. Premier Li congratulated Prime Minister Sharif on Pakistan's election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.The two sides agreed to maintain high-level exchanges including strengthening institutional linkages at all tiers and in all spheres of bilateral cooperation. Pakistan and China will also continue to consult closely on issues of regional and global significance and multilateral fora, especially during the two-year tenure of Pakistan as a non-member of the UNSC.The delegation-level talks were followed by an MoU signing ceremony. Both signed 23 MoUs and agreements deepening cooperation in transport infrastructure, industry, energy, agriculture, media, health, water, socio-economic development and others of mutual interest.","Pakistan and China vow to protect the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) from its ""detractors and adversaries"" Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured Beijing of providing complete security to Chinese personnel working on the USD 65 billion project.

An Islamabad HC division bench, comprising justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, delivered a short verdict, accepting their appeals against the convictions.

“The state had badly failed in proving its case and even its prosecutors had abandoned the case. Hats off to the honourable judges. It was a case of first impression. Imran and Qureshi did not do any anti-state activity,” remarked Imran’s counsel Salman Safdar following the verdict.

Despite the acquittal, Khan will remain imprisoned to serve his sentence in the “iddat” case, related to his alleged unlawful marriage to Bushra Bibi, his third wife. Both are serving seven-year jail terms after a trial court ruled that their 2018 marriage broke the law by not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called “Iddat”, after Bibi divorced her previous husband.

Qureshi remains on physical remand until June 5, accused of inciting violence on May 9 last year when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters stormed military and civilian govt assets following Imran’s arrest.

The 71-year-old former cricket star has faced a series of political and legal challenges since being ousted as PM in April 2022 after losing a confidence vote in parliament. A special court, constituted under Official Secrets Act, 1923, had convicted the two PTI politicians for sharing classified communication between Washington and Islamabad, which Khan claimed was part of a US conspiracy to overthrow his govt in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Washington and Pakistan’s military dismissed the allegation.

Khan’s conviction in the cipher case was one of three charges against him leading up to the Feb 8 elections this year, which he alleged were orchestrated to prevent his return to office. Last year, the same court overturned his conviction in a corruption case involving the unlawful sale of state gifts during his term from 2018 to 2022. The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes — the most expensive being $304,000.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan sentenced to 10 years in prison.

The uploads also included pictures of Pakistan’s current civilian and military leaderships and alleged they stole the mandate of the Imran-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in general elections this Feb.“Every Pakistani should study the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and get to know who was the true traitor, General Yahya Khan or Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” said a quote attributed to Imran.The commission had probed Pakistan’s political-military involvement in East-Pakistan --- current-day Bangladesh --- from 1947 to 1971. The video referred to purported crimes by the Pakistani military during the civil war in East Pakistan and claimed former military dictator General Yahya was responsible.Strong backlash followed the posts, especially from government ranks who called it “alarming” and accused PTI of fuelling a narrative of “hatred and incitement” by drawing comparisons between Imran and Mujib.On Friday, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials visited the prison where Imran has been kept to quiz him over the post but he refused to meet them without lawyers. FIA has sent a notice to Imran on the matter.This was followed by a meeting of army commanders, which vowed to defeat what it termed “digital terrorism” by trying to induce despondency and sowing discord by peddling “blatant lies, fake news, and propaganda”. “The nation is fully cognisant of their ugly and ulterior motives and the designs of these nefarious forces,” General Munir was quoted army’s media wing as saying.Imran’s PTI had until recently been trying to disassociate itself from the controversial posts but “owned” them on his directions. A meeting of PTI’s core committee was held on Friday. “Hamoodur Rehman Commission Report must be made public to avoid 1971 like grave challenges, learn a lesson from the past and apprise the people about what exactly happened in 1971,” PTI said in a statement after the meeting.The statement then sought to draw a parallel between 1970 and the current situation in Pakistan. “In 1971 debacle, the most important aspect was rejection of the people’s mandate, which is also presently prevailing in the country,” PTI said.",The posts were uploaded by Imran’s social media team last week on his X account.

We have been suffering for over 12 hours of load shedding in this high heat, while they sit in the air-conditioned offices.""""They will not be able to tolerate any heat if the roles are reversed. And I believe that there is a lot of water but the entire problem is because of rampant corruption and other misconducts.

Despite strong reservations from Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the government on Thursday recalled these ambassadors, including Nepal's envoy to India Shankar Sharma, The Kathmandu Post newspaper reported.This comes ahead of Prime Minister Prachanda's likely visit to New Delhi on Sunday to witness Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony. Such a move sends a very undiplomatic message, multiple foreign ministry officials told the newspaper.Foreign Minister Shrestha had reportedly been opposing the proposal to recall ambassadors appointed in the quota for the Nepali Congress and other parties, but Prime Minister Dahal and CPN-UML Chairman Oli unilaterally decided to recall the ambassadors, a minister told the paper.Foreign Minister Shrestha reportedly told both Dahal and Oli not to recall all 11 envoys because the performance of some of them was good, the minister said. Dahal and Oli are learnt to have pressured Shrestha to accept the move which was later decided by the Cabinet.The decision was supposed to come from the foreign ministry but the Cabinet had endorsed it without much discussion. Shrestha opposed the decision in the Cabinet meeting too, sources said.The recalled ambassadors are Sharma (India), Sridhar Khatri (USA), Gyan Chandra Acharya (United Kingdom) and Jyoti Pyakurel Bhandari (South Korea). They were appointed in the quotas allotted to the Nepali Congress when the party president Sher Bahadur Deuba headed the government in 2021. Sharma, Acharya and Khatri were recommended ambassadors in October, 2021.Other ambassadors whose terms were cut short are Naresh Bikram Dhakal (Qatar), Nawaraj Subedi (Saudi Arabia), Sharmila Parajuli Dhakal (Spain), Ram Swartha Ray Yadav (Denmark), Kanta Rizal (Israel), Dilliraj Poudel (Malaysia) and Salin Nepal (Portugal).Dhakal, Rizal and Nepal were also appointed in the Congress quota before the party left the Dahal-led government in March. Subedi and Yadav were recommended by the Janata Samajbadi Party. Dhakal was appointed in the quota for the Prachanda-led CPN (Maoist Centre) but her influence in the party was weak, sources claimed. Poudel was appointed in the quota for the CPN (Unified Socialist) but he failed to build a cordial relationship with Minister for Labour D P Aryal.The envoys have been given three to four weeks to return, according to a minister.","Nepal government has recalled ambassadors from 11 countries, including those serving in India and the US.
