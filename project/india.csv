"No strain, Congress-AAP will fight with full strength in Delhi: Rahul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-strain-congress-aap-will-fight-with-full-strength-in-delhi-rahul/articleshow/110242536.cms,"NEW DELHI: Signalling that Congress and AAP will be putting up a united front to strongly counter BJP , Rahul Gandhi on Saturday at a public meeting here said that on May 25 when Delhi goes to polls he will be voting for AAP and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal will be voting for Congress. This assertion of unity by the Congress functionary came at a packed Ramlila Ground in Ashok Vihar area of Chandni Chowk parliamentary constituency.Making it clear that both parties need to work together to ""save the Constitution"" from those trying to destroy it, Rahul trained his guns at Prime Minister Narendra Modi claiming that while he is giving scripted interviews to a few of his ""favourite journalists"", he is refusing to have a debate with him as suggested by some intellectuals and journalists.He challenged that Modi will not have a debate with him as the PM cannot answer his questions about his links with a few favoured businessmen and the misuse of the electoral bonds scheme.AAP and Congress are contesting in alliance in Delhi under the INDIA bloc with a seat-sharing arrangement of 4 and 3 seats. So, going by Rahul's statement, since he lives in New Delhi, he will be voting for AAP's Somnath Bharti and Civil Lines resident Kejriwal will be casting his ballot in favour of veteran Congress functionary JP Agarwal who is contesting from Chandni Chowk.Rahul's emphasis on Congress and AAP fighting with full strength is significant as it comes at a time when there has been speculation that the Congress-AAP Alliance is under strain as Congress is seen to be distancing itself from the controversy surrounding Kejriwal's party as it is caught in the midst of a political storm over the assault case involving its Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal.In a sharp attack on those leaving Congress to join BJP, Rahul said, ""We don't want 'darpok (coward)' leaders."" As the crowd cheered, he said, ""We want 'Babbar Sher' (lions) and not those who fear action from CBI-ED.""Rahul urged both Congress and AAP workers to work together and ensure victory for their alliance on all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi. ""It's interesting that I will vote for AAP and Arvind Kejriwal will vote for Congress in these elections,"" he said.Continuing with his attack on PM Modi, Rahul said, ""he (the PM) is giving non-stop interviews to his favourite journalists but he will not have a debate with me. I'm ready but I'm sure he won't come. The first question I would ask PM Modi is what is his relationship with Adani, next I want to ask him about electoral bonds,"" he said and claimed that the debate would end after these two questions. He also questioned that while PM Modi talks about Congress getting tempo-loads of money from Adani-Ambani, but he does not dare to get it investigated.Rahul attacked the PM recalling that earlier he would spread hatred and make one religion fight with the other. He claimed that recently in an interview ""Modi said that when he was small, on Eid, Muslim brothers would send food to his house. Really, Modi ji but you are vegetarian. So are you not a vegetarian that you claim to the world...""""So, now you see a new Narendra Modi because you can see that he can perceive he is on his way out as the PM...,"" Rahul alleged.In his address, the senior Congress member also referred to his questioning by the Enforcement Directorate and pointed out that they interrogated him for 55 hours till they got tired. ""They snatched my house... I told them I don't want your house as the entire country is my home,"" he said to a overwhelmingly responsive crowd.Even though Congress is fighting the polls in alliance with AAP in Delhi as part of INDIA Bloc, the meet was largely a Congress outreach. Five of 9 AAP MLAs from Chandni Chowk including Delhi minister Imran Hussain, who represents Ballimaran assembly, were present.All three Congress candidates - JP Agarwal (Chandni Chowk), Udit Raj (northwest) and Kanhaiya Kumar (northeast) - were present at the meet. Among senior members present at the meet were Congress general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal, P Chidambaram, Ajay Maken, Delhi Congress President Devinder Yadav and AICC Delhi in-charge Deepak Babaria, All India Mahila Congress President Alka Lamba and former Delhi ministers Haroon Yusuf, Yoganand Shastri among others.Despite the heat, thousands thronged to the Ramlila Ground in Ashok Vihar. As the crowd swayed the Congress flags raising slogans in support of Rahul Gandhi, Congress set off its show of strength with 'Vande Mataram'.The concerns raised by the people in the crowd ranged from joblessness to price rise and inadequate pension as excited first time voters to elderly jostled for space to get a glimpse of Gandhi and hear the party functionaries zealously share the promises laid out in the party's 'Nyay Patra' as they looked for answers to their daily troubles.",Rahul Gandhi said that on May 25 when Delhi goes to polls he will be voting for AAP and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal will vote for Congress. This assertion of unity by the Congress functionary came at a packed Ramlila Ground in Ashok Vihar area of Chandni Chowk parliamentary constituency.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110242571,imgsize-1247887,width-400,resizemode-4/110242571.jpg"
Welfare or casteism? Tough call for Kaushambi voters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/welfare-or-casteism-tough-call-for-kaushambi-voters/articleshow/110242197.cms,"PRAYAGRAJ : Known as the ‘tapobhoomi’ (ground of penance) of Tathagata, the birthplace of the sixth Tirthankara of Jainism Padmaprabha, and the land which had been witness to unbreakable love of Maharaja Udayan and Vasavadatta, Kaushambi is set to witness an interesting battle between a seasoned politician and a debutant.Two-time MP from this Lok Sabha seat Vinod Sonkar of BJP is running for a third term.He is up against Samajwadi Party candidate Pushpendra Saroj, a fresh face in politics, educated in London and one of the youngest candidates in fray.The seat which will go to poll on May 20, comprises Chail, Manjhanpur (reserved) and Sirathu of Kaushambi and Babaganj (reserved) and Kunda assembly seats of Pratapgarh. Dominated by caste politics, issues of national interest and development have been raised by only a small section of voters in this reserved Lok Sabha seat.Lack of industries, not much being done to promote ODOP (banana), scarcity of water supply and roads are all issues raised by the main opposition, SP , which had captured all three assembly seats of Kaushambi in the 2022 assembly elections To add spice to this battle, Kunda MLA and president of Jansatta Dal (Loktantrik) Raghuraj Pratap Singh aka Raja Bhaiya, who has a huge influence on voters of the two assembly seats, is neither contesting the parliamentary polls nor supporting any political party in Kaushambi Lok Sabha poll.The seat is also a test of power and influence of leaders like deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and sitting BJP MP Vinod Sonkar, who are flexing muscles against Pushpendra Saroj, son of SP general secretary Indrajeet Saroj.In the elections, there is less talk about issues and more about caste equations. BJP workers are conducting door-to-door contact programmes in all five assembly segments of Kaushambi Lok Sabha seat, while SP, which enjoys a more formidable support—had won all three assembly seats in Kaushambi district including Manjhanpur, Sirathu and Chial in 2022 state assembly polls—seems quite confident in backing the 25-year-old candidate Pushpendra Saroj.Apna Dal (Kamerawadi) had parted ways with SP and forged alliance with AIMIM under the banner PDM (Pichhda Dalit Muslim) and fielded its candidate Narendra Kumar Saroj. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate is former administrative officer Shubh Narayan Gautam.This seat, with about 20 lakh voters, has 35% Scheduled Caste voters whereas the alliance of Yadavs and Muslims is about 13%.While BJP is trying to break into SP’s stronghold playing the Hindutva card and highlighting welfare schemes of the central and state govts, SP is trying to woo young voters and trying to strengthen the base of caste equations. The fact that its candidate is young and foreign educated, lack of good educational institutions in the district and too much dependency on Prayagraj is also being highlighted by SP.Shailendra Kesarwani of Chail says, “So far, people have been voting in the name of Hindutva. This time there is anger against the candidate and voting will be on the basis of development and ideology, though the behavior of the candidate will also be considered.” Rakesh Kumar Pasi says, “There will be division of caste votes and people may vote in the name of Modi. The work done by the MP matters.”Retired teacher Chandra Bhushan Pandey explains the importance of local issues, saying, “Kaushambi has not developed industrially. Bananas were included in ODOP but no food processing unit was set up in 10 years. Employment resources have become zero. All the claims made by politicians will be under voters’ scanner.”There is pain in the words of Buddhan as he speaks about the atmosphere in the Pasi dominated village about 3 kms away from Kaushambi Khas. He says that in elections, earlier, most of the people used to vote unanimously but not this time. “Crop destruction by stray animals and water scarcity could go against the BJP but satisfactory law and order is a plus point,” he says.Prabhakar of Shahbadpur of Kunda dismisses the issue of stray animals and electricity. “This is not an issue as farmers have made their own arrangements. Today, I want to see where my nation stands in the international arena, where the govt has the spine to hit back at traitors and bring back stranded citizens.” Dr Mohammad Khan, who lives in Chakia of Prayagraj but has roots in Manjhanpur, says, “The decision of Raja Bhaiya has literally ‘freed’ the voters and now SP stands a fair chance.”","Two-time MP from this Lok Sabha seat Vinod Sonkar of BJP is running for a third term. He is up against Samajwadi Party candidate Pushpendra Saroj. The seat which will go to poll on May 20, comprises Chail, Manjhanpur (reserved) and Sirathu of Kaushambi and Babaganj of Pratapgarh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110242208,imgsize-1307976,width-400,resizemode-4/110242208.jpg"
Party that works for national interest will win this family’s votes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/party-that-works-for-national-interest-will-win-this-familys-votes/articleshow/110242183.cms,"In 1972, Kishore Sharma came to Jhansi to set up a rolling mill plant. Soon after, his brothers Dilip and Rajiv followed from Prayagraj. The close knit family now has a thriving business, an active social life and they have been witness to the growth of Jhansi into its present day avatar.The family strongly believes that the issues of ‘roti, kapda aur makaan’ are foremost issues for any govt to fulfil.Therefore, says 75-year-old Dilip, “the party that works for national interest will win our votes.” There was a time when the family voted for candidates, based on their personal equations and the work done by them. Their vote continues to be for one person, though that person is not a candidate here. The vote is for Narendra Modi .His sister-in-law Vidrum highlights the need for a strong govt that can address law and order issues. Jhansi, she says, was a place where women could not step out alone after a point of time. Lawlessness was out of control some years back, and even today, people shudder at the mention of ‘gundagardi’. Vidrum’s husband Rajiv recalled a recent incident from his own factory, where a disgruntled employee ended up calling the police helpline after he was ticked off at work and the police reached within minutes. “At that point we were annoyed with the worker but also impressed with the police for reacting so quickly. Jhansi has changed drastically,” he said.The family is united in its opposition to freebies by govt, but believes that if a welfare programme reaches genuine beneficiaries, it will be welcome. Similarly, there is a strong opposition to reservations . Vidrum’s and Rajiv’s 28-year-old daughter Vatsala, who is preparing for judicial exams, says that the young generation would vote for any party which ends reservations.“There is no good Opposition at present, unless the alliance changes its image. Unlike older generations who have seen several govts, we have nothing to compare the present govt with. This is all we have seen through our youth. The youth will support a govt which ends reservations and ensures jobs,” she said.While extremely happy with the current govt for having provided welfare schemes , increasing India’s prestige and implementing development, the three brothers are unhappy with corruption persisting at the lower levels of govt. Dilip and Rajiv relate how while the govt could be clean at the higher levels, officials at the lower levels are continuing to demand bribes. “Many processes have been moved online, but corruption at the lower levels continues to remain an issue,” says Rajiv.The eldest brother Kishore, who holds immense respect for former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, says that he was the equivalent of Lord Ram, the Maryada Purshottam who could do no wrong. He said: “On the other hand, Modi is like Krishna. He will do whatever is needed to ensure the best for the people. It is because of this end goal of his that he commands such massive support.”During a discussion on the Ram temple and its use in the current election narrative, Vatsala says that this should not be an election agenda. Hindus are happy with its construction, she says, but the election should focus on development, economy and national defence. “Such matters are best ignored,” she said. Affiliation to a political party too, she believes, is linked to where one is coming from. In discussions among classmates and friends, one’s political leanings or appreciation for a political party throw light on the state one belongs to. A person from Delhi, she says, is likely to be impacted by the Aam Aadmi Party while BJP is the preferred choice among most people who belong to UP and Bihar.Vidrum’s father, 87-year-old Dr Manohar Abhay, now lives with his daughter in Jhansi, along with his wife Premlata. Abhay retired as chairperson of the Family Planning Association of India in Mumbai and was deeply associated with the Jana Sangh. Speaking on the changing political situations in India since the 1940s, he said: “A person should have the freedom to speak, unlike how it was during the Emergency. There is a need to end all divisions. A person should not be tied down to an ideology or he or she will have no future. We finally have a new leadership which is working not for a person but for the entire country. Govt should work for development,” he said.","In 1972, Kishore Sharma came to Jhansi to set up a rolling mill plant. Soon after, his brothers Dilip and Rajiv followed from Prayagraj.

Rajnath Singh eyes ‘5 lakh paar’ victory margin as opposition toils to make a mark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-singh-eyes-5-lakh-paar-victory-margin-as-opposition-toils-to-make-a-mark/articleshow/110242154.cms,"Lucknow moves beyond caste lines



‘Opposition face not visible’



Rajnath’s popularity



Issues: Unemployment a major concern



The Bharatiya Janata Party has been maintaining an iron hold on Lucknow Lok Sabha constituency since 1991, when it was first won by party veteran and former prime minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who won five times on the trot and continued to hold the seat till 2009.Vajpayee’s Man Friday Lalji Tandon won the seat in 2009 and passed on the baton to another senior leader Rajnath Singh who, carrying forward Vajpayee’s legacy, emerged victorious in 2014 and 2019, and is looking forward to a hat-trick from the City of Nawabs which goes to polls on May 20.In 2014, Singh bagged 54.43% of the votes polled, which went up to 56.64% in 2019, when he won the seat by a margin of 3.5 lakh votes against SP candidate Poonam Sinha. Though SP had contested the 2019 election in alliance with BSP, Singh won more votes than both the SP-BSP combine and Congress, which totaled 4.62 lakh votes.This year, Singh is up against sitting Samajwadi Party MLA from Lucknow Central, Ravidas Mehrotra and Sarwar Malik of the BSP. Singh is only the fourth non-Brahmin to have been elected from Lucknow.Before him, three non-Brahmin MPs elected from Lucknow include BK Dhaon and Lalji Tandon, both Khatris, and Mandhata Singh. When Singh contested his first election from Lucknow in 2014, he faced Brahmin candidates from SP, BSP and Congress. Interestingly, none of the major parties has fielded a Brahmin candidate. Three main candidates belong to Thakur, Khatri and Muslim communities which shows that Lucknow is no longer voting on caste lines. Lucknow Lok Sabha constituency has over four lakh Muslims and an equal number of Brahmins, besides over two lakh Kayasthas. SP’s Ravidas Mehrotra is a socialist who became a legislator from the city for the first time in 1989. He has been to jail over 250 times in his career, mostly for ‘breach of peace’.BSP’s Sarwar Malik started his career with students politics in 2012 and contested the Lok Sabha election from Lucknow on TMC’s ticket in 2014. He joined BSP in 2015 and was fielded by the party from Lucknow North assembly seat in the 2022 state elections.Even as both the opposition candidates are toiling hard to make their mark in the face of BJP’s poll blitz, Rajnath is depending on the development plank to set the victory margin target of ‘5 lakh paar’ (victory margin of over 5 lakh votes).While Rajnath Singh enjoys widespread popularity in the city, non-BJP supporters want to vote for INDIA bloc but many of them are not aware of the candidates that the opposition parties have fielded. A shopkeeper in Indiranagar, who did not wish to be identified, said: “I don’t know who the opposition has fielded. We have not seen any opposition candidate campaigning on this side of the city. However, I believe the INDIA bloc has shown significant improvement in garnering public support,” he said.In Indiranagar’s Bhootnath Market, Aslam, who runs a flower shop, says that people in Lucknow are not voting on caste or religious lines. “Singh’s image and the prestige of having a defence minister represent the constituency, is enough reason for many in the minority community to vote for him. Had it not been for Singh, maybe I would not have voted for BJP,” he said.Vishal Singh, an entrepreneur, says, “He is a very dignified politician. I have never heard him speak ill about other politicians, a trait that is seldom seen. He gave Lucknow facilities like Shaheed Path and Outer Ring Road. He also ensured safety and security to residents in his last two terms.”BJP continues to remain a popular choice for businessmen. Talking of the development brought in by BJP, they say that PM Narendra Modi remains the face of the party. “We don’t care whom the BJP fields as long as Modi is the PM. For me, Lord Ram and the nation are major election issues. Infrastructure development is taking place at a massive speed. The PM has a vision where he is not talking about 2029 but about 2047. People’s needs are being met, they are getting access to health and education,” said Sanchit Garg, an industrialist in the solar energy sector.At the famous Sharma Tea Stall in the heart of the city, people continue to brave the scorching heat for a cup of tea and some political ‘gupshup’. Vipul Singh, a 26-year-old electrical engineer, voices the plight of many of his friends as he relates how several of them have had to change their fields as they could not find jobs. “I am working in sales. Over the past few years, I have filled forms for several jobs but there have been very few vacancies. There are hardly any permanent jobs and those available are on third-party payroll. Despite this, political parties are talking of caste and religion and are not discussing real issues,” he said.","Lucknow Lok Sabha constituency has over four lakh Muslims and an equal number of Brahmins, besides over two lakh Kayasthas. None of the major parties has fielded a Brahmin candidate. Rajnath Singh is only the fourth non-Brahmin to have been elected from Lucknow.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110242153,imgsize-1396583,width-400,resizemode-4/110242153.jpg"
"Andhra: Vizag Police bust cybercrime racket, arrest three for trafficking youth to Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/andhra-vizag-police-bust-cybercrime-racket-arrest-three-for-trafficking-youth-to-cambodia-myanmar-and-thailand/articleshow/110241694.cms,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The Visakhapatnam police claimed to have busted a cybercrime racket and arrested three consultancy agents for allegedly luring unemployed youths and sending them to Chinese-operated cybercrime rings in countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand, officials said on Saturday.Despite growing awareness of cybercrime, incidents continue to rise, with many still falling prey to sophisticated scams.To combat this, Visakhapatnam police launched an operation to root out these criminal activities, according to an official release.Their efforts led to the arrest of consultancy agents from the Gajuwaka area, including the main suspect, Chukka Rajesh (33). The illegal racket came to light after Botcha Sankar, an ex-Navy employee, filed a complaint through the 1930 cybercrimes helpline. Sankar's complaint was based on the account of a victim who had managed to escape.Following the complaint, Visakhapatnam police arrested Chukka Rajesh, the ringleader, and his associates, Sabbavarapu Kondala Rao and Mannena Gnaneshwar Rao, both from the Gajuwaka area. The police investigation revealed a complex network of agents, including Santosh, Arya, Umamahesh, and Habib, who facilitated the trafficking .Visakhapatnam Commissioner of Police, Ravi Shankar Ayyanar, told that they suspected there could be over 5,000 victims from Andhra Pradesh, especially from Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, Anakapalli, Palasa, Rajamundry, Tuni, Amalapuram, and Anantapur, apart from Kolkata. He said that they are sharing the investigation details with the Indian Embassy in Cambodia and appealed to the parents of victims to approach them and the Indian Embassy in Cambodia.Cases were registered against the three local agents for human trafficking , extortion, wrongful confinement, and criminal conspiracy.CP Ravi Shankar further said that the Indian agents in Cambodia called the local agents to arrange people for cybercrimes in the name of data entry jobs. The local agents collected Rs 1.50 lakh from each job aspirant, out of which they sent Rs 80,000 to the Cambodian agents for passports, visas, and other arrangements, and kept the rest as their commission, he pointed out.Upon reaching Cambodia, these youths were locked up as slaves and forced to operate in the cybercrime network. They were denied food and pay until they complied. The agents gave them training before deploying them to commit various online frauds, through which they robbed innocent people of their hard-earned money.""Courier scams, cryptocurrency scams, task games, and OTP frauds are some of the offenses committed by them,"" he said.""Those who work properly will be given a salary of 600 dollars, besides incentives, and promotions. As per the investigation, the victims are forced to work for at least one year,"" he added.During the investigation, the police verified the facts through a video call with the victims, CP Ravi Shankar said, adding that the victims had shared their hardships. Once they agreed, the men and women were sent to countries like Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand, where they ended up working for Chinese companies . These companies trained them for 7-10 days and forced them into engaging in cybercrime at an average salary of 600 dollars per month. Any resistance invited severe punishment, including torture and deprivation of food and water.Officials said that approximately 5,000 people from Andhra Pradesh had fallen victim to this scam over the past two years. The victims went to Cambodia on tourist visas, which were converted into business visas once they joined Chinese companies, they added.","Visakhapatnam police claim to have busted a cybercrime racket.

"Don't do pressers as media not neutral, says PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-do-pressers-as-media-not-neutral-says-pm-modi/articleshow/110187422.cms,"Brought new work culture, media’s call to endorse it or not: PM Modi

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Thursday justified his decision not to hold press conferences by saying that the nature of media had changed and it was not the neutral entity that it used to be, with journalists promoting their views and ideologies.""I am answerable to Parliament.Today, journalists are identified with their own preferences. Media is no longer a non-partisan entity.People are now aware of your beliefs as well. Earlier, media used to be faceless... who is writing in the media, what is its ideology... nobody was bothered about it earlier. However, the situation is not the same any more,"" Modi said in an interview to Aaj Tak Hindi.The PM said a new culture had developed in politics which was centered on managing the media and not being concerned about performance. “However, I don’t believe in treading that path. I have to work hard and reach out to each household of the poor. I can also get clicked cutting ribbons in Vigyan Bhavan. However, I go to a small district in Jharkhand for a minor project. I have brought a new work culture and it is for the media to take a call whether they endorse it or not,” he said.Asked about allegations that Election Commission ’s independence had been compromised on his watch, Modi shot back by recalling instances of CECs taking to politics and holding ministerial positions after their retirement under Congress regimes and by pointing out that EC was a single-member entity for 56 years.“The funny thing is that people who came out of Election Commission sometimes became governors. Sometimes they became MPs. Sometimes they went to contest parliamentary elections against Advani ji, they are examples of people who served as chief election commissioner under previous governments. Election commissioners from that era, now retired, still tweet promoting the same political philosophy. They give their opinion and write articles. This only shows that it is only now that EC has become completely independent,” the PM said, a reference to former CEC T N Seshan contesting polls against L K Advani and M S Gill being nominated to Rajya Sabha and later becoming a Union minister under UPA regimes.In response to the opposition’s allegations that 400+ seats were meant to change the Constitution, Modi said, “Who was the first person to tamper with the Constitution in this country? It was Pandit Nehru. The amendments he brought were meant to restrict freedom of speech, which was against democracy and against the Constitution.”“After that, his daughter (Indira Gandhi) overturned a court judgment and imposed an Emergency. Rajiv Gandhi overturned Supreme Court judgment in the Shah Bano case and imposed restrictions on the media. The crown prince of Congress (Rahul Gandhi) once tore down the decision of the Union cabinet,” he said.The PM further said four different members of the same family have insulted the Constitution at different times.","PM Modi: Media is no longer a non-partisan entity.

He speaks about democracy repeatedly but doesn't adhere to the tenets of democracy,"" Kharge said in a joint press conference with other INDIA bloc leaders in Mumbai.On PM Modi 's recent statement that the Congress will bulldoze the Ram mandir in Ayodhya and also restore Article 370 if the INDIA bloc is voted to power, Kharge said, ""We have never used a bulldozer on anyone. Bulldozer is their government. This comment is to instigate and the Election Commission should take action against him. Our government will function as per the Constitution.

Attacking the BJP and PM Modi for calling his party ""nakli"" (fake) Shiv Sena, Thackeray said the BJP will also call RSS 'nakli Sangh'.

of appeasement politics

NEW DELHI: Calling the Congress-AAP alliance ""opportunistic"", PM Modi on Saturday said the world was watching one corrupt party covering for another.Addressing his first rally in the capital for the Lok Sabha polls, Modi said Congress had taken credit for exposing AAP govt's involvement in the alleged liquor scam but was now forced to join hands.He also accused INDIA bloc of going to any extent to pursue ""vote bank politics"" and claimed the then Congress govt handed over 123 prime properties to Delhi Waqf Board during 2014 LS polls.Local Congress functionaries are stuck in a bind because their facade of camaraderie in Delhi and Haryana and rivalry in Punjab won't hold up for long. The public can clearly see how one corrupt individual is shielding another,"" Modi said at a rally in northeast Delhi.Taking a swipe at CM Arvind Kejriwal and AAP, he said those who had entered politics promising to end corruption were now involved in scams worth thousands of crores of rupees and were making rounds of the jail. He also took a dig at Congress-AAP seat-sharing arrangement, saying there was a time when Congress held the reins across the country but now could not put up a candidate in the constituency where its ""shahi pariwar"" (royal family) lived, referring to the Gandhi family which has houses in the New Delhi parliamentary constituency.Under the alliance in Delhi, AAP has fielded its candidates in four seats, including New Delhi, while Congress is contesting three.Though he did not make any direct reference to Kejriwal's insinuation that he would retire next year after turning 75 and make Amit Shah the PM, Modi asserted that he has no heir. ""Agar koi vaaris hai, aap hi mere vaaris hain (you are my only heirs),"" he told the crowd, adding that 140 crore Indians were his heirs and he had dedicated himself to securing their future. ""Mera pal-pal aapke liye, mere pal-pal desh ke liye (every second of my life is for you, for the country). Your dreams are my resolution,"" he added. Around 25 foreign diplomats from 13 countries, including UK, Australia and Indonesia, were present at the rally as observers.Accusing the opposition alliance of pursuing ""appeasement"" politics, Modi alleged in exchange for electoral support, Congress-led UPA govt transferred 123 significant heritage properties to Waqf Board. He claimed that these properties were situated in prime locations in Delhi and were worth lakhs of rupees per square yard.He also blamed the opposition for the 2020 Delhi riots following the enactment of Citizenship (Amendment) Act and said there was significant resistance to the move to provide Indian citizenship to refugees, mostly Dalits, who were persecuted in neighbouring countries and were recently granted citizenship under the law.""This opportunistic alliance can also spread violence in the country for appeasement. Remember, when the CAA law was brought, they held Delhi hostage for months. First, they blocked the roads, then caused riots. But today their lies have been exposed. Refugees living in Delhi for years are getting citizenship,"" Modi said. During the rally, several women belonging to Hindu families from Pakistan who recently got Indian citizenship under CAA felicitated the PM.He reiterated his charge that the INDIA bloc was going against the Constitution by openly advocating quota on the basis of religion, dividing the quota meant for Dalits, tribals, and backward classes. He accused the alliance of wanting to overturn the Supreme Court's decision on Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, bring back Article 370, and disarm India's nuclear weapons.""Should such a dangerous alliance be given even a single vote?"" he asked the audience. He did not mention the ongoing controversy over former DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal's allegations of assault against Kejriwal's close aide.His 33-minute speech included barbs on the opposition and showcasing of BJP's plank of 'Viksit Bharat'.Modi said the 2024 Lok Sabha elections were aimed at placing India among the top three economies globally and safeguarding the economy from ""forces that wanted to destabilise it with their economic policies"". He listed the construction of Bharat Mandapam and Yashobhoomi, the new Parliament building, National War Memorial, a museum for Prime Ministers, and Kartavya Path as some of his govt's achievements, saying it brought a sense of pride to everyone.""Modi's 10-year tenure has been a transformative period for Delhi's infrastructure. My focus has been on ease of living and ease of travel,"" he said. He added that the length of national highways in Delhi in the last 10 years had increased from 80 km to 160 km, the Delhi Metro network had doubled in size, and the Namo Bharat train had become a new identity for Delhi-NCR.Modi also said that the central govt had provided electric buses to major cities, including Delhi, to address environmental issues. The prime minister talked about the regularisation of unauthorised colonies and providing pucca houses to slum dwellers under the 'jahan jhuggi wahan makan' scheme. He added that under the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, people's electricity bills would come down to zero.""This election is aimed at protecting the poor and middle class from forces that seek to deprive them of their assets... The 2024 election is aimed at building a mazboot Bharat (strong India) and defeating the forces that seek to weaken it,"" Modi said.","PM Modi accuses Congress-AAP alliance of pursuing ""appeasement"" politics.

Hospitals' failure to declare brain deaths hitting organ donations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hospitals-failure-to-declare-brain-deaths-hitting-organ-donations/articleshow/110238776.cms,"MUMBAI: Failure to identify and certify brain deaths by hospitals is reducing the country's organ donation rates drastically despite a significant number of potential donors available, Union health ministry recently stated in a directive, asking states to insist on hospitals documenting brain stem deaths meticulously. The ministry said India's cadaver organ donation rate continues to be abysmally low - less than 1 donor per million population a year.In a recent letter, it reminded states that as per provisions of the Transplantation of Human Organs Tissues Act , hospitals must identify each potential brain stem death case admitted in the ICU.It said it is mandatory for hospitals to ask if such potential donors had pledged for organ donation, and if not, to make family members aware of the opportunity to donate organs before the heart stops. The doctor-on-duty, with the transplant coordinator's help, is required to inquire after certification of brain stem death.It is estimated that India sees nearly 1.5 lakh potential brain stem deaths a year due to accidents. Other causes, like strokes, could add to the numbers. However, the total number of deceased donors in India was just 1,028 in 2023, which facilitated over 3,000 transplants. This falls drastically short of the annual need for about 5 lakh organs. With barely 2-3% of the demand met, countless lives are lost to organ failure. In Mumbai alone, over 4,000 people are awaiting cadaver organs.""We need all transplant centres and non-transplant organ retrieval centres to start declaring brain deaths. This is the crucial first step to facilitate organ donation, yet it's not happening in most hospitals,"" said Dr Anil Kumar, director of National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organisation (Notto). He said even registered transplant centres are failing to declare brain deaths.An official from the Maharashtra public health department said most institutions lack a panel to certify brain stem death which hampers identifying such cases. In Mumbai and most other urban districts, majority of brain death certifications are happening in the private sector.Issuing protocols, health ministry has, through Notto, urged hospitals to install 'Required Request Display Boards' at strategic locations conveying the message to the public that in the unfortunate event of brain death or cardiac arrest, donation of organs and tissues - like kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, eyes, skin and bones etc. - could save lives.Notto also issued a proforma to collect information from hospitals on a monthly basis. It said the head of the institutions and respective State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation could analyse and take corrective action.","India's cadaver organ donation rate continues to be abysmally low - less than 1 donor per million population a year.

This amount is more than two-and-a-half times the total seizures made during the entire 2019 general election period.With three more rounds of polling scheduled over the next two weeks, the total amount of seizures during this general elections is expected to rise.According to Election Commission data released on Saturday, out of the total Rs 8,889 crore worth of seizures, drugs and narcotics accounted for approximately 45%, followed by 'freebies' at 23% and precious metals at 14%. The agencies have also seized Rs 849 crore in cash and around 5.4 crore litres of liquor worth Rs 815 crore.Among all states and UTs, seizure in Gujarat in value terms was maximum at around Rs 1,462 crore, mainly on account of a recent joint operation by Gujarat ATS, Narcotics Control Bureau and Indian Coast Guard that led to three high-value seizures of drugs worth Rs 892 crore. Rajasthan ranks second in the list where maximum 'freebies' worth around Rs 757 crore were seized by enforcement agencies.The poll panel said these elections have witnessed a series of targeted actions against the menace of drugs. Apart from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Delhi have also reported seizures of drugs. On April 17, police busted a drug factory in Greater Noida from where 26.7kg of MDMA valued at Rs 150 crore was seized and two foreigners were arrested.""The seizures in other cohorts have equally been impressive and surpasses the entire seizures of 2019 parliamentary elections by a big margin... Enhanced vigil against inducements, including drugs and psychotropic substances, has resulted in big seizure actions and continuous surge. Drug seizures have been maximum,"" said the poll body.According to the EC, analysis of data shows that states and UTs that used to be 'transit zones' are increasingly becoming 'consumption territories'.In terms of illegal movement of liquor, Karnataka tops the list with around 1.5 crore litres of liquor being seized, followed by Maharashtra (at approximately 62 lakh litres). In seizure of cash, Telangana leads among states and UT with Rs 114 crore, followed by Karnataka (Rs 92 crore).","In two months since announcement of Lok Sabha poll dates, enforcement agencies have seized nearly Rs 9,000 crore.

Naresh Mhaske

speaks to

TOI

about his challenges and plans to bag the seat

Q. Mira Bhayender and Navi Mumbai cities are new to you?

Q. Your name announcement as the Mahayuti candidate saw prompt opposition from ally party workers. How do you see this?

Q. The opposition parties have said that you were absent during the crucial Covid phase.

Q. The opposition is harping on the gaddari (betrayal) tag.

Q. What are your observations of the problems faced by people of your constituency?

Q. So many projects are delayed here.

Q. Has the Raj Thackeray rally where he raised the migrant issue proved counter-productive?

Q. What are your winning expectations?

A. The mood in the constituency is Modi-may (dominated by Narendra Modi).Even though I have worked in Thane, I was always aware of happenings in these cities where I worked as an office bearer of the Shiv Sena. People trust the Sena. Our workers are working 24x7 and we are banking on their efforts. As I said, I may be known to Thane residents but I have been associated with Navi Mumbai and mira Bhayender since my Vidyarthi Sena (youth wing activist) days. Several of the current leaders from ally parties have known me since those days and we share a good rapport. It didn’t take time to reach out to them.A. It is but natural that workers would want the seat for their leader who has also worked hard. But we must remember that when a coalition is formed, certain decisions have to be taken. It may have affected for a day but now everything is resolved. I have seen the same people who apparently were upset earlier now supporting me wholeheartedly and even ensuring my well-being during rallies.A. I was accessible during the pandemic and working 24x7 on the field. Instead, there were people asking about the absence of opposition leaders. We reached out to many supplying essentials and even vaccines. I was called the vaccine man. Those opposing me have forgotten that I ensured their own staff got the vaccine due to my efforts. Thanekars know all and will respond.A. Who betrayed the voters first? We fought the elections with the BJP and against the Congress but they later joined hands with them (Congress) just for power. This is gaddari (betrayal). We formed a govt with the party who the people voted for.A. One of the common problems is inadequate train services in addition to the proliferation of slums among others...A. We are working on pushing the Thane railway station project along with the metro routes here. Some projects were delayed due to ‘percentage’ and we will soon expose them.A. No. He spoke only about the proliferation of Bangladeshi migrants here. The opposition has no issues left to discuss.A. Aligning with our motto of Ab ki baar 400 paar, I am confident of winning the Thane seat with a thumping majority and breaking previous winning margins. It was our efforts last time that elected a Sena MP in Thane and this time our team is working for me- their own candidate.",Naresh Mhaske is the Shiv Sena's candidate for the Thane seat of Mahayuti.
