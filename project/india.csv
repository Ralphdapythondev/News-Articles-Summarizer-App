Why Agnipath may not fire for BJP in Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-agnipath-may-not-fire-for-bjp-in-haryana/articleshow/113777585.cms,"Locals say Hisar’s Mahabir Stadium once used to teem with those training for armed forces recruitment. Aspirants now accuse the govt of turning its back on them with the Agniveer scheme

As Tide Of Armed Forces Aspirants Turns Into A Trickle In Jat-Dominated Districts And Elsewhere, Youths Make Their Displeasure Loud And Clear Ahead Of

Assembly Polls

Pressing issue

Tough choices

HISAR: Occupying the town’s sweet centre, Mahabir Stadium is 52 years of age. But these days the sprawling sports arena looks unmistakably geriatric and utterly unkempt. It’s been an abundant monsoon.And the punishing rains have left their mark. The running tracks are a mess, the tall weeds could delight a goshala of cows and the battered stands might employ masons and house painters for weeks.Over the decades, this multipurpose sports complex in central Haryana has not only played host to national competitions but also been a theatre of dreams for those readying themselves for the armed forces and the paramilitary. Thousands of young men — also a few women — have come here from nearby districts and states, indeed from everywhere, to toil and train.For months now though, the number of aspirants has kept plummeting, says Sonu Lamba. Describing himself as “a defence coach”, Lamba says he trains would-be soldiers for a fee. He shows an old video on his mobile phone of hundreds of army and paramilitary aspirants.“Log junoon ke saath taiyyari karte thhey (Aspirants used to prepare with passion). That is gone. Once I had 1,700 trainees. They came from Rajasthan, Punjab, even Uttarakhand. Now there are only 44,” he says.Jyoti Saini, 21, talks about the large gathering of enthusiasts when she first started practising here in 2021. The crowd has since dwindled. “I used to run with a group of 10-15 girls. Now, that is down to just about a handful,” she says.Talking to other hopefuls in Hisar and other districts, it is undeniable that the armed forces’ Agnipath scheme, which the Union govt launched in 2022, has dealt a harsh blow to their job dreams. And for the disgruntled — it includes both the aspirants and their families — the scheme is a major election issue. More so in a state where the unemployment rate among 15-29 years-old is marginally higher than India’s national average, per 2023-24 govt data.Jobs in the armed forces are much sought-after in Haryana. A fauji gets economic benefits and, equally importantly, social prestige. Village gateways are erected to pay homage to soldiers martyred in the service of the nation. With Agnipath, jobs and emotions have combined to create a volatile cocktail ahead of the Oct 5 assembly polls.Among different caste groups, Jats are the most vocal against the scheme in which an Agniveer gets to serve in the army for four years. Only 25% of a batch will get a full tenure. The Jats are numerically substantial and electorally crucial in districts like Hisar, Sonipat, Jhajjar, Rohtak and Jind.“What’s the point in training for years for a four-year job. When it is over, you are neither in sports nor in the army. Does it make sense?” asks Amandeep Pangal, who trains at the Hisar stadium.Another Jat, Ajit Sehrawat of Khandrai village in Sonipat district, has a similar question. “If an Agniveer spends four years in the army and then is made to quit, how will he serve his family in the future? He will no longer be eligible for other jobs.” The age limit for an Agniveer applicant is between 17.5 and 21 years.In July, CM Nayab Singh Saini’s govt announced a series of concessions for Agniveers who have to leave after serving for four years. It included a 10% horizontal reservation in recruitment for posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden, and SPO (special police officer). That guarantees them a fixed proportion of positions in those categories. Those establishing their own business, the announcement said, can receive an interest free loan of up to Rs 5 lakh.But boxing coach Pradeep Sawant insists that changing one’s line of work is far more complicated than is being made out. “Despite what the govt is saying, it won’t be easy for an Agniveer to get a new job.”It isn’t just the Jats. Ashish Valmiki, a Dalit who works as a sweeper in a govt office in Gohana in Sonipat district, doesn’t like the scheme either. “For every selected candidate, a hundred are rejected. All Agniveers will be capable. Why retain only 25%?” he asks.Ajay, who uses only his first name, travels back and forth every day for training from nearby Fatehabad district. “Jo choubees ghante ghar se door rahega uski pension khatam kar rahe ho. Jo aath ghante ke liye office jaata hai, usko pension de rahe ho (those who stay away from home totally will not be eligible for pension. And those who work for eight hours in office will get it).”The merit of such questions is open to debate. And it is possible to argue that they are missing the big picture. But one thing is clear: by their own admission, none of the Agniveer aspirants that TOI spoke to are likely to provide endorsement for the scheme in the upcoming vote.","Jobs in the armed forces are much sought-after in Haryana.

Government unveils draft rules to take terminally ill off life support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-unveils-draft-rules-to-take-terminally-ill-off-life-support/articleshow/113777504.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Life support can be withdrawn from a terminally ill patient if both the primary and secondary medical boards constituted by a hospital, as well as the family or surrogate of the patient, give their consent, the health ministry has suggested.In draft guidelines released for public comment, the ministry states that many patients in ICUs are terminally ill and are not expected to benefit from life-sustaining treatments (LST), which include (but are not limited to) mechanical ventilation, surgical procedures, parenteral nutrition, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).""In such circumstances, LST are non-beneficial and increase avoidable burdens and suffering to patients and therefore, are considered excessive and inappropriate. Additionally, they increase emotional stress and economic hardship to the family and moral distress to professional caregivers. Withdrawal of LST in such patients is regarded as a standard of ICU care worldwide and upheld by several jurisdictions,"" the ministry says.Terminal illness refers to an irreversible or incurable condition from which death is inevitable in the foreseeable future. Severe devastating traumatic brain injury which shows no recovery after 72 hours or more is also included.According to the health ministry's draft guidelines, life support can be withdrawn if a patient is brain dead or prognosis suggests she or he is not likely to benefit from aggressive therapeutic interventions or in case the patient/surrogate has documented informed refusal, following prognostic awareness, to continue life support.A surrogate is a person or persons other than the healthcare providers who is/are accepted as the representatives of the patient's best interests, who will make decisions on behalf of the patient when the patient loses decision-making capacity. If the patient has made a validadvanced medical directive (AMD), the surrogate would be the person or persons named in the directive. If there is no valid AMD, the surrogate will be the next of kin (family) or the next friend or guardian (if any) of the patient.According to govt guideline, the primary medical board (PMB) which has to assess inappropriateness of life support should consist of the primary physician and at least two subject experts with at least five years of experience. After that, the decision is to be verified further by the secondary medical board (SMB) which should consist of one registered medical practitioner (RMP) nominated by the CMO and at least two subject experts. A member of the PMB cannot form part of the SMB. Additionally, govt guidelines suggest, the hospital may constitute a clinical ethics committee of multi-professional members for audit, oversight and conflict resolution.Dr R K Mani, one of the doctors involved in drafting the guidelines, told TOI that the last date for submission of comments is Oct 20. ""Any issues raised will be addressed by the expert group on behalf of the health ministry,"" he said.Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care department at Holy Family hospital , said, ""The Supreme Court, in its wisdom, has placed the safety of the individual as the highest priority, but that unfortunately has made the process very complex and complicated and difficult to implement. But, it is surely a step forward and hopefully it will be reviewed in the near future after some experience with this process, to make it smoother and less complex, while continuing to maintain the autonomy and safety of the patient and the wishes of the family in mind,"" he said.","Life support can be withdrawn from a terminally ill patient if both the primary and secondary medical boards constituted by a hospital, as well as the family or surrogate of the patient, give their consent.

The Iran-backed Hezbollah on Saturday confirmed the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in Israeli airstrikes on Friday. Recently, Israel eliminated several functionaries of the militant group and now it faces concern of who will succeed Nasrallah.According to several reports, Hashem Safieddine is considered a potential heir to Nasrallah. News agency Reuters citing a source within Hezbollah said that Safieddine survived the Israeli strikes.Hashem Safieddine is a cousin of the late leader Nasrallah and as the head of the executive council oversees Hezbollah’s political affairs.He is also a cleric who wears the black turban that signifies descent from Islam's Prophet Mohammed. He also serves on the group's Jihad Council .Safieddine's family ties and religious status as a descendant of Mohammed would all work in his favor as a potential successor, reported news agency Reuters.In 2017, the US State Department designated him as a terrorist, and in June, he threatened major escalation against Israel following the death of another Hezbollah commander. At the funeral, he warned, ""Let (the enemy) prepare himself to cry and wail.""Safieddine's public statements often reflect Hezbollah's militant stance and its alignment with the Palestinian cause. At a recent event in Dahiyeh, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut's southern suburbs, he declared, ""Our history, our guns and our rockets are with you,"" in a show of solidarity with Palestinian fighters.According to Philip Smyth, an expert on Iran-backed Shi-ite militias, said Nasrallah ""started tailoring positions for him within a variety of different councils within Lebanese Hezbollah. Some of them were more opaque than others. They've had him come, go out and speak,""He has also been outspoken in his criticism of US policy. In 2017, responding to American pressure on Hezbollah, he said, ""This mentally impeded, crazy US administration headed by Trump will not be able to harm the resistance,"" maintaining that such actions would only bolster Hezbollah's determination.Hassan Nasrallah joined the list of some of the important leaders and commanders Israel recently assassinated amid the conflicts that started on October 07, 2023, following a brutal attack by Hamas on Israel killing over a thousand people.

How KMF functions today

NEW DELHI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam ( TTD ) has appointed ‘ Nandini ’ as the new ghee supplier, with the supply order already issued to the company. The Andhra Pradesh government took this action amid controversy over the alleged adulteration of laddus at the Tirupati temple, following claims of the use of animal fat and other substances.‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.It is Karnataka’s biggest milk brand and is also recognised in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Goa. The ‘Nandini’ brand is owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited ( KMF ), the second-largest dairy cooperative in India, after Gujarat’s Amul.The current managing director and CEO of KMF is Karnataka administrative service officer MK Jagdish.KMF’s history dates back to 1955, when the first dairy cooperative was established in the Kodagu district of Karnataka. At that time, there was no system of packaged milk, and farmers delivered milk directly to households. There was also a shortage of milk. It wasn't until the 1970s, during India’s ‘White Revolution,’ that efforts to increase milk production took hold, supported by World Bank projects.In 1974, the Karnataka government created the Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDCC) to implement these dairy projects. By 1984, KDCC was renamed the Karnataka Milk Federation, and it began selling packaged milk and other products under the brand name ‘Nandini.’ Over time, ‘Nandini’ grew into Karnataka’s most popular dairy brand and expanded to neighbouring states.KMF operates 15 dairy unions throughout Karnataka, including the Bengaluru, Kolar, and Mysore Cooperative Milk Unions. These unions buy milk from village-level Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) and deliver it to KMF for processing. According to the Karnataka Milk Federation’s website, KMF purchases over 86 lakh kilos of milk daily from 26 lakh farmers in 24,000 villages.One of KMF’s standout features is its daily payment system for milk suppliers, who are mainly small farmers and producers. The federation distributes more than Rs 28 crore in daily payments. KMF has 15 units that process and package milk, which is then sold through various channels.","‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.

Water shortage in Bengaluru: Tanker bill per house goes up to Rs 25k here,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/water-shortage-in-bengaluru-tanker-bill-per-house-goes-up-to-rs-25k-here/articleshow/113683003.cms,"The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand.

BENGALURU: Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now, forcing them to rely on very few private water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand, and each household is spending anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 every month on water.BWSSB officials attribute the delay in addressing the issue to the pending activation of Cauvery Stage 5.Rishabh Aditya, a software engineer and new father, shared the difficulties faced by his family due to irregular water supply. ""I have an infant at home, and water has become a top priority for us. We need it for cooking, cleaning, and giving warm baths to the baby. Unfortunately, we receive no support from BWSSB, and we are forced to rely on tankers,"" he said.Aditya described the frustration of having to stay awake until late at night to ensure water delivery. ""Tankers supply water based on who books first. With more than 100 people in the layout, we often have to wait until 1am, which is exhausting,"" he said.The cost of water from tankers varies, with residents paying anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000 for a 5,000-litre load. For larger families, the expenses quickly add up. Naveenchandra Keshavmurthy, another resident, shared that his household spends Rs 20,000 to Rs 35,000 each month on water. ""We are in absolute misery because of the lack of BWSSB water supply. Despite our complaints, nothing has been done,"" he maintained.Senior citizens living in the area are also feeling the pinch, especially those who rely on pension and savings. Jaishankar V, an elderly resident, expressed concern over the financial strain caused by the ongoing crisis. ""It is painful for us, especially those who are retired. Depending on tankers every day is draining our savings, and monthly costs are overwhelming just for basic water supply,"" he lamented.Venkateshwar, a local tanker owner, said the challenges faced by operators in sourcing and supplying water to the area. ""There is a huge demand for water here, and it is difficult for us to source enough to meet everyone's needs. We charge reasonable rates, but residents still complain.""The residents approached BWSSB officials multiple times, but have only received assurances. According to BWSSB chairman Ram Prasath Manohar, the delay is due to the pending release of Cauvery Stage 5 water. ""These layouts, including Kamadhenu, were developed in 110 villages, and water supply was not originally allocated for them. However, in a few weeks, they will receive water from BWSSB. We are working to address the tanker mafia problem in the area,"" he said.","Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now. The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand. Each household is spending anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 every month on water.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113683228,imgsize-304667,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/113683228.jpg"

Rahul said, “Whenever he would speak to me about the BJP and RSS, he would not say that they were doing this and that, he would say that look, this is a danger to the country.What they are doing to our institutions, what they are doing to our structure, what they are doing to our education system is going to destroy India.""Rahul Gandhi paid a heartfelt tribute to Yechury, whom he described as a man of great integrity and conviction. ""He was a person you could trust, someone you were 100% sure wasn’t compromised in today’s political environment. Whatever he did, he always did it in the interest of the country. Maybe my brothers on the Left might not like it, but every time his starting point was India, and after that came his political ideology and convictions,” said Gandhi.Gandhi further reminisced about his long association with Yechury, noting how despite their ideological differences, Yechury had a unique ability to understand opposing viewpoints. ""I observed him carefully, and what I found was a person who was flexible, who listened, and despite being on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum, he had the ability to understand where we were coming from. He also allowed us to understand where he was coming from,"" Gandhi noted, calling Yechury a “bridge” between the Congress party and other parties in theINDIA alliance .The Congress leader emphasised Yechury's behind-the-scenes role in keeping political alliances intact. ""There are people who are visible and upfront, and then there is the glue that holds the structure together. Sitaram Yechury was that glue,"" he said, referring to Yechury’s role in the INDIA and UPA coalitions.On a personal note, Rahul Gandhi shared memories of Yechury's habit of smoking cigarettes, something Yechury was never able to quit. ""I always noticed how stress was countered with a cigarette, and I used to tell him, ‘Yechury Ji, why don’t you get rid of this?’ That, I think, was the only habit he couldn’t let go of,"" Gandhi said with a smile.In an emotional moment, Gandhi recounted Yechury's reluctance to go to the hospital during their last meeting. ""That was the last time I saw my friend,"" he said, recalling how he had insisted Yechury go to the hospital after observing him cough.Rahul Gandhi also reflected on the profound loss Yechury endured when his son passed away. He admitted that during their conversation, he was left speechless, unsure of what to say. ""I called him, but I didn’t know what to say. When I met him a few days later, the same tough, brave Yechury Ji was back,"" Gandhi said.","Rahul Gandhi paid a heartfelt tribute to Yechury, whom he described as a man of great integrity and conviction.

Bhavika Mangalanandan, first secretary at India’s permanent mission to the UN, accused Pakistan of using cross-border terrorism as a key strategy against India, citing numerous incidents, including the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001 and the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.""The list is long,"" Mangalanandan said in retort to Islamabad's unfounded assertions.She further said that there can be ""no compact with terrorism"" and that Pakistan's cross-border terrorism against India will ""inevitably invite consequences"".""We are talking about a nation that for long hosted Osama bin Laden. A country whose fingerprints are on so many terrorist incidents across the world, whose policies attract the dregs of many societies to make it their home,"" Mangalanandan said during India’s right of reply.India’s sharp rebuttal followed Sharif’s remarks, calling India to reverse its ""unilateral and illegal"" actions in Jammu and Kashmir , referring to the 2019 revocation of Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu & Kashmir.""India spurned Pakistan's proposals for a mutual strategic restraint to regime. Its leadership has often threatened to cross the line of control and take over Azad Kashmir,"" Shehbaz Sharif claimed.Mangalanandan in her response called Pakistan a ""country run by the military"" with a ""global reputation for terrorism, narcotics, and transnational crime.""She expressed disbelief that Pakistan, a nation known for these issues, would attack India, the world’s largest democracy, in such a forum.""It is even more extraordinary for a country with a history of rigged elections to talk about political choices in a democracy,"" Mangalanandan said.The Indian diplomat said that Jammu and Kashmir is an ""inalienable and integral part of India"" and that Pakistan had long sought to disrupt peace and elections in the region through violent means. She condemned Pakistan’s actions, stating, ""For such a country to speak about violence anywhere is hypocrisy at its worst.""Mangalanandan also responded to Pakistan’s proposal for a mutual strategic restraint regime, declaring that ""there can be no compact with terrorism."" She emphasised that Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism against India would inevitably have consequences.""It is ridiculous that a nation that committed genocide in 1971 and which persecutes its minorities relentlessly even now, dare speak about intolerances and phobias. The world can see for itself what Pakistan really is.

Zoon to zyeun: How Iltija's PDP slogan has been adopted by NC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/zoon-to-zyeun-how-iltijas-pdp-slogan-has-been-adopted-by-nc/articleshow/113776395.cms,"Imitation is the best form of flattery, says PDP candidate Iltija Mufti (PTI photo)

SRINAGAR: With political parties and workers unleashed after a long wait of 10 years, the Kashmir poll campaign struck a tone, harsh and partisan. But it also witnessed a tune so captivating that it acquired a universal appeal.The reverberating chants of ""zyeun ho zyeun ho, albain zyeun ho"" from a hall of packed supporters of National Conference candidate Hilal Akbar Lone and the social media post of party mascot Omar Abdullah with his inked finger and same caption, could be called a tribute to arch-rival and PDP functionary Iltija Mufti - who coined and popularised the slogan.'Albain' is the NC symbol 'plough'.The ""zoon ho zoon ho, PDP zoon ho"" that the Mufti heir apparent has personally led the crowds to chant started off as an irritant for rivals, moved to becoming an object of derision for critics, but ended up being adopted by the rivals in the last stretch. Clearly, it was too catchy and inspiring to have remained copyrighted.Iltija has claimed victory. ""Imitation is the best form of flattery,"" she told TOI, as she reacted to the deluge of NC chants of her coinage by dubbing the rivals as ""copycat monkeys"". When the assembly contest started a couple of months ago, Iltija was out front firing up the workers with a slogan that, riding on its pithiness and rhythm, acquired a life of its own.Aided by social media posts and WhatsApp forwards, it settled on the lips like nursery rhymes do with children.It was amusing to find random passersby humming it on the streets of Kashmir for no rhyme or reason.But delivered as a full-throated slogan, led by Iltija herself, it gave a disproportionate presence to a visibly shrinking PDP, widely viewed as fighting for its survival. ""PDP has been splintered into pieces and we are at our weakest. Yet, our campaign is way more energetic, so much so that others are copying us,"" she said.The crucial bit was that it stoked an unending parallel discussion on Kashmiri social media. After all, ""zoon"" is ""moon"", while ""Zyeun"" is ""win"".Iltija, who grew up in Delhi and abroad, was mocked for her ""feeble acquaintance"" with the native language.""They are mocking my Kashmiri,"" she chuckled, unaffected.Poet Ayaz Nazki feels the mispronunciation by Iltija made it a convenient tool for NC to show her up, a reason why it has been taken up by the rival. ""There is no other reason,"" he laughed.And the Mufti girl improvised. Soon, the ""zoo"" became ""zeu"", as she tried to get the phonetics in place.The chants only became louder and lustier at PDP rallies, where workers danced with energy and stomped the ground to welcome a party star or candidate.The crowd that witnessed the reception of party candidate Syed Aga Muntazir and functionary Waheed Parra in Sholipura, Budgam, last week were visibly enchanted.With PDP finding competition from NC even on the slogan it coined, the political fight has only got that bit more intense in the home stretch and people are waiting with bated breath for the results on an election long delayed and keenly fought. But Iltija has already delivered a ""zyeun"" that few can deny.","PDP functionary Iltija Mufti coined and popularised the slogan 'zyeun ho, albain zyeunho' She has claimed victory.

HOSUR: At least 10 people received medical treatment, with two hospitalised, after a major fire Saturday disrupted production at a key Tata Electronics plant in Tamil Nadu which makes Apple iPhone components. The incident in Hosur is the latest to affect Apple's iPhone supply chain just as the company is looking to diversify beyond China and sees India as a key growth market.It is also the latest in a string of incidents to affect Apple suppliers in India over the last few years.The fire broke out near another building inside the Tata complex which will, in coming months, turn out complete iPhones. The fire was contained to one building and has been extinguished, top district administrative official K M Sarayu said, adding no decision has been made on when manufacturing can restart.Sarayu said that 523 workers were on shift when the fire broke out early morning and that all workers had been evacuated and accounted for.Tata Electronics is one of the major contract makers of iPhones in India, along with Foxconn. The company said it was investigating the cause of the fire and would take necessary steps to safeguard employees and other stakeholders. ""Our emergency protocols at the plant ensured that all employees are safe,"" a Tata Electronics spokesperson said.J Saravanan, a senior district official charged with handling industrial safety, said the injuries were all related to smoke inhalation.Production was halted and employees sent home for the day following the fire, a person with direct knowledge of the incident said, describing the blaze as chemical-related.Apple made no immediate comment on the incident.The fire began in an area used to store chemicals, a fire official said. Last year, Apple supplier Foxlink halted production at its assembly facility in Andhra Pradesh after a massive fire led part of the building to collapse.","Tata Electronics is one of the major contract makers of iPhones in India, along with Foxconn.

During two short sessions held after the election, with permanent places still to be allocated to the members, the SP chief has seated Faizabad MP Awadhesh Prasad next to him.The choice has been politically significant as Faizabad comprises temple town Ayodhya, where SP vanquished BJP and delivered it a psychological blow. Its implication is amplified by the fact that Prasad is a veteran Dalit face who was fielded from a general seat, where he overcame BJP's known local face identified with Hindutva.With SP looking to increase its reach among the Dalit voters of UP, rendered uncommitted by the collapse of BSP, Prasad is viewed as the magnet to woo the vast populace.During the LS sessions, the large and vocal Samajwadi contingent and Congress mascot Rahul repeatedly held up Prasad to rile BJP, even as the veteran himself spared no opportunity to get under the skin of the ruling benches. A section of opposition is also pushing him for deputy speakership, with demand that Modi govt hold election to the prestigious, if ceremonial, post.INDIA bloc cobbled during 2024 parliamentary polls returned with a strength of 240 MPs, including TMC which too is expected to get front row seats besides the seven allocated to Congress, SP and DMK.Sources said that the seating arrangement is still being discussed, as the Speaker's office has sought names of MPs for individual seats across rows allocated to the opposition.","Samajwadi Party is set to have two front seats in Lok Sabha.

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar lashed out at Pakistan for its PM Shehbaz Sharif 's remarks against India at the UN , saying that a dysfunctional nation coveting the lands of others must be exposed and countered.Countering Sharif's ""bizarre assertions"" in which he had spoken about an alleged Hindu supremacist agenda and claimed that the people of Kashmir had struggled for freedom like Palestinians, Jaishankar said Pakistan's cross-border terrorism policy will never succeed and it can have no expectation of impunity.On the contrary, the minister said, actions will certainly have consequences.""The issue to be resolved between us is now only the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan. And of course the abandonment of Pakistan's long-standing attachment to terrorism,"" said the minister, underscoring that terrorism is antithetical of everything that the world stands for and all its forms and manifestations must be resolutely opposed.This latest run-in comes weeks before a possible and rare visit by Jaishankar to Pakistan for a meeting of the SCO heads of governments. Government sources have not so far ruled out high-level participation by India in the meeting, in keeping with its plurilateral obligations.While addressing the UNGA , Jaishankar also said sanctioning of global terrorists by the United Nations should also not be impeded for political reasons, adding that while many countries get left behind due to circumstances beyond their control, some make conscious choices with disastrous consequences.""A premier example is our neighbour, Pakistan. Unfortunately, their misdeeds affect others as well, especially the neighbourhood. When this polity instils such fanaticism among its people, its GDP can only be measured in terms of radicalisation and its exports in the form of terrorism,"" Jaishankar said. ""Today, we see the ills it sought to visit on others consume its own society. It can't blame the world; this is only karma,"" added the minister.While delivering India’s national statement, Jaishankar also spoke about the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts saying the world cannot be fatalistic about the continuation of violence on a large scale, no more than be impervious to its broader consequences.Whether it is the war in Ukraine or the conflict in Gaza, the international community seeks urgent solutions, he said. “Respect for international law and commitments are among the foremost in that regard. If we are to ensure global security and stability, then it is essential that those who seek to lead, set the right example. Nor can we countenance egregious violations of our basic tenets,” Jaishankar said.The minister said that reforming multilateralism is an imperative and that the UN in its present form was ill-equipped to handle global challenges.“Leaving no one behind means advancing peace, ensuring sustainable development and strengthening human dignity. This cannot be delivered by a UN paralyzed when faced with division, conflict, terrorism and violence. Nor can it be advanced if access to food, fuel and fertilizer is jeopardized.

NEW DELHI: Government has made the National Security Council Secretariat ( NSCS ) the nodal agency for dealing with the growing threats to cyber security.As per a notification issued late Friday evening, PM-led NSCS has been mandated “to provide overall coordination and strategic direction for cyber security” in addition to assisting the National Security Adviser, the principal adviser on national security matters to the PM and the council.So far the job was the concern of the Cabinet Secretariat . PM Narendra Modi oversees the NSCS with NSA Ajit Doval serving as its secretary. The NSCS acts as the top body for all internal and external security matters in India.As per the notification, specific responsibilities have been assigned to the ministries of telecom, IT and home ministries to ensure better clarity.While the telecom department will be responsible for telecom network security, the IT department will take care of cyber security, and the home ministry will deal with cybercrime.The decision follows deliberations in the govt and experience of several countries which have mandated well-defined roles to different govt entities to eliminate ambiguities and duplication of efforts in the fight against the challenge of cyber attacks which have opened up a new realm of warfare.“Now with this new allocation of business rules, there will be more clarity in dealing with different aspects and for better coordinated strategies. The NSA will have greater say in these matters,” said a source familiar with the reasoning behind the change .As per the notification the telecom department will deal with “matters relating to telecom networks” in addition to the earlier task of policy, licencing and coordination matters relating to telegraphs, telephones, wireless, data, facsimile and telematic services and other like forms of communications.Similarly, the electronics and IT has been assigned the business of matters relating to “cyber security as assigned in the IT Act” and “support other ministries and departments on cyber security”.In the case of home ministry, an additional business allocation has been made to deal with “matters relating to cybercrime”.",The decision follows deliberations in the govt and experience of several countries which have mandated well-defined roles to different govt entities.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Saturday launched a ‘handbook’ with a glossary of terms that perpetuate stereotypes about disabilities that must be avoided and provides alternative, respectful language for use in legal documents, orders, and judgments.“Engaging with stereotypes and biases is crucial, as these can subtly influence legal proceedings — whether in the assumptions made about the capacity of a child with disabilities to testify or in the way their credibility is assessed,” Chief Justice of India Dhananjay Chandrachud asserted.He was speaking at the inaugural session of a two-day annual national stakeholders consultation on child protection organised under the aegis of the Juvenile Justice Committee of the Supreme Court in association with UNICEF .Chandrachud emphasised it must be ensured that the justice system, from the police stations to the courtrooms, understands and responds to the compounded vulnerabilities of children with disabilities. He also cited absence of reliable data on children with disabilities, especially those who are survivors of sexual offences or who come into conflict with the law, as a significant challenge. He said improving data collection systems must be a priority as it is the “foundation for meaningful reforms”.The ‘Handbook Concerning Persons With Disabilities ’ launched by SC on Saturday advised against use of “offensive terms such as crippled, idiot, loony, mad, junkie and retard in any derogatory contexts.” Some other descriptions to be avoided when referring to PwDs include “infirm; stunted; unfit; helpless; crippled; defected; deformed; invalid; lame; maimed; mutilated; or subnormal”.The CJI asserted that “the handbook aims to aid and sensitise not only the legal community but also society at large, in using inclusive terminology when referring to disabilities.”When referring to persons with intellectual or learning disabilities or mental health conditions, the terms to be avoided include “crazy; freak; idiot; insane; loony; mad; maniac; nut case; nuts; nutter; psycho; simpleton; stupid or unhinged”.To avoid stereotypical judgments about a person’s disability, it is stated in the handbook that rather than assuming that all persons with disabilities are “brave, heroic, inspiring, or suffering, burdened, and victimised, avoid value judgments about the person’s experience”. “Use neutral language to simply state the nature of the disability when relevant to the context,” the handbook states.Also instead of using ‘disabled person’ the handbooks recommends “using the phrasing “person with a disability” as this reflects a people-first approach. It also pointed out that some terms such as “people of determination,” “special,” and “differently abled” are also considered condescending and offensive because they stigmatise the language around disability by substituting it. “Also when possible and if in doubt, ask the individual in question how they would prefer to be described,” it is recommended.Pointing that the theme of the consultation “protection services for children with disabilities holds a special place in his heart the CJI drew upon his personal journey with his foster daughters who he shared are born with a genetic condition. “As someone who fosters two wonderful young daughters, I am reminded daily of the joy, purpose, and love they bring into my life. They have transformed not only how I see the world but also how I engage with it — strengthening my commitment to creating a more inclusive society where every child, regardless of their abilities, is cherished and protected,"" the CJI said.",The Supreme Court on Saturday launched a ‘handbook’ with a glossary of terms that perpetuate stereotypes about disabilities.

Ten tourists from Europe in J&K, some of whom had visited the region earlier during its years blighted by terrorism, have confessed to being struck by the “peace and serenity” now, more so when elections are underway.Octogenarian Glenys Gem of UK first came to Kashmir Valley when she was 43. “We first came in 1980 and were captivated by Kashmir’s beauty.This time we have arrived with our group of ten, some from Switzerland, some from Luxembourg and the rest from Germany. We’ve all been struck by the peaceful atmosphere even though local assembly elections are on here. It’s been of added interest to witness campaigning with processions and no sign of any trouble at all,” Glenys, now 87, said.For Mario and his wife Suzanne from Switzerland, there seems “a new settled feel here now, with local Kashmiris enjoying life with a new hope”.Thiele and wife Werner from Germany had similar feelings about their trip this time. Between their many sightseeing rounds, they packed in a trip to watch the second phase of elections in Srinagar on Sept 25. “We have not seen such peaceful elections in Kashmir earlier. This land was always in bad news. But this time around, the situation has changed,” Thiele said.Luxembourg’s Danielle and wife Nadine could not stop raving about the “serenity” of their Shikara (houseboat) rides on Srinagar’s Dal Lake .For UK’s Glenys, the current visit presented a contrast with some of her earlier trips. “I have visited Kashmir several times, sometimes when it was enduring serious turmoil,” she recalled. This time, it was great to relive the great memories. “We had the good fortune to stay with the Wangnoo family on their beautifully comfortableWangnoo Sheraton houseboats (on Dal Lake), then headed up by Sultan Wangnoo and now by his son Habib,” Glenys said.All this was music to the ears of those connected to tourism, once J&K’s mainstay and an area on which the Centre has renewed its focus since the 2019 abrogation of J&K’s special status. The chorus reached a crescendo last week when the Union ministry of tourism declared Aru village in J&K’s Pahalgam one of the winners of Best Tourism Villages Competition, 2024. The honour was announced on World Tourism Day on September 27.This year, the competition featured 991 villages from 30 states and Union territories; 36 villages won in various categories. Aru top-scored in adventure tourism, which includes a range of activities like trekking, skiing, and camping. Hoteliers from other parts of India have started investing in star hotels in Aru, many with local businessmen as partners, setting the stage for generation of jobs for J&K youths, said a senior tourism department official.","Ten tourists from Europe in J&K have confessed to being struck by the “peace and serenity” now, more so when elections are underway.

BISHNAH: Congress star campaigner Priyanka Gandhi Saturday slammed the BJP for making Jammu and Kashmir a ‘pawn’ in its political chess.

Citing Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 's United Nations General Assembly ( UNGA ) speech where he accused New Delhi of ""escalating tensions"" in Kashmir, Jaishankar also warned that Islamabad's ""actions will most certainly have consequences"".Addressing the UNGA, Jaishankar said that the ""issue to be resolved between the two countries is only the vacation of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir by Islamabad and the abandonment of its long-standing attachment to terrorism.""""Some make conscious choices with disastrous consequences. A premier example is our neighbor Pakistan. Unfortunately, the mystics affect others as well, especially the neighbors. When this quality instills such fanaticism among its people, Its GDP can only be measured in terms of radicalisation against exports in the form of terrorism,"" Jaishankar said.""We heard some bizarre assertions from this very forum yesterday. Let me make India's position very clear - Pakistan's policy of cross-border terrorism will never succeed. And it can have no expectation of impunity. On the contrary, actions will certainly have consequences. The issue to be resolved between us is only the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan and of course, abandonment of Pakistan's long-standing attachment to terrorism,"" he added.This comes a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif remarks, calling India to reverse its ""unilateral and illegal"" actions in Jammu and Kashmir, referring to the 2019 revocation of Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu & Kashmir.""India spurned Pakistan's proposals for a mutual strategic restraint to the regime.

Health ministry comes up with new draft guidelines on passive euthanasia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/health-ministry-comes-up-with-new-draft-guidelines-on-passive-euthanasia/articleshow/113771653.cms,"NEW DELHI: Doctors should take a ""considered decision"" on withdrawal of life support in terminally ill patients on the basis of certain conditions including a documented informed refusal by the patient or their kin, according to draft guidelines by Union Health Ministry . The guidelines laid out four conditions on passive euthanasia for taking a ""considered decision in a patient's best interests, to stop or discontinue ongoing life support in a terminally ill disease that is no longer likely to benefit the patient or is likely to harm in terms of causing suffering and loss of dignity.""The conditions are whether the individual has been declared brainstem death , if there is a medical prognostication and considered opinion that the patient's disease condition is advanced and not likely to benefit from aggressive therapeutic interventions, patient/surrogate documented informed refusal, following prognostic awareness, to continue life support and compliance with procedure prescribed by the Supreme Court.The 'Draft Guidelines for Withdrawal of Life Support in Terminally Ill Patients,' also state that doctors should take a considered decision to not start a life supporting measure in a terminally ill patient that is unlikely to benefit the patient and is likely to lead to suffering and loss of dignity.In such a case, three conditions - on whether the individual has been declared brainstem death, if there is a medical prognostication and considered opinion that the patient's disease condition is advanced and not likely to benefit from aggressive therapeutic interventions, patient/surrogate documented informed refusal, following prognostic awareness - has to be taken into account.The Union ministry has invited feedback and suggestions from the stakeholders on the draft by October 20.The draft guidelines have not gone down well among the members of the medical fraternity, with the IMA's national President Dr R V Asokan stating it exposes doctors to legal scrutiny and puts them under stress.""Such clinical decisions have always been taken in good faith by doctors. The patient's relatives are explained and given all information, taken into confidence in a given case and decision is taken on merit in every single case. Putting it down in sort of guidelines and also alleging that inappropriate decisions have been taken or they have been prolonged is misunderstanding the situation,"" Dr Asokan said.""First the perception and assumption that unnecessarily machines are used and lives are prolonged is wrong. It exposes the doctors to legal scruity.""More so what is left of a doctor-patient relationship... trying to define it in four corners of black and white documentation which is legally scrutinised is nothing but exposing the doctors to further stress,"" he said.There are things which should be left to relatives, patients, and doctors based on science and situation, Dr Asokan said.The Indian Medical Association , Dr Asokan said, will study the document and submit its views seeking a revision of the draft guidelines.Terminal illness in the draft guidelines has been defined as an irreversible or incurable condition from which death is inevitable in the foreseeable future. Severe traumatic brain injury which shows no recovery after 72 hours or more is also included.The draft document states that many patients in the ICU are terminally ill, and not expected to benefit from life sustaining treatments (LST) that include (but are not limited to) mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, dialysis, surgical procedures, transfusions, parenteral nutrition or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.""In such circumstances, LST are non-beneficial and increase avoidable burdens and suffering to patients and therefore, are considered excessive and inappropriate. Additionally, they increase emotional stress and economic hardship to the family and moral distress to professional caregivers.""Withdrawal of LST in such patients is regarded as a standard of ICU care worldwide and upheld by several jurisdictions. Such decisions have medical, ethical and legal considerations. It may be considered that the above mentioned also applies at the time of initiating Life support treatments to individuals with,"" the draft said.The draft calls for taking a considered decision not to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of anticipated cardiac arrest if there is no realistic possibility of survival or meaningful recovery.According to it, the legal principles outlined by the Supreme Court state an adult patient capable of taking healthcare decisions may refuse LST even if it results in death.Further, according to principals, LST may be withheld or withdrawn lawfully under certain conditions from people who no longer retain decision-making capacity, based on the fundamental Right to Autonomy, Privacy and Dignity and that there is an Advance Medical Directives , or AMD, that meets specified requirements is a legally valid document.AMD is a written declaration made by a person with decision-making capacity documenting how they would like to be medically treated or not treated should they lose capacity.For a patient without capacity, Foregoing of Life Support proposals should be made by consensus among a group of at least three physicians who form the Primary Medical Board (PMB).The PMB must explain the illness, the medical treatment available, alternative forms of treatment, and the consequences of remaining treated and untreated to fully inform the surrogate.A Secondary Medical Board of three physicians with one appointee by the Chief Medical Officer of the district must validate the decision by the PMB.""Active Euthanasia is the intentional act of killing a terminally ill patient on voluntary request, by the direct intervention of a doctor for the purpose of the good of the patient. It is illegal in India,"" the draft document said.","Draft guidelines laid out four conditions on passive euthanasia for taking a ""considered decision in a patient's best interests"" The conditions are whether the individual has been declared brainstem death, if there is a medical prognostication and considered opinion that the patient's disease condition is advanced. The Indian Medical Association will study the document and submit its views seeking a revision of the draft guidelines.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113771699,imgsize-580121,width-400,resizemode-4/113771699.jpg"
