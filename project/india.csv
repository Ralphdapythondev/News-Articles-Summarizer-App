We will work closely with all Canadian enterprises engaged with India to ensure these important economic connections remain strong,” she said.However, she also pointed out the need to balance economic interests with the protection of Canadians and adherence to the rule of law. “We will not tolerate any foreign government threatening, extorting, or harming Canadian citizens on our soil. We urge the government of India to respect the same principles of law and justice that guide our actions,” Ng added.Despite the current tensions, Ng expressed Canada’s openness to dialogue, stating, “The Government of Canada remains open to a dialogue with India and we look forward to continuing our valued relationship.”Her comments come as India and Canada's diplomatic relations hit rock-bottom with both the nations expelling each other's diplomats.According to the India Brand Equity Foundation, the bilateral trade between Canada and India reached USD 8.27 billion in the fiscal year 2022-2023 and USD 5.3 billion during the period from April to November 2023. In 2022, India ranked as Canada’s ninth largest merchandise trading partner in the Indo-Pacific and the 13th largest globally.Major exports from India to Canada include pharmaceutical products valued at USD 274.05 million, nuclear reactors, boilers, and parts at USD 195.46 million, and electrical machinery at USD 160.68 million for the April-November 2023 period. Conversely, key imports from Canada during the same period consisted of petroleum products at USD 608.17 million, edible vegetables at USD 420.60 million, and fertilizers at USD 337.63 million.As of September 2023, Canada is ranked as the 17th largest foreign investor in India, with cumulative investments amounting to USD 3.6 billion since April 2000, constituting approximately 0.56% of India’s total foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow.The investigation into the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader in British Columbia sparked a major diplomatic row between India and Canada. Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, was designated as a terrorist by India in July 2020.India expelled six Canadian diplomats, including the acting high commissioner on Monday, hours before Canada’s foreign ministry announced the expulsion of six Indian diplomats.These actions follow a series of tit-for-tat expulsions and suspended visa services.","India and Canada's diplomatic relations hit rock-bottom with both the nations expelling each other's diplomats.

NEW DELHI: The opposition parties raised concerns and urged the government to take a more inclusive approach by engaging the opposition in handling the sensitive issue as tensions escalated between India and Canada.The diplomatic fallout between India and Canada over the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Sikh separatist leader, has led to a series of tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats and a suspension of visa services.Nijjar, a Canadian citizen labeled as a terrorist by India in 2020, was killed in British Columbia earlier this year, sparking a diplomatic confrontation.India has strongly refuted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's claims, saying that the assertions made by Canadian officials about presenting evidence in the Sikh extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar case are untrue, according to government sources quoted by ANI. India also dismissed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's (RCMP) allegations that Indian agents use criminals in Canada to target the South Asian community, particularly ""pro-Khalistani elements,"" citing a lack of specific evidence.Here’s how key opposition figures responded to the ongoing India-Canada diplomatic row:Congress leader Jairam Ramesh urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to engage opposition leaders in discussions on the diplomatic crisis.In a post on X, Ramesh expressed concern about the deteriorating relations, saying, “The Indian National Congress certainly hopes and expects that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take into confidence the Leaders of the Opposition in both Houses of Parliament and the leaders of other political parties on this extremely sensitive and critical issue ofIndia-Canada relations .”Rashid Alvi, another Congress leader, told ANI, “It is a matter of great concern. When such a thing happens, it shows that our relations with that country are not good...Earlier, such things never used to happen. It has started under the BJP government .""The Communist Party of India (Marxist) urged the government to brief opposition parties on the evolving situation with Canada. The party highlighted that anti-India Khalistani elements operating in Canada have long posed a threat to India's national security.“The Government of India is duty-bound to protect the national interest for which it has the support across political parties in India,” the CPM said. The party also raised concerns about allegations from Canada regarding India's role in Nijjar's killing, asserting that these claims should be addressed with transparency.The CPM also said that ""activities of anti-India Khalistani elements operating in Canada have been a matter of serious concern"" and called for unity among Indian political factions in defending the nation’s interests.National Conference President Farooq Abdullah urged India not to sever diplomatic ties with Canada, suggesting that both countries should strive for peaceful negotiations. He raised questions about of the allegations made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.""I regret this situation; we should establish a friendship...We should not stray from the path of diplomacy,"" Abdullah said, adding that India should continue to deny the allegations unless presented with clear evidence.TMC MP Sagarika Ghose took to social media to criticize the Modi government for its handling of the diplomatic row, accusing it of evading accountability. She questioned why Canada’s accusations have not been addressed transparently.“The head of another government and its police publicly accuse the Modi-led government of shocking criminal activity on its soil, and no one is supposed to ask for answers from the non-biological PM Narendra Modi?” Ghose wrote on X.",Opposition parties urge the government to take a more inclusive approach by engaging the opposition in handling the sensitive issue.

It’s the first time in decades that the five-year term of the assembly was split with two rival coalitions running the govt. The first one known as the MVA (comprising Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP) remained in the saddle till June 2022 when a revolt in the Shiv Sena led to Uddhav Thackeray resigning as chief minister. The man who took over, Eknath Shinde , was an MVA minister himself until he broke away and formed the Mahayuti govt, backed by the BJP and later the NCP Now as electorate takes stock, it will have to weigh MVA’s record against that of Mahayuti. Issues at stake range from execution of infra projects undertaken in the last five years to welfare schemes in health and education as well as measures taken to promote industry and agriculture. The ongoing quota stir, dissatisfaction over low fair and remunerative prices for sugarcane, export policy on onions, farmer suicides , law and order, and the sympathy wave for Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar for putative BJP-engineered splits in their parties will also impact voting.The Mahayuti govt has introduced several measures to appease farmers, while also attempting to persuade quota activist Manoj Jarange to adopt a less confrontational stance towards it. In addition, the alliance continues to assert that chief minister Eknath Shinde’s faction is the true Shiv Sena and deputy CM Ajit Pawar represents the authentic NCP. On the other hand, the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi, energized by its performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, is expected to attack the Mahayuti on two fronts: highlighting the govt’s failure to address the agrarian crisis, and portraying BJP, the dominant partner of the ruling coalition, as one that specializes in splitting parties and toppling governments.The sugarbelt of the state remains politically significant as it sends 58 of the 288 assembly members. The region is a large sugarcane cultivation belt but has a growing industrial base as well. Rise in crime, particularly in and around Pune, has become a key concern.Once a Congress stronghold, the region saw a shift in the 2019 elections, with Congress winning just 10 seats, the undivided NCP securing 21, and the BJP claiming 19, riding the Modi wave, which five years earlier had propelled it to power nationally in the 2014 parliamentary elections. The upcoming battle is expected to center on similar issues, though alliances have shifted.Here, Centre’s onion export ban has stirred considerable anger, something that BJP had failed to anticipate. Known as the state’s ""kitchen bowl"", this region saw the BJP-Shiv Sena win only two of the eight Lok Sabha seats, a sharp decline from their 2014 clean sweep. In the 2019 assembly elections, the undivided BJP-Sena won 22 of the 47 seats in the five districts of the region, while Congress-NCP claimed 20. With the split in the Sena and NCP, a tight contest is expected.Long the subject of political discourse due to its droughtprone nature, it is the epicenter of the Maratha reservation agitation. The region, which has produced four chief ministers, could prove crucial to the fortunes of the alliance that eventually gains power. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-Sena managed just one of the eight seats, down from six in 2019, when the saffron alliance won 29 of the 46 assembly seats across the region's eight districts. Winning over the Maratha community here will be key to success—a near-impossible task for Mahayuti, as neutral political experts say.This region, which has the highest incidence of farmer suicides in Maharashtra, has a total of 62 assembly seats. The outcome will depend on how OBC, Dalit, and tribal voters, who make up 80% of the electorate, respond to various narratives. Farmers form the largest voter group. But they are grappling with debt, rising input costs, and a labour shortage, partly attributed to the Ladki Bahin freebie. In the 2019 polls, BJP’s seat count in Vidarbha had dropped to 29 from 44 in 2014.The state’s coastal belt is known for its Alphonso mangoes, cashew plantations, rice fields and fish. It’s also a region which faces the brunt of climate change, with cyclones battering its shores of late. Electorally, the Konkan region spans one of the state’s densest clusters: Mumbai Metropolitan Region with satellite towns like Thane, Mira-Bhayandar and Palghar. In 2019 assembly elections, the undivided Sena won 15 seats—the region was always a Sena bastion—BJP 11, NCP 5, and Congress none. Smaller parties won the remaining eight seats. Following the split in the Sena, most of its MLAs sided with the Shinde faction. In the Lok Sabha polls, Sena (UBT) suffered major losses, with BJP’s Narayan Rane winning RatnagiriSindhudurg and NCP’s Sunil Tatkare taking Raigad.","First time in decades that the five-year term of the assembly was split with two rival coalitions running the govt.

Eknath Shinde: Will Shinde retain his hold on home turf?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-shinde-retain-his-hold-on-home-turf/articleshow/114267731.cms,"Will Shinde retain his hold on home turf?

In the broader Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) beyond Mumbai, which is the backbone of Maharashtra ’s economy and a vibrant urban centre, stakes are high for both the Mahayuti and the MVA but especially so for CM Eknath Shinde as his home turf of Thane is part of it. The region is witnessing an intense tussle for seats within the Mahayuti with BJP , while acknowledging the CM’s position, not wanting to concede seats to the Shinde-led Shiv Sena in Thane which it has fought earlier.The MMR, spread over Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts, has 65 assembly seats, of which 36 are in Mumbai. In 2019, BJP won 16 seats in Mumbai and 10 in the rest of MMR. The undivided Shiv Sena on the other hand won 14 seats in Mumbai and seven in the rest of MMR.The four seats within Thane considered the dominion of CM Shinde, have become the centre of attention for assembly polls as the two Shiv Senas will try their best to capture these. At present UBT Sena doesn’t have any representation in these four seats — Ovala Majiwada (Pratap Sarnaik-SS), Kopri-Panchpakhadi (Eknath Shinde-SS), Thane (Sanjay Kelkar-BJP) and Mumbra Kalwa (Jitendra Awhad-NCP SP), all of which are located within the Thane civic corporation limits.Thane Sena (UBT) neta and ex-MP Rajan Vichare said the party was confident of a turnaround in the assembly results as the public has witnessed “betrayal” by their rivals (Shinde) and “rampant corruption in Thane corporation controlled by Mahayuti.”“Thane corporation in their (Shinde Sena) tenure has become a hotbed of corruption. Their own ally (BJP MLA Sanjay Kelkar) has consistently raised questions and alleged corruption in TMC. The corporation was once financially stable but has to rely on state grants every month. Voters have also not liked how they (Shinde) used Anand Digheto to polish their own image in the recently released Dighe biopic sequel. People will teach these ‘traitors’ a lesson in the polls,” he added.However, Shinde Sena is not just basking in the 2024 Thane & Kalyan (from where CM Shinde’s son Shrikant won) LS victory but says it is banking on initiatives taken by its leader Shinde during his tenure as the chief minister.“The LS poll results have shown the affiliation of residents towards Shinde saheb. Anyone can see the works done during his tenure as CM. We are confident that the goodwill will help us not just in Thane but across the state. The opposition has been trying to politicise certain issues, but people are intelligent enough to see through their words,” said Sena MP Naresh Mhaske.A BJP said every party will hold the seats it has won in the last state polls. “There is no conflict on this issue. Recently Dipesh Mhatre, who has been close to MP Shrikant Shinde, quit the Shinde Sena and joined Shiv Sena (UBT) as he wants to contest from Dombivli where PWD minister Ravindra Chavan is sitting BJP MLA. It was clear he would not get the seat,” said the source.On BJP increasing its seat share in MMR, the source said in Palghar, BJP is keen to contest on Dahanuwon by CPI-M’s Vinod Nikole in the last polls. “The other seat it is eyeing is Mira-Bhayandar won by Independent candidate, Geeta Jain,” said the source. Chavan has also been aggressive about expanding the party in Thane, in particular in the KalyanDombivli-Ulhasnagar belt.Another source said that with the BJP keen to fight more seats in Mumbai, Shinde could demand more seats in Thane and beyond, which are his strongholds. “Already BJP neta in Navi Mumbai Ganesh Naik is unhappy about Shinde trying to make inroads into Navi Mumbai,” the source said.BJP is also trying to expand in the Palghar district. “Its MP candidate Dr Hemant Savra won a decisive victory despite the opposition to Vadhavan port. The party has a voter base among Gujaratis, Hindi-speaking migrants from Uttar Pradesh and a section of the Marathi populace. It may reach an understanding with Hitendra Thakur’s Bahujan Vikas Aghadi,” the source explained.","Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has 65 assembly seats, of which 36 are in Mumbai.

"Canada’s targeting of envoy Verma ‘absurd’, says official",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canadas-targeting-of-envoy-verma-absurd-says-official/articleshow/114267531.cms,"Asked about the allegation that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi was working for the Indian govt, official sources said Canada had not provided any “specifics” to back its claim.“The central assertion from all Canadian officials is that credible evidence has been presented to India. This was also repeated by their charge d’affaires to the press. This is simply not true.From the very beginning, the Canadian approach has been to make vague accusations and put the burden of denial on India,” said an official, responding to remarks made by Trudeau and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).“At the RCMP press briefing, assertions were made about connections of certain individuals to India. In no case were any specifics provided. There was also talk about holding people accountable. But it was never made clear who and for what,” added the official, describing as absurd that after intensively engaging Indian high commissioner Sanjay Verma over the last year, the Canadian govt had chosen to target him. Verma was among the six Indian diplomats “expelled” by Canada on Monday. India, however, had said it had recalled Verma and expelled six Canadian diplomats.Speaking in the same press conference, Joly did not rule out sanctions against India. “So today was a really important step. When you look at what is available in our toolbox, expelling diplomats is one of the highest and toughest measures a country can take under Vienna Convention. Everything is on the table,” she said when asked about the possibility of sanctions.“Justin Trudeau again fails to provide compelling evidence to the public after escalating the tensions with India. Diplomats have been expelled and we are still in the ‘trust me bro’ phase. This could end up costing Canada billions in trade. All to appease Jagmeet and the gang of Khalistani ministers ,” a Canadian geopolitical analyst tweeted.Trudeau though maintained in remarks at a press conference and a lengthy statement that Canada had “clear and compelling evidence that agents of the govt of India have engaged in, and continue to engage in, activities that pose a significant threat to public safety”, and New Delhi had rebuffed several Canadian attempts to apprise India of it.“This includes clandestine information gathering techniques, coercive behaviour targeting South Asian Canadians, and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts, including murder. This is unacceptable,” Trudeau said.He added that the evidence brought to light by the RCMP could not be ignored.“It leads to one conclusion: it is necessary to disrupt the criminal activities that continue to pose a threat to public safety in Canada. That is why we acted. Because we will always — first and foremost — stand for the right of Canadians to feel safe and secure in their own country,” he said.“Once again, we call on India govt to cooperate with us on this investigation, to put an end to its inaction and misleading rhetoric, to recognise the credibility and severity of the evidence and information we have shared so far, and to reiterate, in no uncertain terms, that its position on extrajudicial operations abroad will henceforth be unequivocally aligned with international law,” Trudeau added.","Official sources said Canada had not provided any “specifics” to back its claim. “From the very beginning, the Canadian approach has been to make vague accusations and put the burden of denial on India,” said an official, responding to remarks made by Trudeau and the RCMP.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114267547,imgsize-581731,width-400,resizemode-4/114267547.jpg"
"Over 800 US military veterans released under 'don’t ask, don’t tell' policy receive honorable discharges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-800-us-military-veterans-released-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-policy-receive-honorable-discharges/articleshow/114267124.cms,"Over 800 military personnel discharged under “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy had their service records upgraded (Representative Image)

The Pentagon announced on Tuesday that more than 800 military personnel who had been discharged under the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy have had their service records upgraded to honorable discharges . This policy, which was in effect from 1993 to 2011, prohibited LGBTQ troops from openly serving in the US armed forces and led to the discharge of thousands of service members who disclosed their sexual orientation.The announcement comes as part of broader efforts by the US government to rectify decades of discrimination. The roots of this issue date back to 1951, when Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) criminalized consensual same-sex activity.Former President Bill Clinton ’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy modified this stance in 1993, allowing LGBTQ personnel to serve as long as they did not disclose their sexual orientation. However, it was not until 2011 that Congress fully repealed the policy, allowing for open service by LGBTQ members in the military. Additionally, in 2013, the UCMJ was updated to decriminalize consensual same-sex activity, narrowing the scope of Article 125 to cover only nonconsensual acts.The move to upgrade discharges is part of a review initiated last year by defense secretary Lloyd Austin. The Pentagon estimates that approximately 13,500 service members were discharged under “don’t ask, don’t tell.” Of those, many were issued less-than-honorable discharges, which stripped them of military benefits such as educational assistance and impacted their civilian employment prospects.By upgrading more than 800 discharges, the Pentagon said that 96% of the affected personnel now have honorable discharges. However, not all of the 13,500 discharges required review. Some service members were already discharged, while others did not serve long enough to qualify for benefits or were not eligible for upgrades due to other violations.Defense secretary Austin reaffirmed the Pentagon’s commitment to honoring all who have served, saying, “We will continue to honor the service and the sacrifice of all our troops — including the brave Americans who raised their hands to serve but were turned away because of whom they love. We will continue to strive to do right by every American patriot who has honorably served their country.”This decision also aligns with President Joe Biden’s recent move in June to issue pardons to service members convicted under repealed military policies, further illustrating the government’s efforts to undo the damage caused by historical discrimination.","Pentagon announced on Tuesday that more than 800 military personnel who had been discharged under the “don’t ask, don’T tell” policy have had their service records upgraded to honorable discharges.

'Marriage penalty': Employment rate for Indian women drops by 1/3rd,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/marriage-penalty-employment-rate-for-indian-women-drops-by-1/3rd/articleshow/114267046.cms,"S Asia’s rates of women’s labour force presence still low: Report



NEW DLEHI: While men command a premium to get a job after marriage, women face a “marriage penalty” resulting in a sharp drop in their labour force participation , a new World Bank report says.It estimates that in India, post-marriage female employment rates drop by 12 percentage points, about one thirds of the female pre-marital employment rate, even in the absence of children.In contrast, there is a 13 percentage point premium for men post-marriage. While the premium for men erodes after five years, it persists for women.“This marriage penalty among women without children persists up to five years after wedding in India and Maldives,” the report says, while asserting that social norms may also be at the root of the “marriage penalty”.To make matters worse for women, there is also a “child penalty” as they are entrusted with childcare responsibilities, forcing many to opt out of the workforce.India, and South Asia in general, have poor female labour force participation rate, estimated at 32% in 2023, and with most countries, barring Bhutan, in the bottom quartile of World Bank’s sample. “Women with more than secondary schooling or those who marry men with more than secondary schooling are less likely to be hit by the marriage penalty, suggesting education has a role in mitigating it,” it said.Higher education levels for men as well as women can improve the situation, the study said.On the overall scenario, the ‘South Asia Development Update’ focused on “women, jobs and growth” highlights that South Asia’s rates of female labour force participation remain low despite faster-than average progress over the past three decades. Only 32% of working-age women in South Asia were in the labour force in 2023 — well below the region’s male labour force participation rate of 77%. The report further states that nearly two-thirds of working-age women are out of the labour force in the region.The reports states that “if labour force participation rates for women were raised to those of men, South Asia’s regional GDP (and, by construction, also per capita income) would be 13–51% higher.”World Bank chief economist for South Asia Franziska Ohnsorge asserted “if women worked in as productive jobs as men, GDP in the South Asian region could go up by up to 51%.” Calling South Asia, particularly India, a “bright spot” in the global economy, she said things could be “brighter” if the untapped potential of women is unlocked.Poonam Gupta, director general of National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) said, “We need to target institutional and societal causes creating the gender gaps in employment, while simultaneously making it easier, safer, remunerative, and professionally rewarding for women to join the workforce.”","Women face a ‘marriage penalty’ resulting in a sharp drop in their labour force participation.

(Picture credit: AP)

Taiwan reported the detection of 153 Chinese military aircraft around its airspace, marking a record number in a single day, according to official data released on Tuesday, reported the news agency AFP.The surge in aircraft sightings followed large-scale military drills conducted by China, which included fighter jets, drones, warships, and coast guard boats encircling the island.The 25-hour period leading up to 6:00 am (local time) on Tuesday saw Taiwan's defence ministry on high alert, as 111 of the detected aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, a previously respected boundary between mainland China and the self-governed island.The drills come at a time when tensions are constantly rising between Taipei and Beijing . Taiwan’s President, Lai Ching-te ’s administration has pledged to protect Taiwan’s democracy.In response, Taiwan deployed its own ""appropriate forces"" and heightened the alert status of its outlying islands. The island’s government condemned China’s manoeuvres as ""irrational and provocative,"" while the United States described the actions as ""unwarranted"" and warned that they risked escalating tensions in the region.Japan also expressed concerns, with its government monitoring the situation closely and scrambling fighter jets near its southern Yonaguni Island. Japan’s deputy chief cabinet secretary, Kazuhiko Aoki, confirmed that the concerns were conveyed to Beijing.China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. The latest exercises, named Joint Sword 2024B , are the fourth round of large-scale drills in just over two years, with Beijing signalling them as a warning to pro-independence movements in Taiwan.Lai, who has been more vocal about defending the island’s sovereignty compared to his predecessor, reiterated his commitment to resisting annexation and safeguarding national security.","Taiwan reported the detection of 153 Chinese military aircraft around its airspace, marking a record number in a single day.

RG Kar issue: Junior doctors' hunger strike enters 11th day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rg-kar-issue-junior-doctors-hunger-strike-enters-11th-day/articleshow/114237191.cms,"(With inputs from agency)

KOLKATA: The ongoing indefinite hunger strike by junior doctors in West Bengal, demanding action in response to the RG Kar Hospital incident, reached its 11th day on Tuesday. Despite a meeting between medical representatives and the state government, no resolution was achieved, prolonging the impasse.The situation escalated as two more doctors participating in the 'fast-unto-death' protest in Kolkata's Esplanade area fell ill, intensifying the unrest that originated from the tragic rape and murder of their colleague at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.On Monday, a critical meeting was held at Swasthya Bhavan between representatives from 12 doctors' associations and chief secretary Manoj Pant. However, the discussions concluded without any breakthrough.The hunger strike, which commenced on October 5, followed nearly 50 days of 'cease work' protests divided into two phases. The catalyst for the agitation was the horrific rape and murder of a postgraduate trainee at the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.As of Tuesday, seven junior doctors persisted in their hunger strike, with several necessitating urgent medical intervention.Pulastha Acharya, a junior doctor from NRS Medical College and Hospital, was admitted to the facility's Critical Care Unit (CCU) on Sunday night after complaining of severe stomach pain.Another junior doctor from Kolkata Medical College and Hospital, Tanaya Panja, experienced a significant deterioration in her health condition, losing consciousness and requiring immediate transfer to the medical establishment for treatment. Upon arrival, she was admitted to the CCU, where a team of doctors initiated prompt treatment.The most recent junior doctor to participate in the fast was from the ENT department of North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, commencing the hunger strike on Monday afternoon.Following the unsuccessful meeting with the doctors on Monday, chief secretary Pant stated that the doctors demanded a well-defined timeline to address their concerns. However, the government maintained that such a deadline could not be provided.Pant noted that seven out of the ten demands put forth by the junior doctors had already been addressed, while the remaining three necessitated further administrative deliberation.""For the remaining three demands, they were requesting specific timelines. These are administrative decisions that the state needs to consider, so we cannot provide a deadline at this point,"" Pant said.The Joint Platform of Doctors (JPD) was invited by Pant for additional talks at the state health department headquarters. He encouraged them to cancel their scheduled 'Droher Carnival' protest on October 15.The JPD had declared the protest to show support for the junior doctors, but the government was worried that it would overlap with the state's yearly 'Durga Puja Carnival.'The junior doctors' main demands consist of justice for the RG Kar Hospital victim, the prompt dismissal of Health Secretary N S Nigam, and better workplace safety, together with further demands for a centralised hospital referral system, a bed vacancy monitoring system, and crucial infrastructure such as on-call rooms, CCTV, and adequate washrooms.Insisting on a swift and open investigation by the CBI into the alleged rape-murder at RG Kar hospital, protesting junior doctors on Monday evening marched to Raj Bhawan and delivered a memorandum to the governor's secretary.","The hunger strike by junior doctors in West Bengal reached its 11th day on Tuesday.

Canada invokes allies support to threaten sanctions on India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invokes-allies-support-to-threaten-sanctions-on-india/articleshow/114260003.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

Canada has invoked support from its ""five eyes"" intelligence partners and G-7 nations to warn India of sanctions over allegations that New Delhi is involved in transnational hits of Khalistani terrorists on its territory, even as an Indian team probing the matter is holding talks in Washington on Tuesday.“Everything is on the table,"" Canada's Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said at a news conference when asked if Ottawa is considering sanctions against India.She said Canada will continue to ""push India to make sure they cooperate"" and will continue to engage on the issue with ""five eyes"" partners, an intelligence alliance that includes the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand, and also Group of Seven nations that includes France, Germany and Italy.In Washington, the State Department said the visit of the Indian probe team on Tuesday was ""completely coincidental"" but ""when it comes to the Canadian matter the allegations are extremely serious and we expect it to be taken seriously.""""We want to see India cooperate with the investigation and they have obviously not chosen the path...they have chosen an alternate path,"" a state department spokesman said, backing Canada's allegation that India is not cooperating with the probe.Joly's threat of sanctions came on the heels of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau once again going public with allegations of India's involvement amid push back from critics that he is exacerbating the issue due to domestic political compulsions where his minority government is dependent on support from separatist Sikhs.""Justin Trudeau again fails to provide compelling evidence to the public after escalating the tensions with India. Diplomats have been expelled and we are still in the “trust me bro” phase. This could end up costing Canada billions in trade. All to appease Jagmeet and the gang of Khalistani ministers,"" a Canadian geopolitical analyst tweeted, as the spat cascaded into social media, where supporters and critics of the Modi and Trudeau governments clashed.Trudeau though maintained in remarks at a press conference and a lengthy statement that Canada has ""clear and compelling evidence that agents of the Government of India have engaged in, and continue to engage in, activities that pose a significant threat to public safety,"" and New Delhi had rebuffed several Canadian attempts to apprise India of it.""This includes clandestine information gathering techniques, coercive behaviour targeting South Asian Canadians, and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts, including murder. This is unacceptable,"" Trudeau said, asserting, in an effort to expand the scope of action against India,""that Canada's position on extrajudicial operations abroad will henceforth be unequivocally aligned with international law.""Trudeau said Canadian officials had met with their Indian counterparts to share ""evidence which concluded six agents of the Government of India are persons of interest in criminal activities and despite repeated requests...India has decided not to co-operate."" The six accused appears to include India's high commissioner to Canada, one of the highest ranking diplomats in India, whose diplomatic immunity Ottawa wants revoked.Meanwhile, US State Department on Tuesday confirmed that an Indian Enquiry Committee established to investigate activities of certain organized criminals is actively investigating the individual who was identified last year in the Department of Justice’s indictment as an Indian government employee who directed a foiled plot to assassinate a US citizen in New York City.US federal prosecutors last November charged Indian national Nikhil Gupta with working with an Indian government employee in the alleged foiled plot to kill Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York. Gupta, who arrested in the Czech Republic in June last year, was extradited to the US and remains in custody.The US statement made no mention of the Canadian charges, but said as part of their ongoing investigations to discuss the case, including information they have obtained, the Indian team will receive an update regarding the US case. Additionally, India has informed the United States they are continuing their efforts to investigate other linkages of the former government employee and will determine follow up steps, as necessary, it added.","Canada has invoked support from its ""five eyes"" intelligence partners and G-7 nations to warn India of sanctions over allegations that New Delhi is involved in transnational hits of Khalistani terrorists on its territory. “Everything is on the table,"" Canada's Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said at a news conference.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114259958,imgsize-22906,width-400,resizemode-4/114259958.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Mumbai police have revealed that the plot to assassinate NCP leader and former Maharashtra minister Baba Siddiqui had started three months ago. The accused had visited Baba Siddiqui's residence multiple times without carrying any weapons, as per the Mumbai police.Based on the information obtained from the Mumbai Crime Branch, the entire plot to murder Baba Siddiqui was orchestrated in Pune.The Mumbai Crime Branch has recorded statements from over 15 individuals, including several eyewitnesses who were present at the scene of the incident.In connection with the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique, the Mumbai Police has taken another individual into custody, alleging that he supplied funds and weapons for the crime. Harishkumar Balakram Nisad (23), originally from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh, is the fourth person to be arrested in the case. On Tuesday, a court remanded him to police custody until October 21.""Nisad worked as a scrap dealer in Warje area of Pune city,"" said a police official. A team from the Mumbai crime branch apprehended him in Bahraich on Monday.Previously, the police had arrested Gurmail Baljit Singh (23) from Haryana, Dharmaraj Rajesh Kashyap (19) from Uttar Pradesh, both alleged shooters, and ""co-conspirator"" Pravin Lonkar from Pune.Shivkumar Gautam, another suspected shooter who also hails from Bahraich, remains at large.During Nisad's appearance before additional chief judicial magistrate V R Patil, the police informed the court that he had provided financial assistance to the co-accused and that further investigation was required to establish ""the upper link and lower link"" regarding the financial support and determine how he procured the weapons used in the crime.Nisad and Kashyap are from the same village as the wanted accused, Shivkumar Gautam.Ajay Dubey, Nisad's lawyer, opposed the remand plea, arguing that the accused was a ""victim of circumstances and a scapegoat."" However, the magistrate acknowledged the seriousness of the offence and deemed his custodial interrogation necessary.According to the police, Nisad, along with Kashyap, Gautam, Pravin Lonkar, and Pravin's brother Shubham, was involved in the conspiracy to kill Siddique.On Saturday night, Baba Siddique (66), a former Congress leader who had recently joined the Nationalist Congress Party, was ambushed by three individuals in Mumbai's Nirmal Nagar area, just outside the office of his MLA son Zeeshan Siddique , and shot.The Mumbai crime branch has assembled various teams to apprehend Shivkumar Gautam, accused Mohammed Zeeshan Akhtar, and other individuals wanted in connection with the case.According to officials, the crime branch is exploring various angles, including the possibility of a contract killing, business or political rivalry, or threats related to a slum rehabilitation project.","Harishkumar Balakram Nisad (23), originally from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh, is the fourth person to be arrested in the case.

He had greeted his then counterpart Bilawal Bhutto Zardari last year in the Goa SCO meeting with a namaste. However, Jaishankar, was neither scheduled to call on Shehbaz separately nor have a formal bilateral meeting with his counterpart Ishaq Dar, who was present at the dinner, during his 24-hour stay in Islamabad.After having ruled out a bilateral meeting, both sides also played down expectations of a brief pull aside on the sidelines of the summit on Wednesday, maintaining Jaishankar’s presence in Pakistan was about the SCO, the security-oriented Eurasian bloc which counts India and Pakistan as full member-states since 2017.After the dinner, Pakistan minister of planning and development Ahsan Iqbal put the onus for a bilateral meeting on India, saying that Pakistan, as the host, can’t propose any such meeting. Asked about the exchange of greetings between Jaishankar and Shehbaz, the minister also said it was time for both sides to uphold the Lahore Declaration that Shebaz’s brother Nawaz Sharif reached with then Indian PM A B Vajpayee in 1999.There was also a cultural programme at the dinner in which a Pakistani dancer performed Bharatanatyam. Shehbaz was seated next to his Chinese and Kazakhstan counterparts at the dinner table and there wasn’t much of an exchange between him and Jaishankar during the dinner.The SCO heads of government meeting is focused on the trade and economic agenda of the organisation. Ahead of Jaishankar’s arrival in Islamabad, the government said in a statement India remains actively engaged in the SCO format, including various mechanisms and initiatives within the SCO framework. Jaishankar himself announced his arrival in a post on X, uploading photos of him being greeted by children at the airport.Jaishankar met Chinese Premier Li Qiang too at the dinner. He will address the summit on Wednesday, underlining India’s position, without naming China or Pakistan, that all member-states must respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial connectivity while pursuing connectivity and infrastructure initiatives.The government of Pakistan uploaded a video of Jaishankar’s arrival for the SCO meeting, saying “exciting discussions ahead’’. A meeting between Jaishankar and Dar remained a remote possibility though.``I don’t think there is any expectation of a breakthrough in bilateral ties during the visit by the Indian minister,’’ said former Pakistan interim PM Anwaar-ul-haq Kakar, responding to a query from ToI. Considered close to the federal government, Kakar, however, also said the visit by Jaishankar, even if for a multilateral event, could provide an opening for engagement between the 2 countries. Asked why Pakistan had not proposed a meeting, Kakar said an outreach to India could hurt the government in the elections and would provoke widespread protests by PTI supporters.India is unlikely to itself propose any sort of meeting with Pakistan during Jaishankar’s visit. As former Indian high commissioner Ajay Bisaria says, India has already taken the bold step of sending Jaishankar and the onus is now on Islamabad to use this opportunity to stabilise ties by proposing a meaningful conversation. For any improvement in bilateral ties, India would like Pakistan to first review its decision to recall its high commissioner, after India revoked the special status of J&K.",Foreign minister S Jaishankar began his visit to Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) heads of government meeting. It was the first by any Indian foreign minister in nearly a decade.

He had asked Hezbollah members to destroy their mobile phones to evade detection by Israeli agencies. It turned out to be a grave error as Israeli agencies infiltrated the supply chain of pagers by setting up a front company which gained the franchise from the Taiwanese manufacturer of the devices, and rigged them with explosives which could be set off by sending an encrypted message.With Hezbollah firing missiles at Israel, the encrypted message was delivered to the pagers on Sept 17, setting off explosions which killed more than a dozen and maimed thousands. A day later, this was followed by Hezbollah walkie-talkie sets also going off as part of an audacious operation by Israel.

Quota row puts an out-of-sync Mahayuti in a tighter spot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quota-row-puts-an-out-of-sync-mahayuti-in-a-tighter-spot/articleshow/114263153.cms,"Jarange's jang

Tightrope walk for Mahayuti

Not easy for MVA either

Has caste buried other issues?

Protests by the Maratha, OBC and Dhangar communities in Marathwada are expected to cast a long shadow over voting patterns in the state, much like during the Lok Sabha polls. With BJP reeling from its poor performance even five months after the polls (it did not win even a single of the four seats it contested in Marathwada, and Mahayuti won just one-Aurangabad-out of the region's eight seats) party workers, wary of another defeat, were recently told by NDA chairman and Union home minister Amit Shah that the Centre would help to resolve the issue.Besides voter fatigue and anti-incumbency sentiment, the Mahayuti's poor show was largely explained by the region's dominant community, the Marathas, led by quota activist Manoj Jarange, turning their backs on the governing alliance. With internal tensions over issues like claiming credit for the Ladki Bahin Yojana already weakening Mahayuti, the ongoing quota dispute does not bode well for the BJP-led alliance, though it won't spare MVA either.Jarange has said Maharashtra should not go to the polls and the model code of conduct must not come into force until the govt declares a quota for Marathas from the OBC share. ""Marathas account for nearly 55% of the state's population. Mahayuti will face a poll debacle if it attracts the wrath of our community,"" said Jarange, who went on six hunger strikes within a year over his demand that Marathas be given Kunbi certificates to make them eligible for OBC benefits. This has riled the OBC communities, led by Laxman Hake, a former member of the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission. Hake, who too resorted to hunger strikes to protect OBC reservation from ""encroachment"" by Marathas, told TOI that the Maratha stir would perhaps have the unwitting effect of uniting OBCs: ""Though OBCs form the largest community in the state, they are not united. Heavily influenced by regional politicians, instead of thinking about the community's best overall interests, they focus on the narrow minded issues of local politicians. So, our agitation is an attempt to voice the concerns of the entire community. If we unite, it will have a deciding impact.""Realising that quota protests will likely impact the poll outcome in most regions, and not just Marathwada, the govt has been on a tightrope walk on the matter. For example, the Dhangar agitation for inclusion in the ST category has compelled the govt to hold talks with everyone. Thus, in May, chief minister Eknath Shinde said the govt had ""walked the extra mile"" to grant 10% SEBC reservation to Marathas by distributing thousands of Kunbi certificates. But Marathas rejected it saying that the 10% quota is legally fragile and only reservation through OBC quota would be foolproof. This made Shinde and other Mahayuti leaders blame the opposition for not attending an all-party meet ""to build consensus"". Hake seems to have had the last word. He cornered Mahayuti saying, ""We'll ensure the victory of 50 MLAs who supported us in protecting the OBC quota. We'll inflict loss upon an equal number who colluded with the forces determined to end our quota.""MVA is keen on carrying the LS poll momentum in Marathwada but Jarange has not spared its leaders either, accusing them of letting down the community. A month ago, a group of Maratha protesters stopped NCP (SP) leader Sharad Pawar 's car in Barshi and shouted disruptive slogans during his rally. Some of them met him at his residence in Pune a day later and told him to clear his stand on the quota issue. On Oct 4, Pawar reiterated his stand that Marathas should be given reservation without disturbing the quota of other communities and said his party will support the govt if it brings an amendment and increases quotas to 75%. But Jarange insists on the inclusion of Marathas in the OBC category within the existing reservation. As for Hake, he trashed Pawar's proposal, calling it unconstitutional.Social activist and independent observer Vishnu Dhobale said caste agitation has become an easy way to establish political leadership: ""It takes attention away from common issues of public good. It will affect the poll manifestos of parties.""But state president of Sambhaji Brigade, Pravin Gaikwad, said the Maratha agitation will have limited impact on the assembly polls. ""Though caste rallies draw crowds, people don't necessarily vote on those issues as other calculations are involved. Thus, I feel the impact of the Maratha agitation will be limited. Economically, the Maratha community in Marathwada is weaker compared to those residing in western Maharashtra or Vidarbha. Therefore, the anger against established politicians is more in Marathwada, which percolates through votes.""","Protests by the Maratha, OBC and Dhangar communities in Marathwada are expected to cast a long shadow over voting patterns in the state. With internal tensions over issues like claiming credit for the Ladki Bahin Yojana already weakening Mahayuti, the ongoing quota dispute does not bode well for the BJP-led alliance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114263159,imgsize-913023,width-400,resizemode-4/114263159.jpg"

Threats for 10 aircraft in 1.5 days: AI & IndiGo international flights divert; AI to recover cost from pranksters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/threats-play-havoc-2-international-flights-diverted-ai-to-canada-government-promises-action/articleshow/114256881.cms,"NEW DELHI: The menace of hoax threat messages playing havoc with flight schedules and passengers continues unabated. On Tuesday, at least seven flights — including an Air India Delhi-Chicago flight that had to be diverted to a nondescript Canadian town of Iqaluit and IndiGo ’s Dammam-Lucknow to Jaipur — saw such threats after three on Monday when AI’s Mumbai-New York nonstop was diverted to Delhi for this reason.Checks revealed the four Tuesday threats — including for AI 127 Delhi-Chicago diverted flight; IndiGo’s 6E 98 Dammam-Lucknow diverted; Air India Express Jaipur-Ayodhya; SpiceJet ’s SG 116 Darbhanga-Mumbai and Akasa ’s QP 1373 Bagdogra-Bengaluru — were hoax. Threats for some of these flights were posted on X (former Twitter) from a handle — @schizobomber777 — that has been suspended now.As per protocol, after getting any threat aircraft — baggage and passengers — are thoroughly checked before being are released for next flight or continuing the journey. But on long hauls like AI’s affected nonstops of last two days, this means the same crew can’t operate the flight as they will breach their maximum duty time limitations and a fresh set of crew has to be arranged. Doing so in a remote Canadian town takes time. Providing for well over 300 passengers at a small airport that many flyers can’t even exit for hotels till alternate arrangements are made due to lack of visas is also an uphill task for any airline.Airlines are urging Govt to crack down on this menace that troubles passengers; disrupts schedules and costs a lot. Air India will “consider legal action against those responsible to recover damages incurred by the airline.”The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) had this June proposed to the Union aviation ministry that people people making hoax threats to flights and other aviation-linked infra be put on no fly list. However, this deterrent is yet to be put in place. A senior aviation ministry official said: “BCAS didn’t identity the relevant law to base this move on. We will work it out.”BCAS DG Zulfiquar Hasan Tuesday sounded a stern warning to all those issuing these hoax messages. “All standard operating procedures were followed. All our flights are safe and the Indian skies are absolutely safe. We are confident of tracing all those behind these threat messages and very strict action under law will be taken against all of them. Police across the country is cooperating in ensuring this happens.” Hassan ensured air travellers amid growing threats that “there is zero risk in flying.”An airline spokesperson said about Tuesday diversion: “Flight AI127 operating from Delhi to Chicago on Oct 15, 2024, was the subject of a security threat posted online and, as a precautionary measure, has landed at Iqaluit Airport in Canada. The aircraft and passengers are being re-screened as per the laid down security protocol. Air India has activated agencies at the airport to assist the passengers until such time that their journey can resume.”“Air India notes that it, and other local airlines, have been subject to a number of threats in recent days. Though all have subsequently been found to be hoaxes, as a responsible airline operator all threats are taken seriously. The inconvenience to customers is sincerely regretted. Air India is extending all cooperation to authorities in identifying the perpetrators of such threats to ensure that they are held accountable for the disruption and inconvenience caused to passengers, and will consider legal action against those responsible to recover damages incurred by the airline,” the airline added.IndiGo said in a statement: “Flight 6E 98, operating from Dammam to Lucknow, was redirected to Jaipur due to a security-related alert. The aircraft was isolated, and all passengers were safely disembarked. Ensuring the safety and security of our customers and crew remains paramount in all facets of our operations. We are working closely with the relevant authorities, and mandated checks are currently underway. We sincerely regret any inconvenience this situation may have caused our customers and appreciate their understanding.” SpiceJet and Akasa statements also said safety is paramount for them.","Airlines are urging Govt to crack down on this menace that troubles passengers; disrupts schedules and costs a lot.

BJP vs Hemant Soren in Jharkhand

NEW DELHI: The countdown for the high-stakes assembly elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand has begun with the Election Commission on Tuesday announcing dates for voting in the two states. While Maharashtra will vote on November 20, Jharkhand will see two-phase polling on November 13 and 20. The results for both the states will be out on November 23.After registering convincing victories in Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh and riding on the back of its impressive show in Haryana, the BJP-led National Democractic Alliance (NDA) will go all out to end the year 2024 on a winning note.The opposition INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) bloc, on the other hand, would hope that Haryana shocker was just a Congress-inflicted hiccup and it won't wash away their Lok Sabha gains.The Maharashtra electoral battle is all set to be one of the keenest this year. The state's politics has seen a lot of turbulence in the last 5 years - with allies becoming political foes and parties splitting down in the middle leading to changed power equations. There is a lot at stake for both the ruling Mahayuti and opposition's Maha Vikas Aghadi.The BJP and the undivided Shiv Sena had contested the 2019 assembly election as allies and had won a decisive mandate. The BJP had won 105 seats and the Shiv Sena 56. However, fight over the chief minister's post saw Uddhav Thackeray quit the NDA and join hands with NCP and Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The MVA went on to form the government under Uddhav's leadership.In June 2022, Eknath Shinde led a rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray and walked out of the party with most of the MLAs. He joined hands with the BJP to become the chief minister of Maharashtra and eventually got recognition as the orginal Shiv Sena. A year later, Sharad Pawar's NCP met with the same fate with his nephew Ajit Pawar leading the rebellion. The NCP also split eventually and Ajit Pawar joined the ruling Mahayuti as deputy chief minister.The 2024 Lok Sabha elections was the first electoral contest in the state after the changed power equations in the state. And the verdict was decisively in favour of the Maha Vikas Agadhi which won 30 out of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state. The Lok Sabha results gave the MVA both hope and confidence of defeating the Mahayuti again in the assembly elections. But as the Haryana elections show, Lok Sabha success is no guarantee of victory in state elections. The Eknath Shinde government has taken a leaf out of Nayab Singh Saini's success story template and has gone on an overdrive to woo all sections ahead of the assembly elections. Whether it can replicate Haryana BJP's success story or not we will know on November 23.The MVA will also hope to learn important lessons from the Haryana mandate - including the consequences of division of votes against the BJP. Confident after their Lok Sabha success, the three MVA allies have been struggling to arrive at a seat-sharing deal - with each party trying not to concede too much of space. The Haryana results have surely dampened Congress's spirits and the party may have lost some of its bargaining powers. The Maharashtra results will be important for the future of not just MVA but also the INDIA bloc, which has struggled to stay intact.In Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA, which has been in the opposition for the last five years, will faceoff with a confident Hemant Soren-led opposition alliance. The BJP has four former chief ministers in its ranks. Ironically though, the party's campaign in the state is being spearheaded by Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Union minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. They have gone hammer and tongs on the issue of Bangladeshi infiltrators threatening the existence of tribals in the state and their promise of implementing the NRC. While these issues may resonate in some of the districts bordering Bengal, it remains to be seen how much of an impact it makes in the rest of the state.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, on the other hand, has played his cards well till now. He has managed to return as chief minister after having to quit the post for a short jail term after the ED arrested him in an alleged money laundering case related to land scam. However, Soren has managed to use the case and the jail term to play the victim card and accuse the BJP of targeting him because he is a tribal. The Congress in the state lacks mass leaders and also a strong leadership and hence would continue to play second fiddle to the JMM.In the last assembly elections, the BJP lost despite leading a government in the state for five years. While the BJP could win only 25 seats, the JMM emerged as the single largest party with 30 assembly seats and went on to form the government with the help of its allies including the Congress. The JMM-led INDIA bloc made some gains in the Lok Sabha elections as well winning 5 out of the 14 Lok Sabha seats. It will hope to consolidate these gains further and return to power in the state.The results of Maharashtra and Jharkhand assembly elections will decide which of the two alliances take the pole position as they brace for the 2025 electoral battles starting from Delhi. A win for the BJP will further consolidate its Haryana gains while a win for the INDIA alliance will help the opposition bloc emerge from its Haryana shock.","The Election Commission on Tuesday announced dates for voting in the two states. Maharashtra will vote on November 20, Jharkhand will see two-phase polling on November 13 and 20. Results for both the states will be out on November 23.

"Maharashtra polls on November 20, Jharkhand votes on November 13, 20",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-polls-on-november-20-jharkhand-votes-on-november-13-20/articleshow/114266953.cms,"Midweek polling day to ensure voters don’t choose to travel: EC



NEW DLEHI: Election Commission Tuesday set the stage for another mouth-watering contest between BJP and its allies and their Congress-aligned rivals, announcing single-phase polls in Maharashtra on November 20 and two-phase voting on November 13 and 20 to elect the new Jharkhand assembly. Counting for both states, as well as 48 assembly and 2 Lok Sabha bypolls will be held November 23.The twin contests are crucial for both sides, with BJP keen to build upon the advantage it gained after a stunning victory in Haryana and Congress and its allies looking to regain the momentum from their im- proved LS performance.The two parliamentary bypolls are in Kerala’s Wayanad, from where Priyanka Gandhi will contest her first election, and Nanded in Maharashtra, which fell vacant after the death of sitting MP Vasant Chavan. While polling for 47 assembly seats and Wayanad will be held on November 13, the assembly seat of Kedarnath and Nanded LS constituency will vote on November 20.Bypolls due in Basirhat in Bengal and Milkipur in UP were not announced in view of pending election petitions. The vastly altered political landscape of Maharashtra since the last polls, with Shiv Sena and NCP splitting and Uddhav’s Sena leaving BJP to join forces with Congress makes the current contest an absorbing affair.In Jharkhand, the imprisonment of CM Hemant Soren and his dramatic comeback has sharpened the tribal versus non-tribal faultline, bringing a sharper edge to what should have been a traditional incumbent versus challenger showdown.“Elections are a festival of democracy and voters’ enthusiastic participation is desired and requested. We also appeal to the candidates to campaign fearlessly while honouring model code of conduct,” chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar, who was flanked by election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and S S Sandhu, said at a press conference to announce the poll schedule.The latest assembly polls come close on the heels of BJP making history by winning a third straight term in Haryana, dashing Congress’s hopes of voting it out based on what it had wrongly gauged a s a strong anti-incumbency sentiment. Congress’s alliance with National Conference did win J&K polls, but it was the latter’s show all the way with the national party contributing just six seats to the combine’s 48-seat tally.BJP-Shiv Sena-NCP alliance had suffered reverses in Maharashtra LS polls, managing just 17 of the state’s 48 seats, even as the alliance between Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) and NCP (Sharad Pawar) put up an impressive performance with 31 seats. This followed splits in both Shiv Sena and NCP midway through the five-year term, which enabled the BJP-led coalition comprising the breakaway factions to dislodge the Thackeray govt in 2022.BJP will look to turn things around in Maharashtra and wrest back Jharkhand from the JMM-led alliance, which has been saddled with corruption charges. In Lok Sabha polls earlier this year, BJP had bagged eight of the 14 seats in Jharkhand, while JMM and Congress managed three and two seats respectively.As many as 9.6 crore voters in Maharashtra, which includes 20.9 lakh first-time voters aged 18-19 years and 1.8 crore voters aged 20-29 years, will vote across 288 constituencies. In Jharkhand, 2.6 crore voters, including 11.8 lakh first-time voters, will vote across 81 constituencies.The poll schedule takes into account multiple festivals crowding Nov, including Diwali, Chhath and Dev Deepawali. EC scheduled the polls towards the end of the second week of November to give enough time for migrant voters from Bihar to be done with Chhath festivities and related travel to their hometowns.CEC said Wednesday was deliberately chosen for both polling days as it falls in the middle of the week and would make sure that voters don’t choose to travel out by clubbing the poll-day holiday with the weekend.For the second time, EC has restricted the phases in a state seen as a security challenge. After winding up J&K polls in three phases, the commission has carried the trend forward by bringing down phases in Jharkhand, affected by Left-wing extremism, to just two from five in 2019. This was made possible by the Centre’s decisive push to tackle Left-wing extremism in Jharkhand by liberating several areas of the state from the hold of Maoists.","Election Commission announces single-phase polls in Maharashtra on November 20. Two-phase voting on November 13 and 20 to elect the new Jharkhand assembly.

NEW DELHI : In a landmark verdict meant to demolish barriers on entry of people with disability in educational institutions, Supreme Court on Tuesday held that quantified disability per se will not disentitle a candidate from being considered for admission in educational institutions and they would be eligible for admission if Disability Assessment Board opines that the disability won't come in the way of pursuing a course of study.Rules, guiding admission to various professional courses, fix a benchmark of quantified disability and a candidate is barred from admission if the level of disability is above that. Like in the case of speech and language disability , a person with above 40% disability is not entitled to pursue MBBS study as per Graduate Medical Education Regulations. It allowed a plea of a student with 45% speech and language disability.Allowing a plea of a student with 45% speech and language disability whose dream to pursue study in medicine was blocked by the regulation despite cracking NEET , a Supreme Court bench of Justices B R Gavai, Aravind Kumar, K V Viswanathan said merely because of the quantification of the disability for speech and language at 40% or above, a candidate does not forfeit his right to stake a claim for admission to course of their choice. The court granted relief to the student after medical board told SC that his disability would not hamper pursuing medicine course.Justice Viswanathan said the decision to allow admission or not should be taken on the basis of a report by Disability Assessment Board which will specify whether the disability will or will not come in the way of the candidate pursuing the course. The court said that any decision taken by boards, which give a negative opinion for the candidate, will be amenable to challenge in judicial proceedings. The court said the boards should positively record whether the disability will or will not come in the way of the candidate pursuing the course in question and should give reasons in the event of coming to the conclusion.Justice Viswanathan said there is a need to have inclusive approach to bring differently-abled persons to social mainstream and give them opportunity to grow their potential to the fullest and reminded that the world would have been so much the poorer if Homer, Milton, Mozart, Beethoven, Byron and many more would not have been allowed to realise their full potential.Observing that it is the constitutional goal for the State to make effective provisions for securing the right to education including for persons with disabilities, the bench said an inclusive attitude will have be taken furthering the concept of reasonable accommodation recognised in the RPwD Act.",A person with above 40% disability is not entitled to pursue MBBS study as per Graduate Medical Education Regulations.
