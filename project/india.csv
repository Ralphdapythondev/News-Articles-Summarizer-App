Academic autonomy is under threat. At least in some states of India where the public university and colleges under it seem to be on the warpath over freedom. Of the 45,000-plus colleges across India, only about 995 are autonomous.The University Grants Commission (UGC) has been promoting autonomy for decades. But it has been an arduous long walk to self-rule.For one, autonomy is not uniformly spread across the country: states like Jharkhand, Manipur, Rajasthan and Goa have the lowest count of autonomous colleges with the largest pool in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.Secondly, academic autonomy in its truest sense is still uncommon, even though it is a proven fact that academic autonomy has an impact on performance in higher education . It is supposed to allow colleges to function without undue interference, allowing them to do what they do best: offer courses, alter curricula, innovate in teaching-learning and evaluate smartly. Yet, there are not many takers for it.From political interference and universities unwilling to let go of their powers to a sheer lack of ambition and confidence in going independent, colleges across the country are reluctant or slow to turn autonomous for a variety of reasons. This despite the fact of UGC’s repeated prodding of the states to encourage colleges to embrace independence.A recent note speaks volumes about what is taking place on the ground. “...Some universities do not allow complete autonomy to the autonomous colleges in the matter of designing syllabus, introduction of new courses, and evolving methods of assessment of students’ performance etc. as per provisions of the regulations. Certain universities ask the colleges to sign a MoU/agreement having terms and conditions against the provisions of the UGC regulations,” it said.Several principals in Kerala said universities discourage affiliated colleges from becoming autonomous as they “don’t want a high per forming college to move out from their ambit”. Given limited flexibility, colleges are not permitted to start new programmes or change the existing syllabus by more than 20%. Autonomous institutes are also penalised disproportionately for oversights such as misspelt names in result sheets.Worse still, despite all instructions having been fulfilled, universities often do not give approval to start new programmes or put colleges through a long-winding process that can take years. Several autonomous colleges have now approached Kerala High Court in order to obtain approval for new programmes. But even after HC’s nod, a college will have to pay high fees for getting the syllabus approved. For example, Mahatma Gandhi University charges Rs 57,890 for UG programmes and Rs 1.2 lakh for approving PG programmes from autonomous colleges.But it is the students that are the real sufferers in a clash of academic institutions. For instance, an autonomous college in north Kerala started five new undergraduate pro grammes in 2022, strictly adhering to UGC regulations of 2018 and submitting all necessary documents to the University of Calicut. Students admitted in those programmes have entered their fourth semester. But the university has yet to take any steps to give affiliation to or recognise these programmes. Since these programmes are not included in the university’s database, the college fears that the students admitted to these courses may be denied degree certificates after completing their course.Worse still, as the college doesn’t have the university’s certificate of affiliation for the five new programmes, NAAC has now sought a clarification from the college in this matter.Such examples point to the difficulties inherent in negotiating an autonomous path for colleges. Given the disconnect between university education and the jobs market, innovative courses through industry and sectoral linkages are clearly the need of the day. However, with state-run universities unwilling to ease up on their jurisdictional powers, the process of reform is likely to remain slow.Though autonomous colleges conduct exams, the degree certiﬁcate is awarded by the university. While results of examinations are published and intimated to the universities, there is a delay in issuing provisional and original degree certiﬁcates to autonomous colleges, which are penalised for minor mistakes, too. For instance, the university can impose a ﬁne of upto Rs 6,000 if a student’s name is misspelt by a college while the mistake is corrected only after much back and forth. Non-autonomous colleges are ﬁned Rs 50 and the mistake is immediately corrected.The faculty of an autonomous college is expected to attend the university’s evaluation camps. In case they don’t, an explanation is sought. “Our teachers are also asked to do double duty,” a college in Thrissur district wrote to UGC. It said they have to evaluate papers for the college, and also of university students studying in afﬁliated colleges that are not autonomous.Proposal by an autonomous college for a new course that is not offered by the university has to be ﬁrst presented to the college’s board of studies, which has a university nominee. Then, it is presented before its academic council, which has three university nominees. For ﬁnal approval, it is presented before the college’s governing body, which has a university nominee and a state govt nominee. Yet, when the revised syllabus is forwarded to the university, there is a reluctance to clear it. One reason being that there is often no university board of studies that can study the proposal, thus leaving the college in limbo.A university charges a one time afﬁliation fee/annual afﬁliation for existing programmes. But Calicut University charges higher fees for self-ﬁnancing courses. While the fees for self ﬁnancing courses introduced by autonomous colleges is Rs 1.2 lakh, for govt-aided programmes it is Rs 33,090.","Of the 45,000-plus colleges across India, only about 995 are autonomous. Autonomy is not uniformly spread across the country. The largest pool of autonomous colleges is in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Autonomous institutes are also penalised disproportionately for oversights such as misspelt names.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111501160,imgsize-27416,width-400,resizemode-4/111501160.jpg"

MMRDA has a 26% stake in the SPV, while Anil Ambani 's R-Infra holds 74%.There are six lenders in all: State Bank of India, IDBI Bank, Canara Bank, Indian Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, and IIFCL (UK).In March 2024, MMOPL signed a debt settlement agreement with the lenders, committing to pay Rs 1,700 crore as one-time settlement of its entire debt. As part of the agreement, MMRDA and MMOPL made upfront payment of Rs 171 crore to the lenders.On March 11, the state cabinet had cleared purchase of R-Infra's 74% stake in Metro-1 for Rs 4,000 crore by MMRDA. The buyout would have allowed MMOPL to exit the project. However, MMRDA said it could not finance the acquisition and requested state funding, which was denied, leading the state cabinet to reverse its purchase decision recently.Now, at a June 26 cabinet meeting, sources said, it was decided to ask MMRDA's executive committee ""to discuss the issue of the one-time settlement."" MMRDA was directed to take immediate action for implementation of the cabinet move, sources added.The MMRDA commissioner will soon convene a meeting with all six lenders of MMOPL to deliberate on the matter. Between April 2023 and June 2024, MMOPL has regularly paid interest to the lenders amounting to over Rs 225 crore.MMOPL was facing insolvency proceedings in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). IDBI Bank initiated insolvency proceedings in Oct 2023 over dues of Rs 133.37 crore, while SBI followed in Aug 2023 due to defaults amounting to Rs 416 crore. NCLT disposed of the insolvency cases after MMRDA paid Rs 170 crore, which is 10% of the one-time settlement amount.When contacted, an MMOPL spokesperson declined to comment. MMRDA officials were also unavailable for comment.Officials clarified that Metro Line 1, constructed at a cost of Rs 2,356 crore, was not making operational losses, but the financially troubled Anil Ambani group wanted to exit the project.The concession agreement between MMRDA and MMOPL was signed in 2007, and the corridor became operational in 2014.MMOPL was also engaged in arbitration against MMRDA over cost escalation during construction of Metro Line 1. While MMOPL claims it cost Rs 4,026 crore to build Metro Line 1, MMRDA maintains the cost is Rs 2,356 crore as per the original contract."," MMRDA has a 26% stake in the SPV, while Anil Ambani's R-Infra holds 74%.

For school and college students, July is a month of new beginnings. After the summer vacations that typically end in June, students return to school, ready to embark on a new academic journey. This period also coincides with the onset of the monsoon season in many Indian states.In terms of holidays, July has relatively few school breaks.Schools may declare holidays for special occasions, with Muharram being a notable one. Including weekends, students can expect a total of five off-days in July.Here's an overview-Muharram holds deep historical importance for both Sunni and Shia Muslims, as it commemorates the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, who was killed in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. This event, marked by the Day of Ashura on the tenth day of Muharram, is a time of mourning and reflection for the Muslim community. Muharram also marks the beginning of the new Islamic year.","Schools may declare holidays for special occasions, with Muharram being a notable one.

Sonia Gandhi's nudge puts Hemant Soren back in Jharkhand saddle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/sonia-gandhis-nudge-puts-hemant-soren-back-in-jharkhand-saddle/articleshow/111500162.cms,":

RANCHIHemant Soren was back in the saddle Thursday for a third stint as Jharkhand CM after an unannounced 5pm swearing-in bereft of ceremony and purportedly hastened by a prod from Congress’s parliamentary chairperson Sonia Gandhi .The former Congress president, whom Hemant called on June 30 after getting bail in the Ranchi land scam case two days earlier, is said to have convinced him to take charge quickly “in the interest of clarity within the JMM-led coalition”.Hemant will seek a floor test during a one-day assembly session scheduled for July 8 and expand his cabinet thereafter, JMM said.Both Raj Bhavan and the JMM rank and file had been given to understand after stand-in CM Champai Soren ’s resignation Wednesday that Hemant would prefer to take the oath of office on June 7.The apparent change in plan was conveyed to governor C P Radhakrishnan’s secretariat Thursday morning and made public barely two hours before the swearing-in.JMM said 5pm was an ""auspicious mahurat"" for Hemant's return. Since it was too late to send out invitations, the event at Raj Bhavan's Durbar Hall took place before an audience of barely 100 people, including the three-time CM's predecessor.""He (Hemant) had been asked to intimate a date and time for the swearing-in. On Thursday morning, we received a letter saying the new CM would like to take oath at 5 pm, and it was arranged accordingly,"" a Raj Bhavan official said.ED's plan to move Supreme Court against Jharkhand high court's acceptance of Hemant's bail plea may have been a factor in Hemant advancing the swearing-in.When they spoke last week, Sonia apparently told Hemant that the only way to prevent ""dual power centres"" was for him to take back the chief ministership.Hemant first became CM in July 2013, retaining the post till Dec 2014. His second stint started on Dec 29, 2019, but was cut short hours before his arrest on Jan 31 this year. Champai, whom he picked as his successor, took over on Feb 2.Hemant's father and JMM patriarch Shibu Soren, his newly elected MLA wife Kalpana Murmu Soren, Jharkhand Congress president Rajesh Thakur, former ministers of Champai's cabinet, and MLAs of INDIA bloc attended the swearing-in.Hemant and his wife visited Sidho-Kanhu Park in Morabadi later to pay tributes to tribal revolutionaries Sidho and Kanhu Murmu.""They (NDA) tried to stop our march by hatching a conspiracy and development projects stalled for a few months.

Additionally, the miserable governance of the previous administration marked by malice, corruption and mis-governance has dealt a more deleterious blow to the state than the bifurcation,” said a source.During his meet with the PM, Naidu sought Centre’s “financial handholding” to tide over the crisis and focus on investments in specific projects and backward regions. He argued that there was “no other way to face such a challenge”.The list of items for which Naidu has sought the Centre’s “cooperation” runs into several pages — covering short-term assistance as well as an additional allocation under the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment, meant to build core infrastructure.Besides, project-specific support to build the govt complex and trunk infrastructure in Amaravati, which was chosen by Naidu to be the capital after the loss of Hyderabad to Telangana, the Polavaram irrigation project and development of Duggirajupatnam port also figure in the list.Naidu also met home minister Amit Shah, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, oil minister Hardeep Puri, power minister Manohar Lal, agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and 16th Finance Commission chairman Arvind Panagariya and had specific demands from each of them, including projects and release of funds that are due to the state.For instance, when he met Puri, he demanded that state-run BPCL set up an oil refinery in the state, in line with the AP Reorganisation Act of 2014, and suggested that an announcement by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman would “augur well” for increasing the refinery capacity in the country.During his meeting with the home minister, the Andhra CM flagged division of assets with Telangana as an issue, along with bifurcation of several institutions and a resolution of financial issues between APGENCO, the power generation company, and Telangana power discoms.Similarly, Naidu suggested to Manohar Lal that Vizag Kakinada should be promoted as a green hydrogen hub and sought Gadkari’s help for road projects. In his meeting with Goyal, he sought grants for building infrastructure in four industrial nodes.","Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu came calling to the Capital with a long wish list.

"Isolate and expose States that back terrorism, PM Modi tells SCO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isolate-and-expose-states-that-back-terrorism-pm-modi-tells-sco/articleshow/111496160.cms,"PM Narendra Modi ’s address to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ), the security-oriented Eurasian bloc which held its annual summit in Astana Thursday, was replete with messages to Pakistan and China as he sought a decisive response against cross-border terrorism - calling upon all to shun double standards – and backed connectivity linkages that respect territorial integrity .PM Modi did not participate in the summit but, in remarks delivered through foreign minister S Jaishankar who filled in for him, he sought to allay apprehensions about India’s commitment to the group saying in a world moving inexorably towards real multipolarity, the SCO will only become more important and that it occupies a prominent place in India’s foreign policy. However, he added its true value would depend on how well the member-states cooperate amongst themselves.Without naming Pakistan, the PM called for action to isolate and expose countries that harbour terrorists, provide safe havens and condone terrorism. ``Cross-border terrorism requires a decisive response and terrorism financing and recruitment must be resolutely countered. We should also take proactive steps to prevent the spread of radicalization among our youth,’’ he said, adding if left unaddressed, cross-border terrorism can become a major threat to regional and global peace.Significantly, while strongly condemning terrorism, SCO’s joint statement called upon the international community to seek consensus on the adoption within the UN of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) as an “important contribution to the existing base of universal international counter-terrorism instruments”. CCIT was first proposed by India to UNGA in 1996 but it couldn’t be adopted because of differences over the definition of terrorism.Addressing the participating leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, PM Modi said terrorism ranks foremost for many member-states as it continues to be used by nations as a tool of destabilization. Reminding the Organisation that combating terrorism was one of its original goals, Modi said that the SCO must never waver in its commitment. ``We cannot have double standards in this regard,’’ he said, in remarks aimed at China, which has blocked UN ban on Pakistan based operatives of proscribed terror groups.In another message to China and Pakistan, he reiterated India’s position that connectivity and infrastructure projects must not undermine sovereignty and territorial integrity. India remains the only SCO member-state to not endorse China’s BRI because its ``flagship’’ project CPEC passes through Gilgit-Baltistan in PoK. India was also the only member-state to not endorse the SCO Economic Development Strategy 2030 announced last year.PM Modi said connectivity linkages must be respectful of sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and be built on the foundation of non-discriminatory trade and transit rights to neighbours. Pakistan continues to deny India land access to Afghanistan and Central Asia. Modi mentioned the progress made on Chabahar port recently in the form of a long-term agreement between India and Iran, saying it not only holds great value for landlocked Central Asian states but also de-risks commerce between India and Eurasia.The PM said that SCO is a principle-based organization, whose consensus drives the approach of its member states. ``At this time, it is particularly noteworthy that we are reiterating mutual respect for sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, equality, mutual benefit, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force or threat of use of force as a basis for our foreign policies. We have also agreed not to take any measures contrary to the principles of state sovereignty and territorial integrity,’’ he said, while expressing hope for a consensus in the group on the need for reform of the current global order, including the UNSC.","PM Modi did not participate in the summit but delivered remarks through foreign minister S Jaishankar who filled in for him.

'Not much scope ...': Why Congress said 'no' to alliance with Arvind Kejriwal's AAP in Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-much-scope-why-congress-said-no-to-alliance-with-arvind-kejriwals-aap-in-haryana/articleshow/111494075.cms,"Haryana faceoff

Failed experiment

First Mamata, now Kejriwal

No pan-India formula for INDIA bloc

United at Centre, divided in states

NEW DELHI: The Congress has formally announced the end of its uneasy and unsuccessful alliance with Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party. The two parties, which had joined hands for Lok Sabha elections in Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat and Goa as part of opposition's INDIA bloc , will now faceoff as rivals in upcoming assembly elections.""There does not appear to be much scope for an alliance between the Congress and the AAP for the assembly polls in Haryana and Delhi but the INDIA bloc will fight elections together in Maharashtra and Jharkhand,"" Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said on Thursday.AAP had already announced a month back that it will not extend its alliance with the grand old party in the assembly elections.The first fallout of this political separation will be felt in Haryana, which goes to polls later this year. The Congress fancies its chances in the state elections after an impressive performance in the Lok Sabha polls. The grand old party, which could not open its account in 2019, won five out of the 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state with a vote share of 43.67%. The Congress managed to severely dent the BJP , which could win only 5 seats - half of its 2019 tally, despite a change in state leadership and a higher voteshare of 46.1%. Kejriwal's AAP, with 3.94% of voteshare, was a distant third in the state in the national elections.In the 2019 assembly elections, the Congress had put up an impressive show winning 31 out of 90 seats with a vote share of 28.08%. This was more than double its 2014 tally of 15 assembly seats. The BJP, on the other hand, could not manage to win majority on its own and managed only 40 assembly seats with a vote share of 36.49%. In 2014 assembly elections, the BJP had won 47 seats. The Aam Aadmi Party could not win any seat in 2019 and managed only .48% of vote share in the state.The Congress, which has seen its performace improve in the state since the last assembly elections, is perhaps confident of further gains and does not want to accommodate Kejriwal's party. Aam Aadmi Party’s Haryana unit has already drawn a 90-day roadmap for an aggressive promotion of party's achievements in Punjab and Delhi in all the 90 constituencies of the state. The BJP, on the other hand, will hope that a divided opposition will help it regain some lost ground in the upcoming assembly elections.The short-lived Congress-AAP alliance failed to make any impact in Lok Sabha elections. In Delhi, the two parties could not even open their account. They failed to prevent third consecutive clean sweep by the BJP which won all the 7 seats in the national capital. The Congress went ahead with the alliance despite a very strong opposition from its state leaders and in the process even lost some of them to the BJP. In other states also where the two parties contested together there was not much of gains. On the contrary, in Punjab, where the two parties decided to contest as rivals, Congress won 7 seats out of 13 and the AAP managed 3. This despite the fact that AAP has a government in Punjab and its chief minister Bhagwant Mann had all along claimed that it will sweep out the Congress in the state.For the Congress, strong regional leaders present both an opportunity and also a challenge. In Lok Sabha elections, the Congress successfully aligned with the likes of Akhilesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, MK Stalin in Tamil Nadu, Tejashwi Yadav in Bihar and Hemant Soren in Jharkhand. However, the grand old party failed to join hands with Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal. In fact, the two parties engaged in open war of words through the elections. Mamata fought the elections alone and defeated not just the BJP but also decimated the Congress. Kejriwal will be second key leader of INDIA bloc with whom the Congress has now refused to stich an alliance. Both Congress and AAP, which has gained the status of a national party, have high stakes in assembly elections and feel going solo will be more beneficial for them.The Congress today made it clear that alliances in states under the INDIA banner would be on a case-to-case basis and there will be no one formula for tie-up. Where state Congress leaders and the respective alliance parties agree, there will be an alliance, the grand old party said outlining the principle for future tie-ups. ""In states where the circumstances are such that our leaders of the state and leaders of our alliance partners want, the alliance will remain. In Maharashtra, the alliance will be there with Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SCP). In Jharkhand, we have an alliance with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha,"" Jairam Ramesh said.The internal contradictions of the INDIA bloc are already in display in states like West Bengal, Kerala and Punjab - where Congress is a political rival of its national alliance partners. All these states have seen the INDIA bloc partners attack and target each other - giving fodder to the BJP which has all-along called the INDIA bloc an opportunistic alliance.","The Congress has formally announced the end of its uneasy and unsuccessful alliance with Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party.

"Redouble disengagement efforts, LAC peace essential: Jaishankar to Wang",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/redouble-disengagement-efforts-lac-peace-essential-jaishankar-to-wang/articleshow/111496177.cms,"Foreign minister S Jaishankar in a meeting with his counterpart Wang Yi called for redoubling military and diplomatic efforts to achieve complete disengagement in the remaining areas in eastern Ladakh, as India and China agreed the prolongation of the current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side. Jaishankar told Wang respecting LAC and restoring border peace and tranquillity is essential for removing obstacles towards return of normalcy in Sino-Indian bilateral relationship, which PM Narendra Modi recently described as important for the entire region and the world.Jaishankar met Wang on the margins of the SCO summit in Astana Thursday.While they met briefly at the Munich Security Conference in February this year, their last formal bilateral meeting was in Jakarta in July 2023.In line with China’s position that progress in bilateral ties is not stymied by the border issue, Wang sought ``positive thinking’’ in the form of efforts on one hand to manage the situation in the border areas and, on the other, to ``actively resume’’ normal exchanges on the other. This never sat well with India’s position that there can’t be normalcy till the time disengagement is fully completed in eastern Ladakh.India and China have achieved disengagement at 4 points in the western sector, since the ongoing standoff erupted in May 2020, but the same has remained elusive in Depsang and Demchok areas even after 21 rounds of military and 15 rounds of diplomatic talks . China sees these as legacy issues that predate the current standoff.During the ``in-depth’’ exchange of views for early resolution and rebuilding of ties, Jaishankar reaffirmed the importance of fully abiding by relevant bilateral agreements, protocols, and understandings reached between the two governments in the past. ``The Line of Actual Control must be respected and peace and tranquillity in the border areas always ensured,’’ said the Indian side in its readout, adding India and China agreed to step up meetings to address the remaining issues. Another round of diplomatic talks is expected soon.Jaishankar reiterated India’s position that mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interest – the 3 mutuals – will guide bilateral ties.Before Modi opted out, the SCO summit was seen as the first opportunity for both sides to consider a meeting between him and President Xi Jinping, who have not had a formal bilateral meeting since 2019, after the return of the NDA government. The leaders, who did meet informally at the BRICS summit in Johannesburg last year and at G20 in Bali 2022, are now expected to come face to face only in October at the BRICS summit in Russia in October. While discussing regional and global situations, Jaishankar also told Wang India will support China’s upcoming presidency of SCO.After an 18-month hiatus, the longest since the restoration of ambassadorial relations in 1976, China finally appointed a new ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, in May this year. In April this year, in an interview to Newsweek, Modi called for urgently addressing the prolonged situation on the border to do away with the abnormality in ties, adding stable and peaceful relations between India and China are important for not just the 2 countries but the entire region and world.According to a Chinese readout, Jaishankar told Wang India follows an independent foreign policy, the concept of multilateralism, and will safeguard the common interests of developing countries.``China and India, both countries in the ""Global South"", should work together to oppose unilateral bullying, resist camp confrontation, safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and make due contributions to regional and world peace, stability and development,’’ said the Chinese statement.",India and China agreed the prolongation of the current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side.

Distributed Exams: Distributed Exams to Prevent Paper Leaks: AIU President,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/distributed-exams-to-prevent-paper-leaks-aiu-president/articleshow/111497890.cms,"NEW DELHI: Advocating for “distributed exams”, the new president of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU), Vinay Pathak , has emphasised that “over-centralisation” of any test can lead to significant adverse issues and a single exam should not determine the future of a student.In light of the NEET-UG controversies and paper leaks , and the decision to revert to the pen-and-paper mode for UGC-NET and CUET-UG, Pathak, also the vice-chancellor of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University (formerly Kanpur University), in an exclusive interaction with TOI, discussed the future of exams .He advocated for technology-driven adaptive testing, similar to the GRE and TOEFL, as a “progressive solution”. He also stressed that in addition to entrance tests, university admissions should incorporate multiple evaluation methods, including Board exam scores, group discussions, and personal interviews.While the govt considers adopting a JEE-style online test format for entrance exams conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), Pathak highlighted the drawbacks of centralisation. “Over-centralising exams, where a single test determines a student’s future, is fraught with risks. In engineering, for instance, moving from single-threaded to distributed systems improved reliability because if one part fails, others can still function. Similarly, decentralised exams could localise the impact of any single point of failure, like a paper leak,” he said.Pathak highlighted adaptive testing as a promising solution, explaining that it adjusts to the test-taker’s ability level in real time. “Technologies like AI can create personalised tests that are both secure and fair. Tests like the GRE and TOEFL have successfully implemented adaptive testing, minimising the chances of leaks and ensuring a more accurate assessment of student abilities,” he said.Limiting students to a single exam can be detrimental, leading to undue stress and even mental health issues, Pathak pointed out. “That’s why you’re seeing lots of depression during medical entrance tests and many suicides. While multiple exams have their own pressures, they also release pressure differently,” he added.Multiple chances allows students to perform to their potential across, mitigating the impact of a bad day. “Exams like JEE-Mains, which now allow multiple attempts, provide a useful model,” he said.Pathak stressed that admissions based on a single entrance test score are not ideal. Instead, he suggested that “a comprehensive evaluation system should combine various metrics, including standardised test scores, academic performance, recommendations, and personal interviews. This approach, used by top universities globally, offers a more rounded assessment of a student’s capabilities.” He pointed out that entrance exams currently test whether students know what the examiner knows, not what the students know.Regarding the recent issues of paper leaks and irregularities in major exams, Pathak emphasised the importance of maintaining the integrity of the exam process. “Public trust in the system can be bolstered by transparency and consistent performance from testing agencies. As seen with exams like JEE Advanced and UPSC, when the process is perceived as fair, it garners respect and confidence from students and society alike,” he said.","Vinay Pathak is the new president of the Association of Indian Universities.

NEW DELHI: India and Australia on Thursday discussed closer collaboration in the Indo-Pacific region , as part of their expanding strategic ties , during a telephonic talk between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Richard Marles.A range of issues pertaining to bilateral defence cooperation were reviewed, including the need for greater cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, in the backdrop of China’s expansionist muscle-flexing in the region.“We place great value on the India-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership,” Singh said.The two ministers noted the “transformative progress” in defence cooperation and the momentum achieved in the ties since the last bilateral two-plus-two ministerial dialogue in Nov 2023. Australia has described India as a top-tier security partner in its National Defence Strategy document released earlier this year.During the dialogue, India and Australia decided to strengthen their overall defence-strategic ties, including cooperation in information exchange, maritime domain awareness and niche areas like AI, cyber, anti-submarine and anti-drone warfare. Marles had then stressed that China was “the biggest security anxiety” for both India and his country, while also being their largest trading partner.","India and Australia discussed closer collaboration in the Indo-Pacific region.

"Agnipath will 'degrade' combat power & operational efficiency of military, say several officers & veterans",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agnipath-will-degrade-combat-power-operational-efficiency-of-military-say-several-officers-veterans/articleshow/111500969.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the political slugfest over compensation paid to Agniveers who die in the line of duty, several serving military officers and veterans say the overriding critical concern that the Agnipath scheme will “degrade” combat effectiveness and operational efficiency is being ignored despite the clear and present threats posed by China and Pakistan.It takes seven to eight years for a soldier, sailor and airman to become fully combat-ready, with the requisite hands-on experience, but 75% of the Agniveers from each batch will be demobilised after four years under the scheme rolled out in June 2022.While this will especially hit the IAF and Navy, which are more technology-intensive, the Army will also be impacted. “The very nature of warfare is changing with rapid technological advances. Why should the armed forces spend precious time and money training Agniveers to handle sophisticated weapon systems, missiles and machinery when the bulk of them will go after four years,” a top officer told TOI.Moreover, the over-stretched Army is already facing a shortage of combat-ready soldiers, which will get further accentuated with each passing year without tweaks in the Agnipath scheme. Around 60,000 soldiers retire every year, while the annual intake of Agniveers is limited to 40,000 at present.Given that the govt is unlikely to scrap the radical Agnipath scheme, which is primarily aimed at slashing the ballooning salary and pension bills, the armed forces want the retention rate of Agniveers to be raised to at least 50-60% from the existing 25%, among other tweaks, based on surveys and feedback from their units.Admiral K B Singh, who retired as the Navy chief in Nov 2021, in a post on ‘X’ on Thursday, said, “The only motivation driving Agnipath is reducing the pension bill. The fact that this scheme will degrade combat effectiveness is known to all who understand national security.”Another former Navy chief, Admiral Arun Prakash (retd), in turn, said “Economics (must) take a back seat to national security. The sole litmus test for any change or reform in the military must be: “Does it enhance or degrade combat effectiveness?”There should be concern about the “huge operational handicap” being imposed on combat units forced to accept “barely trained recruits fit only for sentry duties”, he added. Agniveers, incidentally, receive a truncated basic training of six months instead of the around 11 months for regular soldiers earlier.Other military chiefs and top officers also criticise Agnipath on several counts. Former Army chief Gen M M Naravance, who retired in April 2022, of course, has already said the Army had initially proposed only “a limited number (10%)” of jawans should be enrolled for the short-term service.But the PMO directed that not only should the entire intake (100%) be on a short-service basis, but it would apply to IAF and Navy as well. Later, the Army also argued that 75% of the recruited jawans should be retained, but to no avail.A senior Army officer said the Agnipath scheme was already creating “fissures in the all-important cohesion, camaraderie and regimental spirit” of battalions. “There are now two classes of soldiers, the Agniveers and the regular ones with higher salaries and annual leaves as well as pensions. There is also unhealthy competition emerging among Agniveers to prove their suitability to be retained as regular soldiers. If the Constitution can be amended over 100 times, what is the harm in tweaking Agnipath?” he said.","It takes seven to eight years for a soldier, sailor and airman to become fully combat-ready. 75% of the Agniveers from each batch will be demobilised after four years under the scheme rolled out in June 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111500964,imgsize-92260,width-400,resizemode-4/111500964.jpg"

He won the Ghazipur seat on a Samajwadi Party ticket in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.According to the Representation of the People Act, any MP or state legislator sentenced to imprisonment of two years or more shall be disqualified ""from the date of such conviction"" and remain disqualified for another six years after serving time.Earlier, an MP-MLA court of Ghazipur had on April 29, 2023, convicted Ansari and sentenced him to four years in jail and also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh in the Gangsters Act case.Following this, Ansari was disqualified as MP.

Delhi Zoo: Delhi Zoo implements ayurvedic methods to safeguard animals during monsoon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-zoo-implements-ayurvedic-methods-to-safeguard-animals-during-monsoon/articleshow/111494209.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Zoo authorities are using ayurvedic methods, including neem oil, turmeric and quicklime, to keep the animals healthy and free from bacterial and viral infections during the rainy season . As the monsoon season sets in, Delhi Zoo is taking innovative steps to ensure the health and safety of its animals by incorporating traditional ayurvedic methods.""The monsoon has entered the capital and we have to take all necessary measures to keep the animals healthy and safe during this season. We will use some Indian home remedies like neem oil, which will help protect the animals from common biting insects, including mosquitoes, biting midges and fleas,"" Delhi Zoo Director Sanjeet Kumar told PTI.Neem oil acts as an herbal disinfectant and fly repellent, said Kumar, turmeric, known for its anti-inflammatory and healing properties, will be used to treat itchy skin conditions, infections and wounds. Turmeric dust will be applied to lesions and foot sores to expedite healing, he said.Heavy rains often lead to waterlogging in certain parts of the zoo which create breeding grounds for mosquitoes. To counter this, quicklime (chuna) will be sprinkled in these areas to prevent mosquito proliferation.""We are using quicklime in waterlogged spots to stop the growth of mosquitoes and keep our animals safe,"" the official said.After the heavy rains that lashed the national capital on Friday, recording 228.1 mm of rainfall in just 24 hours - the highest in June since 1936 - the Delhi Zoo was also affected.A power failure occurred when floodwaters breached the zoo's boundary wall from the Sundernagar side, inundating the substation area and causing damage to the transformer.This incident affected animal enclosures, administrative offices and staff quarters. Referring to this situation, Kumar said that measures have been taken to prevent a recurrence.""The broken boundary is being repaired and barriers are being installed to prevent water backflow, ensuring water does not reach the animal enclosures,"" he said.Additional measures include providing elevated platforms in areas prone to water accumulation, ensuring animals have dry spots to rest.""The director also mentioned that we will purchase an additional generator dedicated to essential uses such as gate operation, Wi-Fi, control room, CCTV operations and animal enclosures for water pumping during rainy periods when electricity is cut off,"" said Kumar.The official also said that Delhi Zoo presently has two generators: one for the animal hospital and another for operational needs throughout the facility, with the third generator to be allocated accordingly.He emphasised the importance of preparing for rain-related health issues by stocking necessary medicines.The National Zoological Park, also known as Delhi Zoo, is situated in a 176-acre area under the central government's jurisdiction.","Neem oil acts as an herbal disinfectant and fly repellent.

"Bihar bridge collapse: Petition in SC seeks highest level structural audit of all existing, under construction bridges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bihar-bridge-collapse-petition-in-sc-seeks-highest-level-structural-audit-of-all-existing-under-construction/articleshow/111476261.cms,"Supreme Court (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court urging the Bihar government to conduct a structural audit of all existing and under-construction bridges in the state.The petition, submitted by advocate Brajesh Singh , highlights the urgent need for this audit following multiple bridge collapses in Bihar within just two years. The petition seeks to identify and either demolish or retrofit weak structures to prevent future incidents and protect public safety.Advocate Brajesh Singh raised the issue on Wednesday, emphasizing that three major under-construction bridges and several other bridges have collapsed recently in Bihar.He noted the severe consequences of these incidents, including fatalities and injuries, and underscored the potential for future collapses due to government negligence and corrupt practices.""It is a matter of grave concern that in a state like Bihar, which is the most flood-prone state of India, the total flood-affected area in the state is 68,800 sq. km which is 73.06 per cent of the total geographical area. Hence such routine accrual of the incident of falling bridges in Bihar is more disastrous as the lives of people at large are at stake. Therefore the urgent intervention of this Hon'ble Court is required to save the lives of people, as the under-construction bridges before its accomplishment collapsed routinely,"" the petitioner said.Singh also requested the Supreme Court to direct the Bihar Government to establish a real-time monitoring system for both old and new bridges, based on guidelines developed by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India. These guidelines, issued on March 4, 2024, mandate the use of sensors for real-time health monitoring of bridges, particularly those under National Highways and Centrally Sponsored Schemes, and should be applied to state-level bridges as well.""The petitioner has also sought to issue direction to respondents specifically Bihar for making an efficient permanent body through legislation or executive order, comprising high-level experts from the concerned field for continuous monitoring of all the existing and under-construction bridges in Bihar and also for maintaining the comprehensive database on the health of all existing bridges in the state,"" the petition stated.The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) enumerated various bridge collapses, primarily river bridges, in districts such as Araria, Siwan, Madhubani, and Kishanganj. Singh's petition underscores the critical need for immediate action to ensure the structural integrity of these infrastructures, which are vital for the state's connectivity and safety.The plea highlights that without thorough and proactive measures, further collapses could result in more tragic loss of life and property, especially in a state prone to heavy flooding. This call for action aims to mitigate such risks and safeguard the residents of Bihar from future bridge-related disasters.","A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court urging the Bihar government to conduct a structural audit of all existing and under-construction bridges.

However, the BCCI has not yet provided their approval for the proposed schedule.The Champions Trophy is planned to take place from February 19 to March 9, with March 10 designated as a Reserve Day.It is believed that PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi who attended the T20 World Cup final in Barbados as an invitee, has submitted a schedule consisting of 15 matches. All of India's games have been allocated to Lahore, citing security and logistical considerations.""The PCB has submitted the draft of the 15-match ICC Champions Trophy. Seven games in Lahore, three in Karachi and five in Rawalpindi,"" an ICC Board member said.""The opening match will be held in Karachi with two semifinals in Karachi and Rawalpindi, final in Lahore. All India matches (including semifinal, if the team qualifies) in Lahore,"" the source added.India find themselves in Group A, alongside their traditional rivals Pakistan, as well as Bangladesh and New Zealand. Meanwhile, Group B features cricketing powerhouses Australia, South Africa, England, and the rising Afghanistan team.In a recent development, Chris Tetley, the ICC head of events, held a meeting with Mohsin Naqvi in Islamabad. This meeting took place following a comprehensive inspection of the venues and other arrangements by the ICC's security team.Pakistan's most recent experience hosting a major cricketing event was the Asia Cup in 2023. The tournament was conducted using a unique 'Hybrid Model' due to the Indian government's refusal to allow its players to travel across the border into Pakistan. As a result, India's matches were played in Sri Lanka, while the rest of the tournament took place in Pakistan.""All board chiefs of the ICC Champions Trophy participating countries (minus BCCI) have assured him of their complete support but BCCI will consult its government and update the ICC,"" the source added.The ICC finds itself in a challenging position, as it lacks the authority to compel any cricket board to act in opposition to its government's directives.

BMRCL: Silk Board Double-Decker Flyover: Commuters Demand Immediate Opening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/double-decker-flyover-awaits-vip-launch-commuters-irked/articleshow/111443589.cms,"BENGALURU: Commuters facing daily traffic woes at Silk Board junction have one demand: Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd ( BMRCL ) must open to motorists the lower deck of the rail-cum-road double-decker flyover between Ragigudda and Silk Board and three ramps at Silk Board junction without further delay.They argue that if the road infrastructure is ready, there should be no reason for delaying the opening, as formal inauguration by VIPs shouldn’t be a priority.Last year, BMRCL had to drop its plans to formally launch two stations of the Purple Line at Challaghatta and Benniganahalli after public outrage. The stations were operationalised and virtually inaugurated at a later stage.As part of Yellow Line Metro, BMRCL has built a 3km road-cum-rail flyover from Ragigudda to Silk Board. Initially, BMRCL planned to open the road infrastructure to vehicle users by the end of 2023, but the deadline was revised to May 2024 and then pushed to June. It is said the Metro authority is awaiting approval from the central and state govts, both partners in BMRCL, to set a formal opening date.While the lower deck was ready 1.5 years ago, construction of the ramps at Silk Board junction was finished recently. At present, the infrastructure is partially ready to accommodate traffic flow from Ragigudda and BTM Layout side to HSR Layout and Hosur Road. Work to ready the flyover to accommodate traffic flow in the opposite direction will take another year for completion.The alignment of the flyover passes through Jayadeva hospital junction, where the city’s tallest Metro station — providing interchange facilities for the upcoming Yellow and Pink lines — has been built. At Silk Board, BMRCL has built three ramps traversing over a flyover located at the junction. These ramps will allow motorists coming from Ragigudda and BTM Layout to reach HSR Layout (ORR side) and Electronics City (Hosur Road) without stopping at the signal.In 2016-17, BMRCL modified the design of the elevated Metro corridor to accommodate the city’s first double-decker flyover. The road infrastructure has cost Rs 449 crore.Those travelling from Jayanagar and Bannerghatta Road to Silk Board endured daily traffic snarls for years during the construction work. In 2019, BMRCL demolished the Jayadeva flyover to facilitate the work, and traffic diversions were put in place for years.Transport minister Ramalinga Reddy, who also represents BTM Layout assembly constituency, said, “As per the information I have, the road infrastructure is ready. BMRCL is waiting for consent from the ministry of housing and ministry of urban development for its formal inauguration. The road flyover and ramps at Silk Board will ease congestion on this busy corridor. Once the ramps from HSR Layout towards BTM Layout get ready, congestion will drastically come down at the junction.”BMRCL officials remained tight-lipped on the issue. A senior official simply stated, “The date of opening the road infrastructure will be communicated shortly.”","BMRCL has built a 3km road-cum-rail flyover from Ragigudda to Silk Board.
