What is our fault if groom flees before marriage: MP CM on Cong candidate's withdrawal in Indore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-our-fault-if-groom-flees-before-marriage-mp-cm-on-cong-candidates-withdrawal-in-indore/articleshow/110047512.cms,"INDORE: Taking a dig at the Congress over its Indore Lok Sabha seat candidate withdrawing from the fray at the last moment, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav has said it was not his party's fault if the ""bridegroom fled before the wedding"". The Congress received a jolt in Indore after its candidate Akshay Kanti Bam withdrew his nomination on April 29, the last date of withdrawal, and later joined the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ).""The Congress claimed that the BJP did something wrong in Indore. What was our fault? It is like inviting the entire village to the wedding feast and the groom running away before the marriage ceremony,"" Yadav said at the BJP's campaign rally at Betma near here on Saturday.The opposition party, which has no candidate left in the fray for the May 13 election in Indore, is insulting democracy by appealing to local voters to press the NOTA (None Of The Above) button, the chief minister said.""If someone's child runs away from home, whose fault is it? They are your children, you should take care of them,"" he said.Yadav also participated in a roadshow in Indore city in support of BJP candidate and sitting MP Shankar Lalwani.Terming the opposition INDIA bloc as ""Ghamandiya"" alliance, Yadav evoked the epic Ramayana and the city of Lanka, the capital of its arch-villain Ravan.""These arrogant people were born in Lanka 17 lakh years ago during the time of Lord Ram. Due to the bankruptcy of their intellect, they posed as fake saffron-clad (monks) to abduct Sita,"" the chief minister said during the roadshow.Calling upon the voters to reject the Congress' appeal to opt for NOTA, he said, ""Mother Sita made the mistake of crossing the 'Lakshman Rekha,' but the people of Indore should resolve that they will not cross the Lakshman Rekha under any circumstances.""Taking a swipe at state Congress president Jitu Patwari, who hails from Indore, Yadav said after suffering defeat at the hands of BJP candidate Madhu Verma in Rau seat in the district in the last year's assembly elections, Patwari was scared of contesting the Lok Sabha election.On the other hand, even some 80-year-old Congress leaders were contesting the election, he added.Referring to Congress leaving the Khajuraho Lok Sabha constituency to the Samajwadi Party as part of a seat-sharing agreement, Yadav claimed that it showed the Congress was afraid of elections.","Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav has said it was not his party's fault if the ""bridegroom fled before the wedding"" The Congress received a jolt in Indore after its candidate Akshay Kanti Bam withdrew his nomination on April 29, the last date of withdrawal, and later joined the BJP.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110047607,imgsize-786428,width-400,resizemode-4/110047607.jpg"
‘Will fulfil PM’s vision of Viksit Bharat’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-fulfil-pms-vision-of-viksit-bharat/articleshow/110047198.cms,"BJP, candidate from Kanpur City Lok Sabha seat, Ramesh Awasthi, is upbeat about the party’s prospects and is confident that the party would come out with flying colours in the elections. In an interview with Rajiv Srivastava, he rubbished claims of being an “outsider” and said that he would work for ‘Viksit Kanpur’ on the lines of PM Narendra Modi’s ‘ Viksit Bharat ’ call. Excerpts:





How is your poll campaign progressing?

What is your agenda for the Kanpur Lok Sabha seat if you win the polls?

Opposition parties are claiming that you are an outsider as you belong to Farrukhabad, and you were seeking a ticket from Banda earlier. What do you have to say?

Were you not elected student union president of a degree college in Farrukhabad?

Your nearest rival and Congress candidate Alok Misra is from Kanpur. Of the five assembly constituencies falling in Kanpur City Lok Sabha constituency, three assembly constituencies have MLAs from Samajwadi Party, including Mohd Hasan Rumi from Kanpur Cantt, Amitabh Bajpai from Aryanagar and Haji Irfan Solanki from Sisamau. How will you overcome these challenges?

How will you check the division of votes of specific castes?

People are saying you are overconfident. Is it so?

It’s going well. The people-friendly schemes started by PM Narendra Modi have reached the ground level. The common man is very excited.I will work for ‘Viksit Kanpur’ to fulfil the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Viksit Bharat Mission, 2047. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath want all-round development of Kanpur. My aim is to restore the past glory of the city.Congress had raised this issue.Is Rahul Gandhi contesting from Rae Bareli as an outsider or a native of Rae Bareli? What is the actual definition of an outsider? I have been residing in Kanpur since 2010. I did my LLB in 1996 from Kanpur. Since then, I have also been active in Kanpur student politics. I have my home in Swaroopnagar locality of Kanpur. I organise programmes like mango parties and Holi Milan in which people and members of all parties participate.It is true that I was into student politics in Farrukhabad. There is no doubt that I was born in Farrukhabad, and I completed my initial schooling there. Lekin meri karmbhoomi Kanpur hai (my workplace has been Kanpur). Since 2010, I have been residing permanently in Kanpur. I am a member of the BJP working committee representing Kanpur for the last five years. This issue is only being raised through the media.There is no doubt that three assembly constituencies are with Samajwadi Party. There were some issues due to which the SP MLAs won from these three seats by a narrow margin. But in the last Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won from Aryanagar assembly segment. The BJP also won mayoral elections. We are now regularly winning from these seats. In Lok Sabha polls, the candidate’s role also becomes significant. In the last general election, Congress had two prominent faces, Shriprakash Jaiswal and Ajay Kapoor. Now that Ajay Kapoor is in BJP, he has come with his vote support and Jaiswal is no longer active in politics. Congress is left with nothing.There is no impact of the Opposition candidate in the city. Name one leader from any caste who is supporting the Congress candidate. Barring his family vote, the Congress candidate will not even get the support from the staff of the school which he owns.There is feedback that the BJP local unit is not happy with you.This claim is baseless. I am a member of the BJP working committee from Kanpur. Each office-bearer of the district unit is with me. Can anyone name even one organisation office-bearer not working to ensure the victory of BJP in Kanpur?No BJP worker is overconfident. We say what we see on the ground. Each voter is with Modi and Yogi in Kanpur. We have good support in Sisamau and Aryanagar. In other areas, things have improved after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s roadshow.","Ramesh Awasthi, BJP candidate from Kanpur City Lok Sabha seat, is upbeat about the party's prospects.

‘Idol of Ram Lalla ended India’s North-South divide’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/idol-of-ram-lalla-ended-indias-north-south-divide/articleshow/110047197.cms,"With his deep devotion and proficiency in his ancestral sculpting business, MBA-turned-master sculptor Arun Yogiraj , who has attained the status of a celebrity after giving shape to the Ram Lalla idol , talks about the uphill task, sacrifices he had to make to realise India’s dream and how it has helped bridge the North and South divide in an interview with TOI’s Ankur Tewari. Excerpts:





How has the perception of people and your family changed after Jan 22 ‘Pran Pratishtha’ ceremony? Do they treat you like God?

How has life changed? How have you taken all the accolades coming in?

While carving the most-awaited idol, did you experience added pressure due to the debate over the North-South divide ?

Today, devotees worldwide are thanking PM Narendra Modi for making Ram temple possible. What’s your take?

You recently shared with fans the photo of the second Ram Lalla idol. What was the idea behind carving another idol? Which stone was used and where will it be kept?

While carving out the idol, did you have any idea it would be the lucky one?

If given a chance, will you settle down in Ayodhya, the town which has given you so much fame?

Today, everyone is showering praise on Arun Yogiraj, the man behind Ram Lalla idol. Tell us something about those who worked behind the scenes — your family?

Which other projects are you working on?

They are giving me immense love and respect. Though my family is proud of my achievement, I am still the same Arun for them. But, when I venture out, it’s a different world. The amount of love I am getting from people is overwhelming... Their love for Ram Lalla and me is the same.I was lucky that Lord Ram chose me for His idol. I also want to thank my ancestors and parents for knowledge transfer.Due to them, the whole of India recognises me today and wants to see me, talk to me and embrace me. But I want to remain grounded and give back all the love to my family and fans.I gave special attention to detail to ensure that the idol did not reflect aesthetics that were typically South Indian as I wanted to encapsulate the whole of India in it. I had to make a lot of changes so that North Indian devotees don’t feel disconnected.... Now, it is interesting to see some people are finding a resemblance of Venkateswara Swami and others comparing the idol with that of Krishna’s in Gujarat and Mathura. This proves that the idol has ended all the divide. The only division today is geographical and different ways of life.Lord Ram has been re-seated in his grand temple in Ayodhya after five centuries. Generations of generations left with the same wish, but it was PM Modi who realised this dream. Today, the world is recognising Bharat’s global march as a spiritual and cultural powerhouse under PM Modi. The youth is also driven towards our culture and heritage and it’s only due to two legends — Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath . Great leadership I must say.When my idol got selected on Dec 29 last year, I was asked to stay in Ayodhya to coordinate the ‘vastra’ and ‘abhushan’ that Ram Lalla had to wear on the consecration day. Since I had no work, I carved the mini Ram Lalla from Krishna shila — the same stone from which the main idol was sculpted – out of fun. I later presented it to Champat Rai, general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra.Tell us something about the sublime eyes of Ram Lalla which took the world by storm?Aacharya Ganesh Shastri of Kashi had given me just a 20-minute ‘mahurat’ to carve the retina before taking a holy dip in the Saryu river and offering prayers at Hanuman Garhi and Kanak Bhawan in Ayodhya. My only thought at that moment was to ensure the eyes mesmerise the devotees as they would be seeing the idol from a distance of around 30ft. I think Lord Ram guided me. He wanted the divine eyes to be like this.I just concentrated on my work. I gave my best and God chose me. But it was a lot of pressure. I really burnt the midnight oil and left no stone unturned to give shape to Ram Lalla idol as the whole country was waiting with bated breath. While carving the idol, I had almost lost one of my eyes when a tiny piece of stone pierced the cornea. I was on antibiotics for weeks. A lot of sacrifices had to be made during the course of giving shape to the idol. First, I had to do a lot of homework. I went through around 1,000 images of Ram Lalla to ensure the best result. I followed all rituals every day, avoided sugar and spices to stay calm. Every day, it was taking a new shape, but the Lord guided me.I don’t think of all these things. But, if Lord Ram wants me to do his ‘sewa’, I will bow to his wish. However, I love Mysuru too.My wife has always supported me through thick and thin. It was difficult for her to stay away from me. At times, my kids fell ill but she did not inform me. I am blessed to have her as she is the one who has kept me composed. She has played a key role in Ram Lalla idol and all credit goes to her.No project will ever be bigger than Ram Lalla. Presently, I am busy completing backlog and will be able to take new projects later.","MBA-turned-master sculptor Arun Yogiraj has attained the status of a celebrity after giving shape to the Ram Lalla idol.

"When will Madurai, Trichy wake up?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-will-madurai-trichy-wake-up/articleshow/110047138.cms,"TRICHY/MADURAI: The recent mauling of a girl in Chennai by two rottweilers is yet to serve as a wake-up call for Trichy and Madurai which do not have regulations for rearing pet animals. Many foreign dog breeds considered as aggressive and ferocious are reared in these cities. Civic bodies are now waiting for the model code of conduct to be lifted to tighten rules.According to the animal husbandry department , Trichy district has 24,505 pet dogs and 20,988 stray dogs .Residents point out that some people take along even multiple pets for morning walks. “Most owners bring their pet dogs out with leash. But muzzles are needed as walkers and joggers are using the public space,” Shabbeer Hussain, a resident of KK Nagar, said.Madurai residents and animal activists have called upon the corporation to bring comprehensive rules for pet dog registration and hold a survey of the dog population. Corporation officials said that a resolution on dog ownership has been passed and rules are to be formulated into a bylaw after the general election.However, enforcement of existing rules remains lax with many residents unaware of the necessity of a licence. A senior veterinarian pointed out that licences are primarily used only by breeders, activists and trainers. Every year dog owners have to renew their dog registration with the corporation after paying the tariff based on the number of dogs they own.A pet licensing system would help the urban local body collect data on the number of pet dogs and breeds reared. Besides, the system would help the animal husbandry department to ensure anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) coverage for all pet dogs. In Trichy, the department has administered ARV to 11,554 pet dogs in 2023-24. Officials said that the licensing system will help differentiate between pet dogs and stray dogs.Madurai corporation plans to eact bylaws on pet ownership, including ban on straying of certain breeds in public places, mandatory registration and muzzling requirements while the pet is taken to the public places including parks. S Vasuki, zonal chairperson of Madurai East, rued the absence of a clear rule governing dog ownership. “Many adopt street dogs without understanding the responsibility involved. Some abandon pets when they pose a threat to public safety, such as biting incidents,” she added.“Licensing should be introduced initially for foreign breeds. For better regulation, breeding and sales of rare dog breeds should be brought under GST,” K M Karthik, Trichy-based animal volunteer, said. “We will introduce the pet dog licensing system by passing a resolution in the council. The process will take shape once the election model code of conduct is lifted,” Dr T Manivannan, city health officer, said.pup-rottweiler near Mattuthavani market.

Meet the foster moms who are opening their hearts and homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-the-foster-moms-who-are-opening-their-hearts-and-homes/articleshow/110046567.cms,"It is one thing to

a child you have given birth to or adopted, and quite another to love and care for someone who may be with you for only a few months or years. This Mother’s Day, three foster carers talk to Neha Bhayana about why it’s important to take in

who would otherwise languish in a shelter or orphanage.

‘His parents are missing but till then I get the joy of raising him’

Leela Jedia | Has one foster child

‘We have raised five children. We can love one more’

Liji Thomas | Has 5 biological children and 1 foster child

‘I can never forget the day when my younger foster son called me aai’

Jyoti Patwardhan | Has two foster kids

This Mother’s Day is special for Leela Jedia.The Chittorgarh-based government school teacher had yearned to be a mother for years. Her wish came true on January 10 when she got six-year-old Rihaan* home from a local institution through a foster-care scheme. Rihaan’s biological parents have gone missing, so the district authorities had decided to place him with a foster family. States are slowly trying to deinstitutionalise care for children who are not eligible for adoption as it is considered better for the child’s development to live in a family set-up.Leela knows Rihaan may be taken away from her someday, but she is happy to be his mom till then. “If he is reunited with his parents, it will be good. But till then, I feel blessed to experience the joy of raising a child. He has completed our family. Hear him say ‘mamma’ is a beautiful feeling,” says the 55-yearold, adding that they will be happy to have him forever if his parents are not found.The Jedias had applied to adopt a child but they have been on the wait-list for years. When they learnt about kids who spend years in shelters because they are not eligible for adoption or are not getting adopted, they approached theFoster Care Society, Udaipur, for support.Now, when Leela returns from work every evening, Rihaan runs to open the door and the duo then spends the evening playing and doing homework. Rihaan knew very little compared to most six-year-olds, so Leela has been teaching him colours, the names of fruits and vegetables as well as basic manners like not making noise while chewing food. “I cook different subzis daily as I want him to develop a taste for all vegetables. He is not fond of sweets though, unless we get his favourite gulaab jamun,” she says.They have enrolled Rihaan in a reputed English-medium school and engaged a tuition teacher as well to help him reach on par with other kids in his class.Leela hopes to bring home one more child, ideally a girl, via adoption or foster care. “All couples who are financially stable should foster a child, even if they have biological children. Children who stay in orphanages have to move out when they turn 18. At that point, they have to suddenly face the world outside. When they are with a family, we educate them, teach them good values, and make them competent enough to live in the world,” she says. “Hum ek bache ki life bana sakte hai and khud bhi maa baap hone ka sukh pa sakte hai (we can make a child’s life better and also experience the joy of being parents.)”Most couples feel overwhelmed with the responsibility of even one or two children. But Kozhikode residents Liji and Bijo Thomas felt blessed to have five kids. In fact, when their eldest daughter — she is 25 and their youngest is 13 — got married and moved to Kanpur last year, Liji felt a void. Since they are not eligible to adopt as they already have biological children, they applied for foster care via the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) and brought a 12-year-old boy home in January after due procedures. Seventeen children have been placed in long-term foster care in Kozhikode so far.Sahil’s* parents were unable to care for him due to confidential reasons and had voluntarily put him in a government-run children’s home four years ago. They gave consent for placing him in foster care too. Liji is happy they got the opportunity to look after Sahil. “We have the experience and the resources which come from parenting five children so we thought why not take in one more child and let him also benefit from what we had learned over the years. A child growing up in an institution has very little chance of understanding how society or family functions. If you do not experience love when you are growing up, you will never be able to give love,” she says.While Liji works as a medical writer, Bijo is a software developer. They both work from home. When Sahil joined the family, they realised he did not know how to read or write and did not even understand basic concepts like right or left, front or back. Liji and Bijo started teaching him from scratch. Within three months, Sahil started to read Malayalam and has memorised four long poems and several songs. “Sahil’s papers had stated that he has an intellectual disability but I don't feel that’s the case. I feel he’s just been neglected,” says Liji. She is also training Sahil to conduct himself appropriately and encouraging him to participate in household chores like all their kids. “He is 12 but did not even know how to wear a belt, so we taught him. Now he can dress himself independently. He is learning something new every day and feels so proud of himself,” says Liji.Though the family does not celebrate Mother’s Day, Liji says she feels special daily, thanks to the love and hugs she receives from her children. “My kids are very affectionate. Sahil tends to be a little distant in comparison but whenever I praise him, he smiles widely. He loves it when I put my arm around him or give him a hug; he hugs back immediately and I can sense that he is happy,” she says.Liji wishes more families would volunteer to foster. “We see a lot of children who are neglected and sadly, we call them anti-social elements but it is not their fault. They have not been given the right direction. I feel if we all raise children to be people who are good and who do good, the world will be a richer place. That’s a small contribution we can make,” she says.Jyoti Patwardhan was nervous when she brought two boys, aged seven and nine years, to her home in 2020 via Maharashtra’s foster care programme. The consumer court judge, who is single, had always wanted a girl, so she didn’t know if she would feel love for the brothers who were offered to her and she was also concerned about the adjustment issues they may face. But all her doubts vanished on the first night itself. “While Vihaan* slept peacefully, the younger one Ved* tiptoed into my room and asked if he could sleep next to me. When I nodded, he crept into the bed, looked up with innocent eyes and asked if he could call me ‘aai’. I can never forget that moment. I was so touched. All my worries melted away and I knew I had made the right decision,” says the 50-year-old Akola resident.When Jyoti met the official handling their foster care arrangement a few weeks later, she got to know that while other kids at the shelter used to demand chocolates or toys, Ved always said “mujhe mummy chahiye” (I want a mother). The brothers had been put in the institution by their biological mother as she was unable to look after them.They recently became ‘legally free’ for adoption so Jyoti has applied to adopt them — a foster parent can seek to adopt the child after two years together. “My world is complete with my sons and my only aim is to raise them to be good men,” says Jyoti who has no plans to get married. She revealed that Vihaan hopes to join the military when he grows up — he is inspired by the photographs he has seen of Jyoti’s father who was a captain in the army and grandfather who was the first flight lieutenant of India.Jyoti is certain her sons will have a grand surprise planned for her on Mother’s Day. “They go out of their way to celebrate my birthday and Mother’s Day. They decorate the house, get a cake and buy me clips and earrings from the money collected in their piggy bank,” she says.*Names changed to protect identity.","This Mother's Day, three foster carers talk to Neha Bhayana about why it’s important to take in children who would otherwise languish in a shelter or orphanage.

The toughest part of managing teens is getting through to them: Maria Goretti,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-toughest-part-of-managing-teens-is-getting-through-to-them-maria-goretti/articleshow/110046561.cms,"She is a Cordon Bleu chef who has hosted several popular food shows on television. She’s also a poet whose book won the PragatiE Vichaar Award for English poetry last year. When you mention Maria Goretti, however, everyone still remembers her as the bubbly MTV VJ of the ’90s. She spoke to Neha Bhayana about dealing with teens (she is mom to 19-year-old Zeke Zidaan and 16-year-old Zene Zoe) and why her husband Arshad Warsi is a more chilled out parent.

You took a break from work after kids. Was it difficult to be a stay-athome mom after years of working?

At what point did you decide to get back to work and what led you to becoming a chef?

I am sure your kids loved sampling the dishes you experimented with when you were honing your skills …

The toddler years or the teenage phase — what is tougher to handle?

What’s the toughest part of dealing with a teen?

As kids grow up, they don’t need mom as much anymore. Did you find the change difficult to deal with?

Disciplining a teen can be difficult. What’s your trick for getting them to listen to you?

What are your rules regarding screen time?

Arshad has this image of being a bindaas guy on screen. Is he the same at home, with kids too?

What upsets him?

What are these altercations about?

When it comes to parenting, are you and Arshad on the same page?

What values have the two of you tried to instill?

Arshad mentioned in an interview that he is not a star at home, nobody gives a sh** about him and nobody likes the work he does.

Zeke looks a lot like his dad. Does he too have an inclination to act?

A lot of moms and dads try to be the child’s friend, not the parent. Do you think that’s a good idea?

What are you strict about — any ground rules for the kids?

Do marks matter to you?

■ We’ve seen you in many avatars.Which has been the toughest role?The mom. I think being a parent is the toughest because there are no rules to follow. Each child is different, and each day is different. You wake up and you have no clue how the day is going to pan out. You have to find your way and figure out what suits you and your child the best. We were brought up in a certain way and we feel that’s how we’re going to bring up our kids. But things were very different then. Televisions were not the norm, forget computers. Today, every child is given an iPad or smartphone. It is tough to help kids navigate their life and try to put in the right kind of thoughts and actions into them. I clearly remember when my son was really small, I saw to it that he didn’t have too much sugar, maida or processed food. But when he went to school and everyone else’s dabbas opened, he realised there is so much more available than what mum is giving me. He would bring tiny pieces of his friends’ food and beg me to make them. That’s how it is. I feel that as a parent you are just trying all the time. What works for one child will definitely not work for other kids. So, I think we have to practise bespoke parenting . There is so much trial and error. You have to just figure out whether you can teach your children to make the right choices and pray that they do.No, I loved it. I started working when I was 17 years old and I wanted to stay home and enjoy my kids. I don't know whether what I did was right or not. I saw a lot of my peers go back to work immediately after having kids. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. But I was very happy sitting at home and looking after them. I enjoyed everyday things and had a lot of fun with them.Was cooking always a passion? Not at all. I started learning how to cook because I had to feed my kids, and then I realised how much fun it is. I felt the need to learn and understand how things work so I decided to study food. In 2011, I went to the Tante Marie Culinary Academy in London and did a certificate course in culinary, bakery and boulangerie. In 2018, I went to Le Cordon Bleu, Paris and London, and did a diploma in patisserie. Meanwhile, I did a book on food and recipes and did a few food shows on television. People started calling me to do food-related stuff. So, it was a very organic thing. I’m not someone who can plan things. I do what comes to me naturally. I have been writing poetry for a long time too. Whatever comes through in life is what I'm part of.They did. They loved the risotto I made and there was this one muffin they always wanted. I would hand roll the pasta too, so they were exposed to a lot of different kinds of food.The teenage phase is way tougher. When moms I meet tell me they want to get back to work, I always ask them how old their child is. I feel when kids are small, they just need to be fed and kept safe and they’re not going to go anywhere. It’s easier to look after them. When they are older, they can look after themselves but there is so much more that you have to stay attuned to. I do go out and work, but I end up calling them more often than when they were little. You have to ask them so much — ‘How was your day? Why are you not looking like your happy self today? What is going on?’ The issues they are dealing with become complex.I think just getting through. They are going through a lot but unless they tell you exactly what they're going through, you are never going to know. Some things they want to share with their friends and not with you, and I feel that is okay. But they are the same age and navigating the same emotions, so they need a safe place to vent. Schools have introduced counsellors and I think that’s very important.It does pinch. I missed the cuddles and adoration with which they look at you when they are little. Teens look at you like you don’t even know what you’re talking about (laughs). But I am also happy to have the freedom to do what I like.I have not yet learnt how to discipline a teen. I have no tricks. Sometimes, I'm successful. Sometimes, I am not. They're 16 and 19. They have a mind of their own. Most of the time, we come to a compromise. Some things I have to let go of. It’s amazing how when we are bringing up our children, we want them to be assertive and vocal but when they enter their teens all that you have wanted them to be suddenly poses problems because they are trying that out on you. So, you are their first guinea pig.Frankly, I am not the most successful parent while I am navigating their teens. I do make mistakes. But I am always open and willing to go and say, “Listen, I'm really sorry. I think I overreacted. I could have handled this better. Let’s try and figure out how to do this.” I have realised that parents are not perfect. We are also learning. So, I feel it’s okay to say sorry when you've messed up.I also tell my kids, “You have to live with the choices you make. At the moment, you have a choice to study, to do well, to go ahead, whatever you do. If you don't make that choice and you don't use that, you lose that privilege of education. This period will pass and then you will be the one left behind.” I also remind them that I am older than them and do know a little more. But then they look at me and roll their eyes (laughs).Before the pandemic, I used to get really upset when they were on the phone for long. But during the lockdowns, we had to give them phones and laptops to attend online school. They were in front of the screen for seven hours daily. After that, it became very difficult to say, “Put your phone away”. The whole system changed. They even had to do assignments online. Now, there is no chance that they don't have a phone and laptop as part of their body. I’m sure that half of their body fluids flow through those things (laughs).He is a very chilled out dad actually. He is very cool till they really piss him off.I think disrespect is what really, really upsets him. They are very lovely children but sometimes teens get so adamant. They feel what their parents are telling them is total rubbish and they absolutely have no idea. So, if we feel that something is harmful for them, then Arshad really puts a stop to whatever it is.But he rarely gets upset because he’s not involved in the nitty-gritties of their everyday lives. He has a different equation with them. He has chats with them about life, work, about basic humanity and all of that. But the fact of the matter is that their everyday life is looked after by me. I am more hands-on which is why I have more altercations with them.It is the usual stuff. I am after them to pick up their towels or cups or books. Frankly, I actually don't like this role because I also want to have fun with them. But somehow, I am the one who’s constantly telling them this is right and that is wrong. It’s a bit much. Sometimes, I want to let it all go to dust. But then they’re your kids, you don’t do that.No, there are lots of differences. If I am saying east, he is definitely saying west or north. I have made my peace with this though. I guess we have different approaches to parenting because Arshad grew up in a boarding school and I grew up at home with parents. The kids know the gap, and they sometimes slip in the middle. They are very smart.We always tell them to be respectful to everyone, to treat everyone well, to be kind and generous. We tell them to not treat someone in a good fashion or a bad fashion depending on who they are and where they come from. They need to treat everyone with love and respect.I think he was just being funny. Of course, he is not treated like a star at home. Nobody is pulling chairs out for him or rushing for his au tograph. That is a given. This is his home and if he does not get treated like a normal dad at home, it would be a cuckoo situation.I have no clue about what he wants to do. He's in college and he’s studying. He does what any teen does. He goes out, hangs out with friends, sometimes he goes to dance classes, sometimes he is doing some fitness thing. I have always told the kids to do whatever they wish to do, as long as they are happy with it and able to make a living with it. I think he is in that phase where he’s also figuring himself out.I can’t be their friend. They already have their friends. But they don't have any more parents. So, I am their parent.Sometimes, I feel like I’m strict about everything. And sometimes I feel I’m strict about nothing. Every day with parenting is different. I just go with the flow. If I don’t, I'll drive myself insane.I think education matters. More than anything else, it is the discipline of education that really makes a difference. When my kids were younger, they were doing very well. Today, they want to do different things on the side besides their education. I feel that whatever their line of interest, they need to put 300% into that. I've always told them that education is a very big part of life, and it has to be done. You cannot just say I like dancing so I am going to stop everything and just dance. Of course, you can dance, but you also need education. And, education is there for a very small period of time. What you do in school and college shapes you. You may not use that education in the profession you choose later on, but the fact is what you do in those years — with your institute, your friends and your professors — plays a very important role in your life. You get a lot unknowingly; a lot more than your degree or diploma.",Maria Goretti is a Cordon Bleu chef who has hosted several popular food shows on television.

On April 22, BJP's Mukesh Dalal was declared elected unopposed from Surat after all other candidates, including one from the BSP, withdrew their nominations.Due to a pre-poll alliance with Congress, the AAP had not fielded its candidate from Surat.

She demanded Bose’s resignation, declaring that even sitting beside him felt sinful to her. “One more kelenkari (scandal), deed after deed, scandal after scandal.Who are you to torture Bengal’s women?” she asked Bose.The CM’s remarks came in response to a former Raj Bhavan staffer’s allegation that Bose had molested her within the premises. Kolkata police claimed on Friday that they had obtained CCTV footage from Raj Bhavan’s PWD wing, depicting the complainant leaving the premises “dishevelled and in tears” on May 2.Banerjee announced her refusal to visit Raj Bhavan again. “If you call me to the street (outside Raj Bhavan), I will meet you there. From what I hear about your deeds and scandals, it would be a sin to even sit beside you,” she said during a rally in Hooghly’s Adisaptagram.She described Bose as a person “with little shame” at her second rally in Howrah’s Jagatballavpur. “I want to say that this is not a one-off incident. Mothers and sisters, I know of several incidents (happening) over a considerable period of time. He occupies an important post and that is why it is unseemly to say everything. But women are now feeling scared to meet him. I would rather meet you on the footpath than go to your residence. Not one but many women have been abused.

We will act decisively and take back PoK,” Shah said.Shah’s remarks at an election rally in Chevella, Telangana , were in response to Aiyar’s statement that Pakistan has the nuclear bomb and therefore a cautious approach has to be adopted.Shah said the late former PM Atal Behari Vajpayee had conducted the Pokhran-2 nuclear test. The first was conducted by Indira Gandhi’s govt in 1974.The home minister also scoffed at Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy’s remarks that the surgical strikes on Pakistan “did not even kill a crow”. “PM Modi’s swift decision had resulted in terrorists in Pakistan getting wiped out in the surgical strikes,” he said.Later in the day, he told reporters that after the BJP-led NDA forms govt at the Centre for a third time, it would make sure the 4% reservation for Muslimsin Telangana is scrapped.“The fact is that reservation for Muslims is affecting the reservation for other sections, so we will scrap them,” he said. He also said Congress and BRS were spreading canards that BJP was against reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs. “We have never said we will remove reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs,” he said in Hyderabad.On the final day of campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections in Telangana, which goes to polls on May 13, Shah said, “Whichever party is in power, it is AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi who holds the steering wheel.

NEW DELHI: The campaigning for the fourth phase of Lok Sabha elections , scheduled for May 13, came to an end on Saturday evening followed by the commencement of a 48-hour silence period. A total of 1,717 candidates are in the fray for the lower house of Parliament from 96 constituencies across 10 states and Union Territories.During the runup to the fourth phase of polling, PM Modi continued his onslaught on Congress over the issues of corruption and wealth redistribution.Meanwhile, the opposition INDIA bloc stuck to its 'save democracy' plea, and got a major morale boost after the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal till June 1.All 25 seats in Andhra Pradesh and 17 constituencies in Telangana will go to polls in this phase. Polling will also take place in 13 seats in Uttar Pradesh, 11 in Maharashtra, 8 in West Bengal, 8 in Madhya Pradesh, 5 in Bihar, 4 each in Jharkhand and Odisha as well as one seat in Jammu and Kashmir.All eyes will be on UP's Kannauj as Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav is in the fray from this seat. The former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh will be contesting against Bhartiya Janata Party's Subrat Pathak.Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress' leader Mahua Moitra will also be contesting from the Krishnanagar constituency. Hyderabad is also bracing itself for the big showdown between Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Madhavi Latha and sitting All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen MP Asaduddin Owaisi for the Lok Sabha election.The run up to the fourth phase polling saw the Election Commission and Opposition INDIA bloc entering into a spat over delay in release of voter turnout data. The poll body accused Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge of creating impediments in the conduct of free and fair elections and said that Kharge's allegations are unwarranted, without facts and ‘reflective of a biased and deliberate attempt to spread confusion’.During the campaigning, Congress chief Kharge and Rahul Gandhi also targeted Prime Minister Modi after he accused the grand old party of receiving ""tempo loads of money from Adani and Ambani"" in exchange for Gandhi's silence on the issue.Former Congress president replied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's allegations and challenged the PM to initiate a CBI or ED investigation into the matter.Moreover, Prime Minister Narendra Modi continued his onslaught against the INDIA block and attacked the Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray factions of NCP and Shiv Sena and claimed that ""duplicate NCP and Shiv Sena"" have made up their minds to merge with the Congress after the June 4 Lok Sabha election results.Additionally, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal got a huge relief amid the ongoing Lok Sabha elections as Supreme Court granted him bail till June 1 for campaigning. Kejriwal has been lodged in Tihar Jail in an alleged money laundering case in connection with the now-scrapped Delhi Excise policy.The Lok Sabha polls are set to unfold in seven stages over a 44-day period.

But the HC wanted to strike a balance.It held that the Mumbai suburban collector was justified in 2013 in cancelling the non-creamy layer certificate issued to the student Lubna Mujawar as an OBC category candidate.The Lokmanya Tilak Medical College at Sion had then cancelled her admission to the MBBS course, in Feb 2014. But the HC said due to the passage of time and as she, based on interim orders that allowed her to study, completed her course in 2017, she should now be conferred with the degree. Under the interim orders which were in operation from Feb 2014 onwards, the petitioner has completed the course of MBBS and, therefore, it would not be proper at this stage to withdraw the qualification obtained by the petitioner more so when the petitioner has qualified as a doctor, the court said.The HC said the student gained admission on her father giving false information and not disclosing that the mother worked for the municipal corporation. The HC directed the student to now pay the fees as an open category student for the course, within three months, and also additionally pay the college Rs 50,000.In 2012, based on a petition seeking inquiry into OBC admissions in MBBS courses based on non-creamy layer certificate an inquiry was conducted against all students who had been admitted.The petitioner, Lubna Mujawar, said since her father had given her mother a talaq, he did not mention her income on the certificate. The MUHS said he falsely stated they were not staying together to avoid being hit by the Rs 4.5 lakh income limit for non-creamy status. Such practice would set a wrong precedent, argued MUHS counsel RV Govilkar and state's lawyer Abhay Patki."," Bombay HC held that a student wrongly gained admission to an MBBS degree course in a top Mumbai college as an OBC on a non-creamy layer certificate based on false and suppression of information. But observing that doctors are needed, did not cancel her admission as she had completed the course.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110043012,imgsize-1444118,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110043012.jpg"

Speaking at an election rally in Bargarh, western Odisha, Modi asked, “You tell me who runs the BJD govt. Do you know that the entire govt has been outsourced? There is a super-CM who is above MLAs elected democratically and the CM elected by MLAs. Do you want Odisha to fall into the hands of someone who doesn’t understand Odisha?

Stating that the countdown for a BJD govt in Odisha had started, Modi said, “Gaje Baaje ke Saath Vida Kijiye (Send them packing on a celebratory note).”Claiming that Odisha’s culture is in danger under the current BJD govt, Modi said many eminent Odia personalities, such as Veer Surendra Sai, Gopabandhu Das, Harekrushna Mahtab and Biju Patnaik, must be very sad seeing the state of affairs. “Odia asmita (self-respect) can’t be mortgaged to someone like this,” he said, an indirect reference to Tamil Nadu-born VK Pandian’s rise in BJD.",Modi claims that Odisha is controlled by outsiders who have taken over the state in the last five years.

Congress tried to frighten our own people citing Pakistan N-bombs: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-buyers-for-desperate-pakistan-trying-to-sell-nuclear-arsenal-pm-modi/articleshow/110042630.cms,"BHUBANESWAR: PM Narendra Modi claimed on Saturday that Congress was trying to instil fear among Indians by emphasising Pakistan possesses nuclear weapons but now “the situation in Pakistan is such that it’s not even in a position to handle the bombs they have”, reports Ashok.Pradhan.“They are out to sell the bombs. They are looking for buyers. They are unable to sell,” Modi said, adding, “Because of Congress’s weak approach, people in Kashmir suffered from terrorism for 60 years.”Later, speaking in Jharkhand and attacking Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in particular, Modi said the number of seats Congress would win would not even equal Gandhi’s age.In Odisha, recalling that India conducted nuclear tests (Pokhran 2) on this date (May 11, 1998), when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was PM, Modi claimed that it was for the first time after Independence that people across the globe looked at an Indian leader with the utmost respect. India’s first nuclear test was conducted by Indira Gandhi’s govt in 1974.Speaking at an election rally at Phulbani, under Kandhamal Lok Sabha seat, Modi said: “This was the day when India demonstrated its strength to the world.” He added, “On the other side, there is the thought of Congress party. Time and again, Congress tried to frighten our own country. They say be cautious. Pakistan has atom bombs. These dead people also kill the heart of the country. Congress has always adopted such an attitude.”“Instead of giving them a befitting reply, Congress used to hold meetings with terror outfits. Congress feared annoying vote banks,” he alleged.Later, speaking at Murve Maidan in Simaria, Jharkhand, Modi said the alliance and the local JMM-Congress govt was full of corruption. Accusing the JMM-Congress-RJD govt of running an opium industry in Chatra, he said people should not vote for them if they want to secure the future of their children.“Mountains of cash are being recovered from JMM and Congress leaders. I have never seen such an amount of cash in one place. If so much money is there with the PA and his servant, one can imagine the amount of black money held by ministers,” he said.“One leader of the alliance partner has offered to merge with Congress after declaration of the results.

Kharge-EC war of words rages: Cong chief asks why no action against ‘communal’ remarks by BJP leaders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kharge-ec-war-of-words-rages-cong-chief-asks-why-no-action-against-communal-remarks-by-bjp-leaders/articleshow/110042132.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking exception to the language of the Election Commission ’s letter to him, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge has written to the commission asking why they have not taken action against “blatantly communal and cateist” statements made by BJP leaders. He said the Congress “is on the side of the commission and stands for its strength and independence” but “it is for the officials of the Commission to now decide where they stand.”Kharge pointed out that the letter that he had written earlier this week, even though an open letter, was clearly addressed to the INDIA bloc partners and not the EC.He expressed “surprise” that the EC wanted to respond to this letter while ignoring several other complaints given directly to it. Asserting that he has certain “misgivings about the language of the letter” that the EC has addressed to him, Kharge took a dig at EC as he added that he would not press on that issue as he understands “the pressures they (EC) are working under”.On Friday, Congress had termed EC’s response to Kharge‘s letter as a “permanent blot” on the face of a body, which is there to “ensure a level-playing field to all political parties”.Kharge in the letter, he wrote to INDIA bloc parties earlier this week, underlined the “inordinate” delay in the release of final voter turnout of first two phases and a jump of around 5.5% over the initial projection. In an unusual move, the EC responded to Kharge's open letter rejecting his allegations around voter turnout data as “baseless.”Questioning the EC, Kharge asked on Saturday that “the lack of urgency shown by the Commission in taking action against blatantly communal and cateist statements being made by the leaders of the ruling party that vitiates the electoral process seems puzzling.”“I am also puzzled by the need to write that the ‘Commission is not legally bound to publish any voter turnout data at aggregate level of a constituency or state’, though it is factual,” he added. Kharge said that he is sure that many voters would be surprised too. “Many voters who are deeply interested in the elections would also like to see the absolute number of votes polled to be put out in the public domain by the Commission directly,’ he said.He concluded by expressing disappointment and said, “it should be our collective endeavour to safeguard democracy and protect the independent functioning of the ECI.”",Mallikarjun Kharge has written to the commission asking why they have not taken action against “blatantly communal and cateist’ statements made by BJP leaders.

NEW DELHI: Businesses remained closed and normal life was affected during a crippling strike in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir's capital Muzaffarabad to protest against a police crackdown, which led to a confrontation between the security forces and demonstrators, a local media report said on Saturday.The shutter-down and wheel-jam strike in the Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir's ( PoK ) Muzaffarabad on Friday, on a call by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), also saw police resort to teargas shelling, affecting people in homes and mosques as well, after demonstrators pelted stones, the Dawn newspaper reported.Saturday's strike was observed in various parts of PoK, including Samahni, Sehansa, Mirpur, Rawalakot, Khuiratta, Tattapani, and Hattian Bala.The JKJAAC called for the strike after several of its leaders and activists were arrested by police in overnight raids across Muzaffarabad and Mirpur divisions.The committee had previously announced plans for a long march towards Muzaffarabad on May 11.The JKJAAC is a prominent rights movement that has been protesting against the ""unjust"" taxes imposed on electricity bills. In August of the previous year, the committee had organised a similar shutter-down strike.In anticipation of the May 11 strike, the Chief Secretary of PoK, Dawood Muhammad Bareach, had written to the Secretary of the Interior Division in Islamabad on April 22, requesting six civil armed forces (CAF) platoons for security purposes.The letter stated, ""We are (now) faced with calls for shutter down and wheel-jam strikes from May 11 onwards given by the sub-nationalists and other disgruntled subversive elements. They intend to create a law and order situation by forcibly closing markets and disrupting public service delivery.""Meanwhile, it has emerged that the Chief Secretary of the PoK had written to the Secretary of the Interior Division in Islamabad, requisitioning as many as six civil armed forces (CAF) platoons for security due to the May 11 strike.Requesting the additional troops for three months, Chief Secretary Dawood Muhammad Bareach, in his letter of April 22, said: ""We are (now) faced with calls for shutter down and wheel-jam strikes from May 11 onwards given by the sub-nationalists and other disgruntled subversive elements. They intend to create a law and order situation by forcibly closing markets and disrupting public service delivery.""Sources said in anticipation of the strike, the government had enforced Section 144 across PoK and announced holidays in all educational institutions on May 10 and 11. However, people came out in thousands on the road in all districts of PoK.The JKJAAC movement has demanded that electricity should be provided to consumers following the production cost of hydro-power in the state, Dawn said.In December last year, it had reached an understanding with an official reconciliation committee, following which a notification was also issued by the government on February 4.However, in April the committee announced the long march on May 11 in protest against the ""non-fulfillment of the written commitments"" by the government.The Dawn newspaper reported that all businesses, including banks, remained closed, and traffic and vendors were off the roads in three districts of Muzaffarabad division.","Businesses remained closed and normal life was affected during a crippling strike in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir's capital Muzaffarabad.

FRAMED IN

DIFFERENT KEEPSAKE

Glittering lehengas, elaborate rituals, and sumptuous food. The wedding of Gujarat-based real estate developer Piyush Patel's twin daughters in February last year had it all. Yet, one absence loomed large: that of their mother Daxaben, who passed away months before the event due to a brain stroke. The void was hard to fill, but Patel was determined to plug it a little.He decided to commission an artist and give his daughters a surprise they'd remember the rest of their lives: a life-size hyper-realistic silicone model of their mother, adorned in a bright turquoise saree, real gold jewellery, and a warm smile.Seeing it, not just the daughters, but many other guests present cried, he recalls. ""It was like she was really there, blessing our daughters,"" he adds. From photographs to pooja rituals, Daxaben's model marked her presence at the wedding ceremony. It sits in their home even today, with fresh clothes and makeup, for occasions like birthdays, festivals, and more.Vadodara-based artist Vibha Patel, who made the statue, says she gets many requests to make silicone models for people who've lost near and dear ones, but they often back out after getting to know the cost. Such models typically cost around Rs 3-5 lakhs to make. While not everyone can afford a silicone model, people are finding different ways of keeping the memory of their late mothers alive. From rings made from strands of their hair that were preserved for years, to using technology to photoshop them into wedding albums, the modes adopted are many.Noida-based digital artist Divyanshu Garg, who goes by the name @ind_cyborg on Instagram, has received multiple such photoshop requests over the last few months. Earlier this year, he received one such request from Ami Kaur, who is from a Sikh family living in Thailand. Kaur's younger brother got married two years ago, but their mother was alive to only attend the engagement, and then succumbed to cancer. As his second marriage anniversary was approaching, Kaur decided to approach Garg to recreate a photograph of the wedding: one with their mother present in it. It was a surprise not only for her brother, but also their father, she adds. In the 'reaction' video uploaded on Garg's channel, there are plenty of tears and long hugs, as they hold the photo. ""For a person who has lost their mother, the grieving period is never over. But this really helps. We got many copies made,"" Kaur says.While photoshop technology helped Kaur and her family make their mother a part of a big day, some opt for live paintings of their late moms instead. In a reel that went viral in February, a California-based painter Kim-Vi Tran captured her journey of painting an Indian American bride's late mother into the surroundings. She also added a rainbow behind the late mother, ""to remind the couple that she was there, cheering them on,"" Tran wrote in her caption.Some rely on a different kind of technology. Delhi-based artist Preety Maggo started 'Magic of Memories' five years ago, which helps clients preserve a range of remnants - from strands of hair to even drops of blood, umbilical cords, and breastmilk in the form of jewellery. While she has been subjected to online trolling due to the nature of bodily elements involved - which some find 'odd' to preserve -Maggo has stayed the course. She makes jewellery that not only helps children remember their late mothers, but also mothers who've lost their newborns. ""I know what it means for people who have only these parts left as memories,"" she says.Just last week, Kolkata-based Dipika, herself a mother of two children, reached out to get pendants made with the last remaining strands of hair of her mother. She wanted to keep one for herself, and gift another to her brother, who is getting married later this month. The strands are designed in a manner that spells 'MOM'. Why hair? Dipika says there's a reason behind it. ""My mother loved her hair,"" she says. However, after undergoing a kidney transplant, she had a reaction to some of the medicines prescribed, and started losing her hair, leaving her with no option but to wear scarves. In December, she passed away after battling for her life. Through the pendants, Dipika says she not only wanted to preserve her memory, but also hold on to something that her mother loved a lot. As she waits for the shipments to arrive in order to surprise her brother, she cannot contain her excitement.As they say, there are as many ways to deal with grief as there are people.","People are finding different ways of keeping the memory of their late mothers alive.

Tough Match With

Sharad Pawar

Camp

Much At Stake For Munde Heir

CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR (AURANGABAD): Until last June, Pankaja Munde had her eyes on Maharashtra’s Parli assembly seat that her cousin and NCP member Dhananjay Munde had snatched in 2019. That loss and her earlier remark: “I am the CM in people’s mind” had led to her “isolation” within the state BJP, so starting the groundwork 17 months before the state polls was understandable.But when Dhananjay and some other NCP legislators led by Ajit Pawar joined the Mahayuti (BJP plus chief minister Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena) govt last year, Pankaja withdrew her claim on Parli, and rumours of her candidature from Beed Lok Sabha seat whirled.Finally, on March 13, BJP declared Pankaja its Beed candidate in place of her younger sister Pritam.Beed is a water-starved constituency where many take up the traditional job of sugarcane harvesting. Lack of industrial development has halted its growth, and the district headquarters is still without a rail link. It is also a constituency plagued by caste divisions.The Maratha demand for reservation has soured relations with OBCs, who fear losing a share of their quota. In fact, Beed was the only Maharashtra district that saw widespread violence during last year’s Maratha agitation .Pankaja, daughter of late BJP MP and former state deputy CM Gopinath Munde , is the party’s OBC face , and her campaign convoy has been stopped by ‘protesters’ at least a couple of times recently, although she’s said she favours a separate Maratha quota. “My opponents are trying to polarise voters in the name of caste. I am, however, keen to take people from all castes and creeds along,” Pankaja said at a recent campaign rally.She’s found endorsement from Union minister Nitin Gadkari, who told people at a rally, “You can come to me seeking solutions to road infrastructure problems only if you vote for Pankaja.”Keeping the caste factor in mind, Sharad Pawar’s NCP (SCP) has renominated Bajrang Sonawane, a Maratha who was vice chairman of Beed zilla parishad and, briefly, deputy CM in Ajit Pawar’s camp. Sonawane got the ticket because he had bagged more than 5 lakh votes in the 2019 LS poll that he lost to Pritam Munde.Sonwane recently said the Beed contest with Pankaja would be a cakewalk for him. “There is no neck-and-neck fight. My opponent is in no position to put up a tough contest as she is hardly available in Beed.”His state unit chief Jayant Patil accused BJP of failing to develop the constituency. “We are confident that MVA – Congress, NCP (SCP), Shiv Sena (UBT) alliance – is winning at least 33 Lok Sabha seats, including Beed. We will have to send Bajrang to Delhi for the district’s development.”Attacking the Munde family, Sonawane said, “Vaidyanath cooperative sugar mill, controlled by the Mundes, went bankrupt. Sugarcane growers, transporters and cane cutters have not been paid. Before splurging on their poll campaigns, the Munde cousins should answer these people.”Gopinath Munde died in an accident on June 3, 2014 and Pankaja has been seen as his political heir. She was cabinet minister from 2014 to 2019 in the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP govt. But she’s been without a seat since her loss in 2019, and analysts say this poll is a test of her relevance in Maharashtra’s political landscape.Pankaja has her cousin Dhananjay’s support this time, and it could bolster her prospects. “Differences with Dhananjay are a thing of the past. We were together even before Lok Sabha elections were announced,” she said.BJP’s Maratha stalwarts like MLC Suresh Dhas, ex-MLC Amarsinha Pandit and Nilanga MLA Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar have shown their support for Pankaja to prevent run-ins with quota supporters.As for the ‘audacious’ remark that isolated her and caused a ‘rift’ with former CM Devendra Fadnavis, Pankaja says, “My statement was read out of context... I never expressed a desire to become CM on any platform. My differences with Fadnavis are also hearsay.”With her house finally in order, Pankaja might not be watching her back, but she needs all her focus for the May 13 duel, which is a Munde-Sonawane and BJP-NCP (SCP) re-match with the extra dimension of OBC vs Maratha this time.",Pankaja Munde is the daughter of late BJP MP and former state deputy CM Gopinath Munde.

Modiji will turn 75 on Sept 17 next year. Modiji himself made a rule in BJP in 2014 that anyone in the party who reaches the age of 75 will retire,” Kejriwal said at a media interaction.“So I ask BJP, who is your PM candidate ? If they form govt, they will first tackle (UP CM) Yogiji. Then, Modiji’s most favourite, Amit Shah, will be made PM. So I want to alert the people of the country, Modiji is not asking for votes for himself, he is seeking votes to make Amit Shah PM. I want to ask Modiji and Amit Shahji, who will fulfil Modiji’s guarantees? Will Amit Shah do it?""Shah immediately responded by saying that Kejriwal was unnecessarily celebrating the prospect of Modi hanging his boots after turning 75 and the PM was not going anywhere. “I want to tell Arvind Kejriwal & co and the entire Indi Alliance, you don’t have to be happy about Modiji turning 75. This is not written anywhere in BJP’s constitution. Modiji will complete his term and continue to lead the nation. There is no confusion in BJP about this,” Shah said in the first forthright assertion that PM was not bound by the 75-year cutoff that was brought in 2014 by the larger saffron leadership to phase out veterans who were adjudged to have reached their ‘sell-by’ political date.Shah’s statement that the 75-year rule does not apply to Modi only confirms what was already known. The decision to ‘retire’ veterans like Advani reflected the consensus in the Sangh Parivar about the diminution of their capacity to contribute to the cause. In contrast, Modi is seen as the talisman, with his popularity surpassing even BJP’s in many parts and sections.Kejriwal’s statements triggered a string of reactions from other senior BJP functionaries as well, including defence minister Rajnath Singh and party chief J P Nadda. “The INDI Alliance, which is unable to decide on its leadership is speculating unsuccessfully about our leadership... INDI alliance leaders do not have even an ounce of the acceptability and credibility that Modi has among people,” Singh said.“Modi is our leader and will continue to lead us in the future,” Nadda said. “The leader who has come out of jail also knows that ‘aayega to Modi hi, rahega to Modi hi’ (only Modi will be voted to office, and he will remain there)”.","Delhi CM and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal fired his first salvo on Saturday.

"Rahul Gandhi moots debate with PM Modi; he’s merely an MP, mocks BJP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhi-moots-debate-with-pm-modi-hes-merely-an-mp-mocks-bjp/articleshow/110043683.cms,"NEW DELHI: Reacting to Rahul Gandhi ’s call for a face-to-face debate on Lok Sabha elections with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP on Saturday questioned his knowledge of poll issues as well as his standing in Congress party, noting that he is neither the president of his party nor the leader of opposition in Parliament.At a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi asked in what capacity is Gandhi looking to debate with Modi as he is merely an MP of his party.The remark comes as Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said he or party chief Mallikarjun Kharge would be pleased to participate in such a discussion and expressed hope that PM Modi would also take part. “It would be a positive initiative for the major parties to present their vision to the country from one platform for a healthy democracy,” Rahul wrote on X. He also added that the nation expects Modi to participate in the debate.Rahul’s post was in reply to Justice (Retd) Madan B Lokur, Justice (Retd) Ajit P Shah and senior journalist N Ram, who had written to him and the PM earlier this week, inviting them to a platform for a debate on the key election issues.“Congress welcomes this initiative and accepts the invitation for a discussion,” Rahul said. “We agree that such a debate will help people understand our respective vision and enable them to make an informed choice. It is also critical to put to rest any unsubstantiated allegations attributed to our respective parties. As the principal parties fighting the election, the public deserves to hear from their leaders directly. Accordingly, either myself or the Congress President would be pleased to participate in such a debate,” he added.In the invite addressed to PM Modi and Rahul, it was pointed out that the PM has publicly challenged Congress on reservations, Article 370 and wealth redistribution. On the other hand, Kharge has questioned the PM on possible “mutilation” of the Constitution, electoral bond scheme and the govt’s response to China and also challenged him to a public debate. In this backdrop, a debate will help the citizens to hear directly from the political leaders, the invite said.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said he or party chief Mallikarjun Kharge would be pleased to participate in such a discussion. “It would be a positive initiative for the major parties to present their vision to the country from one platform for a healthy democracy,” Rahul wrote on X.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110043668,imgsize-51232,width-400,resizemode-4/110043668.jpg"

In an 83-page order, the judge had cited a table chronicling 207 dates in the case, emphasising that Kapoor was not responsible for the delays.Section 436A of the Criminal Procedure Code allows the release of undertrial prisoners upon completion of half of the maximum jail sentence. In the case of the Wadhawans , the judge, though, said the section does not provide an absolute right of bail and it may be denied where the trial is delayed because of the accused.The judge said there cannot be any dispute that filing a bail plea is a constitutional right of any accused. ""...but certainly if such accused files bail application... and strategically keeps the same pending for uncertain period, ie for a long period of one year, can it be held that he is exercising his constitutional right of bail and such leisure on his part has lawful exemption under the explanation to Section 436A? Certainly, conduct of the accused itself is an answer to this question. In my opinion, this much period of one year has to be deducted while computation of period under Section 436A...,"" Special Judge M G Deshpande said.The judge further said when it was noticed that the accused kept the bail pleas under Section 436A strategically pending, causing impediment in the progress of the trial of other undertrial prisoners, co-accused Avinash Bhosale and Sanjay Chhabria, a noting was also made in the daily court recordings about how the lawyer would simply appear and not pursue the pleas.""It is only thereafter, arguments in these two applications began and finally concluded on March 26... Can it be said that both applicants are bona fide exercising their right under Section 436A...? Is it not a delay in proceeding caused by applicants... ?"" the judge said.The judge referred to the earlier bail pleas kept pending by the duo from 2022 till March 2023 when they were finally decided. The judge said after excluding this period, the remaining period does not qualify for bail.In October 2023, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 70.4 crore of erstwhile DHFL promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan as part of a money laundering investigation linked to an alleged bank loan fraud case.The attached assets were in the form of paintings and sculptures worth nearly Rs 28.6 crore, watches worth Rs 5 crore diamond jewellery worth over Rs 10.7 crore.",The brothers were arrested in 2020 in a money laundering case in which Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor and others are also accused.

He was suspended for two years from the institute and debarred from entering all the four campuses, in an order passed last month. In his petition, Ramadas has appealed to the court to set aside the inquiry report of the institute's empowered committee and the revocation of the suspension order and restore his entitlements as a student.He said that he was 'unlawfully, arbitrarily and unfairly suspended by the institute'Ramadas has also asked for the withdrawal of the public notice issued by the institute on April 20, two days after the suspension order was passed. The public notice, stated the petition, was 'malicious' and 'defamatory' in nature and 'puts his life and academic pursuits under grave threat'. He also pointed out that his legitimate participation in student life and exercise of his constitutional rights has been deemed as 'anti-national' by the institute.The petition also seeks directions to the union ministry of social justice and empowerment to ensure the continuation and monthly disbursal of the national fellowship he was entitled to. In his petition, Ramadas mentioned that he did not receive the fellowship amount for April 2024, in pursuance of the suspension order. Ramadas has also set an interim stay on the suspension order and the continuation of the fellowship pending the hearing and the final disposal of the petition.UGC is also one of the respondents in the petition, as the guidelines for students' entitlements allows him freedom of thought and expression. The petition mentioned that he moved the court as the students' handbook of the institute does not provide details on the internal appeal process against an empowered committee's order. It also added that the public notice was issued by the highest authority and therefore, he would not get an independent or fair hearing in the appeal.The research scholar was suspended on April 18 based on the recommendations of the empowered committee. He was accused of participating in a protest march in New Delhi in January and also for urging people to watch the documentary 'Ram ke Naam' during the Pran Pratishthan.Ramadas, in his petition, claimed that he had attended the protest march in his personal capacity as a member of two students' organisations and that the march was to raise issues related to education, including the National Education Policy , fee hikes, employment guarantee, among others. He also stated that he had not organised any screening of the documentary but only posted a message in Malayalam urging people to watch the award-winning documentary. He claimed that the accusation that he had organised a screening was baseless and false.","Research scholar, Ramadas KS, has moved the Bombay High Court against the institute's suspension order.

Now, the Delhi police are after you for circulating a fabricated and edited video of mine and that scaring you,” Shah said at a rally in Chevella, Telangana, in support of a BJP candidate on the last day of campaigning.Delhi police had registered a case on April 28 over the doctored video showing Shah advocating the abolition of reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs, and issued summons to Revanth to appear on May 1, which he skipped. A couple of days ago, Revanth, who is also party Telangana unit president, said: “Amit bhai is trying to scare me and using his ministry to do so. If a political party produced a doctored video against another party or leader, the party concerned has to complain. But in this case the complaint was filed by the home ministry.”BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya, on the other hand, said the morphed video had been altered to misrepresent Shah’s remarks on the issue of reservation for Muslims in Telangana.At the Chevella rally , Shah said only the NDA govt could protect the country against terrorism. “People ask why Telangana would be interested in what is happening in Jammu and Kashmir. They are interested because they are connected. Youth from Telangana serve in the Army to protect the country’s borders. So, whatever the govt decides is in the best interests of Telangana people too,” he said.","Delhi police had registered a case on April 28 over the doctored video showing Shah advocating the abolition of reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs.
