Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection.

Mami Mizutori

tells

Pradeep Thakur

Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people. Excerpts from the interview:

The

estimates 150 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021 due to Covid-19. How can India minimise the impact?

The US and some other countries reserved enough shots for their citizens. Should India have done the same?

How much success has the UN’s Covax programme achieved?

The second wave of Covid-19 has caused more deaths in India. Where did it go wrong?

Your idea of a ‘global response for future pandemics’ and vaccine distribution?

With Covid disruptions, can countries like India meet the UN’s

target?

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people and government of India on the tragic loss of life that is taking place across the country.All major disasters which affect low- and middle-income countries result in economic losses on a scale which has a damaging effect on their ability to eradicate poverty and meet other basic needs, including health services and access to education. In the case of Covid-19, we have seen how it has pushed millions into extreme poverty globally, and has contributed to rising levels of hunger in many parts of the world where the informal economy that poor people depend on has been decimated. For all member states, the eradication of poverty cannot be achieved without reducing disaster risk and improved prevention as nothing undermines development like disasters.Much of the world looks to India for vaccine supply but the pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex and specialised to a degree that serving a population the size of India’s was always going to be a gargantuan task. The numbers already vaccinated in India are enormous but manufacturing enough doses to reach over one billion people will take time.The Covax facility portfolio, administered by Gavi, currently consists of agreements related to eight vaccines, including those developed with the Serum Institute of India . Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, Covax is making steady progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline healthcare workers.Covid-19 demonstrates the systemic nature of disaster risk, how a biological hazard can ravage all areas of life starting from public health to all socio-economic aspects of our societies. Unfortunately, many countries, including India, are learning the hard way that prevention requires more patience than previously thought and, in the case of biological hazards, a longer game plan. WHO has warned that when there are mass gatherings, more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low, this can create a perfect storm for the virus to spread in any country. India has done an admirable job in harnessing technology and communication to ensure effective early warning leads to early action in the case of cyclones. The challenge for the government now is to communicate effectively on the continued need for face masks, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings while at the same time rolling out an effective vaccination programme.If the global level of preparedness for this pandemic had matched the warnings, much of the impact could have been reduced. An adequate level of pandemic preparedness would have cost billions instead of the trillions that it is now costing. The loss of life and the economic disruption could have been significantly reduced if we had been adequately prepared from the moment biological hazards were included in the Sendai Framework in 2015. Given the transboundary nature of biological hazards it is obvious that a global response plan is required for future pandemics. A patchwork response is not working for Covid-19, and it will not work against any newly emerging diseases and viruses in the future. It is not acceptable that developing countries should have to wait so long for Covid vaccines. This inequality and lack of solidarity to access affordable vaccines only fuels the spread of the virus, allows the emergence of new variants and prolongs the pandemic. None of us is safe until we are all safe.It is clear that the death toll and economic loss from Covid-19 means that Sendai Framework targets on reducing mortality, numbers of disaster affected people and economic losses has suffered a great setback. However, we are still making significant progress on other targets. Asia and the Pacific are not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.","Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people.

GEORGETOWN: In most parts of the West Indies, the old-fashioned way of walking down the runway to the plane still prevails. It's fun on most days, but at night with the rain lashing down, the walk to take the flight, or to deplane, can get a little tricky.On Tuesday night, a small flight of about 80 people, consisting mostly of people related to the T20 World Cup, landed in Georgetown and were greeted by persistent showers.As the passengers all dashed for the shade, one could see the tall figure of Australian umpire Rod Tucker running alongside. When somebody asked Tucker whether he would be officiating the game, he laughed: ""Well, yes, if it happens"".""If it happens."" That's the operative word on everybody's lips as India get ready to play England in Rohan Kanhai land on Thursday.It's been raining for the last couple of days in Guyana and it didn't stop through the morning on Wednesday. What the locals are hoping is that if it rains on one day, it doesn't on the other. But then, that's clutching at straws, especially when the forecast is as bad as it is for Thursday.Probably the only ones who don't care are the Indian fans who have tickets for the final in Barbados on Saturday but couldn't manage one for the semifinal here. India will make the final if it's a washout because they topped their Super 8 group.The ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours than what it was earlier, but for all that to happen, the rain has to stop first. ""This is rain time in Guyana, why did they even schedule the game here? That too without a reserve day,"" mused a local in anguish.But the guys who will benefit the most if it keeps raining - the Indian team - are the ones who don't want it to happen this way. The sun came out here after the morning showers on match eve and after India completed a practice session at the quick drying Providence Stadium , captain Rohit Sharma said: ""We are not looking at a curtailed game. When we come tomorrow, we will hope that it is a full game, but if it is so, we will adapt.""This game has a lot riding on emotionally as well for the Indian team because it is their chance to get revenge on a team that had humiliated them in the 2022 T20 World Cup semis. Though the return of Jasprit Bumrah , who missed that World Cup with an injury, has been the single most important change that has happened since then, Rohit insists ""not much has changed"".""We have thought and discussed and thrashed out numerous times what needs to be done. It's about keeping it going,"" the skipper said.Bumrah apart, it's Kuldeep Yadav who has been another superb inclusion once India landed in the West Indies. His quality and guile have been difficult to deal with for most opponents and England shouldn't be any exception.The defending champions, though, have a bit of firepower with the likes of Jos Buttler , Phil Salt and the rest finding some form. They have three spinners - Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone - who can make use of spin-friendly conditions in Guyana, but the biggest England supporter would say that a curtailed game would be their best chance.Man to man, on current form, India are much superior, but if it's a shorter game, many of those things go out of the window. It becomes a bit of a shootout and with rain in the air and Messrs Duckworth, Lewis and Stern calling the shots, the toss, too becomes important.India know that they may have to deal with these variables, because that's the nature of the beast these days if it's a 365-day cricket season. Rohit and Co. will believe they are good enough for whatever comes in their way as they look to break their ICC silverware drought.It will be cloudy in Guyana on Thursday with 75% probability of rain. While forecast for match hours are slightly better, if it rains heavily before the starts, it can have an impact. With an inefficient stadium drainage system, many hours could be lost.There is no reserve day for this game. However, play can extend to 4 hours and 10 minutes to complete the game. India advance in case of a washout.Providence Stadium is a spinner's haven with low, sharp turn on offer. Spinners have conceded less than 7 runs per over here in recent times, good news for India's spin troika - Kuldeep, Axar and Jadeja. England too boast of Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone in their ranks for this day game.In the previous WC game here, West Indies struggled to chase down PNG's 137, with the variable bounce raising eyebrows. Don't expect the ball to come on to the bat and expect the surface to play a few tricks.This is precisely what India didn't do in Adelaide last time around. If Rohit Sharma can reprise his heroics against Australia, India will be home free.On paper, England have more six-hitters in the lineup but India's middle order enforcers like Suryakumar Yadav , Rishabh Pant and Shivam Dube will worry the England attack.India have been traditionally shaky in knockout rounds. But the current England white-ball dispensation too is under pressure after the failure to defend the ODI World Cup last year.",India face England in T20 World Cup semifinal in Guyana on Thursday. Rain forecast for Guyana with 75% probability of rain. ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours.

Eligibility criteria set by the AICTE is different like PCM score. So, if students meet the eligibility criteria, there is no harm in allowing them to apply for the vacant seats.

Of them, data shared by govt on the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) dashboard shows, 40,451 filled in key statistics about their respective facilities in the Open Data Kit - a digital tool - developed by the health ministry .When the scoring was done based on the statistics shared, it was revealed that only 8,089, approximately 20% of the facilities, scored 80% or higher which is needed to qualify as IPHS compliant .

The official said that while NQAS assessment for district hospitals, sub-district hospitals, community health centres and primary health centers will continue to be carried out physically, they have introduced a new provision of virtual assessment for the Ayushman Arogya Mandir that constitute the highest number of public health facilities under NHM.The Centre bears 60% of the expenditure in a public health facilities under the NHM while the rest of the expenditure is borne by the state.","Nearly 80% of public health facilities in India do not meet minimum essential standards for infrastructure, manpower, equipment and other benchmarks set by govt.

Additionally, an access road will be constructed providing direct connectivity from the west end of Bandra station to Western Express Highway.The rehabilitation project had been stalled since 2002 and locals, along with Khan, had approached courts, seeking permission to renew their agreements under the new slum scheme that offered them more benefits.The developer has been paying monthly rents to the eligible families for transit accommodation after they vacated their shanties.Earlier, the slumdwellers had locked horns with the authorities over their rehabilitation after receiving multiple demolition notices from BMC to allow it to undertake road widening.The slumdwellers had signed the agreement with the builder in 2002, but over the last two decades, govt has changed the eligibility criteria . After the residents approached courts—the issue went till SC—the builder accepted the demand to execute a fresh agreement as per the new rules.","The vacant plot will be used to build several towers to rehabilitate 1,400 eligible slum families.

Unveiling Kerala's Unique Duryodhan Temple: A Taxpaying Tribute to Mahabharat's Arch Villain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/a-temple-for-mahabharats-arch-villain-now-a-taxpayer/articleshow/111325091.cms,"A village where Duryodhan's a benign

, is called 'grandpa'

Even in a land of temples, and more deities than even the most pious can name, a temple for the arch villain of India's greatest epic is unusual. But what really makes the Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala 's Kollam district a standout is an aspect of modernity - per govt records, the eldest Kaurav prince pays taxes.Local lore has it that the prince was tired and thirsty during his travels.Drinking water was scarce, but a woman of a so-called low caste offered him a drink of toddy. Duryodhan, who also famously elevated the supposedly low-born Karna to kingship, accepted happily, blessed the woman and her village, and gave them land. The temple for him was the village saying thank you. Ritual offerings here include a good measure of intoxicants.At the Peruviruthy Malanada temple, the daily offering of toddy to Duryodhan, who's not represented by an idol in the temple but by a polished mace, the Kaurav prince's weapon of choice. In Mahabharat , he's the man who hoots with delight as he orders Draupadi disrobed, the prince who plotted to steal the kingdom that rightfully belonged to the good guys - Pandavs. But in this village, he's a benign, protective deity. Villagers call him 'appoopa' (grandpa).That sharp departure from Mahabharat's narrative treatment of Duryodhan, the fact that there's no idol and the votive offering of toddy are similar to other non-Vedic practices in many southern temples. Villagers have a more interesting take on the toddy offering - a tipple keeps the deity in a mild and cheerful mood, they say.As for those taxes Duryodhan pays diligently, it will be wise to first point out that the tax is not on the temple's income - all temples are tax free in India. The levy is on the 15 acres of temple land at the Poruvazhy village surrounding the temple.""When the pattayam was issued for the temple, the land was registered in the deity's name. The thandaper (land deed) number and survey details show the land is owned by Duryodhan. Ever since taxes were introduced in Kerala, this land tax has been paid in Duryodhan's name,"" a local administrator said. Of the 15 acres of temple land, eight acres are paddy fields, the rest is forested land, said temple committee secretary Rajaneesh R.When in Puruvazhy, don't diss Duryodhan.","Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala's Kollam district is a standout.

How can you file a petition under Article 32,"" it asked senior advocate R Basant.When Basant said even if the court disregards the coaching centre, there are four other students who have filed a joint petition alleging that OMR answer sheets have discrepancies in evaluation and that there is no mechanism provided by the NTA to address these grievances.NTA counsel Vardhaman Kaushik said a batch of petitions related to alleged irregularities in NEET-UG is engaging the attention of SC and is fixed for hearing on July 8, the first day of the court resuming normal business after summer break.But court, on insistence of Basant, asked NTA to file an affidavit detailing the mechanism to address grievances of students regarding evaluation of OMR sheets. However, it expressed its strong disapproval of the coaching centres jumping into the fray with students regarding the NEET-UG.The bench observed, ""We see the role played by the coaching centres as pied pipers.

No justification to charge toll if roads are in disrepair: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-to-charge-toll-if-roads-are-in-disrepair-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/111267453.cms,"NEW DELHI: Echoing the sentiment of many highway commuters, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said there is no justification of highway agencies charging toll, if roads are not in good condition and people continue to face problems. He was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling, which will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year.Known for not mincing his words, Gadkari said, “If you don’t provide good services, you should not charge toll...We are in a hurry to start tolling to collect user fees and protect our interest.When the condition of any road is not good I get numerous complaints and there are social media posts all over...You should collect the user fee where you provide the best quality road. If you collect toll on roads with potholes, mud, then there will be a backlash from people. We (political leaders) face people’s ire.”The minister said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face waiting for long at toll plazas and there must be a mechanism for lodging grievances and their quick redressal.Though govt made the use of FASTag for paying toll on highways mandatory in 2021 for seamless travel through toll lanes and currently around 98% transactions are through these smart tags fixed on vehicles, there have been numerous reports of queues at plazas from across the country. In its bid to put an end to this, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on the roll out and expansion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based toll collection. This aims to remove toll gates from the NH network in the next few years.The highway authority proposes to roll this out in a phased manner, starting with only commercial vehicles and dedicating one lane on each side of toll plazas for them to pass without stopping. It’s mandatory for commercial vehicles to install vehicle tracker system (VTS), an on board unit, which is necessary for GNSS-based tolling.Govt plans to bring private vehicles under this tolling system at a subsequent phase.The road transport ministry has finalised a series of amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules and NH Fee Rules, which don’t need legislation, for roll out of the system. While vehicle owners will be incentivised to get a discount in toll charge for complying with their vehicles having OBUs for paying toll without stopping, there will be disincentives for those who don't opt for this.Gadkari said the system (GNSS)-based toll collection will add Rs 10,000 crore to govt’s toll revenue. “We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of GNSS-based toll collection in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added. The GNSS-based toll collection is expected to enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance travelled.","Gadkari was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling.

Sharmila Tagore: Golden Days: When Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi played a prank on Sharmila Tagore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/golden-days-when-mansoor-ali-khan-pataudi-played-a-prank-on-sharmila-tagore/articleshow/111310941.cms,"In a special segment of Golden Days, we take a nostalgic journey back to the early days of one of India's most beloved couples, veteran actress Sharmila Tagore and the legendary cricketer Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi . Their story of love and companionship spans over four decades, starting with an unforgettable first meeting.Reflecting on her first encounter with the former Indian cricket team captain, Sharmila during her appearance on ‘Kon Banega Crorepati 15’ revealed that their paths crossed at a cricket party in Kolkata.She was an ardent cricket enthusiast and admirer of cricketers, which set the stage for their initial meeting. “At a cricket party in Kolkata, we met. And then we exchanged telephone numbers,” she recounted with a smile.Their budding romance was punctuated by significant events, including a memorable phone call Sharmila made to congratulate Tiger on his remarkable performance in a cricket match. “We were going to Nainital for 'Waqt'. That's when he scored a double century in Delhi so that was very famous. So, I called him and he was not at home. So, I left a message congratulating him for the double century as Sharmila Tagore,” she shared.The story took a humorous turn when Sharmila received a strange phone call months later in Mumbai. She was told that she had received five air conditioners from London, a dubious claim given the import restrictions at the time. “I thought somebody was trying to get me into trouble. And I'll go to jail. I have never even ordered them. I got perturbed. There was a number given. So, I rang that number,” she explained. To her surprise, the voice on the other end wasTiger Pataudi , laughing and admitting it was a prank. “So, that's how it happened. And he asked if we could go out for coffee. I said yeah, we'll go out for coffee,” she continued.Their love story blossomed from that playful exchange, leading to a marriage in 1968 that lasted 43 years until Tiger's passing in 2011. Together, they raised three children: actor Saif Ali Khan, jewelry designer Saba Ali Khan, and actress Soha Ali Khan. Their union remains a poignant chapter in India's cultural history, blending the worlds of cinema and sports in a timeless romance.","Sharmila Tagore and Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi met at a cricket party in Kolkata.
