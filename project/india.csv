The United Arab Emirates will likely receive the largest number of Indian millionaires.

will likely receive the largest number of Indian millionaires. In the last decade, this number increased by 85%.

The country is expected to attract 6,700 HNWIs from around the world in 2024.

Factors like its zero income tax policy, golden visa programmes, luxurious lifestyle and strategic location make the UAE a favourite among wealthy migrants.

Other top destinations for migrating millionaires include the United States, Singapore, Canada, and Australia.

Millionaire matrix

The Henley report describes millionaires and HNWIs as individuals with liquid investable wealth of $10 lakh (about Rs. 8.34 crore) or more.

It said India has 3,26,400 HNWIs, the tenth-highest in the world.

India also had the third-highest number of billionaires: 120.

Globally, 1,20,000 millionaires are expected to migrate in 2024, an increase from last year’s 1,20,000.

Why leave?

Common reasons why millionaires relocate include business opportunities, healthcare, and standard of living.

There are safety and security as well as financial concerns such as taxes and retirement.

They also consider lifestyle factors like climate, nature, scenery and education opportunities.

Not really bad news

The report said this finding is not particularly concerning for India as it “continues to produce far more new HNWIs than it loses to emigration.”

Additionally, a majority of millionaires who leave India often retain businesses and second homes in the country, the report noted.

NEW DELHI: In 2023, India is expected to witness departation of approximately 4,300 millionaires , as reported by the Henley Private Wealth Migration report 2024.Although this figure represents a decline from the previous year's count of 5,100 millionaires, it still positions India as the country with the third-largest number of high net worth individuals ( HNWI ) seeking to relocate abroad.China and the United Kingdom are expected to surpass India in terms of the number of millionaires leaving their respective countries. The report highlights the ongoing trend of wealthy individuals exploring opportunities and shifting their residences to other nations.","In 2023, India is expected to witness departation of approximately 4,300 millionaires.

Trust of India: TOI No. 1 news brand in country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trust-of-india-toi-no-1-news-brand-in-country/articleshow/111121868.cms,"When it comes to the trust of India , there's no beating The Times of India . In a year that has witnessed a hard-fought election, which saw rumour mills go into overdrive and social media being flooded with gossip and fake news, India once again turned for reliable and authentic information to its most trusted source.TOI is the most trusted major news media brand in India, according to a 47-country survey conducted by Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ), Oxford University. The survey, released as part of Digital News Report 2024, an annual publication by the institute, found TOI had a trust score of 71. TOI had also topped the survey in 2021 and 2022.While the report does not make any cross-country comparisons, just how high a trust level 71 signifies can be seen from the fact that the most trusted brand in the UK, BBC News, had a trust score of 62 and the most trusted paper in that country, Financial Times, scored 57. Similarly, in the US, local TV news had the highest trust score of 62 while New York Times (50), Wall Street Journal (49), CNN (48) and Washington Post (46) scored much lower.The high level of trust is particularly noteworthy in the year of an election with sharply polarised opinion and mainstream media being challenged by social media channels.In general, in India print brands were more prominent at the top of trust scores, with the exception of govt media and BBC News. In the West, as evident from the US and UK examples, the pattern was very much the reverse, with television brands topping the trust charts. It is hardly surprising that India had the highest proportion of respondents (40%) who used print media as a source of news. In the US, that proportion was 16% and in the UK 14%.In India, the respondents were mainly English-speaking, online news users, leaning towards a more affluent, younger, educated, and city-dwelling population. The survey therefore reflects the opinions and attitudes of this section. The survey in India was done in collaboration with Asian College of Journalism.","TOI is the most trusted major news media brand in India, according to a 47-country survey conducted by Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ), Oxford University.

Trichy: Rail users and consumer welfare organisations have welcomed the decision of Southern Railway to operate a new Vande Bharat service between Madurai and Bengaluru via Trichy. Though the long-pending demand seeking additional train services from Trichy to Bengaluru has been fulfilled, rail users demanded an overnight service between the two destinations.On Monday, the trial run of Vande Bharat train between Madurai and Bengaluru via Trichy was conducted. S Pushpavanam, secretary, Consumer Protection Council of Tamil Nadu said that the decade-old demand of Trichy passengers was finally addressed.“We reiterate our demand to operate the service continuously.

Some told TOI they had to watch the staff run scissors through their clothes or ditch them in the trash can.CPB rules say an individual can carry one counterfeit item of each type (like one shirt, handbag, or pair of shoes) provided it is for personal use and not for sale. Anything in ""excess"" of this is banned.I travelled to the US to meet my son, who is pursuing a master's in supply chain management in Texas. I was carrying eight shirts, four trousers, some socks, and a pair of shoes. All the goods were still packed as I had just bought them, said a schoolteacher from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand.""At the port of entry officials checked my bags and bombarded me with questions about where I was travelling from, who the goods were for, if I was smuggling them, etc. Though I tried explaining to them that it was all for my son, they insisted that I could not take them as they were all counterfeit goods - copies of big brands - which I wasn't aware of. Since they threatened me with criminal charges, I had no choice but to let them seize everything immediately.""The traveller said many of the clothing items were torn before being discarded. ""I lost goods worth at least Rs 30,000,"" added the 43-year-old, appealing to authorities to mention these rules on relevant platforms for the benefit of travellers.""How do we know this (rule) if it is not prominently mentioned in the dos and don'ts guide that gives travellers a checklist of what can be carried and what can't,"" asked a 27-year-old student from Hyderabad who had a similar experience a few months ago.""It is very common in India for people to sell and buy copies of big brands.I had no idea that carrying them in my luggage is such a serious offence.""

The petitioners contended that police illegally held the animals captive and their whereabouts were not known.A habeas corpus petition is filed before a high court or Supreme Court to produce a person before the court in cases of illegal detention or missing persons.In this case, animal lovers Surabattula Gopala Rao and Thota Suresh Babu, both residents of Vijayawada, moved HC contending that police had unlawfully 'detained' the animals.The petitioners alleged that they found a huge number of bovines on the outskirts of Vijayawada on June 16 and on further inquiry learnt that the animals were being transported for slaughtering on June 17. The animals were not fit for slaughtering as many of them were found to be below 10 years of age while some others were suffering from lumpy skin disease. The petitioners called the police and also approached the local veterinary officer for certification which is mandatory for slaughtering. Police and the veterinary officer concluded that the animals were not fit for slaughtering.However, on the same day, about 300 persons came to the police station and two of them claimed that they were the rightful owners of the animals and had bought them for business. The petition alleged that the police, without following due procedure, shifted the animals to an undisclosed location.Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, advocate JV Phanuduth told HC 'right to life' is not limited to humans but applies equally to animals. He mentioned the SC order in AWBI Vs Nagaraja & Others case, in which it was declared that ""freedom from hunger, thirst, malnutrition, fear and distress, physical and thermal discomfort, pain, injury and disease and freedom to express normal patterns of behaviour of animals will be protected by the state"". Phanuduth argued that the habeas corpus petition is maintainable even in case of animals in view of the legal proposition laid down by Supreme Court.Arguing on behalf of police, the govt pleader said the animals have been handed over to the person who claimed their ownership.

These findings are part of Unicef's global 'Child Nutriton Report 2024'. The percentage of children living in severe child food poverty in 92 countries with available data ranges from 1% in Belarus to 63% per cent in Somalia with the percentage for India at 40% which is categorised as 'high'.Unicef defines child food poverty as children's inability to access and consume a nutritious and diverse diet in first 5 years of life. The forces driving severe child food poverty include ""poor food environments for children, poor feeding practices and household income poverty affecting children and their families"". It is a problem affecting both the poor and non-poor households.The report cautions that severe child food poverty is driving child undernutrition and percentage of children living in severe child food poverty is three times higher in countries with a high prevalence of stunting.The findings of this global study hold signficance for India given that the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) of the Union health ministry puts the prevalence of stunting at 35.5%, wasting at 19.3% and underweight at 32.1% for under 5 children.Even though it is an improvement over NFHS (2015-16) when prevalence of stunting was 38.4%, wasting was 21.0% and underweight was 35.8%, undernutrition continues to be concern.The UN report also states that children deprived of good nutrition in early childhood do less well at school and have lower earning capacity in adulthood, trapping them in a cycle of poverty and deprivation.In the report 'child food poverty' is measured using the Unicef and WHO dietary diversity score wherein for healthy development, children need to consume foods from at least five out of the eight defined food groups. Some of the things listed in the food groups include breastmilk, dairy, pulses to grains, eggs, meat, poultry and fish, vitamin A- rich fruits among others.A total of 2 in 3 children (66%) under 5 are living in child food poverty. This amounts to an estimated 440 million children who are unable to access and consume nutritious and diverse diets comprising at least five of the eight food groups. Children who are fed 0-2 food groups a day are seen to be living in severe child food poverty. The report shows that ""1 in 3 children (32%) experience severe child food poverty in countries with a high prevalence of stunting, compared to 11% in countries with a low prevalence; and odds of stunting are 34% higher affected by severe child food poverty compared to children who are not affected,"" it is stated.","1 in 4 children (27%) globally figure in the severe category as they are surviving on extremely poor diets.

Financial outlay for the central sector scheme - to be implemented between 2024-25 and 2028-29 - will be met out of the home ministry's own budget.The strengthening and upgrade of forensic capabilities nationwide is expected to take care of the higher demand for forensics in investigation of crimes under the new criminal laws, which come into effect from July 1, as they provide for mandatory forensic examination of the crime scene and evidence for offences punishable with imprisonment of seven years or more. An MHA spokesperson said the new criminal laws will significantly increase the workload of forensic laboratories, which are currently grappling with a lack of trained forensic manpower .Stressing on the need for significant investment and enhancement in national forensic infrastructure to enable the smooth rollout of BNS, BNSS and BSA, the home ministry said the establishment of additional off-campuses of the NFSU and new CFSLs would address the shortage of trained forensic manpower in the country.

The current relatively longer hiatus has not only contributed to the current heat wave phase but also delayed sowing operation of kharif (summer sown) crops in north and North-West India.Though the India Meteorological Department (IMD), banking on upcoming La Nina formation, still maintains that the country is most likely to get fairly good rainfall during July-Sept, it has downgraded its forecast for June rainfall for the country as a whole from 'normal' to 'below normal' due to the current pause in the movement of monsoon.La Nina conditions - climate pattern associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific - are generally associated with good monsoon rainfall in India. Past data shows that the summer monsoon was either 'normal' or 'above normal' in most of the last 22 La Nina years since 1954 except 1974 and 2000 when it was below normal. IMD has, already, predicted 'above normal' monsoon rainfall for the country as a whole this year.""Monsoon hiatus is very common in the monsoon season. Monsoon does not progress in one stretch. But the current hiatus is relatively longer. It could be associated with the intra-seasonal activity and also Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO),"" said Madhavan Rajeevan, climate scientist and former secretary, ministry of earth sciences. MJO is one of the most important atmospheric-ocean coupled phenomena in the tropics, which has a profound influence on the Indian summer monsoon.Asked whether the current hiatus will impact the overall quantitative outcome of the monsoon, Rajeevan said, ""We need to wait for the next spell to revive the monsoon. That is expected during the last week of June. Anyway, June will be deficient. But we should not worry. We will have a normal monsoon.""Delayed monsoon will, however, its implications on the farming operation as it would delay sowing of kharif crops, mainly water-guzzling paddy, which will eventually reduce the gap between harvest of kharif crops and sowing of next (rabi) crops — a situation which invariably leads to more stubble burning episodes in north-west India as farmers have to rush to prepare ground for sowing wheat and mustard. Share of stubble burning is quite high in overall air pollution load in Delhi-NCR and neighbouring states during winter.“We will advise farmers to go for direct seeded rice (DSR) method of cultivation to save time. But this method has, so far, not got universal acceptance. Farmers continue to go for the traditional method of prior nursery preparation and transplantation that consumes a lot of time,” said an official in the agriculture ministry.",The monsoon has remained almost at a standstill since June 12 after making gradual progress and covering roughly 40% of the geographical area during the first 14 days.

Good sleep can help reduce high BP risk in children: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/good-sleep-can-help-reduce-high-bp-risk-in-children-study/articleshow/111121502.cms,"NEW DELHI: It is not just the adults. Many children also suffer from hypertension or high blood pressure.While earlier it was thought that changing the diet and improving physical activity are the best non-pharmacological interventions to manage it, new research published in the journal Paediatrics suggests adequate sleep and going to bed earlier are equally important.""We recommend that when a paediatrician identifies a patient (children and teenagers) with elevated blood pressure, in addition to standard counselling, a patient would benefit from counselling on optimal sleep health ,"" study author Amy J Kogon, a pediatric nephrologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia , said in a video abstract.Kogon and his team studied the link between sleep and blood pressure in 539 children and teens who were being evaluated for high blood pressure at the hospital's paediatric nephrology clinic.According to study, they found that on average the children and teens slept just over nine hours per night. Every extra hour of sleep duration was associated with reduced odds of increased blood pressure in the morning. Later sleep onset was associated with worse daytime blood pressure parameters, the researchers found.In India, some studies suggest that nearly 7% of school-going children suffer from hypertension.Dr Krishan Chugh, principal director of paediatrics at Fortis Gurugram said the Philadelphia hospital study scientifically proves what has been widely believed earlier also that a good sleep is essential for maintaining the normal blood pressure and working of the heart, besides that of the brain and the mind.""In recent times, it has been noticed that many adolescents are having high blood pressures, both systolic and diastolic, even when they're not suffering from any other illness. Yes, many of them are overweight or obese, but as such, do not have any disease like a kidney disease. High blood pressure in younger children leads to all the adverse effects that are noticed in adults with hypertension,"" Dr Chugh said. He added that it is not only sleeping for a number of hours that is important, but also sleeping at the right time and not too late to match the biological cycle of a normal human being that needs to be practised.Dr Dhiren Gupta, senior consultant paediatrician at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, said shortened sleep duration in children and adolescents predisposes them to inattention, hyperactivity, easy irritability and poor appetite control among others. Ideally, Dr Gupta said, children aged between six to 12 years should sleep for nine to 12 hours daily.","Research suggests adequate sleep and going to bed earlier are equally important.

According to official sources, while a ""no-objection"" was given to meet BJP's Dilip Ghosh and Sukanta Majumdar and TMC's Derek O'Brien and Jawhar Sircar, they recommended against meeting state ministers.

Explaining the principle of reciprocity, another official source said, the rank of a minister of a state govt is much higher in protocol than that of the deputy chief of a foreign mission and this provision is followed in heeding to any request for meetings. The source suggested that the deputy high commissioner is much junior to the ministers and that is why the meetings sought by the diplomat were not in sync with laid down norms.
