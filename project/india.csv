'Have expressed concerns directly to Indian govt'

NEW DELHI: The United States on Tuesday said that they believed ""India has ability to"" urge Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""end the brutal and unprovoked war with Ukraine"".White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre, when asked about Indian prime minister visiting Russia, said ""We believe India's long-standing relationship with Russia gives it the ability to urge President Putin, to end his brutal war, an unprovoked war in Ukraine...India is a strategic partner with whom we engage in full and frank dialogue, including their relationship with Russia and we've talked about this before.It's critical that all countries, including India, support efforts to realize an enduring and just peace when it comes to Ukraine. It is for President Putin to end. President Putin started the war, and he can end the war...""This came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Russia for two-day official trip to Russia and met President Vladimir Putin.Earlier the State department have also expressed concerns and said that they directly talked to the Indian government about the energy and oil agreements between India and Russia.Responding to a question asked by a reporter about the concerns around India and Russia's continued agreements on energy and oil, State department spokesperson Matthew Miller in a press conference said, ""So, as I said yesterday, we have been quite clear about our concerns about India’s relationship with Russia. We have expressed those privately, directly to the Indian Government and continue to do so, and that hasn’t changed.""During the meeting, both the leaders assessed the multi-faceted mutually beneficial India-Russia relations that span all possible areas of cooperation including political and strategic, military and security, trade and investment, energy, science and technology, nuclear, space, cultural, education and humanitarian cooperation. It was noted with satisfaction that both Sides are actively exploring new avenues for cooperation while further strengthening cooperation in the traditional areas.On Monday also, the US has called upon India to convey a clear message to Moscow that any resolution to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine must adhere to the principles of the UN Charter, which safeguard the territorial integrity of all member states, including Ukraine.Responding to questions regarding Modi's visit to Moscow, Miller said that India is a strategic partner with whom the US engages in open and honest dialogue, including concerns about India's relationship with Russia.""We did just see Modi, like (Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor) Orban, meet with (Ukrainian) President (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy. We thought that was an important step to take. And we would urge India, as we do any country when it engages with Russia, to make clear that any resolution to the conflict in Ukraine needs to be one that respects the UN charter, that respects Ukraine's territorial integrity, Ukraine's sovereignty,"" Miller said.Miller stated that he would closely examine Prime Minister Modi 's public statements to ascertain the topics discussed during the visit.Meanwhile, on Tuesday's press briefing, another reporter also raised question on PM Modi's visit to Russia.Calling Putin ""bloody criminal,"" the reporter asked, ""How do you view the Modi-Putin hugging chemistry, as President Zelenskyy has seriously objected, saying it’s a huge disappointment that the leader of the world’s largest democracy hugs a bloody criminal in Moscow? This is a devastating blow to peace efforts. Will this create any impact on your trusted and strategic partnership with India?""Miller said that the US continued to urge India, to support efforts to realize an enduring and just peace in Ukraine based on the principles of the UN Charter, based on upholding Ukraine’s territorial integrity and its sovereignty. ""And that will continue to be what we will engage with India about,"" he added.","White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre, when asked about Indian prime minister visiting Russia, said ""We believe India's long-standing relationship with Russia gives it the ability to urge President Putin to end his brutal war"" This came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Russia for two-day official trip to Russia and met President Vladimir Putin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111620472,imgsize-48392,width-400,resizemode-4/111620472.jpg"

Seeking a lasting solution

Connected care

Nearly a decade ago, K R Balakrishnan, a heart-lung transplant surgeon in Chennai, and Pete Ayre, a bioengineering professor at University of New South Wales, met for dinner in a Chennai hotel. When the discussion turned to artificial heart pumps , they borrowed pencils from the waiter and scribbled some designs on paper napkins.Soon, the drawings from the dining table made it to labs and, in five years, out came some prototypes.A couple of them — one for the left side of the heart and a smaller one for the right — are now being tested in sheep in Australia. If things go as planned, the team — it has patented the technology — will start clinical trials on humans in India and Australia by Dec 2024.“We never thought we’d get this far,” said Balakrishnan, who heads the heart and lung transplant department at MGM Healthcare. “Our discussion started casually. When I left the hotel, I never thought anything would come of it. I was surprised when Pete called me a week later, and things started happening.” The two have founded a company called Cardiobionic .Their plan was simple: To build a heart pump that would be a long-term and affordable solution to heart failure . Heart pumps available in the market now cost US$100,000 (more than 80 lakh). The team wanted to make one that cost one-fourth of that. “The ones available now are bulky, almost the size of a cricket ball,” said Ayre. “While surgeons may place pumps outside the chest cavity, it is not suitable for petite people and children.”Moreover, pumps today support only one chamber of the heart, the left ventricle. Several people who are given these pumps end up in intensive care for life support when the right side of the heart fails.But just when laboratory studies and designs began to show promise, the team hit its first roadblock. “We needed funds,” said Balakrishnan. “I spoke to more than 50 businessmen from across the world. Two Indian investors, whose details I cannot reveal now, agreed to invest. That’s when the project took off.”In five years, they developed a bi-ventricular assist pump that supports both sides of the heart with one console and a smaller device, which would cost about a fourth of the existing device.The pump is made of titanium and inside there’s a non-contact impella — a device that pulls blood from the ventricle and pushes it out into the aorta, delivering oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body. “It floats on blood and spins continuously. That means it may be a permanent solution and not just a bridge to a transplant,” said Ayre.Several heart failure patients across the country die waiting for an organ. “There are many hurdles in organ transplant. With better awareness, we are getting organs from brain-dead patients. But not all hearts are utilised because we don’t have the network to transport them within its shelf life of four hours. In most parts of the world there are no programmes for heart transplant,” he said. “This pump could prevent many deaths.”A smaller pump that supports the right side of the heart in adults can be used as an LVAD, or left ventricular assist device, for a child. “There are no pumps specifically for children now,” said Balakrishnan. However, more research is needed to understand why some hearts fail despite having an artificial pump.The team, meanwhile, is working to convert the pump into a remote monitoring device so that patients can be tracked from anywhere using the internet. They are also looking to make the entire system wireless. “Now, we have a driveline that connects the implanted pump to an external console via a cable across the skin. This can increase chances of infection,” he said.Doctors are pushing the team to make the pump work as efficiently as the human heart. “The heart can increase output by up to 50% during pregnancy, exercise, or emergency. We want to build pressure sensors that help the pump do this,” Ayre said.While the trials in Australian sheep are showing promise, the team is trying for product approval in India, US and Europe.","K R Balakrishnan, a heart-lung transplant surgeon in Chennai, and Pete Ayre, a bioengineering professor at University of New South Wales, met for dinner in a Chennai hotel.

TMC and BJP clash in West Bengal

Key bypolls in Himachal





High stakes for BJP in Uttarakhand

AAP eyes a comeback in Punjab

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Voting for the byelections in 13 Assembly seats across seven states commenced at 7 am on Wednesday. The counting of votes for these bypolls will take place on July 13.The fate of several veteran politicians and newcomers, including the wife of Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu Kamlesh Thakur will be decided in the polls.These elections, the first since the Lok Sabha polls, will fill vacancies caused by deaths or resignations of sitting members in legislative assemblies. The constituencies going to bypolls include:In West Bengal, both the ruling TMC and the BJP have high stakes in the bypolls. The TMC aims to capitalize on its improved performance in the Lok Sabha elections, while the BJP seeks to leverage the significant leads it gained in the four constituencies during the parliamentary polls.The TMC won Maniktala in the 2021 West Bengal elections, while the BJP won Raiganj, Ranaghat Dakshin, and Bagda before the MLAs switched to the TMC. The TMC has fielded candidates with strong local connections, while the BJP has nominated prominent figures like the All India Football Federation president Kalyan Chaubey.Himachal Pradesh will witness bypolls in three assembly constituencies - Dehra, Hamirpur, and Nalagarh - after three independent legislators who supported the BJP in the Rajya Sabha polls resigned from the House. The BJP has fielded these former Independent MLAs from their respective seats after they joined the party. The Congress has nominated chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu's wife Kamlesh Thakur in Dehra, while former Independent MLAs face Congress candidates in Hamirpur and Nalagarh. The BJP gained leads in all three constituencies during the recent Lok Sabha polls.Uttarakhand's Manglaur constituency will see a three-way contest between the BSP, Congress, and BJP, with the BJP never having won the Muslim and Dalit-dominated seats. The Badrinath assembly bypoll will be a direct fight between the BJP's Rajendra Bhandari, who recently switched from the Congress, and Congress newcomer Lakhpat Singh Butola. Historically, the party in power has an advantage in Uttarakhand bypolls.The Jalandhar West assembly bypoll in Punjab is a crucial test for chief minister Bhagwant Mann and the AAP after their poor performance in the Lok Sabha polls. The multi-cornered fight features candidates from the AAP, Congress, and BJP, with Mann actively campaigning for the AAP candidate. The BJP also aims to secure a victory after failing to win any seats in the recent Lok Sabha elections.","Voting for the byelections in 13 Assembly seats across seven states commenced at 7 am on Wednesday.

July 11, 2024 (as of today):

The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET)-UG 2024, a vital exam for medical aspirants in India, has faced significant controversy. Allegations of question paper leaks, the awarding of "" grace marks ,"" and concerns over exam integrity have led to a series of legal battles reaching the Supreme Court .During the hearing on July 8, Chief Justice DY Chandrachud stated that ordering a re-test for nearly 24 lakh students would be a last resort.Many of these aspirants, he noted, come from poor families and cannot afford the additional travel expenses unless absolutely necessary. Here's a comprehensive timeline of events that have unfolded so far:The National Testing Agency (NTA) conducts the NEET-UG exam for over 24 lakh students across 4,750 centers in 571 cities, including 14 abroad.A petition alleging irregularities in the exam reaches the Supreme Court. The petition raises concerns about a possible question paper leak.The much-awaited NEET-UG results are declared, raising eyebrows amidst an unusually high number of toppers (67 students). Additionally, reports surface about the award of ""grace marks"" to a specific group of students, further fueling suspicion.Discontent with the results spills onto the streets as students and parents protest across the country. Demands for a re-test and re-evaluation gain momentum.The controversy intensifies as multiple petitions are filed in the Supreme Court, urging a fresh examination due to alleged irregularities. Political leaders also join the chorus, demanding a thorough investigation.Taking cognizance of the situation, the Supreme Court issues a notice to the NTA and the Central Government, seeking their response on the allegations surrounding the exam. The court acknowledges the potential compromise of the exam's sanctity.In a significant development, the Supreme Court orders a re-examination for the 1,563 students who received ""grace marks."" The court emphasizes the need to uphold fairness and transparency in the selection process.The Education Minister vehemently denies allegations of corruption surrounding the exam, asserting the integrity of the process. However, the government agrees to cooperate with the ongoing investigations.Amidst the ongoing controversy, a new petition is filed in the Supreme Court, demanding a re-evaluation of all answer sheets to ensure a level playing field.The Education Minister concedes to irregularities in the exam, acknowledging a lapse in security protocols. This admission further fuels public outrage.The Supreme Court defers its decision on whether to order a CBI probe into the alleged malpractices and paper leaks. The court also considers the NTA's plea to consolidate all NEET-related petitions under its jurisdiction.In a separate development, the University Grants Commission National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET), another crucial exam conducted by the NTA, faces cancellation due to concerns over its integrity. This incident further raises questions about the functioning of the NTA.The Supreme Court directs Bihar and Gujarat police to submit a detailed report on the investigation into the alleged NEET-UG paper leak. Notably, the court refrains from ordering a nationwide re-test for all students, acknowledging the potential hardship it would cause.The Supreme Court continues its crucial hearing on the NEET-UG controversy. The Chief Justice emphasizes that a re-test for nearly 24 lakh students would be a last resort, highlighting the financial burden it would place on families. The court emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation and a full-disclosure report before reaching a final decision.The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold its next hearing on the NEET-UG matter.

MEERUT/NEW DELHI: A second-year BA student of Delhi University 's School of Open Learning was allegedly abducted from near his home in northeast Delhi, taken to Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh and beaten to death on Saturday. The family accused of killing the boy, Himanshu Sharma, claimed he had raped their 19-year-old daughter and had been blackmailing her. The boy's mother refuted the charges.Police have filed an FIR against seven people.The mother of the 20-year-old man , Rajni Sharma, said, ""The allegations are a lie. There was no woman involved."" His uncle, Anil Kumar Sharma, added, ""Himanshu received a call from the girl's phone on Saturday. Once he left home, four to five of her family members abducted him to Baghpat, killed him.""While Baghpat Kotwali circle officer Harish Bhadauria confirmed the arrest of two in the case, NP Singh, ASP, Baghpat, said, ""In her complaint, the girl's mother claimed her daughter was being blackmailed by Himanshu after he had raped her.""The girl confided in her brother, who stays in a village in Baghpat. The brother and some relatives reached Delhi, lured the youth with a message from the woman's phone, abducted him and brought him to Baghpat. They intended to teach him a lesson, but the beating went too far,"" said ASP Baghpat.The FIR accessed by TOI lists seven members of the girl's family, including her mother. They have been booked under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita's sections 140 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder or for ransom etc), 103 (1) (murder).For the past 12 years, Rajni had been raising her two children, Himanshu and his younger sister, on her own after her husband abandoned the family. She runs a small grocery shop and stitches clothes to make ends meet in northeast Delhi's New Usmanpur. Himanshu's mother claimed that feeling a sense of unease around 5pm on Saturday, after her son had left home after being ""invited to a birthday party"", she called Himanshu, only to find his phone switched off. ""I waited for him until around 10pm and then alerted my relatives about my missing son,"" said Rajni. ""Around 10.30pm, a woman who lives in the neighbourhood and whose son had phoned Himanshu called me to her house.""There, Rajni claimed, the woman told her that her son had been kidnapped.The woman also made a video call to people she knew in which they showed Himanshu in their custody and said they would kill him.""We knew the woman well since she often came to our house,"" said Rajni. ""The woman told me that if I wanted to see my son again, I should accompany her.""The woman took Rajni to a forest in Baghpat. ""We saw a car bearing Delhi number plate there,"" Rajni claimed. ""My son was in the car with blood spattered everywhere."" She was preparing to take her son to hospital when a police control room van arrived and nabbed two of the accused.Asked whether Himanshu was in a relationship with the girl as alleged by the accused, the Sharma family insisted they weren't aware of such a thing. A weeping Rajni said, ""Our dreams have been completely crushed. If they had problems, why didn't they speak to me first? Did they have to kill him?","Himanshu Sharma, 20, was allegedly abducted from near his home in northeast Delhi. He was taken to Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh and beaten to death on Saturday.

Job cuts due to “different economic reality”: Google CEO Sundar Pichai

Job cuts at Microsoft for restructuring and investments in key areas

Layoffs at IBM, Salesforce and other companies

The tech industry's layoffs haven't stopped. After starting in 2023, many companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook parent Meta and Amazon, among others, are still cutting jobs in 2024. Recently, Microsoft laid off a bunch of people in product and program management roles, impacting multiple teams and geographies. Notably, despite these cuts, major tech companies keep releasing new artificial intelligence (AI) features and products.Here we have listed a few reasons that CEOs of these tech giants have provided for job cuts .The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is among the first tech giants that announced job cuts. On the first round of industry-wide layoffs, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview with “Morning Brew Daily” in February that the company overhired during the pandemic and later realised the benefits of a leaner workforce, leading to more layoffs.Thousands of employees were laid off in Zuckerberg's “year of efficiency,” in 2023.""It was obviously really tough. We parted with a lot of talented people we cared about. But in some ways, actually becoming leaner kind of makes the company more effective,” Zuckerberg said in the interview. (via Business Insider)For Google there are multiple reasons, and also conducted multiple rounds of layoffs, with most recent being in its Cloud unit at the end of May.In 2023, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the company experienced “dramatic growth” during the pandemic, leading to hiring “for a different economic reality” than what was last year. Then in May this year, Pichai told Bloomberg that the company is removing some teams completely to “improve velocity.”He pointed out that the first half of the year will see more job cuts, which will be at a slower pace in the second half.He noted that the company is also “reallocating people” to its “highest priorities”, which include AI projects, like the creation of ARM-based CPUs, development as well as implementation of Gemini across Google and Google Workspace apps.Google isn't the only one to restructure its workforce to make room for AI – its AI rival Microsoft also has ‘blamed’ the new technology for job cuts.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a memo last year said the company while consumers are also optimising their digital spends, the onset of new technology is forcing the company to take such a stand.“First, as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we're now seeing them optimise their digital spend to do more with less. At the same time, the next major wave of computing is being born with advances in AI, as we're turning the world's most advanced models into a new computing platform,” Nadella said, adding that the company will continue to hire in “key strategic areas.”In May 2023, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna predicted AI and automation replacing 30% of HR and non-customer facing roles within five years. The company laid off employees in March 2024.Discord CEO Jason Citron mentioned in a January memo that the company's workforce had grown five times since 2020 – which may be linked to recent layoffs.Just like Zuckerberg, Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff blamed over-hiring during the pandemic for layoffs in 2023. He stated revenue grew, but the economic downturn required a smaller workforce.Dropbox CEO Drew Houston, in a 2023 layoff announcement, said their next phase needed a different skill set focused on AI and early-stage product development.","Google, Microsoft, Facebook parent Meta and Amazon, among others, are still cutting jobs in 2024.

She said Chandigarh, Goa, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Kerala had fully complied with the SC's direction.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said it was unfortunate that states had not complied with the order. ""We had warned of coercive steps in the event of non-compliance. We are now compelled to take it as despite repeated efforts, SAAs have not been set up in each district. Chief secretaries of all defaulting states and UTs shall file compliance affidavits on or before Aug 30, failing which they shall remain present personally before the SC to explain why contempt of court proceedings be not initiated against them,"" the bench ordered.Bhati said since the intervention of the court to expedite woefully slow adoption process, which is further marred by absence of infrastructure and mechanism to identify and register children legally free for adoption, the process has picked up and the Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA) has achieved a record 4,029 adoptions by couples.In 2019-20, a total of 3,745 orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children were adopted through CARA, in 2020-21 it was 3,559, in 2021-22, it was 3,405, in 2022-23 it was 3,441 and 2023-24 a total of 4,029 such children were adopted.","Supreme Court threatens contempt proceedings against chief secretaries of defaulting states.

Mumbai BMW hit-and-run case: Juhu bar's license suspended for serving liquor to 23-year-old accused Mihir Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-bmw-hit-and-run-case-juhu-bars-license-suspended-for-serving-liquor-to-23-year-old-accused-mihir-shah/articleshow/111613780.cms,"MUMBAI: The state excise administration has suspended the license of a Juhu-Tara Road bar that served hard liquor to Mihir Shah , who had not yet attained the age of 25 years. This is a basic criterion for serving or drinking whisky, rum, vodka, or similar Indian-made foreign liquors (IMFLs) in the state. The bar premises have been sealed until the next hearing.According to excise officials, Mihir, who is 23-years-old, is the culprit in the Worli hit-and-run case.The excise department also found various irregularities with the bar, named Don Giovanni Restaurant (Jobel Hospitalities Pvt Ltd bearing license number FL3,1489), aside from serving liquor to the underage Shah. Interestingly, on the cash memo or receipt, the bar was named Vice-Global Tapas Bar , located on Juhu Tara Road opposite Juhu Church Road.Following the Worli hit-and-run, this is the first action taken by the excise department, with more likely to follow. After the Porsche mishap in Pune, which killed two young students due to a drunk minor, around 60 bars across the Mumbai metropolitan region were closed for 5 to 10 days as punishment for not following closure timings, offering liquor to underage patrons, and not issuing a day's drinking permit to them. This action was part of the license suspension punishment.A notice issued by the suburban district collector to the Juhu bar on behalf of the state excise revealed that during interrogation, it was found that Dhruv Jawahar Dedhiya and three others, including Shah, had entered the bar premises and were served hard liquor. Mihir, son of Shiv Sena leader Rajesh Shah, has been prima facie found responsible for ramming his BMW into a couple's bike, killing a woman who was thrown a considerable distance from the accident spot due to the impact of his car.It may be mentioned here that post-Porsche incident in Pune, the state excise commissioner, Vijay Suryawanshi, had issued stringent directives to all bars and liquor shops across the state to install CCTVs to monitor their entrances and counters in real-time for underage customers and closure timings by state excise officials. However, the monitoring and vigilance of all the bars and shops in the city and the state seem to be far from meeting expectations.The license of the Juhu bar where Mihir had liquor has been suspended until the next hearing before the suburban collector on July 19, said excise officials. Other irregularities found in the investigations by the excise police included selling liquor to non-drinking permit holders in non-permitted areas, non-submission of licensed premises for inspection, mixing the permitted liquor serving area with the non-permitted restaurant zone, discrepancies in the liquor stock permitted versus non-permitted, lack of a liquor transport license for a certain amount of liquor stock, and wrongly naming the bar as Vice Global Tapas Bar on the receipts or cash memos. A hearing on the notice issued to the bar has been scheduled for July 19, and until then, bar operations have been sealed, said excise officials.","State excise administration has suspended the license of a Juhu-Tara Road bar.

In his first speech in Parliament as leader of the opposition, the Congress leader accused BJP leaders of dividing people along communal lines during the debate on the Motion of Thanks for the President's address.In response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that Gandhi had referred to the ""entire Hindu community as violent."" To this, Rahul Gandhi replied, “Narendra Modi ji is not the entire Hindu community, the BJP is not the entire Hindu community, the RSS is not the entire Hindu community”.Swami Avimukteshwarananda, in a now-viral video, asserted that Gandhi's speech did not contradict Hinduism , stating, ""We heard Rahul Gandhi's entire speech. He is clearly saying that there is no place for violence in Hinduism."" ""I saw his entire video and found out that he had not said anything wrong,"" Swami Avimukteshwarananda replied when a journalist sought his views on Rahul's remarks in Parliament.Prashant Bhushan, senior lawyer and activist, posted the video on X, and said, ""Shankaracharya pointing out that Rahul didn’t say anything against Hindu religion. The channels & BJP IT cell spreading disinformation against him should be prosecuted.""The Shankaracharya also pointed out that spreading only a part of Gandhi's statement was incorrect and called for the punishment of those responsible for doing so. “Spreading half-truths by editing speeches is a crime, and such people should be punished, whether they are from a newspaper or a channel … Later, Rahul Gandhi clarified that his statement was directed at the party led by the Centre, alleging that they are promoting violence under the guise of religion,” the Shankaracharya added.Priyanka Gandhi, Congress MP, also defended her brother, saying, ""My brother (Rahul) can never speak against Hindus.

Religious imbalance

'

NEW DELHI: RSS-linked magazine Organiser Weekly , in its latest edition, may have echoed the concerns of opposition on the possible adverse political impact of delimitation on the southern states - which Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin had once described as a ""Damocles Sword"" hanging over the state.An editorial published in the magazine flags both regional and religious imbalances linked to population growth and demands a comprehensive national population control policy .""Regional imbalance is another critical dimension that will impact the delimitation process of the Parliamentary Constituencies in the future. The States from the West and South are doing relatively better regarding population control measures and, therefore, fear losing a few seats in Parliament if the base population is changed after the census . Hence, we need policies to ensure that population growth does not disproportionately impact any single religious community or region, which can lead to socio-economic disparities and political conflicts,"" the article titled ""Demography, Democracy and Destiny"" reads.This is exactly what the southern leaders fear post Census, which is likely to happen in the third term of PM Modi. Union home minister Amit Shah had in September last year asserted that census and delimitation will begin soon after the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Delimitation means the process of fixing the number of seats and boundaries of territorial constituencies in each state for Lok Sabha and legislative assemblies based on the population as determined by the latest Census. It also includes determining seats to be reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in these houses. Article 82 and 170 of the Constitution provide that the number of seats in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies as well as its division into territorial constituencies shall be readjusted after each Census.The first delimitation was done in 1952 following the 1951 census which fixed Lok Sabha seats to 494. The next one came in 1963 following the reorganisation of states in 1956, which saw the number of Lok Sabha seats go up to 522. The third and last delimitation, carried out in 1973, raised the number of Lok Sabha seats to 543, which remains till this day.The debate around delimitation began after the Women's Reservation Bill was passed by Parliament last year. The landmark Bill tied its implementation to the delimitation of the Lok Sabha and all state assembly constituencies based on the first Census data after the law was enacted.Several leaders of the south have voiced concern over losing political heft in Parliament after the process of delimitation. While Stalin had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allay the fears of southern states, K T Rama Rao, former minister of Telangana, had called for united action by all political parties of the south against the ""injustice"" being done through the process of delimitation.These leaders fear the north getting a bigger share of parliamentary constituencies because of their higher population density and the south losing its clout substantially because of effectively implementing population control measures.And while the article highlights the opposition's concerns on regional imbalance, it slams leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee for ignoring the perils of religious imbalance citing the growth of Muslim population in some states.""There is a significant Muslim population growth in certain areas, especially bordering districts. The bordering States of West Bengal, Bihar, Assam and Uttarakhand are witnessing unnatural population growth due to illegal migration across the borders. In a democracy, when numbers are critical regarding representation and demography decides the destiny, we must be even more cautious of this trend,"" the article reads.The article then goes on to slam some of the opposition leaders for their appeasement politics.""Politicians like Rahul Gandhi can afford to insult Hindu sentiments now and then, Mamata can play the blatant Muslim card even to accept the atrocities on women by the Islamists, and Dravidian parties can take pride in abusing the Sanatan Dharma only because of their confidence in the consolidation of so-called minority vote-bank developed with the population imbalance. Learning from the horrors of the Partition and what is happening with the politically correct but socially and culturally incorrect migration from West Asian and African countries, we have to address this issue urgently, as pointed out by various Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh resolutions and judicial pronouncements,"" it reads.","RSS-linked magazine Organiser Weekly may have echoed the concerns of opposition on the possible adverse political impact of delimitation on the southern states.

The IJMR study said unnecessary prescription of antibiotics in such a case increases the risk of antibiotic resistance, adverse drug reactions and the cost of treatment; thus, putting the prescription in the category of unacceptable deviation. An acceptable deviation would include incomplete prescriptions with respect to formulation, dose, duration and frequency.In the study, researchers analysed 4,838 prescriptions issued by doctors posted at the outpatient departments of tertiary care hospitals across the country where the 13 Indian Council of Medical Research Rational Use of Medicine Centres are located.All prescribers were post-graduates in their respective disciplines & on average were in practice for four to 18 years.Researchers found OPDs having maximum deviations was community medicine, followed by ENT & paediatrics.

NEW DELHI: The Congress has continued with its offensive against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address in Parliament last week.

""This is factually incorrect. The Congress vote share increased in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Telangana etc.,"" Tagore was quoted as saying in his letter to Om Birla.The Congress MP also termed as ""grossly misleading"" Modi's remarks that ""no bullet proof jackets [were provided] for the Army during the Congress' time"".

A day after his hug with Putin sparked outrage in the West, PM Narendra Modi rapped the Russian president publicly as he told him peace talks could not succeed in the shadow of guns, underlining the need for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine .Modi also vented the global community's anger over a Russian missile strike on Ukraine's largest children hospital on the day he landed in Moscow for his first visit to Russia in five years.""Any person who believes in humanity feels pain when people die, and especially when innocent children die... the heart bleeds (hriday chhalni ho jata hai), and I had the opportunity to talk about these issues with you yesterday,"" Modi told Putin in the Kremlin, in the presence of reporters, just before official summit talks began.Ukrainian president Zelensky had called India's engagement with Putin a ""huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts"".PM Modi Tuesday made clear India's stance on the war in Ukraine, and as he raised concerns about the impact of the conflict on Global South, the PM softened his message, saying he had heard Russian prez Putin's ""frank"" views on peace, which inspired hope in him.""As a friend, I've always told you that peace is essential for our future generations. But I also know that no solution can be found on battlefield. Solutions and peace talks will not be successful under the shadow of guns, bombs and bullets. We must find a way to peace through dialogue,"" Modi told Putin, adding that fresh ideas and a new thinking had emerged from his talks with the Russian president on Monday.Modi's remarks followed an unprecedented blowback from Ukraine and US to his embrace of the Russian President. US state department said it had raised concerns with India about Russia-India ties and that it wanted Modi to ask Putin to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.While reiterating all possible support and contribution for any peace effort, Modi said he wanted to assure both Russia and the world that India was in favour of peace.Modi's comments about children are of particular significance as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky had used the attack on the hospital - Russia has denied any role in it - to attack the Indian PM. Foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra later said Modi was ""categorical"" in expressing concern at the loss of lives in the attacks Monday, particularly of children.According to Indian govt sources, Modi's overriding message to Putin was that there couldn't be a solution on battlefield, much like his ""this isn't the era of war"" remark before Russian president in Samarkand in 2022.In his remarks, Putin said he appreciated Modi's efforts to find ways to resolve the crisis through peaceful means. Modi's emphasis on peace talks sans violence is also important as it doubles down on the international community's call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. India remains the only major country, apart from China, to not have condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine.That Modi was looking to soothe frayed nerves in the West was obvious when he said the world was focused on the meet and was drawing meanings from it. The PM's remarks before Putin seemed aimed at correcting the imbalance, as perceived by the West, in India's position following its decision to skip ministerial-level participation in Swiss peace summit and its refusal to endorse a declaration underlining Ukraine's territorial integrity as basis for any peace process.Even while discussing cooperation under the game-changing initiative on critical and emerging technology, the US has made it clear to India there should not be any leakage of sensitive and dual-use technology to Russia.","Modi: Peace talks can't succeed in the shadow of guns.

However, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said since a five-judge bench had unanimously rejected legalising same-sex marriages, it was the prerogative of the reconstituted five-judge bench to decide the merit of these review petitions in chamber.The CJI said, ""The Constitution bench is seized of the review petitions, which will be heard in chamber on Wednesday.
