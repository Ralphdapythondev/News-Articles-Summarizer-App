BJP (Poonam Mahajan)Ujjwal Nikam (BJP), Varsha Gaikwad (Cong)The special public prosecutor for 26/11 trial, Ujjwal Nikam, has been nominated by BJP in place of sitting MP Poonam Mahajan. Nikam, who formally joined the saffron party in April, faces a tough battle in this constituency. His rival is four-time Congress MLA and the party’s Mumbai chief Varsha Gaikwad, a legislator from neighbouring Dharavi assembly seat.North Central, which stretches from Bandra to Santacruz and Kurla, has a cosmopolitan mix that includes Maharashtrians, North Indians, East Indian Christians, Muslims and Parsis. There was a demand within the local Congress to field a minority candidate, but that wasn’t met. Gaikwad has the advantage of experience in election campaigning as well as the support of Shiv Sena (UBT) whose leader Uddhav Thackeray has his residence here. Nikam, the man who prosecuted Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab, also has BJP’s ground network backing him.r: Shiv Sena (Hemant Godse)Hemant Godse (Shiv Sena), Rajabhau Waje (Shiv Sena UBT), Shantigiri Maharaj (Ind)Hemant Godse, who has been winning from Nashik from 2014, is now locked in battle with his former party colleague and UBT Sena nominee Rajabhau Waje, former Sinnar MLA. Getting a nomination for this prestigious seat wasn’t smooth sailing for Godse, who had to fend off Mahayuti partners, BJP and NCP, which were both keen to contest from here. A prominent face in the ring was NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who claimed that BJP’s central leadership had proposed his name. Godse now has to ensure that parties in the governing coalition act in cohesion. He will also hope that people in the onion growers’ belt respond positively to the Centre’s recent withdrawal of export ban. Waje will rely on Sena supporters backing Thackeray and discontent among farmers. Complicating matters for both is Shantigiri Maharaj, a seer who has a sizeable following in Nashik.Shiv Sena (Rajan Vichare)Naresh Mhaske (Shiv Sena), Rajan Vichare (Shiv Sena UBT)Mahayuti announced its candidate for this seat, which covers Thane city and parts of Navi Mumbai, late as Sena and BJP were both eyeing it. Angered after Sena was handed the nomination, Navi Mumbai strongman Ganesh Naik’s supporters followed up with a spate of resignations. Though the rift was resolved in days, it’s yet to be seen if there’s any long-term impact of the tussle. The coalition’s eventual pick, Naresh Mhaske, had to make up for lost time while Sena UBT’s Rajan Vichare had a headstart as the constituency’s sitting MP. What may still work from Mhaske – the former mayor of Thane – is that he’s fighting from CM Eknath Shinde’s home turf. In this direct Sena vs Sena fight, a win is a must for both parties who want to establish their claim that they are the real Shiv Sena.BJP (Locket Chatterjee)Locket Chatterjee (BJP), Rachana Banerjee (TMC), Manadip Ghosh (CPI-M)Two Tollywood faces square off here, among the handful in these Lok Sabha elections in which both contestants are women. In Trinamool colours is actor Rachna Banerjee while BJP has once again fielded incumbent Locket Chatterjee in a constituency that witnessed the rise of Mamata Banerjee as a force against three decades of CPM rule with the Singur agitation against Tata’s Nano factory. After BJP’s 2019 Lok Sabha win, Trinamool Congress clawed its way back in the 2021 state assembly polls and the 2023 panchayat polls, largely negating gains made by BJP. Though a debutante, Rachna is a household name in the state, courtesy her hugely successful TV show, ‘Didi No. 1’ and Trinamool has thrown its might behind her to wrest the constituency back.BJP ( Rajiv Pratap Rudy )Rohini Acharya Yadav ( RJD ), Rajiv Pratap Rudy (BJP)Famous as the birthplace of socialist leader Jayprakash Narayan, this constituency has been with BJP for the past decade. This time, though, the contest may not be a cakewalk for BJP’s Rajiv Pratap Rudy, former Union MoS for skill development. He is up against Lalu Yadav’s daughter Rohini Acharya, who first came into spotlight after donating her kidney to the RJD patriarch in Dec 2022. Lalu, who was elected from Chhapra (later Saran) in 1977 on a Janata Party ticket as the youngest parliamentarian at 29, represented this seat four times. After being disqualified from contesting elections following his conviction in the fodder scam, he fielded his wife Rabri Devi in 2014 and his samdhi Chandrika Rai in 2019, but both lost. Four assembly segments of the seat are currently represented by RJD and two by BJP.BJP (Shantanu Das)Shantanu Thakur (BJP), Biswajit Das (TMC)In this Matua heartland, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) promise set the agenda in 2019 LS polls, handing BJP a win. Two years later, in the 2021 assembly poll that TMC swept, Bongaon remained firmly with BJP, handing the party wins in six of the seven assembly segments. Five years on, CAA remains at the core of the campaign here. The difference – it was a promise in 2019 and is a reality now. And yet, there is anxiety about the test that every applicant must pass. TMC has pitted a BJP turncoat MLA, Biswajit Das against the incumbent Shantanu Thakur, junior Union minister and descendant of Matua guru Harichand Thakur. TMC, earlier his year, nominated Shantanu’s aunt Mamata Bala Thakur as a Rajya Sabha MP.BJP (Lallu Singh)Lallu Singh (BJP), Awadhesh Prasad (SP), Sachidanand Pandey (BSP)In this constituency that includes Ayodhya, two-time BJP MP Lallu Singh is banking on the euphoria of Ram temple along with govt’s ‘vikas’ theme, to score a hat-trick. A Thakur and an accused in the Babri demolition case, Singh was a five-time MLA from Ayodhya assembly seat between 1991 and 2007. He is pitted against Awadhesh Prasad of SP and Sachidanand Pandey of BSP. A Dalit and former minister in SP govt, Prasad is a nine-time MLA from erstwhile Sohawal and now Milkipur. SP has experimented by fielding a Dalit to cash in on the substantial presence of SC voters here. The entry of former IPS officer Arvind Sen, son of threetime Faizabad MP Mitrasen Yadav, as CPI candidate has made this contest interesting. Mitrasen had won the seat in 1989 for CPI, in 1998 (for SP) and 2004 (BSP).BJP (Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh)Karan Bhushan Singh (BJP), Ram Bhagat Mishra (SP), Narendra Pandey (BSP)Carved out of five assembly seats of Bahraich and Gonda, this constituency was in the news till the last day of nomination due to its association with six-time MP and former wrestling federation president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who was accused of sexual harassment by several women wrestlers. After days of suspense, BJP decided to go with his younger son Karan. Singh’s elder son Prateek is already an MLA from Gonda. Singh, who won thrice from Kaiserganj (2009, 2014 and 2019), and from Gonda (1991, 1999) and Balrampur (2004), wields considerable influence. A law graduate, Karan is a national-level double trap shooter and was named president of UP Wrestling Association. He takes on SP candidate, lawyer Ram Bhagat Mishra, and BSP’s Narendra Pandey, who hopes to cash in on the presence of Brahmin voters here.","The special public prosecutor for 26/11 trial, Ujjwal Nikam, has been nominated by BJP in place of sitting MP Poonam Mahajan.

BJP hopes onions won’t leave it weepy in Dindori,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-hopes-onions-wont-leave-it-weepy-in-dindori/articleshow/110259048.cms,"NASHIK: In the heart of the country’s ‘onion bowl’, Lasalgaon, Ganesh Kokane produces more than 200 quintals of the kitchen staple every year. Auctioning them for Rs 2,500-Rs 3,000 per quintal at APMC mandi would cover his expenses and, in good times, even fetch him a good profit. However, last Nov, unseasonal rains wreaked havoc as the crop was ready for harvest.All he could salvage from his 25 acres was a meagre 25 quintals.Then, before Kokane could recover from the blow, the Centre announced a ban on export of onions in the first week of Dec. “I was forced to sell off my stock for Rs 1,000 a quintal. It was a double whammy,” Ganesh said.But his ordeal had just begun.As moneylenders turned up the heat on Kokane, he was forced to find other sources of income. He finally ended up as a labourer at the APMC.“I blame the Union govt for my plight. Even though it lifted the embargo later on, it did not help improve the wholesale prices,” he said. Now, he earns a paltry Rs 40 for unloading onions from farmers ’ tractors and loading them on to traders’ vehicles. He handles about 10-15 vehicles daily.Kokane’s is not an isolated case. Distress and anger are palpable among nearly 8 lakh voters who are directly or indirectly associated with onion cultivation in the Dindori LS seat, which comprises six assembly segments —Nandgaon , Kalwan, Yeola, Chandwad, Niphad, and Dindori. Voting here is on May 20.At the receiving end of the ire is BJP candidate and Union minister Bharati Pawar , who is under immense pressure to retain the seat that the saffron party has held since 2009.Shiv Sena MLA from Nandgaon, Suhas Kande, said Mahayuti bigwigs are working overtime to contain farmers’ resentment. “But in no way will (Bhaskar) Bhagare’s victory help stabilise prices. Organisationally, Mahayuti is strong and that alone will ensure Bharati Pawar’s victory.”Bhagare, a schoolteacher, is the NCP (SCP) nominee. Party insiders say their chief Sharad Pawar picked him for his clean image and popularity.A BJP politician, who did not want to be named, said farmers snub them when they visit villages for campaigning. “To placate them, we are highlighting the multiple schemes run by the Centre, including the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi that provides Rs 6,000 annually to marginal farmers.”In April, residents of Malwadi put up a board requesting the current MP not to visit their village. “Before the ban came into effect, we were getting Rs 2,500-Rs 3,000 per quintal. Now, prices have dropped while fertilisers and petrol have become dearer,” said Ganesh Ahire of Nandgaon taluk.While accepting that Bharati Pawar faces the ire of onion growers, a state Cabinet minister said: “The unseasonal rain severely hit the crop in Dindori. Had the Centre not banned exports, there would’ve been huge shortages in the country. That would’ve complicated matters for NDA, especially in urban areas.”What has further queered the pitch for BJP is CPI(M) nominee Je eva Pandu Gavit’s withdrawal from the race. CPI(M) had fielded Gavit in 2019, too and he had got more than one lakh votes. Anticipating that Gavit might repeat his performance and take away anti-BJP votes, Sharad Pawar convinced the CPI(M) brass to pull him from the race.Bharati Pawar, however, claims the opposition is misleading farmers. “When Sharad Pawar was the Union agriculture minister under UPA, prices of onion had dropped drastically several times. But since this is election season, the opposition is raking up the issue,” she said.BJP had poached Bharati Pawar from NCP before the 2019 elections, giving her the ticket instead of the then MP Harischandra Chavan.Bhagare, a political greenhorn, faced the setback of four party MLAs switching to deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s NCP camp. But he hopes farmers’ ire will see anti-BJP voters rally around him. “Given the anger among onion growers, my opponent’s defeat is certain. Though our MLAs have deserted us, we are counting on Sharad Pawar’s popularity among the farmers,” Bhagare said at a campaign rally.",Unseasonal rains wreaked havoc as the crop was ready for harvest. Centre announced a ban on export of onions in the first week of December. Bharati Pawar is under immense pressure to retain the seat that the saffron party has held.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110259042,imgsize-83996,width-400,resizemode-4/110259042.jpg"

Revival instinct: ‘Little Europe’ clings to last vestiges of its heritage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/revival-instinct-little-europe-clings-to-last-vestiges-of-its-heritage/articleshow/110258944.cms,"KOLKATA: Much before the British founded Calcutta (now Kolkata), “Little Europe” had already started taking shape in pockets of Gangetic Bengal.The first European colony in Bengal was established by the Portuguese in Bandel on the Ganges riverbank in the early 16th century. The Dutch followed in Chinsurah, the French in Chandannagar (formerly Chandernagore), the British in Calcutta and, finally, the Danes in Serampore.These former colonial enclaves, which are now part of the Serampore and Hooghly parliamentary constituencies, will vote today.The approximately 20 lakh electors in these seats want their representatives and both state and central govts to revive tourism, restore the architectural relics, preserve their heritage and renew trade and commerce.The towns, roughly 60km north of Kolkata, started flourishing in trade and commerce and witnessed an influx of capital, becoming home to some of the biggest riverine ports . The foreign rulers also brought in their cuisine, culture and architecture and constructed churches and mansions.With Kolkata acquiring more significance under the British in the 18th century, the “Little Europe” settlements were relegated to the background as their magnificent architectural heritage began crumbling and their cuisine disappeared and trade dwindled.“These places have been reduced to being mofussil (suburban) towns that are bursting at the seams. The state of infrastructure is abysmal, the drainage system is a mess and unplanned real estate development has affected the quality of living,” said Soumen Banerjee, a former English professor at Serampore College, which was built in 1827.The locals feel the areas have great potential for tourism by virtue of their tangible and intangible heritage.“These towns have been holding on to traces of their European heritage in public spaces, buildings and culture. The colonial architecture , cultural practices and memories in “Little Europe” are now at risk due to rapid urbanisation. They need urgent conservation measures and a solid revival plan,” said Susmita Mukherjee, who runs a café in Bandel.West Bengal Tourism is promoting these areas along the Hooghly and showcasing the settlements of European traders around its banks.To preserve and document the heritage, UK and India have jointly funded The Hugli River of Cultures Project.A team of academic researchers, who reside in and around Chandannagar, and partner teams from the University of Liverpool and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, are collaborating on the project.“Several monuments, including churches and public spaces, have already been restored. The number of tourists visiting these places has also risen,” said an official of the tourism department.Restoration of The Denmark Tavern, using traditional construction techniques and materials, has not only drawn tourists and spurred public interest but also rekindled hopes for the restoration of other heritage monuments in a way that benefits the local economy. The tavern, dating back to the 1780s, served as a hangout offering drinks, books and recreational activities to European visitors.“The restoration of the Danish tavern can be used as an example for other places of historical importance,” said Anirban Ghosh, who conducts heritage walks in various areas of “Little Europe”.","The first European colony in Bengal was established by the Portuguese in Bandel on the Ganges riverbank in the early 16th century.

Eknath Shinde banks on connect in ground zero of battle for Balasaheb legacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eknath-shinde-banks-on-connect-in-ground-zero-of-battle-for-balasaheb-legacy/articleshow/110258894.cms,"THANE: Supporters of the erstwhile undivided Shiv Sena may still be in two minds as to which faction to favour with their vote. However, in Thane on Mumbai’s outskirts, it is not unusual to find Shiv Sainiks who take part in rallies taken out by both factions.“Deep inside, Sainiks know what is right and wrong for them and will express it through their vote on June 4,” says an old-timer.Whether to stick with Uddhav Thackeray or shift allegiance to CM Eknath Shinde is a dilemma that is central to these LS polls in Maharashtra. In all, there are 13 seats where the two Senas are pitted against each other. And, as the polls in Maharashtra enter the final leg, Thane – a citadel of the undivided Shiv Sena and a rapidly growing urban cluster – is likely to see a close fight on May 20.Two of the district’s three LS seats — Kalyan and Thane — are represented by Sena MPs: Kalyan by CM’s son Dr Shrikant Shinde and Thane by Uddhav’s nominee Rajan Vichare. Control over the region will be seen as passing to the rightful claimant to the legacy of the late Anand Dighe, Sena stalwart who grew the party in the district under Balasaheb Thackeray’s leadership. In recent years, Dighe has been deified through a Marathi film that portrays him as a messiah of the underprivileged.For CM Shinde, who was mentored by Dighe and has spent most of his three-decade-long career nurturing the constituency as his hometown, winning Thane has enormous significance. Apart from helping him retain his salience in state and national politics, it will give him the political heft to tackle the upcoming assembly polls in October. Shinde has fielded former mayor and close aide Naresh Mhaske as the Mahayuti candidate from Thane. With the local civic body (which has no elected corporators currently) and at least two assembly segments in Thane city with Shinde’s Sena, Mhaske has the upper hand, though support from BJP, which has an equally strong base here, is crucial.Indeed, the district was largely a BJP stronghold till it was wrested by Shiv Sena in assembly and localbody polls. Using a blend of Hindutva and regional pride, stalwarts such as Dighe and Shinde have held it for nearly 25 years, with the exception of 2009. Of course, it has helped that BJP has not produced a leader of stature in the state for several years now.The district is predominantly an Agri-Koli and Marathi bastion, but is gradually turning cosmopolitan as the industrial and services sectors expand, bringing in a migrant workforce. In all, the Thane region comprises over 18 assembly segments, eight civic bodies and several gram panchayats.“The fight here will show who inherits the legacy of Balasaheb and Dighe. The Thackerays want to avenge the ‘betrayal’ by Shinde in Thane, the city where the party won its first civic polls, while Shinde has to justify his rebellion and retain his dominance to strengthen his standing with the BJP brass,” said an observer.Shinde is banking on vote transfer from BJP. In Thane alone, BJP has four MLAs with three more in Kalyan. So, while the Shinde faction has held sway in some of the now-dissolved local bodies, MLAs working under the guidance of the state leadership retain clout in disbursing aid and commissioning public works.During seat-sharing talks, the CM was able to persuade deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis and BJP’s central leadership that there was no way his party could concede Thane (they kept Kalyan too where the CM’s son is the sitting MP). BJP cadre were expected to fall in line, but there is simmering discontent.“Supporters of MLA Geeta Jain from Mira Bhayender and former BJP MLA Ganesh Naik are miffed,” said a BJP supporter. There’s also the case of BJP MLA Ganpat Gaikwad firing on Sena Kalyan unit chief Mahesh Gaikwad inside a police station. “That’s still on the minds of our karyakartas,” he added. Gaikwad is in judicial custody. Shinde’s Thane nominee Mhaske has sought to build bridges and reach out to workers acquainted with him since his days as a youth activist. However, he has a formidable opponent in Rajan Vichare, a two-time MP and Thackeray supporter. There is a sympathy wave for the Thackerays and they are harping on the loyalty factor faced with the organisational might of the Mahayuti.“A prominent part of our campaign is to convey how the traitors deserted the Thackerays in a time of need, which would never have been tolerated by Dighe saheb,” said a Thackeray loyalist. However, sources close to Shinde say he has managed Thane district well for nearly two decades and strengthened his bonds with the public and netas alike. His access to PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah is seen as a plus.“He may not speak much, but his loyalists know he has a plan for everything, including fixing issues raised by the opposition,” says a supporter who is impressed with Shinde’s interactions over chai and vada pav with grassroots workers.Shinde occasionally talks about his humble origin as a first-generation migrant from western Maharashtra who drove autorickshaws for a living. In his trademark spotless white attire, rubbing shoulders with Modi and Shah at rallies, Shinde has been making an emotional pitch: “You’ve supported me all these years. I expect this support even now,” he says.","In all, there are 13 seats where the two Senas are pitted against each other.

comprising Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP (SP) & Congress.Excerpts from the interview:I think Modi's opinion is wrong; it is not a crime to follow your parents' footsteps. Many doctors feel that their son or daughter should take up the medical profession, similar is the case with politicians too. All will depend on his/her professional competence, if he has ability, he will shine in life; all will depend on the capacity and professionalism of the individual.Modi's opinion appears to be unrealistic. Ever since the Lok Sabha elections were declared, he has given a slogan, 'Abki baar, 400 paar' (This time, more than 400 seats). I do not know on what basis he has arrived at a figure of 400, which is very difficult to achieve. I am doubtful if BJP will reach the majority figure in view of severe discontent against NDA across the country. In all southern states, NDA's performance will be dismal. In addition, it will be a disappointing situation for BJP in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and UP among several other states.We, in the INDIA bloc, at the end of four phases of polling, are confident that it should not be difficult for the INDIA bloc to dislodge the Modi-led NDA govt. With regard to our prime ministerial candidate, it will be decided in the meeting of newly elected MPs. A few decades ago, when Morarji Desai was elected as Prime Minister, a decision was taken in the meeting of the MPs. Then Jai Prakash Narayan had taken a lead in the formation of the new govt.Our top priority will be to provide a stable govt, draft a comprehensive action plan for providing remunerative price for agriculture produce, tackle unemployment, and halt farmer suicides and spiralling prices of essential commodities. Above all, halt gross abuse of central agencies. Investigations by ED and CBI is a matter of concern for people from different walks of life.I think Modi is the first Prime Minister who is concentrating on Maharashtra. It appears that he has lost confidence, therefore, has chosen Maharashtra for extensive campaigning. In the past, PMs like Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi would address just one or two election rallies.In my opinion, the performance of Maha Vikas Aghadi will be impressive, it will win at least 50% of the seats. I was stunned and surprised by the language used by the PM during his campaign in Maharashtra. Shockingly, he called me Bhatakti Aatma(wandering soul) and described Shiv Sena (UBT) as fake. Such language is not expected from a PM; he has lowered the dignity of the post. I am not disturbed by the PM's comment. In the past too, social worker Anna Hazare and former BMC official G R Khairnar had levelled serious charges against me, now no one knows the whereabouts of these two persons.In my opinion, even if legislators have joined hands with Ajit Pawar and Eknath Shinde, grassroot-level workers are still with the original parties. I have seen in most of my meetings, there is a massive presence of members of the younger generations. Similar is the case with Shiv Sainiks, they are still loyal to Uddhav Thackeray.It's a fact that my name was in Baramati parliamentary constituency. When I took a lot of interest in the cricket association, I was told that if you are a permanent resident of Mumbai, then only you can contest the election to the association. After one attains the age of 70, one is not eligible to contest the election, then I decided to shift my name from Mumbai to Baramati, my home town.","Sharad Pawar spoke on the formation of INDIA bloc, its priorities and the future of the country.

"PM Modi expresses concern, says stand in solidarity with Iranians",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-expresses-concern-says-stand-in-solidarity-with-iranians/articleshow/110255338.cms,"PM Narendra Modi expressed solidarity with the people of Iran as he said he was deeply concerned by reports regarding Iran Prez Ebrahim Raisi's helicopter flight that crashed in Iran's East Azerbaijan province. ""We stand in solidarity with the Iranian people in this hour of distress, and pray for the well-being of the president and his entourage,"" he said in a post on X late on Sunday, amid fears that Raisi may not have survived the crash.Modi had last met Raisi on the margins of the Brics summit in Johannesburg in Aug 2023. The two leaders had discussed ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation in various fields, including trade and investment, connectivity , energy and counter-terrorism. Iran, along with five other countries, had joined the group in that summit. Raisi had congratulated Modi on the success of Chandrayaan mission and thanked him for India's support for Iran's Brics membership.In line with the ongoing high-level exchanges, which aided India's delicately balanced approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict, foreign minister S Jaishankar had travelled to Iran in Jan for talks with his counterpart Amir Abdollahian, who too was in the same chopper as Raisi.Raisi had also been looking to intensify engagement with India on the Chabahar port. He and Modi wanted to strengthen cooperation to realise the full potential of Chabahar port as a connectivity hub. Apart from the focus on connectivity initiatives, India and Iran have also worked in the recent past to ramp up political cooperation and strong people-to-people ties.In their meeting in Aug, they had decided to fast-track infrastructure cooperation, including the Chabahar project. The two also exchanged views on regional developments, including Afghanistan where both countries are working to ensure the Taliban don't allow terrorist groups to target any country.

NEW DELHI: The fifth phase of the Lok Sabha elections is all set to take place on Monday, with polling in 49 constituencies across six states including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and two Union Territories.In addition to the Lok Sabha elections, voting will also take place in 35 assembly constituencies in Odisha, where chief minister Naveen Patnaik is among the candidates.This phase will determine the electoral fate of several prominent leaders, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Smriti Irani , and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah.Other prominent candidates include Union ministers Piyush Goyal, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, and Shantanu Thakur who are contesting from Mumbai North (Maharashtra), Fatehpur (UP), and Bangaon (WB), respectively. Other notable candidates include LJP (Ram Vilas) leader Chirag Paswan from Hajipur (Bihar), Shiv Sena's Shrikant Shinde from Kalyan (Maharashtra), and BJP's Rajiv Pratap Rudy and RJD president Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya, both from Saran (Bihar).In Uttar Pradesh, five Union ministers are in the fray: Rajnath Singh (Lucknow), Smriti Irani (Amethi), Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, Kaushal Kishor (Mohanlalganj), and Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma (Jalaun). The Lucknow East assembly constituency will also witness a bypoll.Rahul Gandhi, who is contesting from Wayanad in Kerala, is also fighting for Rae Bareli, a traditional stronghold of the Nehru-Gandhi family. His mother, Sonia Gandhi, has represented the constituency since 2004. BJP has fielded UP minister Dinesh Pratap Singh against him. In Amethi, Smriti Irani, who defeated Rahul Gandhi in 2019, is seeking a second term, while the Congress has fielded KL Sharma, an aide of the Gandhi family.Senior BJP leader Rajnath is eyeing a fourth term from Lucknow, facing off against SP MLA Ravidas Mehrotra from Lucknow Central. In the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat, which includes the temple town of Ayodhya, the main contest is between sitting BJP MP Lallu Singh, who is seeking a hat-trick, and Awadhesh Prasad, the SP MLA from Milkipur (SC) assembly constituency in Ayodhya.In Baramulla, Omar Abdullah is contesting against former separatist Sajad Lone, ex-MLA Sheikh Abdul Rashid alias 'Engineer Rashid' (currently lodged in Tihar jail), and the PDP's former Rajya Sabha member Fayaz Ahmad Mir, among 21 other candidates. The constituency has more than 500 centenarians among its 17.37 lakh eligible voters, and political observers expect a high turnout following the huge crowds at election rallies and roadshows in the first major political battle post the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.In Ladakh, Congress candidate Tsering Namgyal, BJP's Tashi Gyalson, and Independent candidate and NC rebel Haji Hanifa Jan are engaged in a close contest.Over 8.95 crore people are eligible to vote in this round, and 9.47 lakh polling officials have been deployed across 94,732 polling stations.The states and UTs covered in this phase include Maharashtra (13 seats), Uttar Pradesh (14 seats), West Bengal (7 seats), Bihar (5 seats), Jharkhand (3 seats), Odisha (5 seats), Jammu and Kashmir (1 seat), and Ladakh (1 seat). This phase is crucial for the BJP, as over 40 of these seats were previously held by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).The Election Commission has called upon city dwellers in Mumbai, Thane, and Lucknow to turn out in higher numbers, as these cities have historically shown apathy towards voting. So far, the last four phases have registered a total voter turnout of 66.95 per cent.Security has been stepped up in West Bengal's seven constituencies, which have a history of election-related violence, with over 57 per cent of the polling stations identified as sensitive in this phase.Around 45.1 crore electors have exercised their franchise in the last four phases, with polling for 23 states and Union Territories and 379 seats completed so far.The sixth and seventh phases are scheduled for May 25 and June 1, respectively, with the counting of votes set to take place on June 4.","The fifth phase of the Lok Sabha elections is all set to take place on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday alleged that BJP was running ' Operation Jhaadu ', aiming to arrest all top functionaries of his party to eliminate AAP , as it saw them as a challenge.Kejriwal was addressing party workers before leading a protest march to BJP headquarters following the arrest of his aide, Bibhav Kumar , in the Swati Maliwal assault case.Rajya Sabha MP Raghav Chadha, who had been missing in action for months due to an eye surgery that even led to speculation over his affiliation with the party, was also present. Addressing party workers, he said PM Modi could get all functionaries arrested in one go instead of taking them one by one.He told the cadre to be prepared to face bigger challenges ahead. “The top leaders of our party, all ministers, MLAs, MPs, councillors and office bearers are present here. Why did we have to gather here today? Because the Prime Minister has made up his mind to completely destroy and crush Aam Aadmi Party, for which he has started an operation called 'Operation Jhaadu’,” he said.The CM said that Modi feared AAP, as its work was being discussed all over the country, and it could be a challenge for BJP at the national level and in many states.Kejriwal said every senior functionary of AAP had gone through a trial by fire. “They arrested me, Sanjay Singh, Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain. Yesterday, they even arrested my PA. Raghav Chadha has just come back; now they are saying that he will also be arrested. They are saying that Atishi, Saurabh Bharadwaj and Kailash Gahlot will also be arrested soon,” he said.He said that in the coming days, the party office would be locked. “ED's lawyer has already given a statement in court that AAP’s bank accounts will be frozen immediately after the elections,” the CM said.After the speech, Kejriwal led a march towards BJP’s headquarters and sat on the road as police barricades prevented them from reaching the office. There was heavy police presence on Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg.RS MP Sanjay Singh, ministers Gopal Rai and Kailash Gahlot, and other senior functionaries were present. After staging a protest for around half an hour, they left.Singh said, “As per his promise, Kejriwal himself came with other functionaries of the party to get arrested, but they (BJP) left the ground and ran away.”Gahlot said, “We waited for over half an hour, they could have arrested us. The public is with us, you can see how much love has been given to Kejriwalji and AAP because of the good done by us. Let the investigation continue, and everything will be clear.”Earlier in the day, Delhi Police had ramped up security around BJP’s office.To manage the crowd, multilayer barricades were installed and over 1,000 personnel, besides cops in antiriot gear, paramilitary forces were put in place alongside specialised anti-riot vehicles, apart from patrolling in central Delhi.As a precautionary measure, Delhi Metro closed entry and exit at ITO station.",Kejriwal was addressing party workers before leading a protest march to BJP headquarters.

It’s the grand finale of the Maharashtra grudge match as the subplot in the NDA vs INDIA contest becomes the main theme. In and around India’s commercial capital, the two Senas square off in the most bitter & personal of fights in these Lok Sabha elections . The other big face-offs are in UP & Bengal39 seats, including 13 out of 14 in UP, 11 out of 13 in Maharashtra (excluding 2 Sena candidates who are with Uddhav group), all 5 in Bihar, all 3 in Jharkhand, 3 out of 5 in Odisha, 3 out of 7 in West Bengal and lone seat in Ladakh.Bengal, where it lost 4 of 7 seats polling today last time, and in Odisha.7 seats, including 4 of 7 seats polling today in West Bengal, 2 of 13 seats in Maharashtra (adding 2 Sena candidates with Uddhav group) and Rae Bareli in UP.Almost all the states in this round, but more so in Maharashtra, where it had won only 3 of the 13 seats that go to polls today. Also in Bihar, where it starts with a clean slate.The lone seat polling today in Jammu & Kashmir, which is not possible to categorise as having been won by any party last time since seat boundaries have been redrawn since 2019.This Lok Sabha election’s most complex political arena sees its ﬁnal act today with a high-voltage Sena vs Sena showdown, a ﬁght that’s as much about political relevance as it is about Balasaheb’s legacy and prestige for the two protagonists — Uddhav Thackeray and the man who unseated him as CM, Eknath Shinde. Of the 13 remaining seats in the state polling today, six are in India’s commercial capital, Mumbai, the Sena bastion where Uddhav is looking for voters’ stamp of condemnation of the “betrayal” he accuses Shinde of, leading to the party splitting in two. The Shinde group is part of Mahayuti (BJP) and Uddhav’s Sena UBT with MVA (Sharad Pawar’s NCP and Congress). Four of the seats are in the wider Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which includes Shinde’s home turf Thane. Here, Shinde is seeking endorsement of his rebellion. BJP , which did very well here in 2019, will see an advantage, but with two Senas and two NCPs in the mix, it’s a new playing ﬁeld for all parties.The state that votes in all seven phases moves into one of its biggest two rounds today — the next one in Phase 6 — as 14 seats in Awadh, including capital Lucknow, and the entire Bundelkhand (Jalaun, Jhansi, Hamirpur and Banda) go to polls today. In 2019, BJP swept these seats except Rae Bareli. This time, with the Gandhi bastion at the centre, INDIA bloc (Cong & Samajwadi Party) is eyeing a revival here. Other high-proﬁle seats are Faizabad, which includes Ayodhya, and controversial former wrestling federation chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh’s stronghold Kaiserganj. Also keep an eye on Mohanlalganj and Fatehpur from where two Union ministers — Kaushal Kishore and Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, respectively — are contesting.BJP (Rajnath Singh)Rajnath Singh (BJP), Ravidas Mehrotra (SP)Defence minister Rajnath Singh inherited the legacy of Vajpayee in 2014 — after a brief interlude — and is looking for a hat-trick. Vajpayee won the seat on the trot between 1991 and 2004. His Man Friday in Lucknow, Lalji Tandon, won it in 2009, carrying the proverbial ‘khadau’ of Vajpayee. After making his LS debut from Ghaziabad in 2009, Rajnath shifted to the state capital to step into the giant shoes of his mentor. Even two decades after Vajpayee stepped out of active politics, Rajnath doesn’t miss any opportunity to invoke his legacy. He has brought in a slew of projects to the city for sprucing up infrastructure and creating jobs. SP’s Ravidas Mehrotra is an MLA and street ﬁghter, a socialist who ﬁrst became legislator in 1989. His challenge, however, seems feeble in front of Rajnath’s heavy election machinery.BJP (Gopal Shetty)Piyush Goyal (BJP), Bhushan Patil (Shiv Sena UBT)A Rajya Sabha member so far, Union commerce and industries minister Piyush Goyal is making his LS debut from Mumbai, the city he grew up in. With its signiﬁcant Gujarati and middle-class Maharashtrian population, this seat is a BJP stronghold and was nurtured by the party for years before actor Govinda delivered a shock defeat to Ram Naik in 2004. In 2019, Urmila Matondkar contested from here for Congress but was comprehensively beaten by Gopal Shetty. This time, Congress has given the seat to Uddhav’s Sena, which has ﬁelded the relatively low-proﬁle Bhushan Patil. Sena will be hoping to garner Marathi, Muslim and Christian votes, and is banking on the sympathy factor over the killing of its former corporator Abhishek Ghosalkar on FB Live earlier this year. However, this is one seat where the state’s political muddle does not cast a shadow like it does elsewhere because of BJP’s grassroots strength.NC (Mohd Akbar Lone)Omar Abdullah (NC), Sajjad Lone (People’s Conference)Omar Abdullah, who has shifted to this north Kashmir seat from the south (Srinagar), says he is taking on “BJP and the Centre”, who are using all their resources here despite not ﬁelding a candidate in the Valley. The former CM is batting for restoration of full statehood to J&K and has called the nulliﬁcation of Article 370 an “existential challenge”. He says opponent Lone is the “B-team of BJP” while the latter calls Omar a dynast, an “outsider” and a “tourist” in Baramulla. Into this mix comes Sheikh Abdul Rasheed aka Engineer Rashid of Awami Ittehad Party, who is contesting the polls from Tihar jail, where he has been incarcerated since Aug 2019 on terror funding charges. A former aide of Lone, Rashid is a worry for him and PDP candidate Fayaz Mir as he polled over 1 lakh votes in the last LS election and is expected to cut into their share.LJP (Pashupati Kumar Paras)Chirag Paswan (LJP-Ram Vilas), Shiv Chandra Ram (RJD)Socialist bastion Hajipur is one of Bihar’s six Lok Sabha constituencies reserved for SCs. Ram Vilas Paswan represented this seat eight times in his career and lost just twice — in 1984 and 2009. In recent years, the poll narrative in Hajipur has centred around who is the claimant to Paswan’s legacy, son Chirag Paswan or brother Pashupati Kumar Paras, who won from here in 2019 after Paswan offered the seat to him. BJP has decided to fully back Chirag, allotting ﬁve seats in Bihar to Chirag’s faction and none to the Paras camp. Paswan’s party LJP split in 2021. For Chirag then, this is as deep a prestige battle as it gets. PM Modi has campaigned for him, but the battle is an uphill one, with RJD holding three of the six assembly segments and Congress one; ally BJP has the other two.Cong (Sonia Gandhi)Rahul Gandhi (Cong), Dinesh Pratap Singh (BJP), Thakur Prasad Yadav (BSP)After a long wait, Rahul Gandhi chose his mother’s seat as his second contest, alongside Wayanad. He narrowly lost from neighbouring Amethi — another family bastion — against BJP’s Smriti Irani in 2019. Between the two, Rae Bareli is considered the ‘safer’ seat. Rae Bareli ﬁrst elected Rahul’s grandfather Feroze Gandhi to Lok Sabha in 1952. His grandmother Indira Gandhi represented it between 1967 and 1985, barring the 1977 loss to Raj Narayan, while his mother Sonia was MP from 2004 to 2019. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and other INDIA bloc allies have campaigned for Rahul as Congress looks for an improved performance in UP, which is key to Parliament numbers. BJP’s Dinesh Pratap Singh, Congress MLC between 2009 and 2018 and Sonia’s pointsman, jumped ship after a dispute and instantly became BJP’s candidate in 2019. He brought down Sonia’s victory margin from 3 lakh to 1.7 lakh and is once again banking on BJP’s machinery, welfare schemes and his local clout.BJP (Smriti Irani)Smriti Irani (BJP), KL Sharma (Cong)It’s not quite the grudge match of 2019, but still seems to be going down to the last over. With Rahul Gandhi contesting from Rae Bareli, Congress sprung a surprise by ﬁelding KL Sharma, who has been the Gandhis’ Man Friday in the twin constituencies for four decades, from Amethi. Sharma came to Amethi as a member of Rajiv Gandhi’s youth brigade in 1983. Rajiv, who won a bypoll following the demise of his brother Sanjay Gandhi, held the seat till his death in 1991. Sonia Gandhi made her Lok Sabha debut from here in 1999. She shifted to Rae Bareli in 2004, handing Amethi to Rahul, who won the seat thrice before the shock defeat to Smriti Irani in 2019. In the current campaign, Smriti has repeatedly called Rahul a “deserter” but the Congress narrative is that the family loyalist is more than capable of defeating her.","Lok Sabha election in India’s most complex political arena sees its high-voltage Sena vs Sena showdown. Six of the 13 remaining seats in the state polling today are in Mumbai, where Uddhav is looking for voters’ stamp of condemnation of the “betrayal” he accuses Shinde of. The other big face-offs are in UP & Bengal39 seats, including 13 out of 14 in UP.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110258814,imgsize-2059616,width-400,resizemode-4/110258814.jpg"
"Personal touch, spunk and spontaneity: How Priyanka lifted Amethi-Rae Bareli campaign",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/personal-touch-spunk-and-spontaneity-how-priyanka-lifted-amethi-rae-bareli-campaign/articleshow/110258369.cms,"RAE BARELI/AMETHI: Recently, when Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi reached Bachhrawan in Rae Bareli for addressing an evening election gathering, the time window given by the police for the meeting had expired. That meant she couldn’t use the public address system. Undeterred, the star campaigner got the venue’s noisy genset shut down, sat atop her SUV and spoke extempore without a mike, with the crowd providing illumination with mobilephone torches.Videos of the address rapidly went viral (see pic on right).Several election analysts have noted that they are seeing a more spontaneous and articulate Priyanka in these elections. This was evident in her intensive campaign in Rae Bareli and Amethi , where she was canvassing for brother Rahul and Gandhi family’s close associate Kishori Lal Sharma. “Her campaign incorporated a fair dose of randomness and unpredictability. She stopped anywhere and walked up to anyone who welcomed her for an interaction,” said a Congress spokesperson.Most palpably, her taking charge of the campaign energised Congress workers in the twin constituencies. In her maiden address to party workers, Priyanka said they had to pull up their socks and be ready to work 20 hours a day.Those working with Priyanka said ‘Didi’ (as she is affectionately called) led by example. “She began her day with a quick strategy meet and hit the road by 10.30am, returning as late as 11pm,” a team member said.“After returning, she convened meetings to finalise the next day’s schedule and retired only after midnight,” he added. Her speeches generally began with warm greetings and an apology if she had reached the venue late. “Mera abhivadan sweekar kijiye aap sab aur maaf kijiyega thodi si vilamb ke liye. Aapko dhoop mein baithna pada (Please accept my greetings, and apologies for coming late and making you wait in the sun),” she said, at times mentioning the reason for the delay.Her poll pitch has been sharp and she has been quick to respond to barbs and issues raised by the saffron camp. But more than these, Priyanka’s personal touch has added to the enthusiasm of local people and workers.“The respect Priyanka shows to Sharma — who was dubbed as her ‘peon’ by some BJP leaders — has also been appreciated,” said a Congress supporter. “Kishori Bhaiya ne aap sabka bahut khayal rakha hai itne saal. Wo aapke aur humare rishtey ka pul hain. Is baar pratyashi ban ke aaye hain. Hum sab ko mil ke inki jeet sunishchit karni hai (All these years, brother Kishori has acted as a bridge between you and the party leadership. He is the candidate this time and we have to ensure his victory),” Priyanka said during a public meeting.Often in her speeches, Priyanka has swiftly changed gears to aggressively attack BJP, PM Modi and the party’s candidates before softening her tone again to explain to the people the importance of their vote. In a public meeting, she called Amethi and Rae Bareli “her family” and, with teary eyes, narrated how Amethi helped her recover from the tragic death of her father as she went from village to village to build the Congress organisation in 1999 for her mother’s first election.At a meeting in Kamalganj, when a woman talked about the problem of stray cattle while another recalled how she benefited from the self-help group network evolved during Rahul’s tenure as Amethi MP, Priyanka seized the moment to target the saffron camp. “The BJP played politics and got the SHG scheme closed.”During a ‘nukkad sabha’ in Naseerabad, a youth walked up to Priyanka and pointed to a statue of former PM Rajiv Gandhi, urging her to offer floral tributes. Priyanka descended from the stage and almost ran to the statue, with the crowd following her.“She’s running on pure resolve. She barely eats through the day. Foxnuts and ‘nimbu pani’ are her staple. At times, she prefers a ‘parantha achaar’ roll and eats in between public meetings,” said a Congress functionary.",Several election analysts have noted that they are seeing a more spontaneous and articulate Priyanka in these elections. This was evident in her intensive campaign in Rae Bareli and Amethi where she was canvassing for brother Rahul and Gandhi family’s close associate Kishori Lal Sharma. Her taking charge of the campaign energised Congress workers in the twin constituencies.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110258394,imgsize-834631,width-400,resizemode-4/110258394.jpg"

It also remains to be seen whether the Centre will restore the wheat-rice ratio as it was before May 2022.

It's always a possibility that you may look past some key moments in a game when your team is on the winning side in the end, but not when you are a seasoned pro like Dinesh Karthik, who made an interesting analysis, which is hard to deny as a factor that contributed in Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's (RCB) win over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the IPL on Saturday night.The game was played under overcast skies and even got interrupted by rain during RCB innings, after the hosts were put in to bat by CSK, who won the toss at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.Bowling with a ball that repeatedly got wet after rolling on the grass wasn't easy. It was the same for RCB bowlers as they went in to defend a formidable 218/5. While CSK would have loved to win and move into the playoffs, they also had an eye on the 201-run mark, which would have helped them finish in the playoffs bracket even in the face of a defeat.Yash Dayal was asked by RCB captain Faf du Plessis to deliver the final over. With it difficult to grip the wet ball, Dayal faltered off the first delivery, which turned into a juicy full-toss to MS Dhoni on leg-side. The CSK legend helped himself by dispatching it for a 100-metre six that landed outside the stadium.That required a replacement ball to be called for. It was much drier and comparatively easier to grip for the bowler.The six, thus, turned into a blessing in disguise for Dayal, who not only dismissed Dhoni (25 off 13 balls) on the next delivery but also conceded just one run off his last four deliveries to spark off victory celebrations in the RCB camp.Analysing the game in the dressing room after the win, RCB's veteran wicketkeeper-batsman Karthik described that crucial moment in the dying stages of the match.""The best thing to happen today was Dhoni hitting that six outside the ground (because) we got a new ball, which was much better (drier) to bowl with,"" said Karthik, as everyone in the dressing room approved of his analysis.""Yash, that was good bowling. You have a doubt, always bowl a hip-high full-toss on leg-stump...that's a good mantra to follow when the ball is wet,"" he added on a lighter note.He then commended the effort of his teammates, especially for registering six consecutive wins to qualify for the playoffs, when it all looked gloomy having lost seven of their first eight matches of the season.""Other than that, jokes apart, we should be really proud of this journey that we are having. People always remember certain journeys. The way we have come back after 8 games (losing seven of those), we needed to win six (in a row). The way we have come back, I think people will remember this team for a very very special (long) time,"" said Karthik.On a cheeky note, the 38-year-old stumper added: ""Don't be like Andy Flower (head coach) with a glum face. Smile, enjoy, drink, party, have fun.""We have within our grasp to do something where people will remember us for many many decades. They’ll say 'wow, that RCB team was special'.""","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the IPL on Saturday night.

NEW DELHI: Riding high on confidence after securing their first playoffs spot in three years, Sunrisers Hyderabad is eyeing a second-place finish in the IPL 2024 points table . They will face Punjab Kings in their final league game with hopes of securing a win to bolster their position.Having finished at the bottom in the last three IPL editions, Sunrisers Hyderabad has shown remarkable improvement this year.Their aggressive batting and skillful bowling have made them strong contenders for the title.Led by Pat Cummins , Sunrisers Hyderabad secured a spot in the final-four after their match against Gujarat Titans was washed out. With 15 points from 13 matches, they can reach a maximum of 17 points if they defeat PBKS.However, if Rajasthan Royals manage to beat table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders, they will surpass SRH with 18 points, pushing Hyderabad to the third spot.In their last six outings, Sunrisers have had a mixed run, winning two matches, losing three, and one ending in a washout.For Punjab Kings, this match is an opportunity to end their season on a high note after failing to make it to the final four. They have lost key players like Sam Curran, who played a crucial role in their previous win against Rajasthan Royals, due to England player commitments.In their head-to-head encounters, Sunrisers Hyderabad has dominated Punjab Kings, winning 15 out of their 22 matches, while PBKS has managed to win only seven.The pitch at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium has favoured batsmen in IPL 2024, initially appearing flat and lifeless. However, in recent games, bowlers have found some assistance as the pitch has slowed down.In six matches played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium during IPL 2024, teams batting first have won three times, while teams chasing have won twice. The average first innings total is 203, while the average second innings total is 190. The highest total recorded is 277/3 by Sunrisers Hyderabad against Mumbai Indians, while the lowest total is 165-5 by Chennai Super Kings against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Considering the current state of the pitch, it will offer something for everyone. It will be best for batting early on, making top-order batsmen from both teams good picks. As for bowlers, those who can vary their pace and use cutters effectively will have an advantage.The Australian opener has been instrumental in SRH's success in IPL 2024. With his current form and familiarity with the venue, Head is a reliable choice as he is third in IPL 2024 orange cap . Stats: 533 runs in 11 matchesThe South African middle-order batsman has played crucial innings for SRH in the middle overs. With consistent performances in IPL 2024, Klaasen is a safe bet for fantasy teams. Stats: 339 runs in 11 inningsThe Indian middle-order batsman has been a standout performer for PBKS in IPL 2024, providing solidity and dynamism. Given his form, Shashank Singh is a strong fantasy pick.

"Adhir Chowdhury, Mallikarjun Kharge cross swords over Mamata Banerjee's role in opposition bloc",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/adhir-chowdhury-mallikarjun-kharge-cross-swords-over-mamata-banerjees-role-in-opposition-bloc/articleshow/110238595.cms,"Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury: 'I Don't Trust Mamata, She Can Go Towards BJP'

KOLKATA: Bengal Congress chief Adhir Chowdhury should toe the party high command's decision on INDIA bloc or leave, AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge said on Saturday, serving an ultimatum to the belligerent PCC chief who is vehemently opposed to Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress.Kharge's comments followed a question by reporters in Mumbai after he insisted that ""Mamata ji"" was very much a part of INDIA bloc.When pointed out that Chowdhury's views were not aligned with Congress leadership's stand vis-a-vis TMC , Kharge said, ""He (Chowdhury) is not the one to decide. We are there to decide, Congress will decide, there is a high command. So, whatever we decide will be right. Whatever we decide has to be followed, and if someone does not follow, they have to leave.""Reacting to Kharge's remark, Chowdhury said he could not ""cozy up to anyone decimating Congress in Bengal"". Chowdhury told reporters, ""I cannot stop this fight as a party foot soldier. My fight (against TMC ) is an ideological battle. It is not a personal fight. In Bengal, we are trying to save the party. Both BJP and TMC are in collusion with each other in Bengal. They want to make the election bipolar in the state.""To a query on Bengal CM's statement earlier this week that TMC would give ""outside support"" if an INDIA bloc govt is formed, Kharge said, ""Mamata ji first said she will support from outside. There are similar precedents in the past. In 2004, the UPA govt was also supported from outside by the communists. But Mamata ji also said thereafter that she will be part of INDIA govt. So, it is amply clear that she is with the coalition.""Banerjee, too, reiterated on Saturday that TMC was part of the INDIA bloc in Delhi but not in Bengal. ""Nationally, we are with the INDIA bloc. I had named it and we are very much part of the bloc. But in Bengal, we are fighting alone. Don't vote for Congress and CPM as it will only help BJP. INDIA bloc will win this election and when we are in office, we will remove CAA, NRC and UCC and ensure that everyone gets their dues under the 100-day work scheme, homes under Awas Yojana and all other projects for which Centre has held back funds till now,"" she said in election rallies in Arambagh and Bishnupur.","AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge served an ultimatum to the belligerent PCC chief. Chowdhury said he could not ""cozy up to anyone decimating Congress in Bengal"" Banerjee reiterated that TMC was part of the INDIA bloc in Delhi but not in Bengal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110238611,imgsize-678761,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110238611.jpg"
