"Congress reviews Haryana loss, to pause EVM attack till it has ‘enough evidence’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-reviews-haryana-loss-to-pause-evm-attack-till-it-has-enough-evidence/articleshow/114131317.cms,"To ‘avoid bad optics’, Hooda & Selja not invited to Congress meet

NEW DELHI: Congress , which reacted to its Haryana debacle by blaming it on EVMs and rejecting the result as “unacceptable”, has decided to pause the line of attack and has turned the focus inwards to look into the role of factional feuds and weaknesses that prevented a win.The decision was taken at a review meeting convened on Thursday by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , with the party brass agreeing that it will firm up its position on EVMs as one of the key causes for the electoral loss only after it had gathered “firm evidence” of wrongdoing, sources said.A statement issued by Kharge’s office later in the evening said the party has decided to depute a technical team to look into complaints and discrepancies noted by candidates. “Congress will issue a detailed response based on the fact-finding team’s report on the counting process and functioning of electronic voting machines,” it said.The deliberations, held against the backdrop of supporters of factions led by former Haryana CM B S Hooda and former Union minister Kumari Selja pointing fingers at each other, saw Rahul Gandhi asserting the need for all to bury their differences and unite for the party’s interest. “The party’s interest is paramount,” a source quoted him as saying in the meeting. Fight between rival factions is widely seen to be the major factor in Congress’s defeat.Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting, with sources attributing their exclusion to the concern to “avoid bad optics”. The party is planning to carry out booth-level assessment by seeking a report from each candidate to study the factors that played a role in the loss.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Ajay Maken said, “As you all know, as the exit polls and opinion polls had showed, the results were unexpected. There was a lot of difference between the exit polls and the actual results. We discussed what could be the reasons.” On whether infighting had hurt Congress’s chances in the polls, Maken said, “There are various reasons, from EC to internal differences, we have discussed all that and will hold more discussions going forward.”On Tuesday, party general secretary Jairam Ramesh and spokesperson Pawan Khera had blamed the “slow counting of EVMs” for the party’s defeat to BJP: a bitter surprise which has helped the saffron rival gain momentum and raised doubts about the viability of Congress’s planks — guaranteed MSP purchase of entire farm produce, scrapping of Agnipath scheme, caste census and an “imperilled Constitution”.The rejection of the outcome, a first for a national party, drew a strong protest from EC, which rejected all the charges and raised eyebrows in independent quarters. BJP, of course, lashed out at Congress.Besides Kharge and Rahul, general secretary K C Venugopal, senior observers for the polls Ashok Gehlot and Maken, as well as secretaries for the state participated in the review meeting. Party in-charge of the state Deepak Babaria joined the meeting online from Ahmedabad.","Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting.

, cops say have to arrest man

AHMEDABAD: Happily-ever-after stories are all about leaving the trials and tribulations behind. So, imagine the incredulity on the face of a 48-year-old grandfather of two when police landed at his doorstep around a week ago to arrest him for “kidnapping” his wife of 27 years — the one he loved, eloped with, and built a home with four daughters.Turns out his wife’s parents had filed a case against him after their daughter fled with the man she wanted to spend her life with against her family’s wishes.That was in Aug 1997. The charge of kidnapping under sections 363 and 364 of the erstwhile Indian Penal Code remained against the then 21-year-old native of Rajasthan's Ajmer, unbeknownst to the couple revelling in newly-wedded bliss in a village of Gujarat.Mehsana Police recently received information that a man resembling a fugitive “kidnapper” against whom a case had been filed almost three decades ago was now living in that area and making a living as an autorickshaw operator.Narendrasinh Sodha from the Mehsana police said a cops landed at the man’s doorstep, only to find the woman he is supposed to have kidnapped living with him as his wife.“We had no option but to arrest the man, although his wife said they had been happily married. She paraded their four daughters and two grandchildren as proof and said that there was no longer any animosity with her family,” Sodha said.The woman’s father died some years ago, while her brother doesn’t even remember that a case had been filed. Days after the Oct 2 arrest, a court freed the autorickshaw driver on bail. An officer blamed the confusion on the family’s failure to inform police about their “reconciliation over the years”.",A 48-year-old grandfather of two was arrested for 'kidnapping' his wife of 27 years.

Ratan Naval Tata, a titan of industry, passed away on Wednesday night at a Mumbai hospital, aged 86.

NEW DELHI: Ratan Tata , chairman emeritus of one of India's biggest conglomerates Tata Group , died at 86 after prolonged illness. He was admitted to the hospital due to his age and related medical conditions.In a statement, Tata's family said, ""We his brothers, sisters, and family take solace and comfort in the outpouring of love and respect from all who admired him. While he is no longer with us in person, his legacy of humility, generosity and purpose will continue to inspire future generations.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned Ratan Tata and called him a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.""Shri Ratan Tata Ji was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being. He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond the boardroom. He endeared himself to several people thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""One of the most unique aspects of Shri Ratan Tata Ji was his passion towards dreaming big and giving back. He was at the forefront of championing causes like education, healthcare, sanitation, animal welfare to name a few,"" he added.Ratan Tata, who is also known for his charitable work, served as the chairman of the Tata Group from 1991 to 2012. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the conglomerate founded by his great-grandfather over a century ago.In 1996, Tata established Tata Teleservices, the telecommunications arm of the group, and in 2004, he led the initial public offering of Tata Consultancy Services, the group's IT company.After stepping down as chairman in 2012, Tata retained the honorary title of chairman emeritus for several Tata companies, including Tata Sons , Tata Industries, Tata Motors , Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals.Tata was awarded two of India's highest civilian honors: the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.One of India's most successful business tycoons, he is also renowned for his philanthropic endeavors. His personal involvement in philanthropy began in the 1970s with the initiation of The Aga Khan Hospital and Medical College project, which laid the foundation for one of India's premier healthcare institutions.After becoming the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, Tata's philanthropic efforts gained new momentum. He actively guided the Tata Trusts, established by his great-grandfather Jamsetji, towards addressing crucial social needs and established institutes of excellence such as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, while also funding educational initiatives across India.Despite his reputation for class and elegance, Tata was not immune to controversies. Although the Tata Group was not directly implicated in the 2008 scam involving the allocation of second-generation telecom licences, Tata was drawn into the controversy through leaked recordings of purported phone calls he made to lobbyist Nira Radia. However, he was not implicated in any wrongdoing.In December 2012, Tata handed over control of Tata Sons to Cyrus Mistry, his deputy at the time. However, the owners had issues with the functioning of the first non-Tata family member, leading to Mistry's ouster in October 2016. Ratan Tata was said to be one of the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on several projects, including Mistry's decision to discontinue the loss-making small car Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata.Since 2017, Tata has been the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons. During this time, he has taken on a new role, supporting young entrepreneurs of the 21st century by investing in new age tech-driven start-ups that will play a significant role in shaping the future of the country. In his personal capacity and through his investment company RNT Capital Advisors, Tata has invested in over 30 start-ups, including Ola Electric, Paytm, Snapdeal, Lenskart, and Zivame.One wet monsoon evening not many moons ago, dog-lover Tata had decreed that any strays outside the conglomerate's HQ in downtown Mumbai be allowed shelter. Some never left but their benefactor is no more.","Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Group, dies at 86 after prolonged illness.

Legend Ratan Tata No More; Dies At Mumbai Hospital I Tributes Pour In I Tata Sons

The passing of Ratan Tata has brought attention to succession at Tata Trusts , the largest public charitable foundations in India and the owner of the $165-billion Tata Group. As Tata did not designate a successor, the boards of Trusts will have to select a chairman from among the trustees . Though the Trusts comprises several foundations the two main units are Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust.These two entities collectively hold approximately 52% in Tata Sons, the parent of Tata Group , which has a diverse portfolio ranging from aviation to automobiles.There are 13 trustees in total across the two Trusts, with five individuals serving as common trustees for both. The five common trustees are former defence secretary Vijay Singh, automobile industrialist Venu Srinivasan, Ratan Tata's half brother and Trent chairman Noel Tata , businessman Mehli Mistry and lawyer Darius Khambata. The other trustees include former Citi India CEO Pramit Jhaveri at Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, and Ratan Tata's younger brother Jimmy Tata and Jehangir Hospital CEO Jehangir H C Jehangir at Sir Ratan Tata Trust.The chairman of Tata Trusts is elected through majority consent among the trustees. Vijay Singh and Venu Srinivasan hold the position of vice-chairmen at the Trusts. However, the likelihood of either of them being selected as the chairman is relatively low. Noel Tata, aged 67, has a high likelihood of being named the chairman of Tata Trusts. This appointment would satisfy the Parsi community and ensure that a member of the founding family leads the philanthropic organisation, which distributed $56 million (Rs 470 crore) in FY23.Historically, only Parsis have chaired Tata Trusts, even if some had non-Tata surnames and no direct connection to the founding family. If appointed, Noel would become the 11th chairman of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the sixth chairman of Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Noel has been involved with the Tata Group for over four decades and holds positions on the boards of six key companies, including Trent, Titan, and Tata Steel. He was appointed a trustee of Sir Ratan Tata Trust in 2019 and later joined the board of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust in 2022.He was considered a potential candidate to take over as the chairman of Tata Sons after Tata's tenure. However, the position was ultimately given to Cyrus Mistry, Noel's brother-in-law. After Mistry's controversial exit, the role of Tata Sons chairman was then assumed by N Chandrasekaran, a seasoned executive from TCS. Noel and Ratan Tata were not often spotted in each other's company and preferred to keep their distance. However, in recent times, the half- brothers have bridged the gap between them to a large extent.","Ratan Tata did not designate a successor, the boards of Trusts will have to select a chairman from among the trustees. There are 13 trustees in total across the two Trusts, with five individuals serving as common trustees for both. Noel Tata, aged 67, has a high likelihood of being named the chairman of Tata Trusts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114100572,imgsize-653532,width-400,resizemode-4/114100572.jpg"

Why Haryana election outcome puts 'psychological' pressure back on opposition's MVA in Maharashtra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-haryana-election-outcome-puts-psychological-pressure-back-on-oppositions-mva-in-maharashtra/articleshow/114124076.cms,"NEW DELHI: Has Haryana election results neutralised the ""psychological advantage"" which the Congress-led opposition had claimed to gain after Lok Sabha polls? Rahul Gandhi had in his recent speeches claimed that the opposition had broken PM Modi ""psychologically"", citing the fact that his government was dependent on the support of allies in Lok Sabha for survival.The Lok Sabha results had given a new impetus to the Congress offensive against the BJP and it was confident that Haryana results would reinforce its narrative of ""BJP being a party on decline."" However, the actual outcome has left the Congress stunned and also brought it under attack from its allies. And what's more, suddenly the so-called ""psychological pressure"" has shifted to the opposition ranks.The next big electoral battlegrounds are Maharashtra and Jharkhand, where assembly elections are due by the end of this year. The historic Haryana win has given the much-needed confidence boost to BJP as it gears up for the next round of state elections. The opposition, on the other hand, has its task cut out as it realises the need to return to the drawing board and reasses its strategy for the upcoming challenge.Haryana and Maharashtra may not have many things in common. But there is an uncanny similarity in how the BJP was placed vis-à-vis the opposition in both the states after Lok Sabha elections. In Haryana, the Congress had wrested five Lok Sabha seats from the BJP, while in Maharashtra the opposition bloc MVA defeated the BJP-led Mahayuti out and out. In Lok Sabha elections, BJP and allies got 17 seats while the opposition MVA of Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) won 30 of the 48 seats. However, the Haryana outcome has proved that a good show in Lok Sabha elections in a state may not be enough to win assembly elections in that state.Following its Lok Sabha victory in Maharashtra, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which comprises Congress, Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena(UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP(SP), was quick to claim that it was the beginning of the end of Eknath Shinde government in the state. Several MVA leaders had then claimed that the people of Maharashtra would throw out the Mahayuti government in the upcoming assembly elections. But as Haryana outcome shows people of the state can vote differently in national and state elections. So, Lok Sabha advantage is no guarantee of assembly elections success.The second important learning and warning for the opposition, especially the Congress, would be to realise the importance of direct contest in defeating the BJP. The Congress, which snubbed Arvind Kejriwal's AAP in Haryana, has been under fire for being arrogant towards its allies in states where it thinks it is strong. The results show that Congress would have won at least four more seats in Haryana if it had an alliance with AAP. While it may still not have been in the position to form a government, it would have at least been saved of the accusation of being arrogant towards its allies. In Maharashtra, the MVA partners have been struggling to reach a mutually acceptable seat-sharing deal amid claims and counterclaims by the three parties based on Lok Sabha results. The Haryana results may help the allies realise the importance of staying united in their fight against the BJP-led Mahayuti. Also, the regional allies may now have an upper hand over the Congress, which would be wary of pushing too hard.Clearly, the Haryana outcome is a wakeup call for the Congress and other opposition parties, who perhaps know that they may have lost the much-touted ""psychological advantage"" after a better-than-expected Lok Sabha performance.","The next big electoral battlegrounds are Maharashtra and Jharkhand, where assembly elections are due by the end of this year.

NEW DELHI: WWF ’s Living Planet Report , released on Thursday, calls India’s food consumption pattern as most sustainable among big economies ( G20 countries ), noting that it would be least climate-damaging for Earth to support food production by 2050 if all countries adopt India’s pattern. Argentina, Australia and USA are worst on this count.“If everyone in the world adopted the current food consumption patterns of the world’s major economies by 2050, we exceed the 1.5° Celsius climate (warming limit) target for food related greenhouse gas emissions by 263 per cent and require one to seven Earths to support us,” the report says, making special mention of India’s millet mission .The report points out that if all countries adopt the current consumption patterns of India, the world would need ‘less than one earth’ (0.84) by 2050 to support food production. The Indian scenario is even marginally better than the planetary climate boundary for food, indicating the maximum amount of greenhouse gas emissions that food systems can emit to stay within 1.5° Celsius of the warming limit.In contrast, the world will need the highest 7.4 Earths if it adopts the consumption patterns of Argentina. It means Argentina has the worst system on a sustainable benchmark, followed by Australia (6.8), USA (5.5), Brazil (5.2), France (5), Italy (4.6), Canada (4.5) and the UK (3.9). Among the better ones, Indonesia (0.9) figures only after India (0.84) and ahead of China (1.7), Japan (1.8) and Saudi Arabia (2).The report also appreciated India’s ongoing efforts to promote climate-resilient millets ( nutri-cereals ), saying National Millet Campaign is designed to increase national consumption of this ancient grain which is good for health and highly resilient in the face of climate change .“Eating more sustainable diets would reduce the amount of land needed to produce food: grazing land, in particular, could be freed up for other purposes, including nature restoration and carbon sequestration,” says the report. It also underlines the importance of promoting healthy alternative protein sources such as legumes and nutri-cereals, plant-based meat alternatives, and algal species high in nutritional value.","WWF Living Planet Report calls India’s food consumption pattern as most sustainable among big economies.

The Padma Vibhushan recipient, who led the Tata Group for over two decades, had been in intensive care since Monday.But this is the story of the dark time when this national icon stood tall during devastating 26/11 terror attack.In November 2008, Mumbai witnessed a devastating terrorist attack orchestrated by the Pakistani group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Ten terrorists infiltrated the city via the sea and targeted several prime locations, including the iconic Taj Hotel and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. The attack claimed 166 lives, including 33 at the Taj Hotel, and injured more than 300 people.During the attack, Ratan Tata, then 70 years old, displayed remarkable courage and leadership. He was seen standing at the Colaba end of the Taj Hotel as security forces carried out operations against the terrorists inside. In the aftermath, Tata pledged to reopen the hotel and support the families of those killed or injured in the attack.Speaking to National Geographic later, Tata recalled, ""Somebody called me and said there had been shooting at the Taj. I called up the exchange Taj and there was no reply, which was very strange. So I got in my car and came here, and the watchman stopped me from going into the lobby because there was shooting. You know, at a time like that, we had about 300 guests in the hotel. There were. Restaurants were full, the people in the various restaurants who were removed and brought to the chambers. So the staff was terrific. Without a master plan of evacuation, they moved people to safer places. But many of them got killed in the process.""""Throughout this period, he stood by the charge and stood by the management of the Taj right here outside on the pavement,"" a staff member recalled.Later in 2020, while recalling the incident, Tata wrote in an Instagram post: ""The wanton destruction that took place 12 years ago today will never be forgotten. But what is more memorable, is the way Mumbai as a diverse people came together, casting aside all differences, to vanquish the terrorism and destruction on that day. Today, we certainly can mourn the ones we lost and honour the sacrifice of the brave who helped conquer the enemy, but what we must applaud, is the unity and the acts of kindness and sensitivity which we should cherish, and which hopefully, will continue to shine in the years ahead,""The Tata Group formed The Taj Public Service Welfare Trust (TPSWT) to provide humanitarian support during disasters, and Ratan Tata personally visited the homes of victims to ensure their well-being. According to the BBC, he paid the relatives of those killed the salaries they would have earned for the rest of their lives, demonstrating his compassion and commitment to the affected families.","Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata passed away at the age of 86 in Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital.

What pulled down BJP in Pir Panjal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-pulled-down-bjp-in-pir-panjal/articleshow/114129008.cms,"JAMMU: BJP’s below-par performance in Pir Panjal region of Rajouri and Poonch has come under scrutiny after the party managed to win only one of the eight assembly constituencies in these two frontier districts of Jammu zone. BJP won 29 seats, all in Jammu region, in the just-concluded J&K assembly polls but faced a rout in Pir Panjal.Political observers attributed BJP’s failure in the mountainous region to the political dynamics following the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, effects of polarisation over the Pahari quota row, and the rise in terrorist activities, despite the party’s claims of normalising the situation in the two districts sharing a border with Pakistan.While BJP secured Kalakote-Sunderbani, National Conference (NC) and Congress swept the remaining seven constituencies — Nowshera, Rajouri (ST), Budhal (ST), Thannamandi (ST), Surankote (ST), Poonch Haveli, and Mendhar (ST).BJP’s defeat is particularly striking as several top functionaries lost. The biggest upset came in Nowshera, where the party’s state president Ravinder Raina lost to NC’s Surinder Chowdhary, while general secretary Vibodh Gupta was defeated by Congress candidate Iftikhar Ahmed in Rajouri.In Budhal, BJP's former cabinet minister Chowdhary Zulfkar Ali lost to his nephew and NC candidate Javed Iqbal Choudhary. The party’s fortunes were no better in Poonch district, where the party lost all three seats.Doda-based political analyst Tariq Mehmood said BJP had high expectations in Pir Panjal region, believing its decision to grant ST status to the Pahari community would secure their votes. “BJP anticipated a clean sweep, but things went wrong. Though BJP claimed to champion the cause of tribal communities in Poonch and Rajouri, they couldn’t win voters’ confidence.”Mehmood said BJP also struggled to make inroads in Chenab valley, where it lost in Ramban and Doda. “AAP’s maiden victory in Doda poses a new challenge to both Congress and BJP,” he said.According to university student Vishal Singh from Rajouri, BJP claimed there would be no scrapping of any group’s quota, but “NC managed to create the fear among Gujjars and Bakerwals that they would lose if BJP won”.He said political signals in Pir Panjal region are influenced by its ethnic divisions. “In Rajouri, four assembly constituencies that are now part of Anantnag-Rajouri Lok Sabha seat are aligned with Kashmir. Sunderbani-Kalakote, part of Jammu parliamentary seat, leans toward Jammu politics. BJP failed to exploit these divisions.”","BJP won 29 seats, all in Jammu region, in the just-concluded J&K assembly polls but faced a rout in Pir Panjal.

Non-residents, for example, are not taxed in India on foreign income.However, in this case, the individual was a tax resident of both India and the US, requiring the application of the 'tie-breaker test' under the India-US tax treaty to determine which country he was a resident of.Applying this test, which takes into account certain criteria, ITAT concluded that the individual's ""centre of vital interest"" was closer to India, making his US income taxable in India.Applying the tiebreaker test, ITAT, in the case of a person who is a tax resident of both India and the US, has held that income earned in the US was taxable in India.Tax experts said the tiebreaker test is applied in cases of dual residency.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said a returning Indian, for instance, could be a tax resident of both India (based on the number of days in the country) and the US (based on citizenship). “In determining basic residency under domestic tax laws of each country, the fact that US tax residency (among other conditions) is based on US citizenship/green card status does have its own nuances as such individuals ar e always taxed in the US on their global income.”In this particular case, the individual was a tax resident of India, having spent more than 183 days in the country in 2012-13. He was also a US citizen, one of the criteria for tax residency in America.“The tie-breaker test is sequential, meaning if the tie is broken at one stage, subsequent criteria do not need to be applied. But, these criteria are highly subjective and vary with each individual’s circumstances,” Sirwalla said.The individual argued that his family (wife and three children) were a ll US citizens and one of his daughters was studying in the US. While he earned income from investments in both India and the US, he held larger investments in the US, and hence claimed he was a US resident. Accordingly, he said, his US income should not be taxed in India.The I-T department said the man had spent more than 183 days in India, and his wife and two of his children lived in Mumbai, while only one daughter resided in the US.ITAT noted that determining the ‘centre of vital interest’ requires analysing both personal and economic relationships. It observed that while the man had family ties to the US, his immediate family and business activities were centred in India. His siblings and parents residing in the US were deemed less relevant than his stay in India with his wife and children. ITAT gave more weight to his active business involvement in India over his passive investments in the US.The man had returned to India to run a film distribution company, co-founded with his wife in 2009, and was actively involved in its operations. Thus, ITAT ruled that he was a resident of India, making his US income taxable here.","Man taxed for US income as he spent over half the year in India.

While the individual initially declared an income of Rs 9,570 for 2012-13, his taxable income surged to Rs 43.5 lakh after the US income was added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114058724,imgsize-1765385,width-400,resizemode-4/114058724.jpg"
