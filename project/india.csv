Blast at Nagpur explosives unit kills 6 people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/blast-at-nagpur-explosives-unit-kills-6-people/articleshow/110977886.cms,"NAGPUR: Six persons, including five women employees, were trapped in a ball of fire and charred to death after a devastating explosion tore apart Chamundi Explosives Ltd in Dhamna , 25km off Nagpur on Thursday.

While rescue operations were delayed, factory personnel couldn't venture into the smoke-filled death trap, where dismembered body parts were found in metal wreckage when the fire was finally doused. Three other employees are battling for life at different hospitals in Nagpur. A preliminary probe stated sparks from the explosive sealing section had triggered the blast .

Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis declared Rs 5 lakh compensation to kin of the deceased, but the unit's management was yet to announce relief to victims' kin.

The unit, which manufactures safety fuses, gun powder, firecrackers and detonators is located on Amravati highway.

On Thursday, angry villagers blocked the arterial Amravati highway and claimed victims remained trapped inside the explosives sealing and packing unit for over one-and-half hours and were burnt to death. ""The bodies were charred beyond recognition,"" said an eyewitness, adding there were no adequate safety measures at the factory premises.

Yadavrao Modre, relative of 21-year-old Pranjali, who is one of the victims, said the company premises did not have any effective firefighting mechanism, despite dealing with inflammatory chemicals.

Police commissioner Ravinder Singal along with Joint CP Aswati Dorje reached the private hospital, where the injured were admitted. Singal said the process of registering the offence is underway.

NEW DELHI: In response to the ongoing water crisis in Delhi, the government has taken decisive action by deploying high-level officials to each zone. These teams, consisting of Additional District Magistrates, Sub Divisional Magistrates, Tehsildars, and other officials, will serve as 'Quick Response Teams' to ensure the efficient distribution of water tankers and promptly address water-related complaints from residents.

Delhi minister Atishi has instructed the Chief Secretary to oversee these teams as they monitor and inspect the main water distribution network , starting from the water sources and extending to the water treatment plants (WTPs) and primary Underground Reservoirs (UGRs). The teams are tasked with identifying and repairing any leaks in the major pipelines within a 12-hour timeframe, emphasizing the importance of conserving every drop of water during this period of scarcity.

""In the meeting held on 30.05.2024 regarding the issue of prevailing heat wave condition and rise in demand of water, it was decided that from 5th June onwards ADM/SDM level officers would be deployed in each Zone, along with a team of Tehsildars and other officials who will act as a ' Quick Response Team ' for provision of water tankers and resolution of water-related complaints,"" Atishi said in her letter to the Chief Secretary.

Despite these efforts, many residents in various parts of Delhi continue to face water shortages, relying on water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has led to long queues in affected areas as people wait to collect water from these tankers.

The water crisis has also sparked a heated debate between Lieutenant-Governor VK Saxena and the AAP government, with each side pointing fingers at the other. The AAP government attributes the water shortage to the BJP-ruled Haryana government, claiming that it has failed to provide Delhi with its rightful share of water. However, the LG refutes this accusation.

After a phone conversation with Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini on Tuesday, Saxena released a statement asserting that Haryana has been releasing Delhi's allocated share of water into the Yamuna River via the Munak canal. The LG places the blame for the water crisis squarely on the Delhi government, alleging that the shortage is a result of the tanker mafia ""stealing water [from the canal] in connivance with the ruling AAP"".

The third file signed by him was for revocation of the Land Titling Act as promised by his Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) and its allies.

The BJP ended up with just 9 seats, which is less than half of 23, the number of seats it had won in the state 5 years ago. Unfortunately BJP's ""engineered"" allies also failed to contribute to the NDA target.While the split Sena, now the actual Shiv Sena, performed reasonably well, the split NCP, now the official NCP - stares at a tense future. According to news agency IANS, BJP is conducting an internal survey to assess the possibilities of contesting the upcoming assembly elections aloneNCP chief and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who had rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and walked out of the party with most of the MLAs and MPs, finds himself in the wilderness after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha polls. Ajit Pawar 's NCP contested 4 Lok Sabha seats and managed to win only one. Contrast this to the performance of Eknath Shinde , who had rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray, split the Shiv Sena, joined hands with the BJP and went on to become the chief minister of Maharashtra. Shinde's Sena contested 15 seats and won 7 with a strike rate better than the BJP.What's worse - the RSS has come out in the open questioning BJP's wisdom in joining hands with Ajit Pawar. An article in ""Organiser"" magazine, which is linked to the RSS, slammed BJP's move and called it ""unnecessary politicking."" It said the induction of Ajit Pawar's NCP into NDA had reduced the brand value of BJP.""Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,"" RSS lifelong member Ratan Sharda said in the article.""Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,"" he added.The NCP leaders have tried to play down the criticism calling it the personal opinion of the RSS leader. They claim that their alliance with BJP would continue. But the party's reduced bargaining power post elections was evident when PM Modi formed his council of ministers.The NCP is one of the allies who does not have a minister in Modi 3.0. When the contours of the NDA government was being discussed, NCP was the first party to go public with its disappointment over portfolio allocation. Ajit Pawar's party refused to accept minister of state with independent charge post that was being offered for its leader Parful Patel. Pawar said it was a conscious decision taken unanimously as Praful Patel had been a Cabinet minister at the Centre earlier and the offered post would be demotion for him.""I was earlier a Cabinet minister in the Union government, so this will be a demotion for me. We have informed the BJP leadership and they have already told us to just wait a few days, they will take remedial measures,"" Patel had then told reporters.BJP's decision to take Ajit Pawar on board also gave the opposition an opportunity to mock PM Modi over his much-talked about crusade against corruption. This was because the Prime Minister and top BJP leaders had in their earlier rallies accused Ajit Pawar of corruption in the state's irrigation scam.Marginalised after Lok Sabha polls, Ajit Pawar now appears to be waiting for the Rajya Sabha boost to make bigger claims within the NDA. With bulk of NCP MLAs with him, Ajit Pawar will see an increase in the party's tally of MPs in the Upper House. He has already fielded his wife Sunetra Pawar, who had lost Lok Sabha elections to Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule in Baramati, as NCP candidate for Rajya Sabha elections.Clearly, as BJP now gears up for the assembly elections in the state due later this year, Ajit Pawar may face testing times ahead. Shinde has proved that he will be more valuable as a partner to the saffron party than Ajit Pawar.(With inputs from agencies)",NCP chief and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar finds himself in the wilderness after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha polls. BJP is conducting an internal survey to assess the possibilities of contesting the upcoming assembly elections alone.

Jailed BrahMos scientist Nishant Agrawal delivered 80 missiles to forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jailed-brahmos-scientist-delivered-80-missiles-to-forces/articleshow/110949074.cms,"NAGPUR: Former BrahMos scientist Nishant Agrawal , who was sentenced to life by a sessions court here on June 3 for leaking military secrets to Pakistan, worked in the missile assembly unit at Nagpur and was involved in delivery of close to 80 missiles to the armed forces during his four-year stint.

He had access to customers and delivery locations of missiles, as per Major General (retd) Achyut Deo, general manager, BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited (BAPL), who deposed as a witness during Nishant's trial.

Last week, Nishant was sentenced to life imprisonment by the sessions court under the IT Act and Official Secrets Act. He was accused of passing on secret information on BrahMos missiles to Pak intelligence operatives, who contacted him on social media in the guise of girls. His defence counsel has filed an appeal in high court. TOI has access to his case papers.

Deo, however, told the court he did not come across any instance of Nishant tampering, sharing or misusing information from office computers even though his workstation had more classified information. The data allegedly found in his laptop was already in public domain, Deo told the court.

Deo said he headed the warhead integration and mechanical department and did not receive any negative report about Nishant from the Intelligence Bureau or other security agencies. Nishant was also recommended for the young scientist award in 2018.

However, NN Kumar, executive director (production) at the BrahMos unit, told the court that Nishant was not supposed to keep departmental information in his personal computer, which had a technical description of the missile - CK-310. This was highly classified information and a draft version for approval by technical specialists, he said on record.

Responding to the defence lawyer, the investigating officer of Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) which arrested him in 2018, told the court that both Nishant and his wife were not inclined to Islamist ideology or involved in anti-national activity. ATS officer Pankaj Awasthi went on to say Nishant was not investigated for any assets disproportionate to his income and it's not true that he was not in possession of secret information during his training at the Hyderabad unit.

TN Lok Sabha Seats: 40-40: Tamil Nadu voters give it all to DMK alliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/40-40-tamil-nadu-voters-give-it-all-to-dmk-alliance/articleshow/110720261.cms,"CHENNAI: Forty out of forty. That's what Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin told his party cadres last month, urging them to ensure that DMK and its allies win all the 39 Lok Sabha seats in the state and the one in neighbouring Puducherry. And INDIA bloc ticked all the 40 boxes on Tuesday.The big win in the three-cornered fight gives credence to the alliance's ideological bonding strengthened by the common opposition to BJP. It also leaves AIADMK and BJP , former electoral partners, in doldrums to rethink their strategies before the 2026 assembly election.While AIADMK's unimpressive line-up failed to impress the electorate, BJP couldn't do any better with its high-profile candidates like state president K Annamalai (Coimbatore), Union minister L Murugan (Niligirs) and former Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan (Chennai South). Ousted AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam, who contested in Ramanathapuram as an NDA-backed independent, lagged behind DMK ally IUML's K Navaskani by a margin of more than 1.6 lakh (yet to be announced).The counting gave some anxious moments to many candidates. After leading initially, BJP's Tirunelveli candidate and MLA Nainar Nagendran fell by the wayside and Congress candidate Robert Bruce won by more than 1.6 lakh votes. AIADMK ally and DMDK Virudhunagar candidate Vijay Prabhakar, maintained a lead over his Congress rival Manicka Tagore, who finally registered a thin margin of more than 4,000 votes. PMK's Dharmapuri candidate and Sowmiya Anbumani (NDA) gave a tough fight to DMK's A Mani before losing by a margin of 21,000 votes. At the end of counting, DMK's Ganapathy Rajkumar was ahead of Annamalai by more than one lakh votes.Clearly, a divided opposition and a vitriolic anti-NDA campaign that centred on allegations of divisive-communal politics by BJP and Centre starving state of funds helped INDIA bloc's success in TN. Stalin's strategy to showcase his priorities of politics and governance helped win over the Tamil audience. In Puducherry, too, Congress candidate and sitting MP V Vaithilingam won, beating his BJP rival A Namassivayam by a margin of around one lakh votes.As soon as the trends showed INDIA bloc leading in most of the constituencies, Stalin visited his father M Karunanidhi's memorial on Marina beach in Chennai and paid his respects. Later in the evening, Stalin said, ""I know my height,"" repeating his father's famous words when asked about his aspirations and probability of his playing a role at the national level.Stalin will leave for Delhi on Wednesday morning to take part in the INDIA bloc meeting. He thanked his alliance leaders and cadres for their efforts ""to defeat fascism and to safeguard democracy and the Constitution"".In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the DMK-led alliance bucked the national trend to win 38 seats in TN, leaving only the Theni seat to the then united AIADMK in the company of BJP, and grabbing the lone Puducherry seat as well. With the 2024 Lok Sabha poll victory in TN, Stalin has pulled off a hattrick with his successes in 2019 and 2021 (assembly election) after taking over the DMK reins. Party colleagues and allies say the victory is a referendum for Stalin's governance.In the opposition camp, while AIADMK rejoiced its second position with an overall vote share of 20%, having contested 32 seats, the BJP was muted in its celebration, having lost all the 19 seats it contested.The opposition contest and campaign centered on ""exposing"" DMK and Stalin with attacks on their failure to keep the pre-poll promises and practicing corruption and dynasty politics. The 'DMK files' (audio recordings of alleged conversations of some DMK functionaries), allegations of misgovernance, poor law and order, arrest and IT searches of senior ministers and charges of nepotism following the elevation of Stalin's son Udhayanidhi failed to cut ice with the electorate.",INDIA bloc ticked all the 40 boxes on Tuesday.

Global civil society organisations, Public Eye and IBFAN, have submitted a formal request to the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), urging legal action against Nestle “unethical and unfair business practices” in low- and middle-income countries.

Accusing the Swiss major of “double standards”, the NGOs had in April said the company’s two best-selling baby food brands sold in developing countries, including India, have a high content of added sugar, which is prohibited under WHO guidelines. Nestle’s misleading and aggressive marketing and its double standard over added sugar are unfair business practices that affect hundreds of thousands of people in poor countries, they said. The cessation of unethical practices is important not only to protect children, but also the reputation of Nestle’s home country, they said.

When contacted, a Nestle India spokesperson said: “We understand that the authorities are conducting analysis of infant cereals and infant formulas sold by all companies in the country.” It maintained its commitment to compliance and highlighted a reduction in sugar content by up to 30% in its baby food products in India over the past five years.

In April, days after the issue became public, Nestle India’s chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan had said Cerelac complied with local food norms, saying added sugars in the baby food are much lower than what India’s food regulator permits.

The food giant controls 20% of the baby food market, valued at nearly $70 billion. With over $2.5 billion in global sales in 2022, Cerelac and Nido are some of Nestle’s best-selling baby food brands in low- and middle-income countries.

The four students, aged between 18 and 20, had ventured into the river when a powerful wave swept them away. Jishan was on a video call with his family at the time of the incident, and they watched helplessly as the current carried the siblings away.

NEW DELHI: Two days after Supreme Court sought answers from National Testing Agency (NTA) on the “sanctity” of NEET-UG 2024 being affected, the agency decided to rescind its decision to award grace marks to 1,563 students who could not get the full allotted time to take the test due to mismanagement. NTA told the court that a re-test would be conducted for these candidates .As soon as the bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta took up the petitions filed against awarding of grace marks, advocate Kanu Aggarwal informed the court about the Centre’s decision. Aggarwal told the bench that the June 4 decision on grace marks had been withdrawn and a re-test would be conducted for 1,563 affected students on June 23. The result would be declared on June 30 to ensure that counselling, which is likely to start from July 6, is not affected. The bench accepted the decision.The affected candidates will be informed about their actual scores without the grace marks and re-test will be conducted for them. Those who do not wish to appear for the re-test will retain the actual marks (minus grace marks) obtained by them in the test held on May 5.Senior advocate Naresh Kaushik, appearing for NTA, told the bench that the re-test would be notified on Thursday.“Having considered the submissions and the material placed on record, this court finds that the recommendations made by the committee on June 12, 2024, after deliberations held on June 10, 11 and 12 are fair, reasonable and justified. Accordingly, the respondent NTA may proceed for holding the re-test as indicated above,” Justices Nath and Mehta said.NEET-UG, taken by over 24 lakh students on May 5, has been marred by allegations of paper leak, mismanagement and awarding of grace marks. Some students approached SC and various high courts while many took to the streets to protest.The 1,563 students were given grace marks since they did not get the full 3 hours 20 minutes to take the test. The marks were awarded on the basis of recommendations of the grievance redressal committee constituted by NTA. As protests broke out over the decision, a second committee reconsidered the issue and recommended reversal of grace marks.Advocate J Sai Deepak insisted that 1,563 candidates were only those who had approached courts and the number of students who did not get the stipulated time was much higher. He said all those students who suffered should be allowed to appear in the re-test but NTA objected to his plea and said the problem was confined to only six test centres.The court, after hearing all sides, closed the case on the issue of grace marks while keeping the larger issue on question paper leak pending which will be heard on July 8.The entrance test was conducted across 4,750 centres in 571 cities, including 14 cities abroad. Reports of paper leak surfaced after the test and a few arrests were also made.","National Testing Agency (NTA) decides to rescind its decision to award grace marks to 1,563 students.

NEW DELHI: Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday dismissed allegations of paper leak in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-Undergraduate ( NEET-UG ) and said there was no evidence to back these claims. He said govt was committed to ensure no student was disadvantaged, and added that the controversy was “motivated”, indicating that the protest was instigated by coaching centres .He also said more high scorers and more non-coaching candidates cracking the exam was due to concerted efforts of the last three years to make the difficulty level of NEET similar to Class 12 board exam instead of setting “tough” questions.NTA conducted NEET-UG on May 5 and announced results on June 4. A little over 24 lakh aspirants registered for the test of which 23.3 lakh appeared and 13.6 lakh qualified.“There is no evidence of paper leak in NEET-UG. Corruption allegations against NTA are baseless. It conducts exams for over 5 million school students annually, along with higher education exams,” Pradhan said.He said NEET-UG results indicated that there was a significant increase in the number of students qualifying and scoring high marks from govt-run schools and from rural areas who didn’t attend coaching classes.Without naming coaching centres, Pradhan said, “Even in JEE (Advanced), students of rural areas and Navodaya schools have improved their scores and are among the rank holders. They didn’t get any additional coaching. So, you can guess who has impacted them (coaching centres) adversely.”On the controversy over grace marks, the minister said NTA was evolving. “We are not saying everything is foolproof.

With Biden headed to Italy, White House said aboard Air Force One there’s an “encounter” likely between the 2 leaders as the president expects to see the Indian PM there, while reiterating it will continue to raise the foiled Sikh separatist murder plot at very senior levels with India.This is the first time the leaders will meet after their bilateral talks over dinner at Modi’s residence here, on the eve of the G20 summit India hosted last year in September. While a formal bilateral meeting isn’t ruled out in Italy, it’s possible that the leaders might just have a pull-aside because of scheduling constraints.PM Modi , in fact, will have a hectic bilateral schedule at G7 with meetings already confirmed with French president Emmanuel Macron, UK PM Rishi Sunak, Japanese PM Fumio Kishida, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian PM Giorgia Meloni. Modi is also likely to meet Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He had met him at the G7 summit in Hiroshima too last year. Zelenskyy had invited Modi for the peace summit in Switzerland, but India never considered participation at the highest level because of efforts to keep Russia out. There was no meeting scheduled with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau till late on Thursday.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, US NSA Jake Sullivan also said that the foiled murder-for-hire plot against Khalistan separatist and US national Gurpatwant Singh Pannun will be “a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels”. Diplomatic sources did not rule out the possibility of the issue coming up in the Modi-Biden meeting.Biden had taken up the issue during his meeting with Modi in September and Sullivan is himself likely to discuss progress, or lack thereof, in the probe India is conducting into the US allegations that an Indian official masterminded the plot during his visit to India next week. While the visit has not been officially announced yet, Sullivan is scheduled to be here on June 18. He’s expected to meet his counterpart for a comprehensive review of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET) that Modi and Biden had launched in May 2022.“He (Biden) expects to see Prime Minister Modi here. It's up to the Indians to formally confirm his attendance, but our expectation is that the two of them will have the opportunity to encounter one another. The nature of that encounter is still fluid because so much of the schedule is fluid,” said Sullivan.Asked about the issue by reporters accompanying the president, Sullivan said the US will continue to raise the issue, like in the past, at the highest level with India. “We have made our views known on this issue, and it will be a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels,” added the official.","PM Narendra Modi is likely to meet US President Joe Biden Friday on the margins of the G7 summit in southern Italy’s Puglia region.

These are the names given to three craters on the surface of Mars recently discovered by Ahmedabad-based Physical Research Laboratory ( PRL ), that hint at the red planet's wet past. Lal has been named after legendary cosmic ray physicist from Varanasi, the late Professor Devendra Lal. The other two have been named after Mursan town in UP's Hathras district, and Hilsa town in Nalanda district of Bihar.

PRL director Anil Bhardwaj told TOI they are named in accordance with international guidelines which state that small craters should be named after small towns and bigger ones after renowned personalities. Lal, a pioneer in the field of earth and planetary science, served as PRL director from 1972 to 1983.

The craters reside within the Tharsis volcanic region, a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the solar system. 'Lal' is the largest and spans around 65km. It is covered with lava, but there is geophysical evidence of material other than lava in this crater with a 45m thick sedimentary deposit in the subsurface. The discovery provides compelling proof that water has moved large volumes of sediments into the crater. Two small superimposed craters on either side, 'Mursan' and 'Hilsa', provide timeline for the infilling process of 'Lal'.

According to an article published by scientists Rajiv Bharti, Isaac Smith, S K Mishra, N Srivastava and Shital Shukla, the discovery was made within the Mangala crater of Mars using SHARAD (Mars SHAllow RADar sounder), a subsurface sounding radar mounted on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter probe, a spacecraft designed to search for the existence of water on Mars as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Programme.

TOI

NEW DELHI: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked officials to deploy the full strength of counter-terror apparatus against terrorists behind recent strikes in Jammu, law enforcement agencies are seeing the current jihadi escalation as an effort to open a new axis of violence and unrest in Jammu region.On a day when PM Modi reviewed the uptick in terrorist violence with NSA Ajit Doval and others, J&K DGP R R Swain said counter-terrorism strategies were being tweaked to beat the “unique challenge” represented by 40-50 terrorists who infiltrated from Pakistan and were now holed up in the mountainous terrain of Jammu — where road connectivity and communication facilities do not match those in the flat-floor Valley, making it longer for security forces to respond to information.The shift in security strategy includes returning to the force deployment pattern of the 1990s, with more personnel guarding mountain tops, resuming and intensifying counter-terror operations sector-wise and strengthening village defence committees in Jammu by refining their training and equipping them better to bust terror strikes.Maintaining that attacks in Reasi, Doda and Kathua were a recent phenomenon in that particular axis, the J&K police chief said, “After the Valley is relatively pacified, terrorist outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba have shifted attention to Jammu, activating different axes that run through Chenab, Tawi and Ujh-Ravi rivers. It is a determined effort on part of Pakistan-based elements to ratchet up things for reasons that include boosting morale of their fighters and creating inter-communal tension in a region with mixed population (by religion),” Swain toldover phone.Citing the difficult topography and demography of areas within Jammu (with a 60:40 Hindu-Muslim population), Swain indicated the terrorists may be trying to target civilians from a particular community with a design to spark communal unrest, thus creating a law and order challenge. He, however, said the lack of separatist sentiment in Jammu, unlike how things were in Kashmir, was one less headache for security forces.Reasi, where nine people died Sunday after terrorists fired on a bus, has 70% of contiguous mountainous terrain, which Swain said offered the hiding terrorists an advantage as there was invariably a time gap between information reaching the forces and follow-up action.The plan now is to step up deployment in the mountain tops of Jammu to keep an eye on infiltration attempts and challenge the terrorists hiding there after crossing over from Pakistan, the DGP said.","J&K DGP R R Swain said counter-terrorism strategies were being tweaked to beat the ‘unique challenge’ represented by 40-50 terrorists.

Heatwaves more than double of normal this year: IMD data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heatwaves-more-than-double-of-normal-this-year-imd-data/articleshow/110977521.cms,"NEW DELHI: This summer, India has faced what's possibly the longest ever spell of heatwave days, with data from IMD revealing that Odisha experienced the most extreme weather and topped the chart by recording the highest number of such days (27), followed by western Rajasthan (23), Gangetic West Bengal (21 days), and Delhi, Haryana, Chandigarh and western UP (20 days each) during March 1-June 9.These numbers were more than double of what these regions normally experience annually.And, heatwaves continue to scorch many of these regions. Delhi, for instance, has seen three more heatwave days since June 9, including Thursday, taking the total so far to 23. IMD on Thursday said ""severe heat wave conditions"" over northern parts of India are likely to continue in the next 4-5 days.Heatwaves are spells of unusually high temperatures as compared to what is normally expected over a region. Therefore, temperatures at which heatwaves are declared differ from place to place based on the historical temperatures of that region.Data shared by IMD for the March 1-June 9 shows that 14 of 36 meteorological subdivisions in the country have recorded over 15 heatwave days. These subdivisions are spread across the country with east and north India the worst hit. Even the relatively cool high-altitude regions such as Himachal Pradesh reported 12 heat wave days followed by Sikkim (11), Jammu & Kashmir (6) and Uttarakhand (2).""The IMD's map shows a high number of heatwaves over India. This was expected and predicted in advance. In the year following an El Nino year (2023) we tend to get more heatwaves. That is due to favourable atmospheric circulation for heat waves,"" said Madhavan Rajeevan, climate scientist and former secretary, ministry of earth sciences.He attributed the longer spell to global warming, saying it is adding to the natural variability. ""We will tend to get more frequent, longer and stronger heatwaves. We, therefore, need to be well prepared,"" said Rajeevan while flagging the current longer spell against the normal 6-8 heatwave days averaged over central and northwest India per year.A heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature of a weather station is at least 40 degrees Celsius in the plains and at least 30 degrees C in hilly regions, and it is 4.5 to 6.4 degrees C above the normal temperature. If it's 6.5 degrees or more above normal, a severe heatwave is declared. Also, heatwave is automatically considered if the temperature touches 45 degrees C and a severe heatwave declared if it reaches 47 degrees C.In the coastal area, a heatwave is declared if the maximum temperature is 37 degrees C or more and the departure is 4.5 degrees or more above normal.The criteria of declaring heatwaves is, however, not the same in the other countries as quantitatively, there are different thresholds used around the globe. ""It is usually defined based on the temperature thresholds over a region in terms of actual temperature or its departure from normal. In certain countries, it is defined in terms of the heat index based on temperature and humidity, or based on the extreme percentile of the temperatures,"" the met department said.""Heatwave to severe heatwave conditions are very likely to continue over Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh-Delhi and Uttar Pradesh during next five days (till June 18) with a reduction thereafter in terms of areas and intensity,"" said the met department in its extended range forecast for next two weeks.","Odisha experienced the most extreme weather and topped the chart by recording the highest number of such days (27) Western Rajasthan (23), Gangetic West Bengal (21 days), and Delhi, Haryana, Chandigarh and western UP (20 days each) during March 1-June 9.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110977548,imgsize-1368112,width-400,resizemode-4/110977548.jpg"

Weather holds up RLV 3rd landing trial; Chopper delays Gaganyaan air drop test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/weather-holds-up-rlv-3rd-landing-trial-chopper-delays-gaganyaan-air-drop-test/articleshow/110977444.cms,"Gaganyaan Test

BENGALURU: Weather permitting, Isro will attempt to achieve another milestone in the development of reusable launch vehicle (RLV) technology this month, may be as early as next week in Karnataka’s Challakere, while “issues” with chopper (Chinook) is delaying the integrated air-drop test (IADT) of simulated Gaganyaan crew modules at the spaceport in Sriharikota.Isro, which had completed the second landing experiment of the RLV — the RLV-LEX-02 — on March 22, is gearing up for the third landing experiment (RLV-LEX-03), which will build upon RLV-LEX-02 aimed at improving the vehicle’s performance, guidance, and landing capabilities.“...We are just waiting. The helicopter is there but the weather is bad. It (weather) is expected to improve by the 14th and if that happens we can conduct the experiment next week. This will be the last landing experiment and next, we’ll attempt the orbital re-entry,” S Unnikrishnan Nair, director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), which has developed the RLV, told TOI.Compared to the previous LEX, Nair said, RLV-LEX3 will be more challenging as the “intentional cross-range error of around 500m will be tested, compared to around 150m during LEX-02. “The velocity azimuth with respect to the runway centre has been adjusted to 2°, deviating from the previous mission's 0° alignment,” he said.The mission will have another advancement: Implementation of an advanced guidance algorithm that can simultaneously correct errors in both the longitudinal and lateral planes. This decoupled algorithm, an improvement over LEX-02’s approach, will be utilised to enhance the vehicle’s precision and control.Also, to ensure a softer landing and reduce touchdown loads, the main landing gear (MLG) sink rate has been reduced to less than 1m/second, compared to the 1.5m/second limit during LEX-02. Additionally, a smoke marker system has been introduced to trace the descent trajectory, providing visual data for analysis and future improvements.Isro will also evaluate the performance of its real-time kinematics (RTK) system in a high-speed environment. This system is crucial for future landing missions, as it can enhance the robustness of the hybrid navigation system, ensuring accurate and reliable guidance.Around 550km from Challakere, in Sriharikota, Isro’s plan of conducting the IADT of a simulated crew module to validate the parachute system for India's first human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan, has been put on hold a need to revisit “some aspects” of the helicopter selected to carry out the test, arose.During the test, the crew module, weighing around 3 tonne, will be dropped from the Chinook helicopter at an altitude of 3km, and a sequence of parachute deployments will occur before splashdown and recovery. The proposed IADT is part of several such tests to be conducted as part of Gaganyaan’s preparations.TOI had reported in May that pre-mission trials had begun for this. “...During the pre-mission trials for the first IADT in Sriharikota, it was noticed that the helicopter may have ‘some issues’ that needed to be addressed. That is progressing now,” a source said.The Indian Air Force (IAF), whose Chinook aircraft Isro is using for the mission, is conducting an investigation “to understand what needs to be done”, the source said, adding that Isro was waiting for IAF to get back with its findings before moving ahead.Isro plans to conduct seven IADTs as per initial plans, with the final number depending on the test results. Alongside these tests, it is also preparing for at least one uncrewed mission and the second test vehicle mission to test various abort conditions as part of the Gaganyaan programme this year.","Weather permitting, Isro will attempt to achieve another milestone in the development of reusable launch vehicle (RLV) technology this month. “issues” with chopper (Chinook) is delaying the integrated air-drop test (IADT) of simulated Gaganyaan crew modules.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110977441,imgsize-56632,width-400,resizemode-4/110977441.jpg"
