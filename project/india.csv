Indian staff member with the UN killed in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-staff-member-with-the-un-killed-in-gaza/articleshow/110098871.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: An Indian personnel serving with the United Nations tragically lost their life in Gaza 's Rafah area when the vehicle they were traveling in came under attack, marking the ""first international "" casualty for the organization since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict .The individual, identified as a staff member of the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (DSS), was confirmed to be of Indian origin and a former member of the Indian Army, though their specific identity remains undisclosed.The incident occurred as the UN vehicle, en route to the European Hospital in Rafah, was struck, resulting in the fatality of the Indian personnel and injuring another DSS staffer. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed profound sadness at the loss, condemning all attacks on UN personnel and urging a thorough investigation into the incident.Guterres extended condolences to the family of the deceased staff member and reiterated the urgent need for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, emphasizing the protection of humanitarian workers.In a statement, Guterres emphasized the toll the conflict has taken on both civilians and aid workers, stressing the imperative of an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages.""With the conflict in Gaza continuing to take a heavy toll – not only on civilians but also on humanitarian workers – the Secretary-General reiterates his urgent appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and for the release of all hostages,"" the statement added.Responding to inquiries during a press briefing, Farhan Haq, Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General, confirmed that the casualties were ""international staff"" and highlighted that this marked the first international UN casualty during the conflict.Haq revealed that the UN vehicle was on its way to assess security conditions at the European hospital, a routine part of their duties. He also stated that while there have been international casualties among workers for other organizations in Gaza, this incident marks the first involving UN staff.The World Health Organization's Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed devastation at the loss of the UN humanitarian worker, emphasizing the urgent need for a ceasefire and peace efforts.The tragedy adds to the mounting toll of civilian and humanitarian lives in the conflict. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), between October 7, 2023, and May 12, 2024, a staggering number of casualties have been reported in Gaza, with thousands killed and injured.As the conflict persists, calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities and concerted efforts towards peace continue to resonate globally.","An Indian personnel serving with the United Nations tragically lost their life in Gaza's Rafah area.

"14 killed, 70 hurt as mega hoarding falls on Mumbai pump in dust storm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/14-killed-70-hurt-as-mega-hoarding-falls-on-mum-pump-in-dust-storm/articleshow/110099107.cms,"MUMBAI:

At least 14 people were killed and close to 70 others injured after a 250-tonne illegal advertisement hoarding crashed on a petrol pump at Mumbai’s Ghatkopar after a sudden dust storm and rain coupled with winds of up to 60kmph — which IMD said were just pre-monsoon activity — crippled life across the city on Monday evening.At the time of going to press, officials claimed that more people were trapped under the hoarding and were being rescued.There were about 150 vehicles at the petrol pump at the time of the crash, including bikes that had sought shelter from the sudden rain.Zonal DCP Purushottam Karad said a case has been registered for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and causing grievous hurt, among other sections of the IPC. Sources said Bhavesh Bhinde, director of advertising agency Ego Media Pvt Ltd, which had erected the hoarding, is among those who have been booked.A 23-year-old man and two men in their 40s were among the Ghatkopar crash victims. Most survivors had blunt trauma, and fractures in the arm, shoulder and back, said chief medical officer Bharati Rajulwala of Rajawadi Hospital. She said those requiring surgery would be moved to Sion and KEM hospitals.The weather and the accidents left destruction in their wake elsewhere too: there were stampede-like situations at Dadar and Wadala stations, Harbour and Western Railway services were delayed, leading to massive traffic bottlenecks; tree collapses were reported; 15 Mumbai-bound flights were diverted, and there were intermittent power cuts and disruption in water supply in several parts of the city. The mayhem also caused political disruptions, with campaign rallies and roadshows for LS polls either cancelled or truncated.(Inputs from Swati Deshpande, Sanjeev Devasia, Manthan Mehta, Sumitra Deb Roy, Nitasha Natu, Clara Lewis & Mateen Hafeez)","A 250-tonne illegal advertisement hoarding crashed on a petrol pump at Mumbai’s Ghatkopar.

"In PCR call, Swati Maliwal accuses Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's PA of beating her up at his behest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-pcr-call-maliwal-accuses-cms-pa-of-beating-her-up-at-his-behest/articleshow/110098752.cms,"Maliwal reached police stn at 10.30am, left without filing FIR

NEW DELHI: High-voltage drama unfolded at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's residence in north Delhi on Monday morning after his party's Rajya Sabha MP, Swati Maliwal , claimed in a PCR call that she had been assaulted by Kejriwal's personal assistant , Bibhav , on the former's instructions. This brought the cops to the spot. Later, she went to the Civil Lines police station in order to file an FIR.However, after receiving some phone calls there, she left, telling the cops she would return. They were waiting till late at night.The cops marked her complaint as ""pending"" and no FIR had been filed till late Monday. Police have sought legal opinion on whether they can proceed on the basis of the DD entry and PCR call, a protocol followed in many cases.The incident took social media by storm. Bibhav and Swati have been with Kejriwal since his NGO days and their falling out has left a large section within AAP dismayed. It is particularly disturbing when Kejriwal is gearing up for poll campaign. AAP didn't react to the development.Swati's allegation that she was beaten up at the behest of Kejriwal has also angered many partymen.Maliwal reportedly arrived at the CM's residence around 9-9.10 am. She wanted to meet the CM which was allegedly denied by his personal staff and security. This led to the fracas and Maliwal sought police help. According to sources, Delhi Police's control room received a call from Maliwal around 9.24-25 am. ""This is Swati Maliwal, MP, calling from 6 Flag Staff Road. Vibhav has assaulted me on the CM's instruction,"" she said in the call which was logged.The PCR log states: ""Caller bol raha hai 'main abhi CM ke ghar par hu, unhone apne PA Bibhav Kumar se mujhe buri tarah pitwaya hai'."" It was the SHO of Civil Lines who had reached the CM's residence with his team. Maliwal, cops said, reiterated her complaint and was requested to come to the police station. She was seen boarding an auto from near the CM's residence around 9.50am.She was reportedly heading for some other place but reached the police station around 10.30am to lodge an FIR. However, she received a few calls there after which she stood up within a few minutes of her arrival and said she had to leave, policemen present there said. Around 10.50 am, Maliwal boarded another auto and left the station saying she would come back later.A former video journalist with a magazine, Bibhav Kumar is one of Kejriwal's most trusted aides. He has also faced ED's scrutiny in the excise policy-linked money laundering probe besides the case related to alleged irregularities in Delhi Jal Board. In February, ED had conducted raids at 12 locations, including those connected to Bibhav Kumar and AAP lawmaker ND Gupta. Last month, it had questioned Bibhav in the excise policy case as well. Recently, the directorate of vigilance had terminated Bibhav's services as personal secretary to the chief minister.Maliwal, who was previously listed as a star campaigner for Delhi, has not found a place in Punjab star campaigners’ list, evoking a response from BJP. “Instead of an inquiry being ordered, she has been removed from the star campaigner list,” said Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva.“Our ideology may be different from that of Maliwal but it can’t be ignored that she has worked for women, including getting illegal spas closed,” said another party functionary, Tajinder Bagga.","Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal claimed in a PCR call that she had been assaulted by Kejriwal's personal assistant Bibhav Kumar.

Amit Shah

asserted that there’s a positive vote in favour of

. In an interview with Diwakar and Akhilesh Singh on the eve of the fourth phase of polls, the home minister dismissed the assessment that a drop in turnout and absence of a wave could be impediments. Edited excerpts:

NDA

will cross 400 seats or was it a highly ambitious target?

Amit Shah:

How can you be so confident when you have already reached saturation point in your strongholds? You can only lose seats there and can’t gain. How can you reach the 400+ target?

Then why has BJP, which started with its agenda of development, shifted to politics of polarisation? You are talking about UCC, inheritance tax and are focused on the Congress manifesto; there is a lot of emphasis even on the contentious idea of one nation-one poll.

But you have also been harping on preference for Muslims in public procurement, tenders. You just said you will end religion-based quotas.

There is a perception that the momentum of

Ram Mandir

construction ebbed too early.

You have set a highly ambitious target from south India. You just said BJP will fetch the highest number of seats from south Indian states.

What is the basis of this

confidence

? You are still seen as a ‘Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan’ party and don’t seem to understand the sensitivities of south India and the complexities of politics there.

YSRCP and BJD supported you during the last five years in Parliament but you have been aggressive against them during the campaign.

You have also set an ambitious target for West Bengal, how realistic is your target after the debacle in the assembly polls?

You talked about Sandeshkhali but many victims (of sexual harassment) have gone back on their charges and have said they were made to lie…

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has got interim bail and there are indications that Hemant Soren may get similar relief. They are likely to get sympathy in Delhi and Jharkhand, which the BJP had swept last time.

You are calling it a request but it sounds more of a dare.

A couple of days ago, he was very generous to you that in Sept 2025, you are going to take over as PM because by then Modi would have turned 75.

But didn’t the party set 75 years as retirement age?

Coming back to Kejriwal’s case, he and many others in opposition have accused you of misusing ED and CBI to frame your opponents…

So you are confident of a sweep of the seven seats in Delhi?

You have used Sam Pitroda and Mani Shankar Aiyar as a stick to whip Congress, which says this is unfair as the two have expressed personal opinions and they don’t represent the party.

It is being said that the hidden agenda behind this ‘400 paar’ target is to have a super majority so that you can change the Constitution and scrap reservations.

You have also been accused of misusing electoral bonds to raise money for BJP… that the whole scheme was engineered to collect money for your party. After the SC scrapped the bonds, you said it was a good first step towards checking the use of black money in polls. Can we expect an improved version of electoral bonds in your third term?

So are you suggesting that there will be a new scheme if you get your third term?

You seem to imply that the use of cash in this election has gone back to pre-bond levels.

On Saturday, you said Revanth Reddy has committed a big mistake by doctoring a video of yours. You have messed with the ‘wrong person’, you told him in a public rally.

You have jabbed Rahul Gandhi for entering the Rae Bareli fray when he has already contested from Wayanad. Isn’t it his democratic right to decide which constituency he wishes to contest?

You just mentioned initiatives like Startup India and Digital India and how they have supported entrepreneurship. But the opposition is saying complexities in GST are killing enterprises and nipping entrepreneurship and have asked for a unified GST.

The opposition says mega initiatives like Digital India and Make in India were launched with much fanfare but have not achieved much.

TOI: Polls are halfway through but there seems to be no wave, which is also being presumed to be behind lower turnout.Are you still confident thatCertainly NDA is going to cross 400 seats. There are no ifs and buts. Low turnout should be a concern for the opposition , not us. I say this on the basis of my interaction with BJP workers. Maximum number of BJP supporters have cast their votes… people are not excited about the opposition, but they are about us. Both our victory margin and seats will increase. As for the absence of a wave, let me tell you I have been observing polls since 1975, since I was very young, and have been a student of political processes. It is the first time that we are seeing a positive vote of this scale, an endorsement of development. Youth everywhere are discussing schemes like Digital India, Startup India, share market growth. There is also excitement among farmers about welfare and empowerment schemes. Most importantly, there is an army of over 60 crore beneficiaries which is standing strongly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This will ensure BJP’s victory.(Interrupts and laughs) I remember you had asked me the same question in March 2019 when I said BJP was going to get 300 seats. And we indeed got 300. Let me answer where we are going to get seats. We are going to increase our tally in UP, Bengal, Odisha, Telangana, we are going to make a good start in Andhra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu. We are going to be the biggest party in south India and make impressive gains in East and the entire Coromandel belt. Elections are never about one single issue. I don’t consider one nation-one poll polarising… it’s a giant step towards electoral reforms. Recurrent polls mean financial expenditure for govt and political parties, frequent interruptions to development work. It is not in the country’s interest. UCC has been part of our manifesto since the 1950s. Moreover, it is not BJP’s issue. It was debated in the Constituent Assembly and is part of the Directive Principles of the Constitution which mandates states and Parliament to strive for the formulation of UCC. Different laws for followers of different faiths are at odds with secularism.Therefore, opposing UCC is communalism. Since you are talking about inheritance tax, it is part of Congress’s agenda. During elections, parties are required to debate each other’s manifestos and agendas. Polls are a contest of ideas and it is our duty to debate them. Had members of INDI Alliance not said that we should not talk about PoK as Pakistan has got nuclear bombs, we had no reason to discuss it. BJP is opposed to such dangerous ideas and has to tell people about its stand.Religion-based quotas are a violation of the Constitution, which only allows quota for SCs/STs and OBCs on grounds of social and educational backwardness. It is those who have implemented religion-based reservations who are guilty of communalism and appeasement. We are only explaining the constitutional position and our resolve to correct these errors.Ram temple was never a political issue for us, it represented our faith and belief. It should not be seen through a political lens. We corrected Himalayan blunders of Congress with construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and abrogation of Article 370 and people appreciate that.I reiterate that BJP will emerge with the highest combined tally of seats from Karnataka, Telangana, AP, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. BJP is expanding well in south India because people there support PM Modi’s leadership irrespective of language, even ideology.Those who say BJP does not understand South probably don’t understand us. We are people who live for Bharat and when we talk about Bharat, isn’t South also part of it? When we talk about Indian culture, we also express our respect for the culture and traditions of South and all other regions.YSRCP and BJD were never our allies. They supported us on some bills, but they also opposed us on others. Why should parties not support each other on issues that are in national interest? Do you want a Parliament where parties don’t come together for people’s issues? We also supported Congress on occasions on issues of national interest but did that make us allies of Congress.I don’t think we suffered a debacle in the assembly polls. We did hope to form the govt. But going from three seats to 77 when we had only 5% vote share and when Congress and CPM drew a blank was no mean achievement. In the last LS polls, we won 18 seats, and we will definitely improve this time. LS polls are about who is going to be the PM. People in Bengal are also voting against cut money, infiltration, appeasement and TMC’s opposition to CAA. Atrocities in Sandeshkhali have shaken women. Imagine, poor women were sexually exploited for years under the nose of a woman CM on the basis of their religion. This itself renders her ineligible to continue as CM. People of Bengal are firm on making Narendra Modi prime minister. I am sorry to say, unlike you people, we don’t have to depend on findings of surveys. We go by the response from people and I am confident of getting 30 of the 42 seats in the state; take that from me.(Interrupts) This is part of the pattern in Bengal where atrocities are committed and then victims are subjected to trauma and injustice for a second time by being forced to deny their suffering. When I was party president, I went to a family over lunch and they were made to pay a huge price for that. One member of the family was hanged. Is this democratic politics? But when people’s tolerance threshold is breached, they refuse to take it lying down. Today, it is BJP alone, which has emerged as the champion of their cause.Wait a moment. Just consider the facts. Arvind Kejriwal ji went to SC claiming that his arrest was illegal and he got rebuffed. So, during the course of hearing, he changed tack and sought release on bail only to be turned down by the court yet again. The court gave him interim bail saying you are the president of a party and have a democratic right to campaign but you have to come back to jail on June 2. He has neither been adjudged innocent nor has he been given bail. He will be back in Tihar jail on June 2. On the contrary, his claim that his arrest was illegal has been rejected. How can he play victim and gain mileage out of it? Here is a man who entered politics claiming to be a crusader against corruption, he vowed never to enter politics, but he became CM and then engaged in corruption. The man who declared that he would never live in a govt accommodation went on to build a palatial bungalow — sheesh mahal — out of people’s money. Don’t people know all this? In fact, whenever he goes out to campaign, people will be reminded of him being the mastermind of the liquor scam, the luxurious mansion that he built for him self. I have a simple request for him… please invite 15 common citizens from each of the seven Delhi Lok Sabha constituencies and let them see the opulence and luxury that you are enjoying at their cost. Can he invite even 15 journalists for a tour of his sheesh mahal?How can I challenge anybody, I can only make a request.This is a desperate attempt to mislead people… It has been made clear by me, our party president (J P Nadda), Rajnath Singh ji that Modi ji will not just complete his third term but will continue to lead us beyond that.That was applied in a particular situation, there is no such thing in our party constitution and in this election, BJP has fielded at least 10 candidates who are above 75 years. That apart, I would like to reiterate that Modi ji will complete his term and continue afterwards also.(Interrupts) Let us speak on the basis of facts. In 2014, we declared our commitment against corruption but there is no instance of agencies being misused to arrest anyone without evidence. Of the 5,155 PMLA cases registered since Modi took over, only 3% involve politicians. Leave that apart. Haven’t courts been approached in the case of each of these investigations? Why have the cases not been tossed out? Now look at my example, I was thrown into jail on the basis of fabricated charges. But I didn’t go around crying that I was a victim of vendetta, it was the court, which not only quashed the case, but also made the observation that the whole case was politically motivated.Yes. Since they (AAP) are in an opportunistic alliance with Congress, their erstwhile sworn rival, it is possible that in a couple of seats margins will be different but ‘lotus’ will bloom in all seven.The two gentlemen are parked in the garage and are wheeled out at election time to advance Congress’s agenda. Political parties are entitled to have their opinions no matter how controversial but they should have the courage to spell them out. We express our viewpoint freely and boldly but they do so by stealth. Aiyar and Pitroda are their stealth missiles. Both are useful for their politics of deception. Congress tries to distance itself from their remarks whenever it suits it and stages a show of taking action against them when things go awry. I have lost count of the times Aiyar was suspended and then rehabilitated with full honour. Pitroda’s remarks dividing people on the basis of facial features are reflective of the Congress mindset, which believes that India is just a collective of different ethnicities who have somehow been packed together. What they don’t recognise and appreciate is the emotional and cultural bonds which have integrated us for thousands of years. We appreciate the diversity and are also aware of the civilisational unity of this land. Also, Aiyar only articulated the Congress’s view that PoK be considered part of Pakistan. They are scared of Pakistan.Nothing can be more ridiculous and I am surprised you are putting this question to me. We had the numbers to change the Constitution for the past 10 years. We have fulfilled all our commitments: Article 370, CAA, UCC, triple talaq, enacted laws for economic reforms and for radical changes. If abolition of reservation was on our agenda, we would have done that by now using the same numbers. You don’t need 400 seats to amend the Constitution. We are not a party with a hidden agenda. The opposition is lying and misleading. On the contrary, it is they who have violated the Constitution by implementing religion-based quota… they have stolen from the share of SCs/STs/OBCs by implementing religion-based quota for Muslims.You repeated only half the accusation. Rahul Gandhi has, in fact, called the bonds the world’s biggest extortion scheme. Let me answer. We got Rs 6,000 crore through bonds and Congress got Rs 1,400 crore. So isn’t Rahul Gandhi’s allegation an admission, going by his own charge, that he also extorted Rs 1,400 crore? Members of the INDI Alliance have received Rs 6,400 crore which is more than what BJP got. Aren’t they also guilty of extortion? Now look at it in percentage terms… BJP with 383 MPs got less than Congress with 78 MPs. By that yardstick, they have got over Rs 9,000 crore. Then if we accept Rahul Gandhi’s logic, who is the bigger extortionist? And look at the language he uses, after all, the scheme was passed by Parliament. Now come to the second part, the SC in its wisdom has cancelled it but I still maintain that we need to take steps to check the role of black money in elections. Take BJP’s case: before bonds we would get more than 80% in cash, which came down to 4% after launch of the scheme. The most ill-kept secret is that cash accounted for 90% of political funding. The bonds represented a much needed corrective. True, nobody knew who donated to whom. But this confidentiality was required because we have different political parties ruling in different states and it was essential to save donors from possible persecution for not helping one party or the other. That is why they insisted on paying in cash.What I am saying is that this is a sensitive issue which needs to be debated at length by all stakeholders like political parties and civil society. We have to find a way to stop unaccounted cash from our political process.We have to wait for the post-poll declarations by political parties.I only said I will pursue my legal remedies. If you manipulate and morph my video and my speech, am I not entitled to take legal recourse…? I think I am.It is definitely his democratic prerogative and rules also allow that. The issue here is that he didn’t disclose to people in Wayanad his intent to contest from Rae Bareli as well. He waited for polling in Wayanad to be over. And mind it, he went to Wayanad because he could foresee his defeat in Amethi. This time he is apprehensive of a setback in Wayanad and that’s why he has come back to Rae Bareli and not Amethi. He is taking people of Wayanad and Rae Bareli for granted.Since you have been echoing what our opponents say, you should not call it GST but Gabbar Singh Tax… shouldn’t you? I don’t know about the people whose lies and lines the opposition is parroting. But they are either ignorant or dishonest. GST is, globally speaking, the most successful scheme to simplify and rationalise taxes. Sixteen taxes have been clubbed into one while traders have been liberated from the trauma of having to file 16 different forms by taking the entire process online. Figures speak for themselves, GST collections have increased from Rs 60,000 crore at the time of launch to Rs 218 lakh crore in April 2024. Numbers don’t lie. Those who talk about a single tax, can there be one tax for bicycle and Mercedes? Fertiliser has 5% tax and gambling has 28% tax, should the rates for them be identical?They are blinded by their prejudice and their own lies. The success of Digital India and Make in India has been acknowledged globally. In 2023, 103 billion digital transactions worth Rs 166 trillion took place in the country. Over 46% of the world’s total digital transactions take place in India. UPI is now accepted by seven countries of the world — France, Bhutan, Oman, UAE, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Mauritius. Similarly, 2,74,246km-long optical fibre network that is part of the Bharat Net programme has connected 1.15 lakh gram panchayats. Since the launch of Make in India campaign in 2014 to make India a manufacturing hub, FDI has doubled. We have introduced PLI scheme in 14 sectors, resulting in new jobs and India becoming an exporter of finished products.","Amit Shah said there’s a positive vote in favour of the BJP.

Is there anti-incumbency against you? If yes, what’s your strategy to overcome it?

Despite numerous meetings with you, locals say many of their longstanding demands remain unmet such as a government college for girls and a flyover near Mohanlalganj tehsil.

INDIA bloc has pledged to conduct a caste-based census and to raise reservation above 50% if it assumes office. What are your views and those of your party?

Will your rival, INDIA bloc’s RK Chaudhary, pose a challenge?

Will it be ‘Abki baar 400 paar’ for BJP?

Union minister and BJP candidate,, is seeking a straight third term from Mohanlalganj and says there is no anti-incumbency against him. Amid a hectic day of public meetings and engaging with voters at his residence, Kaushal Kishore spoke toabout his campaign and BJP’s vision.There is no anti-incumbency against me.I have been in the constituency even before the enforcement of the model code of conduct, and have been constantly engaging with the people in five assembly segments. Around 1,000 people visit my house daily seeking assistance. I personally interact with them, and even my personal phone number is available to every member of the Mohanlalganj constituency . People across the country have recognized BJP as the party dedicated to the nation's development.Defence minister Rajnath Singh has assured that flyover from Koneshwar Crossing to Dubagga and Sitapur Bypass will be built. As for the other pending demands, I have written to the authorities regarding both the overbridge near Mohanlalganj tehsil and the government college for girls. Work will begin after elections. Mohanlalganj MLA has also advocated for a dedicated government college for girls, and work will begin soon.(Laughs) Rahul Gandhi always tells a pack of lies. What reservation did Rahul Gandhi and his party provide when they were in power? PM Modiji has consistently worked for the people of the country. We revoked Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir to uphold the Constitution. Soon, we will witness people from POK wanting to reside in India, supporting our govt. The opposition lacks concrete plans and issues, so it tries to mislead people by raking up such issues. Modiji and my party have never discriminated against giving facilities on lines of religion or caste. We categorize castes into four parts: women, youth, farmers, and poor. Our PM and leadership will decide on the census after the elections.In a democracy, everyone has the right to contest elections. I am confident of winning with a significant margin. You will get the answer on June 4.Yes, for sure. People will give us the numbers to make India a ‘Surakshit Bharat, Behtar Bharat, Viksit Bharat, Atmanirbhar Bharat’. People have become wise. Recently, former Pakistan minister Fawad Chaudhry praised Rahul Gandhi, calling him ‘saheb’ and suggesting he has the qualities to become PM, while urging people to ‘stop Modi’. Voting for Congress, Samajwadi Party, Mamata Banerjee, or Rahul Gandhi is now being seen as voting for a PM under Pakistan’s influence. Nobody wants that, so they have decided to vote for ‘Viksit Bharat’ and ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’.",Kaushal Kishore is seeking a straight third term from Mohanlalganj and says there is no anti-incumbency against him.

'If you come and do something here...': Jaishankar on India's 'message' against terrorism after Uri and Pulwama terror attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-you-come-and-do-something-here-jaishankar-on-indias-message-against-terrorism-after-uri-and-pulwama-terror-attacks/articleshow/110097865.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a poignant reflection on India's stance against terrorism , external affairs minister S Jaishankar underscored the nation's resolute message through surgical strikes and airstrikes in response to terror attacks like those in Uri and Pulwama .Speaking at an event titled 'India's Vishwabandhu Approach to Global Relations' at Mumbai's Constitution Club, Jaishankar invoked the memory of the tragic 26/11 Mumbai attacks while highlighting the subsequent strategic actions undertaken by India.Addressing the audience, Jaishankar acknowledged the world's sympathy towards India in the aftermath of the 26/11 attacks but noted a reluctance to escalate tensions with Islamabad. He attributed this global sentiment to India's failure to effectively convey the imperative of combating terrorism as a shared global threat.""When 26/11 happened you all know what our response was or to be very frank, what our non-response was. But you also know that our response was very different in Uri and Balakot. And there was a reason. Because Uri was across the Line of Control and Balakot was across the international boundary,"" Jaishankar said addressing the event. ""So the message was, if you come and do something here, you may be across the LoC, you may be across the international boundary- we will still come and get you there,"" he added.Reflecting on India's response, Jaishankar juxtaposed the restrained approach following 26/11 with the decisive actions taken after subsequent attacks. He emphasized that India's retaliatory measures in Uri and Balakot sent a clear message that perpetrators of terrorism would not find safe havens across borders.The EAM further said that India had not lobbied the world against terrorism and couldn't make them understand that anyone can be the victim of the menace.""Now, I want you to think for a moment, about the reaction of the world. When 26/11 happened, everybody said yes very bad, we sympathize with you...but do not create tensions with Pakistan. Because we had not lobbied the world, we had not made the world understand what terrorism is, it is a danger for all...Today, it is my turn, tomorrow it will be yours,"" the EAM said.The Mumbai attacks of November 26, 2008, perpetrated by the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed the lives of over 166 individuals and left hundreds injured. In response to subsequent attacks, India conducted a surgical strike in 2016 targeting terror camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir after the Uri attack, and an airstrike in 2019 against Pakistani terror camps in Balakot following the Pulwama attack.Jaishankar lamented the lack of concerted efforts to lobby against terrorism globally, emphasizing the need to delegitimize terrorism and garner international support for decisive action.Highlighting India's evolving global stance, Jaishankar emphasized the concept of ' Vishwa Bandhu ', suggesting that a country's ability to rally international support strengthens its position in global affairs. He underscored the importance of effectively conveying India's perspective to the world, noting the stark contrast in global reactions to different instances of terrorist aggression.""By the time from 2008, we had reached 2016 actually. We did Uri (surgical strikes) and the world said the Indians did what the Indians had to do. We did Balakot (Air strikes)...- Why was it that the world was understanding about Uri and Balakot, but the world was so tense, or I would say, indifferent on 26/11 because a lot of people sympathized with us, but stopped there,"" the EAM said.""And the reason is that we had not made that effort to delegitimize terrorism, to convince the world...Being Vishwa Bandhu, if you are able to carry the world with your viewpoint, you are that much stronger, you have that ability,"" he added.Earlier in the day, Jaishankar engaged with various stakeholders in Mumbai, including investors, students, and social media influencers. Emphasizing the need for a strong and experienced government, he stressed the importance of making informed decisions to propel India towards its envisioned future.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke at an event titled 'India's Vishwabandhu Approach to Global Relations' He said India's response to the 26/11 Mumbai attacks was restrained. He said this was due to India's reluctance to escalate tensions with Pakistan.

He also added that the nation expects Modi to participate in the debate.Rahul’s post was in reply to Justice (Retd) Madan B Lokur, Justice (Retd) Ajit P Shah and senior journalist N Ram, who had written to him and the PM earlier this week, inviting them to a platform for a debate on the key election issues.“Congress welcomes this initiative and accepts the invitation for a discussion,” Rahul said. “We agree that such a debate will help people understand our respective vision and enable them to make an informed choice. It is also critical to put to rest any unsubstantiated allegations attributed to our respective parties. As the principal parties fighting the election, the public deserves to hear from their leaders directly. Accordingly, either myself or the Congress President would be pleased to participate in such a debate,” he added.In the invite addressed to PM Modi and Rahul, it was pointed out that the PM has publicly challenged Congress on reservations, Article 370 and wealth redistribution. On the other hand, Kharge has questioned the PM on possible “mutilation” of the Constitution, electoral bond scheme and the govt’s response to China and also challenged him to a public debate. In this backdrop, a debate will help the citizens to hear directly from the political leaders, the invite said.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said he or party chief Mallikarjun Kharge would be pleased to participate in such a discussion. “It would be a positive initiative for the major parties to present their vision to the country from one platform for a healthy democracy,” Rahul wrote on X.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110043668,imgsize-51232,width-400,resizemode-4/110043668.jpg"

Chabahar agreement: India takes major step in Central Asia with Iran port deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chabahar-agreement-india-takes-major-step-in-central-asia-with-iran-port-deal/articleshow/110090725.cms,"Why it matters

Chabahar port's strategic location on Iran's southeastern coast, close to the Pakistani border, positions it as a pivotal gateway for India’s trade ambitions, enabling direct access to Central Asia.

Located on the Gulf of Oman near the Iran-Pakistan border, it offers India a crucial trade route bypassing Pakistan.

This is particularly beneficial for trade with landlocked Afghanistan and Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan.

The agreement leverages the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200-kilometer-long network connecting India, Iran, Russia, and Europe.

Bypassing Pakistan allows India to diversify its trade routes and reduce dependence on its neighbor.

Economic benefits

The deal is expected to unlock significant economic benefits for both India and Iran. India Ports Global Limited (IPGL) will invest $370 million in developing port infrastructure and equipment. This investment is expected to:

Increase cargo handling capacity at the port.

Improve efficiency and reduce transportation costs.

Facilitate trade between India, Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia.

Create new job opportunities in the region.

Between the lines

This agreement represents a deepening of ties between India and Iran, amidst shifting geopolitical landscapes.

With the US's past imposition of sanctions and the consequent stalling of the port's development, this new agreement is a clear move by both nations to assert their economic independence and strategic interests in the region.

The operationalization of Chabahar port is expected to shift regional trade dynamics significantly. It not only bypasses Pakistan but also provides a strategic route to landlocked Afghanistan and beyond. This development is part of India's broader strategy under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership to enhance India's maritime capabilities and extend its trade corridors deeper into Eurasia.

What they're saying

Iran's urban development minister, Mehrdad Bazrpash, remarked during the signing, ""Chabahar... can act as a focal point in the transit development of the region. We are pleased with this agreement, and we have full trust in India.""

India’s minister of ports and shipping, Sarbananda Sonowal, noted, ""This long-term contract symbolizes the enduring trust and effective partnership between India and Iran,"" highlighting the deal as a cornerstone for future cooperative ventures.

""It will clear the pathway for bigger investments to be made in the port,"" external affairs minister S Jaishankar told reporters in Mumbai on Monday.

told reporters in Mumbai on Monday. ""Right now the port has not grown. If you don't have a long-term agreement it is difficult to invest in a port. So the very clear expectation is that part of the Chabahar that we are involved in will definitely see more investments, it will see more connectivity linkages coming out of that port,"" Jaishankar said.

""We believe today that connectivity is a big issue in that part. Chabahar will connect us with Central Asia,"" he added.

What’s next

The bottom line

India and Iran sealed a critical 10-year agreement on Monday to jointly develop and manage the Chabahar port , a move that significantly deepens their strategic and economic cooperation. The pact underscores India's intent to expand its geopolitical footprint and boost trade across the West and Central Asian regions.Under the agreement, India Ports Global Limited (IPGL) committed to investing $370 million to enhance the port's infrastructure.This includes acquiring strategic equipment and expanding the transport facilities, essential for transforming Chabahar into a dynamic regional hub for trade transit.Looking ahead, the focus will shift towards the rapid and efficient execution of the infrastructure and equipment upgrades stipulated in the agreement. Both nations anticipate that the fully operational port will act as a catalyst for increased trade flows and economic integration across the region. Moreover, this agreement is likely to spur further investments and might encourage other nations to look at Chabahar as a viable alternative to traditional trade routes.By securing this long-term agreement, India not only strengthens its ties with Iran but also strategically positions itself as a significant player in Central Asian trade. This move has potential ramifications for India’s geopolitical clout, offering it increased leverage in regional politics and trade negotiations.(With inputs from agencies)",India and Iran sealed a critical 10-year agreement on Monday to jointly develop and manage the Chabahar port.

Innocent villagers were gunned down while collecting tendu leaves , they claimed.DIG (South Bastar) Kamalochan Kashyap said those killed were Maoists, many of whom carried bounties.CM Vishnu Deo Sai praised police for their action against Maoists. “Just two days ago, 12 Maoists were killed in an encounter,” CM said on Sunday.In Bijapur, the protest is gaining momentum. Tribal rights activists plan to visit Pidiya village, around 40km from Bijapur and 470km south of Raipur, on a fact-finding mission and Maoists have issued a statement alleging that innocent villagers were killed in police action.Protesters from Pidiya village in Bijapur’s Gangaloor region, where the alleged encounter occurred, began arriving at the district headquarters on Saturday. They are now camping there, seeking justice for the ‘fake encounter’. Women protesters claimed that security forces shot residents from Pidiya and neighbouring Itawar village when they were gathering tendu leaves, a crucial livelihood activity in the area. One of the agitators, Avlam Budri, said police arrested her husband during tendu leaf collection on Friday.Tribal activist Soni Sori, who accompanied them, told reporters in Bijapur that Friday’s police encounter was fake and security personnel had “fired indiscriminately at tendu collectors”. Rakesh Avlam, who identified himself as a Pidiya resident, alleged that one of his cousins was injured in police action.Former Congress CM Bhupesh Baghel posted on X that security forces should “keep in mind that their ultimate commitment is to the Constitution. Political pressure on security forces to achieve results should not lead to questioning their actions. There is a need to solve the naxalite problem while maintaining the morale of security forces.”Maoists’ West Bastar division committee described the Bijapur encounter as fake and urged people to “condemn the massacre”. Maoists alleged that 1,200 security personnel fired indiscriminately at tendu collectors, even shooting a two-inch mortar cell and a rocket launcher at them. Several innocent villagers were injured and should receive medical care, Maoists said, demanding action against the forces, release of the detained villagers, and a judicial probe.Security forces have been on the offensive ever since BJP govt took over in Dec last year. The CM said 104 naxalites have been eliminated this year in encounters with security forces, including 12 in Pidiya.","Security forces claimed to have killed 12 Maoists in an encounter in Bastar’s Bijapur.

""When they (BJP) denied you (the voters) houses and pension, the Hemant-led state govt launched a housing scheme to provide houses to the poor and the universal pension scheme.

Attacking Modi and BJP's divisive agenda and their changing narratives with each passing phase, he said, ""They began the election with 'abki baar, 400 paar', but shifted to mutton, mangalsutra and Muslims. This is reflective of Modi's nervousness as he knows that they are on a sticky wicket. It is time to vote for jobs, communal harmony, and to restore your fundamental rights as a citizen of this country.""He added that BJP and Modi's USP was to spread lies about Congress's manifesto, which talks about inclusiveness. ""He (Modi) now says that Adanis and Ambanis are sending money to Congress. Who is stopping you from acting against Adanis and Ambanis? Are you scared of them? When you can put opposition leaders in jail on charges of money recovery, why can't you find the money trail of Adanis and Ambanis?"" he questioned.Congress fielded K N Tripathi as the INDIA bloc candidate from the Chatra Lok Sabha seat and Jay Prakash Bhai Patel, who had recently switched to Congress from BJP, from Hazaribag.

In 2019, 14.4% voting was recorded.Pune saw 51.3% polling, although it managed to better last time’s record of 49.9%. Similarly, Kanpur reported 52.9% polling compared with 51.6% in 2019, while Kannauj, where Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav is contesting, reported a marginal improvement in polling performance — from 60.86% to 60.89%.Barring Telangana and J&K, all other states where elections were held on Monday reported lower turnout; the sharpest decline was recorded in Madhya Pradesh where 71% polling was registered, against 75.7% in 2019. Polling time in certain assembly segments of the 17 parliamentary constituencies in Telangana was increased due to higher voter participation, EC said in a statement.While West Bengal, where polling was held in eight seats, recorded the highest turnout of 78.4%, it was still lower than five years ago. Among the 96 seats, where 1,717 candidates were in the fray, Bolpur recorded highest polling of 81.2%, against 85.7% in 2019.

The updated numbers for the fourth phase are expected Tuesday evening.In a statement, EC said peaceful polling was reported in 96 constituencies spread across 10 states and J&K. With this round, polling has now been completed in 23 states and Union Territories along with assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.EC said it has now upgraded the voter turnout app to enable Android phone users to take screenshots. “This measure is in addition to the transparency measures taken by the Commission including showing state-wise overall turnout on Voter turnout app and releasing phase-wise electors’ data,” the statement said. The move comes amid allegations of the poll panel “delaying” the release of polling numbers.","The overall turnout for 2019 does not include the delimited seat of Srinagar, which recorded the lowest turnout this time round, at 38%.

According to cops, in the past one year, Kapoor took about 200 flights — 3-4 sorties in a day at times — with the sole purpose of stealing from co-passengers.His ‘frequent flyer miles’ paid off handsomely and he was able to buy a hotel in central Delhi. But his ‘miles’ finally expired when he recently targeted two people flying to the US via Delhi and allegedly took away jewellery worth lakhs of rupees, prompting the police to begin a hunt.Though Kapoor had provided forged documents and an incorrect mobile number to book the flight, they managed to track him down using technical surveillance .DCP (airport) Usha Rangnani said Kapoor meticulously planned his every move. “He would use the identity documents of his deceased brother while booking tickets. He would mostly stalk passengers of connecting flights and generally target elderly women carrying handbags, assuming they would not notice the theft immediately,” she added.According to Rangnani, Kapoor used to strike either before completion of boarding or while the aircraft was mid-air.“Exploiting the chaos of boarding, Kapoor would secretly rifle through overhead cabins, carefully assessing and stealing valuables from handbags of unsuspecting passengers who would be settling into their seats. His method, carefully timed to coincide with the distractions inherent in the boarding process, allowed him to operate undetected,” the DCP said.If the target sat at a distance, Kapoor would even request the crew members to change his seat so that he could sit near the person, she added.Kapoor had been allegedly operating since 2005. For many years, he allegedly stole from passengers in AC coaches of trains. Later, he switched to flights.Kapoor landed in the net following police complaints from two passengers in a span of two months. While a US citizen travelling on an Amritsar-Delhi Air India flight approached cops on Feb 22, a Hyderabad-Delhi passenger of an Air India flight lodged a complaint on April 11. Both said they had lost jewellery kept in their cabin bags .Cops analysed the passenger manifest of these flights and scanned footage of over 100 CCTV cameras to finally zero down on the suspect. His phone number was obtained from the airlines, but turned out to be fake. Technical surveillance revealed his original number and the location was traced to Paharganj.It was found that the suspect switched on his handset only for a brief period. His photograph was obtained from social media platforms and shown to people in Paharganj. He turned out to be the owner of a hotel in the area. A raid was conducted and Kapoor was arrested.Police said the suspect may be linked to 11 similar cases. They also arrested his associate, Sharad Jain (46), who allegedly helped him dispose of the stolen goods. “Jain is a jeweller based in Karol Bagh. He received and bought the stolen items from Kapoor,” DCP Rangnani said.","Rajesh Kapoor (40) was a frequent flyer for a bizarre reason.

‘LG will act if he wants’: SC dismisses plea seeking sacking of Kejriwal as CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/lg-will-act-if-he-wants-sc-dismisses-plea-seeking-sacking-of-kejriwal-as-cm/articleshow/110095047.cms,"NEW DELHI:

Supreme Court

on Monday dismissed a petition for

sacking

of Delhi chief minister Arvind

Kejriwal

, who is on interim bail till June 1 in the excise policy case, but reiterated its proprietary concern about a CM continuing in the constitutional post even after his

arrest

.

In a special leave petition, one Kant Bhati had challenged Delhi high court’s April 10 decision rejecting a writ petition by former AAP MLA Sandeep Kumar seeking removal of Kejriwal, who was arrested on March 21.

Noticing that Kant was not even a petitioner before

HC

, which has already dismissed four similar PILs, the bench dismissed the SLP and said, “LG will take action if he wants to… We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned judgment of the HC.”

The bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta did not even allow Bhati’s counsel to open arguments and asked, “What is your legal right to seek removal of Kejriwal? Why should we go into all this?”

However, the bench said the petitioner may have had something to say on the

propriety

of an arrested person to continue as

Delhi CM

. “We had raised the propriety issue when the other matter (Kejriwal’s petition challenging his arrest by ED) came up before us.”

In its April 10 order dismissing Sandeep Kumar’s PIL, HC acting chief justice Manmohan and Manmeet P S Arora had said, “This court is of the view that there is no scope for judicial interference in the present matter. This court in writ jurisdiction cannot remove or dismiss Kejriwal from the post of CM of Delhi or declare breakdown of constitutional machinery in the state. It is for the other organs of the State to examine the said aspect in accordance with law.”

HC had imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 on Kumar for filing a frivolous PIL.

The bench of Justices Khanna and Datta had granted interim bail till June 1 to Kejriwal to enable him to campaign for the general elections but had barred him from visiting CMO and Delhi Secretariat; bound him to his statement that he would not sign any official files; not make any comment on his role in the excise case; and, not interact with any witness nor have access to any official files connected to the case.",The Supreme Court dismissed a petition for the sacking of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

A police contingent was assigned to her thereafter.Sonipat nominee Mohan Lal Badoli also required police intervention after heckling and haranguing by farmers.Officials said the intelligence agencies were on the job to pre-empt any protest brewing in a particular area ahead of poll campaigning by BJP and JJP candidates.In contrast to the former allies, Congress candidates have been campaigning freely and focusing on local issues, besides BJP's alleged plan to ""change the Constitution and snatch the rights of backward communities"".The undercurrents impeding BJP and JJP's poll campaigns coincided with the farmers' agitation at Shambhu and Khanauri on the Punjab-Haryana border completing three months on Monday.Farm organisations are sticking to their demand for a legal guarantee on minimum support price & a blanket debt waiver, among other things.On February 13, the tractor convoys that Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (KMM) had sent out to Delhi ran into concrete walls and boulders at Shambhu near Ambala and Khanauri near Sangrur, a barrier that continues to hold them down.KMM convener Sarvan Singh Pandher said, ""We didn't block the roads at Shambhu and Khanauri, it was the Haryana govt that did so. Now, when we reciprocate, they shouldn't complain.
