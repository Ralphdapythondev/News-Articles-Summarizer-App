There were hutments, known as Khyber Pass Hostel, for accommodation of the support staff of defence personnel. The cleared portion is worth around Rs 1,000 crore.Officials said though the eviction was to begin from March 4, it was stopped at the direction of Delhi High Court . After the matter was examined at length by HC and a judgment was passed on July 9 upholding the eviction order, the L&DO carried out the eviction on Saturday.They added that such valuable land cannot be allowed to be occupied by few individuals for the benefit of few at loss to the govt. The eviction was carried out with support of Delhi Police, Delhi administration, Municipal Corporation of Delhi and Central Public Works Department , sources said.Some of the occupants had earlier taken the matter to the Delhi High Court seeking relief after the L&DO had issued a public notice to the occupants on March 1, 2024 to vacate. The occupants had claimed that the hostels were allotted to their fathers and grand-fathers about 70 years back and hence they were entitled to resettlement.Challenging the eviction notice, petitioners had pleaded before the HC that they could not be evicted by following the due process of law as they were inducted by the ""Officers of the Armed Forces"" to cater to their needs and they were paying rents.The high court, in its order, took note that the petitioners did not show any document as to who inducted them and said since this issue requires leading of evidence, the petitioners needed to file suit and lead evidence to show that they were inducted lawfully by persons who were competent to do so.Relying on the affidavit of the petitioners, which mentioned that no rent has been paid by them after 2001 and, the HC observed that the ""petitioners cannot be called as legal occupants of the land in question and are rank trespassers"". It also rejected the argument that the petitioners were inducted lawfully and that they are authorised occupants.Dismissing the petition, the court said it ""does not find any reason"" to quash the notice dated March 1, 2024.","Land and Development Office (L&DO) cleared almost 15 acres of prime land in Khyber Pass in Civil Lines area on Saturday.

Teen rape survivor fights back after 3-week nightmare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/teen-rape-survivor-fights-back-after-3-week-nightmare/articleshow/111723767.cms,"Representative image

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

GHAZIABAD: “My only aim now is to become an achiever in life, something people know me for,” a 15-year-old girl told TOI on Saturday as she returned to school after three traumatic weeks. During this period, she was sexually assaulted by a neighbour, closeted herself in at home as the family feared social shame, and saw her name being struck off the school rolls.The scrapping of her enrolment came with a rebuke from her government school principal who – unaware of the girl’s reason for absence – told her father on Thursday to get her married if he wasn’t interested in sending her to class.It was mistimed scorn, which the principal realised on Friday when she was informed about the sexual assault. But word had spread by then. The principal drew heavy criticism on social media as the sexual assault on the girl, the removal of her name from school and her comments to her father conflated into one narrative.Education department officials stepped in on Friday after they learnt about the police case that the teen ’s parents had filed after the June 26 sexual assault. School had reopened on July 1 after the summer vacations, but she hadn’t shown up. Three other girls hadn’t either. It was seen as unexplained absence, and on July 10, the principal decided to scratch their names from the rolls. According to officials, in all cases of absence from school, a student must write a note to the class teacher or principal with specific reasons for absence. The girl’s father told TOI on Saturday she had not stepped out of home since the June 26 incident because of shock. He also spoke of being worried for her safety because the assailant – a married man – lives in the same colony.The accused, who had allegedly met her at Swarn Jayanti park several times, is now in judicial custody, police said, after being charged with rape and criminal intimidation under sections of BNS and provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. He had on June 16 invited her to meet him at a hotel, where he took her to a room and allegedly raped her. “She left for tuition, which generally gets over by 2pm,” the father said. Usually, she is back by 3.30pm but that day, wasn’t home till 6pm. “She looked pale when she returned and did not talk. Next day, I asked her about it and that’s when she told me about the incident,” he said. The episode derailed the family. The girl isolated herself as she tried to cope. The parents wept and worried. Amid this despair, the school de-rostered her. On Friday night, however, the principal was at their door, her manner and demeanor nothing like the voice on the phone that had chided the father. The principal told TOI on Saturday she re-enrolled the girl after the district inspector of schools informed her about the sexual assault case and decided to go speak to the girl herself to convince her to continue with her education. “The girls whose names were withdrawn did not inform the school about their absence.We have come across several instances of girls dropping out because their families got them married. I thought she wasn’t coming to school for the same reason,” she said of her July 11 call to the teenager’s father. It (the de-rostering) was meant as a warning. At that time, I didn’t know what had happened. Once I knew, I personally met the family. We spoke for around three hours,” she added. The girl’s father confirmed the principal had met them, underlined the need for her to return to school and extended her support. “Education is important. We realise that,” he said. On Saturday, the teenager took a step back towards restoring normalcy to her life and returned to school. But the most familiar of places seemed altered. “It was strange. Everyone was looking at me. It seemed like many things had changed. But my friends came and spoke to me. With time, I guess things will be normal,” she said. Her school bag is packed for Monday.","15-year-old girl was sexually assaulted by a neighbour, closeted herself in at home as the family feared social shame, and saw her name struck off the school rolls.

Centre grants J&K LG more powers ahead of assembly elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-grants-jk-lg-more-powers/articleshow/111723619.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of impending assembly elections in J&K, the Centre has defined more clearly unambiguously the powers of Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Jammu and Kashmir with regard to matters like the police, postings and transfers of officers of all-India services including the IAS and IPS, Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and grant or denial of prosecution sanction.A notification issued on Friday to amend the Transaction of Business of the Government of Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir Rules, 2019, states that no proposal which requires previous concurrence of the finance department with regard to ‘police’, ‘public order’, ‘All India Service’ and ‘Anti-Corruption Bureau’ to exercise the discretion of LG under the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019, shall be concurred or rejected unless it has been placed before the LG through the chief secretary.This sub-rule gets added to Section 5(2) of 2019 Transaction of Business Rules, which simply stated that no proposal with which the finance department has not concurred, may be proceeded with, unless a decision to that effect has been taken by the council of ministers and approved by the LG.Sources said with a state government and legislative assembly set to be installed after the assembly elections, the sub-rule was added to rule out any ambiguity with respect to Section 32 of the Act that allows the J&K legislative assembly to make laws with respect to any of the matters in the State list except ‘police’ and ‘public order’ or the concurrent list. Also Section 53 of the Act empowers LG to exercise his functions in his discretion in matters falling outside the purview of powers conferred on the legislative assembly, related to the all-India Services and Anti-Corruption Bureau, etc.“In view of the aforementioned provisions, the powers of the legislative assembly and functions of the LG have been clearly defined and delineated in the Act and same is now reflected in the transaction of business rules…the current notification is to provide better clarity on the processes so as to enable smooth administration of UT of J&K,” a senior home ministry official told TOI on Saturday.The Transaction of Business notified on Friday amend Rule 43 of the principal rules by inserting a fourth proviso stating that matters connected with prisons, directorate of prosecution and forensic science laboratory, shall be submitted to the LG by administrative secretary, home department through the chief secretary. Similarly, matters connected with postings and transfers of administrative secretaries and cadre posts of All-India Services officers shall also be submitted to the LG by the administrative secretary of the general administration department through the chief secretary.Rule 42 sees addition of a sub-rule 42A stating that the department of law, justice and parliamentary affairs shall submit to the LG through the chief secretary and chief minister, the proposal for appointment of the Advocate-General and other law officers to assist the Advocate-General in court proceedings. Another new sub-rule 42B makes it mandatory for any proposal for grant or refusal of prosecution sanction or filing of appeal to be placed before the LG through the chief secretary by the department of law, justice and parliamentary affairs.MHA sources said Friday’s notification does not “in any sense alter the balance of powers as enshrined in the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019”. The Act was passed by Parliament in 2019 and upheld by the Supreme Court. An official added that it was in exercise of powers conferred on the President of India by Section 55 of the Act that the transaction of business rules have been amended.","The Centre has defined more clearly unambiguously the powers of Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Jammu and Kashmir.

Reports indicate that Gambhir’s recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as the fielding coach has been turned down by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ).Gambhir, who has recently been appointed as India’s head coach, had proposed the name of Jonty Rhodes, widely regarded as one of the best fielders to have ever played the game.Rhodes had previously worked with Gambhir at Lucknow Super Giants, where Gambhir was a mentor. However, the BCCI remains steadfast in its policy of maintaining an all-Indian support staff for the national team, a practice that has been in place for the past seven years.According to a report by the Hindustan Times, the BCCI is not inclined to hire foreign personnel for the support staff. This decision comes as India transitions to a new coaching regime following the completion of the tenures of previous head coach Rahul Dravid and his support staff, which included batting coach Vikram Rathour, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, and fielding coach T Dilip, post the T20 World Cup.As per the same HT report, Gambhir’s proposal for R Vinay Kumar as the bowling coach was also reportedly not supported by the board.Additionally, there were earlier reports from Cricbuzz about Gambhir advocating for the inclusion of former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate in his support staff. Ten Doeschate, who served as the fielding coach for Kolkata Knight Riders, is also involved with the franchise’s teams in the Caribbean Premier League and Major League Cricket.Despite these recommendations, the BCCI has made it clear that the final decision on the composition of the support staff rests solely with them. Gambhir’s setback indicates the board’s commitment to maintaining its current strategy and structure for the Indian cricket team’s support personnel.The cricketing community now awaits the BCCI's final decision on the support staff that will work alongside Gambhir as he embarks on his new journey as India’s head coach.",Gautam Gambhir's recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as fielding coach turned down.

Following a complaint filed by ASI Prasad, the police arrested the SpiceJet employee.

NEW DELHI: In more trouble for IAS probationary officer Puja Khedkar , Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials have issued a notice of illegal encroachment at her residence. According to the PMC's Encroachment Department, Khedkar's residence had unauthorised construction or obstructions on public roads or footpaths under the corporation's jurisdiction.While the details of Khedkar's specific case are not publicly known, the PMC's encroachment removal process typically involves issuing notices, conducting surveys, and ultimately demolishing or clearing the illegal structures if the owner fails to comply.Khedkar has found herself in the middle of a massive controversy over alleged misuse of power and privileges.Officials said all documents presented by her to secure her candidature in the civil services examination and then for selection in the service will be re-examined by a single-member committee constituted by the Centre on Thursday.She may be terminated from service if found guilty, said officials.""The officer may be terminated from the service if found guilty.

'Litmus test' in h

ill state

TMC's clean sweep in West Bengal

NDA in Bihar & BJP in Uttarakhand lose polls

BJP wins Madhya Pradesh

Big win for AAP in Punjab

DMK retains Vikravandi seat

NEW DELHI: In a landslide victory in the assembly bypolls, the opposition INDIA bloc on Saturday bagged 10 out of 13 seats that went to polling across seven states. BJP , which after the 2024 Lok Sabha election managed to retain power at the Centre with the help of its NDA allies, faced a major setback in the polls as it could pull off only two seats.The bypolls were held in West Bengal Punjab , Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Tamil Nadu.Besides West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil and Punjab, where the INDIA bloc is in power -- the opposition alliance also won seats in Uttarakhand, which is a BJP-ruled state.However, Himachal Pradesh's Hamirpur seat was won by BJP's Ashish Sharma.After the party's victory in Himachal & Uttarakhand, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said outcome reflected that people are standing with the oppostion alliance for ""the betterment of their lives and protection of the Constitution"".""The results of the by-elections in 7 states have made it clear that the web of 'fear and confusion' woven by the BJP has been broken,"" Rahul Gandhi wrote in a post on X.""Every class including farmers, youth, labourers, businessmen and employed people want to completely destroy dictatorship and establish the rule of justice. The public is now completely standing with INDIA for the betterment of their lives and protection of the Constitution. Jai Hindustan, Jai(Constitution),"" he further wrote.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said the bypoll victory shows that the""people have now completely rejected the arrogance, misgovernance and negative politics of the BJP"".Taking a cue from the bypolls results and linking it to the 2014 transition of power, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said BJP will continue to lose upcoming polls.""This is a trend which began with the Lok Sabha elections and is moving forward. BJP will continue losing all the upcoming elections,"" Khera told news agency ANI.""This trend began for us in 2014 after which we lost many elections and now BJP will go through the same phase,"" he addedByelections in Himachal were necessitated after three former Independent MLAs - Hoshyar Singh from Dehra in Kangra, Ashish Sharma from Hamirpur and KL Thakur from Nalagarh in Solan - had resigned in March this year and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). BJP gave tickets to all three former Independent MLAs.The Congress had fielded Kamlesh Thakur, the wife of chief minister Sukhvinder Singh, against BJP's Hoshyar Singh in Dehra, Pushpinder Verma against BJP's Ashish Sharma in Hamirpur and Hardeep Singh Bawa against BJP's KL Thakur in Nalagarh.In a litmus test for the former three Independent MLAs, who CM Sukhu repeatedly accused of being part of a BJP conspiracy to topple his government, two of them lost the polls as only Ashish Sharma managed to win from the Hamipur assembly seat.After facing a rude shock due to an unexpected slip in its Lok Sabha tally in West Bengal, from 18 seats in 2019 to 12 in 2024, BJP on Saturday was again routed in the bypolls as ruling TMC won all the four seats that went to polls.Trinamool Congress (TMC) candidates Krishna Kalyani, Madhuparna Thakur, Mukut Mani Adhikari and Supti Pandey won Raiganj, Bagda, Ranaghat Dakshin and Maniktala seats respectively.With the massive victory, the ruling TMC in West Bengal won the Matua community-majority Bagda and Ranaghat Dakshin after a gap of eight years.The BJP secured Ranaghat Dakshin, Bagda, and Raiganj segments in the 2021 assembly election. However, despite the win, the MLAs switched to the TMC.The three seats fell vacant after MLAs Kalyani, Adhikari, and Biswajit Das of Bagda resigned from their posts to contest Lok Sabha polls on TMC tickets. Kalyani, who lost to BJP's Kartik Chandra Paul in the Lok Sabha polls, was re-nominated from Raiganj in the bypolls.The Maniktala seat was won by the TMC in 2021 but became vacant after former state minister Sadhan Pandey died in February 2022.BJP, which is in power in Uttarakhand and Bihar, lost bypolls in the states. In Uttarakhand, the saffron party ceded both the seats that went to poll, while in Bihar an Independent won the election.Congress's Lakhpat Singh Butola won the Badrinath assembly by-election on Saturday, defeating his nearest rival former minister and MLA BJP's Rajendra Singh Bhandari by 5,224 votes. Another Congress candidate Qazi Mohammad Nizamuddin won the Manglaur seat.In Bihar, where BJP & Nitish Kumar's JD(U) are in alliance, Independent candidate Shankar Singh won the Rupauli assembly seats, defeating JD(U) candidate Kaladhar Prasad Mandal by over 5,000 votes.Other than Himachal's Hamirpur, the only seat BJP managed to win was Madhya Pradesh's Amarwara assembly seat. BJP's Kamlesh Shah defeated Congress's Dhiren Shah Inavati by over 3,252 votes.AAP candidate Mohinder Bhagat triumphed in the Jalandhar West by-election, securing whopping 58 per cent of the votes. Bhagat's victory marked a significant setback for Congress, which fell to third place behind the BJP.The ruling DMK emerged victorious in the bypoll to the Vikravandi Assembly constituency by a margin of 67,757 votes and NDA constituent Pattali Makkal Katchi ended up runner-up with 56,296 votes.DMK's Anniyur Siva alias A Sivashanmugam was in the lead position all through the vote-counting exercise and the margin between him and his nearest rival, PMK nominee C Anbumani widened round after round.","Opposition alliance bagged 10 out of 13 seats that went to polling across seven states.

Pakistan news channel airs interview with Hizbul Mujahideen commander amid rising terror attacks in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-news-channel-airs-interview-with-hizbul-mujahideen-commander-amid-rising-terror-attacks-in-jk/articleshow/111716126.cms,"

Implications of the interview being aired:

It demonstrates Pakistan's continued support for terrorist organizations like Hizbul Mujahideen that are designated as such by several countries, including India. By providing a platform for the group to propagate its ideology and activities, Pakistan is enabling the spread of extremism.

The commander's remarks glorifying past acts of terrorism and outlining future plans are alarming. His emphasis on confronting the Indian Army and the significance of declaring Burhan Wani, a Hizbul Mujahideen militant, as a hero suggests the group's intent to escalate violence.

Pakistan's actions in providing a platform for Hizbul Mujahideen's propaganda are likely to worsen the already strained India-Pakistan ties.

NEW DELHI: In a surprising development, a local digital news network in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), conducted an interview with Shamsher Khan, a high-ranking commander of Hizbul Mujahideen -- an organisation designated as a terrorist group by the European Union, India, Canada, and the United States.The interview, uploaded by JK Bol, shows Shamsher Khan discussing the organization's past acts of terrorism and outlining their future sinister intentions.During the interview, the commander emphasised the significance of Pakistan 's Prime Minister declaring Burhan Wani, a Hizbul Mujahideen militant, as a hero at the United Nations. He also remarked that their objective was to ""actively confront the Indian Army and prevent them from being at ease"".This interview comes at a time when terrorist activities are on the rise in Jammu and Kashmir. Recently, five Indian Army personnel were killed, and five others were injured in a terrorist ambush, while nine people were killed and 41 injured in a terrorist attack on a bus travelling to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine.Hizbul Mujahideen, founded in 1989, aims to establish an Islamic state in Kashmir and seeks the merger of Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan.The group has been responsible for numerous kidnappings, killings of civilians and security personnel, bombings, and targeted assassinations of political leaders and individuals during the 1990s.Pakistan's decision to provide a platform for interviews with leaders of designated terrorist organizations like Hizbul Mujahideen is a concerning aspect of the country's stance on terrorism.This interview demonstrates how Pakistan's agents allow such groups to propagate their ideologies and activities, potentially influencing public opinion.The interview with Hizbul Mujahideen commander Shamsher Khan has several concerning implications for the security situation in the region.","A local digital news network in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) conducted an interview with Shamsher Khan, a high-ranking commander of Hizbul Mujahideen.

As per the report, around eight crore new jobs were created in the last three-four years. This figure has silenced those spreading fake narratives on jobs,” he said.The Prime Minister highlighted the positive response from investors, saying that both small and big investors have welcomed the NDA government's third term with enthusiasm. “People are aware that only the National Democratic Alliance government can provide stability,” he said.PM Modi also spoke on the importance of skill development and employment, affirming the government's commitment to these areas. “Skill development and employment are needed in the country and our government is working in this direction,” he said.He outlined the benefits of upcoming infrastructure projects in Mumbai, which aim to boost connectivity and ensure better facilities and safety for women.PM Modi noted the rapid expansion of the metro rail network in Mumbai, which has grown from 8 kilometers ten years ago to 80 kilometers now, with ongoing work on an additional 200 kilometers.The Prime Minister cited the Goregaon-Mulund Link Road as an example of balancing nature conservation with development and mentioned the twin tunnels connecting Thane and Borivali, which will significantly reduce travel time.He also highlighted the transformation of the railways, mentioning the redevelopment of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and Ajni-Nagpur, and the inauguration of new platforms at CSMT and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus.The Centre's approval of the Rs 76,000 crore Vadhavan port in Dahanu, Palghar, which is expected to generate 10 lakh jobs, was also announced.

Satellite images reveal archaeological wealth beneath Bodh Gaya’s sacred site,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/satellite-images-reveal-archaeological-wealth-beneath-bodh-gayas-sacred-site/articleshow/111712577.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recent geospatial study conducted by the Bihar Heritage Development Society (BHDS) and Cardiff University has uncovered evidence suggesting the presence of significant archaeological wealth buried beneath the Mahabodhi temple complex and its surrounding areas in Bodh Gaya , Bihar.According to Harjot Kaur Bamhrah, additional chief secretary of the art, culture and youth department, ""The study has unearthed evidence of the presence of archaeological treasure beneath the soil of the UNESCO World Heritage site and its surrounding areas…It's a huge architectural wealth that needs further excavation.""The project, titled 'Archaeology on the footsteps of the Chinese traveller Xuanzang ', involves collaboration between the UK-based university and the BHDS.M B Rajni, a faculty member from the Bengaluru-based National Institute of Advanced Studies and a project member, analysed satellite images of the Mahabodhi temple and its surroundings, attempting to correlate the findings with the descriptions provided by Xuanzang, a 7th-century Chinese translator monk.The satellite images from recent years reveal an alignment of structures buried underground to the north of the temple. Notably, the images also show a shift in the course of the river Niranjana from east to west.The latest findings suggest that the Mahabodhi temple, the Sujata Stupa, and other archaeological remains were once situated on the same river bank, indicating a strong possibility that the monuments and archaeological remains currently located east of the river were part of the Mahabodhi complex. The BHDS plans to initiate research to define the boundaries of the Mahabodhi complex based on these new insights.Bijoy Kumar Choudhary, executive director of BHDS, elaborated on the findings, saying, ""Our fresh study has revealed several findings that include to the north of the temple premises, a square monastery complex enclosed by a wall with a surrounding moat and an extended settlement to its north."" The square wall of the monastery complex, previously excavated by Alexander Cunningham in the 19th century, holds great potential for systematic excavation.Rajni's report further details the analysis of satellite imagery, identifying two concentric squares: an outer square enclosing 4.9 acres and an inner square enclosing 2.5 acres. The squares significantly overlap with the Samanvay Ashram, and the well observed by Cunningham at the centre of the monastery's pillared court might correspond to one of the two wells located within the Ashram.The southern boundary of the Ashram, marked by a compound wall on a raised ridge, aligns with the southern boundary of the outer square, suggesting the presence of buried remnants of an earlier wall.","Satellite images from recent years reveal an alignment of structures buried underground to the north of the temple.

TOI

NEW DELHI: Probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar , in the eye of a storm over the authenticity of her disability and OBC status claims that got her appointed to the civil services, could face termination of service and even criminal charges of forgery if the one-man panel set by the Centre to probe the matter finds any misrepresentation or suppression of facts on her part.Sources in the government said the panel of DoPT additional secretary Manoj Dwivedi will, over the next two weeks, probe how she obtained the documents establishing her disability and OBC status, and whether proper vetting was carried out by the issuing authority.Khedkar is said to have recurrently failed to appear for mandatory medical tests at AIIMS Delhi to confirm her disability, despite having qualified for IAS in the ‘Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD)’ category.“The panel will submit its findings to DoPT which will then forward the report with recommendations to the Maharashtra government, since she is allocated to the Maharashtra cadre. If found guilty of forging her OBC and disability papers, the state government could terminate her. Also, she may face criminal liability for forgery and misrepresentation,” a source said.The DoPT panel looking into Khedkar’s claims is likely to take the help of social justice ministry to verify her OBC status. Although she claims to be from the economically weaker category, the affidavit filed by her father, an ex-bureaucrat and a candidate in the recent Lok Sabha polls, declared his assets at over Rs 40 crore. Khedkar was shown as the owner of flats and plots worth crores.The panel will, in consultation with experts from AIIMS Delhi, also examine if the visual and mental disability claimed by her meets the benchmarks for employment in the government.A senior government functionary said this was not the first case of a civil services aspirant making incorrect disability claims for selection in the PwBD category. “There are instances almost every year when those selected on the basis of false disability claims have evaded the mandatory medical test at AIIMS Delhi and even escalated the matter to the Central Administrative Tribunal seeking testing elsewhere. Eventually, however, they could not secure an appointment after having failed the test,” the functionary told",Pooja Khedkar is in the eye of a storm over the authenticity of her disability and OBC status claims that got her appointed to the civil services.

Supreme Court Ruling: Citizenship Proof Cannot Be Demanded Without Evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-pick-anybody-randomly-ask-for-citizenship-proof-supreme-court/articleshow/111670723.cms,"NEW DELHI: Noting that while Section 9 of the Foreigners Act outs the burden on an individual to prove he/she is not a foreigner, Supreme Court, in an important ruling, has held that this does not mean govt can pick a person at random, knock on their door, and demand they prove their citizenship. There must be some material against the person before proceedings under the law can be initiated, it stressed.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah held that ""in the absence of the basic/primary material, it cannot be left to the untrammelled or arbitrary discretion of the authorities to initiate proceedings"", which have life-altering and very serious consequences for the person.It said, Section 9 could not be invoked on the basis of hearsay or bald and vague allegation(s).""...the question is that does Section 9 of the Act empower the executive to pick a person at random, knock at his/her/their door, tell him/her/they/them 'We suspect you of being a foreigner'?... Obviously, the State cannot proceed in such a manner. Neither can we as a court countenance such an approach,"" the bench observed, while setting aside the order of the Foreigners Tribunal and Gauhati high court declaring a person from Assam an illegal Bangladeshi migrant.The bench accepted the submission of advocate Kaushik Choudhury who, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that Section 9 could not be used arbitrarily and settled principles of natural justice could not be given a go-by.""It needs no reiteration that a person charged or accused would generally not be able to prove to the negative, if he/she is not aware of the evidence/material against him/her which leads to the person being labelled suspect. Ipso facto just an allegation/accusation cannot lead to shifting of the burden to the accused, unless he/she is confronted with the allegation as also the material backing such allegation,"" the court said.The court said that there was no material in possession of authority which could raise suspicion on his nationality. After fighting a legal battle for two decades, SC came to his rescue and declared him Indian as all his relatives were also declared Indian citizens. The court also said that minor spelling mistakes in names on official documents could not be the sole reason to deny authenticity as happened in the case.""However, mere allegation, that too, being as vague as to mechanically reproduce simply the words which mirror the text of provisions in the Act cannot be permitted under law. Even for the person to discharge the burden statutorily imposed on him by virtue of Section 9 of the Act, the person has to be intimated of the information and material available against him, such that he/she can contest and defend the proceedings against him,""the court said.","Section 9 of the Foreigners Act outs the burden on an individual to prove he/she is not a foreigner.

But within a month, Congress came back to win Badrinath (Lakhpat Singh Butola) and Manglaur (Qazi Nizamuddin) in Uttarakhand, and cornered two of the three seats in Himachal.The significance of the victories is attested to by the fact that Congress suffered a big defeat in the 2022 Uttarakhand polls despite a groundswell in its favour, allowing BJP to buck the state's ""revolving door politics"". Since then, Congress failed to win anything there. Crucially, Badrinath poll was necessitated by the defection of Congress MLA Rajendra Bhandari to BJP during the LS polls.The HP wins are even sweeter for the Sukhvinder Sukhu-led Congress, which survived a major jolt after six MLAs cross-voted to defeat the party's RS candidate Abhishek Singhvi in Feb, raising questions about the survival of the state govt. Congress managed to win four of the six assembly bypolls held along with LS polls. The three bypolls on Saturday resulted from the decision of independents to join BJP. The resilience shown by Congress in Himachal is sure to hurt BJP which sensed that bypoll victories could pave the way for another attempt at the Sukhu govt.In all, Congress is enthused by the fact that it has won on weaker turfs, coupled with the realisation that voters finally appear to be reacting to day-to-day realities instead of being taken in by the rhetoric and personality politics of BJP under Modi. Congress has also won a major bragging point with the victory in the temple town of Badrinath, after SP's win in Ayodhya (Faizabad) in the LS contest. Observers said voters are chafing at the massive redevelopment project undertaken in Badrinath, which has left locals worried about their livelihoods because of demolition and displacement.

Madhuparna defeated BJP’s Binay Kumar Biswas by 33,455 votes, while 66-year-old Supti outdid her husband and former minister Sadhan Pandey of BJP by 62,312 votes.Krishna Kalyani defeated BJP’s Manas Kumar Ghosh by 50,007 votes in Raiganj — giving TMC its first win in the constituency. Mukut Nami Adhikari defeated BJP’s Manoj Kumar Biswas by 39,048 votes in Ranaghat South, which TMC had last won 13 years ago.

Kamlesh polled 32,737 votes (57.94%), while Singh got 23,338 votes (41.3%). Congress’s Hardeep Singh Bawa won Nalagarh against BJP’s KL Thakur by 25,618 votes. BJP won the Hamirpur seat by a narrow margin of 1,571 votes with Ashish Sharma polling 27,041 votes against Congress’s Pushpinder Verma’s 25,470 votes.Wednesday’s bypolls were necessitated after three former independent MLAs — Hoshiyar Singh, Ashish Sharma, and KL Thakur — resigned in March and joined BJP.With these two victories, Congress has increased its tally from 38 to 40 in the 68-seat Vidhan Sabha, while BJP’s total seats have risen from 27 to 28. Before the Feb rebellion, when six of its MLAs left to join BJP, Congress held 40 seats. On June 4, by winning four of the six seats in the bypolls, Congress had bolstered its position from 34 to 38 seats.In Uttarakhand, after suffering a crushing defeat in the LS polls, where it lost all five seats to BJP, Congress made a strong comeback by winning two assembly bypolls, with its candidates Lakhapat Singh Butola and Qazi Mohammad Nizamuddin taking the Badrinath and Manglaur seats, respectively. Butola won by 5,095 votes, defeating Rajendra Singh Bhandari, who had switched from Congress to BJP just before LS polls. Nizamuddin’s victory was by a slender margin of 422 votes over BJP’s Kartar Singh Bhadana.In Madhya Pradesh, BJP’s Kamlesh Pratap Shah won the Amarwara seat by 3,027 votes against Congress’s Dheeran Sah Invati. Congress led until the 17th round, but BJP clawed back in the 20th and 21st rounds. BJP was elated as it succeeded in dismantling another stronghold of Congress stalwart Kamal Nath. In both the 2018 and 2023 assembly elections, Congress won all seven assembly segments in Chhindwara, which the former CM represented in LS for nine terms. For the first time in 44 years, BJP defeated Congress in Chhindwara in an LS election, with Vivek Bunty Sahu defeating Kamal Nath’s son Nakul by over 1.1 lakh votes this year.DMK retained the Vikravandi assembly constituency in Tamil Nadu, with candidate Anniyur Siva winning by a margin of 67,169 votes. Siva secured 1.23 lakh votes against PMK’s C Anbumani, who polled 56,026 votes. The bypolls, held after the death of DMK MLA N Pugazhenthi, saw 82.48% voter turnout. CM MK Stalin attributed the win to overcoming “slanderous campaigns and lies” from BJP-led alliance over the govt’s handling of illicit arrack sales, which claimed 66 lives in Kallakurichi recently.In Punjab, AAP’s Mohinder Bhagat won the Jalandhar West seat by defeating BJP’s Sheetal Angural by 37,325 votes. The seat fell vacant after Angural resigned as the AAP legislator and joined BJP in March along with AAP MP Sushil Rinku. Bhagat was with BJP before he switched to AAP during LS bypolls of 2023. His father Chunni Lal was a BJP minister and had won the constituency thrice, including when it was Jalandhar South, before delimitation.Independent candidate Shankar Singh won Bihar’s Rupauli seat, defeating JD(U) nominee Kaladhar Mandal by 8,246 votes and pushing RJD nominee Bima Bharti to third place. The bypolls were necessitated after Bharti, the incumbent JD(U) MLA, switched to RJD to contest the Purnia LS seat, where she lost to independent candidate Pappu Yadav.","Trinamool Congress (TMC) won all four seats in Bengal, wresting three from BJP and retaining one, taking its tally to 222 in the 294-seat Bengal assembly.

"Union minister Amit shah pitches for co-op boost, green energy use in border villages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/union-minister-amit-shah-pitches-for-co-op-boost-green-energy-use-in-border-villages/articleshow/111719891.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah , who on Saturday reviewed the implementation of ‘ Vibrant Villages Programme ’ (VVP) aimed at accelerated and integrated development of villages bordering China, has stressed on the need to create job opportunities for their residents, have the local agricultural and handicraft products sourced by cooperatives and the use of green energy maximised in these villages.Chairing the meeting on VVP, attended by Union Home Secretary and ITBP DG, Shah said the Narendra Modi government is committed to the all-round development of the border villages by increasing their connectivity with the rest of India, thus preventing out-migration by their residents.Shah, who is also the minister of cooperation, said that Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Army deployed around the border villages should encourage purchase of local agricultural and handicraft products through cooperatives. He underlined that the healthcare facilities of Army and CAPFs should be regularly made available to benefit the residents of nearby villages. He stressed upon maximum use of solar energy and other renewable sources of energy like windmills etc in these villages.Prime minister Narendra Modi prefers to call the border villages as ‘first villages’, a change from the past when they were referred to as the ‘last villages’. VVP was launched in February last year in a bid to win over the hearts and confidence of border residents, who form the first line of defence against any border transgressions or war. Happy border population makes the base for a stronger information network, was the mantra behind the VVP initiative.The home minister had, coinciding with the visit of residents of VVP villages to Delhi this year to watch the Republic Day parade, said that VVP has helped “bridge the distance between hearts”, with the government spend on the infrastructure upgrade of these villages in the last five years being twice the total expenditure incurred on their development in 70 years of Independence.Shah on Saturday directed senior ministers and officials to continue their efforts to understand the issues of VVP villages. Ministers and officials have been undertaking visits to the border villages on PM’s direction. So far, more than 6000 events have been organised in VVP villages, which include about 4000 service delivery and awareness camps. More than 600 projects have been sanctioned by the Govt. of India for employment generation.Under VVP scheme, 136 border villages are being provided connectivity through 113 all-weather road projects at a cost of Rs 2420 crore. 4G connectivity is being worked on rapidly in these areas and by December 2024, all VVP villages will be covered. Appropriate steps are being taken to ensure financial inclusion in all these villages and India Post-Payment Banks (IPPB) are also being facilitated there.Work is being done to develop tourist circuits to bring vibrancy to these vibrant villages. In this endeavour, capacity building and tourism-related infrastructure is being developed in coordination with the tourism ministry.","Vibrant Villages Programme (VVP) aimed at accelerated and integrated development of villages bordering China.

PTR fencing fails to curb man-tiger conflicts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ptr-fencing-fails-to-curb-man-tiger-conflicts/articleshow/111719057.cms,"PILIBHIT: The poor quality of the 9-foot-high chain-link fencing , spanning 42.5 km between the Mala, Mahof, and Barahi forest ranges of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) and adjacent agricultural fields, has undermined efforts to mitigate man-tiger conflicts .Initially introduced in a 17.5 km stretch as a pilot project in 2019-20, the fencing was expanded by 25 km in 2023-24, costing Rs 7.75 crore, after PTR authorities claimed it was more effective than solar fencing.PTR authorities initially deemed the chain-link fencing sturdy enough to last decades. However, it has sustained significant damage, with the base wall deteriorating and the wire mesh bent by illegal infiltrators. This damage has failed to prevent wild animals , especially tigers, from entering agricultural fields and has not curbed human infiltration into the core forest area, perpetuating man-wildlife conflicts.A member of the field forest force , speaking anonymously, revealed that the inferior quality of the fencing had been reported to the former Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), who took no action.The current DFO of PTR, Manish Singh, said, “a panel of forest officials has been formed to investigate and report within a week. Inquiries into the fencing work in the Barahi forest range will be handled by the Haripur range officer, while the Mahof range officer will examine the Mala forest range, and vice versa.”“Since the contractor’s final payment has not been cleared and sufficient funds, including security money, remain with the department, the contractor will be directed to repair the damages and ensure the fencing meets the assigned standards, Singh added.","Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) has 42.5 km of chain-link fencing.

The warden who is supposed to stay overnight at hostel, leaves the premises over to a woman guard and goes to her home, leaving girls vulnerable.In such a negligence, a minor 16-year-old girl was impregnated by an unknown person and the whole matter was hushed up by Kujur and the girl was sent back home, without giving exams, in April.The warden didn’t make efforts to find the one responsible for pregnancy nor reported the matter to her seniors, despite that it falls under Pocso act.The matter reached the local people only when the classmates of girls were terrified with the whole incident that the survivor was prevented from appearing for exams and they told their parents.The villagers also asked not to deploy any male staff at girl’s hostel as they are left vulnerable in such a situation.
