"In Karnataka, freshers lose out as 'repeaters' double",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-karnataka-freshers-lose-out-as-repeaters-double/articleshow/111527686.cms,"BENGALURU:

The number of repeat NEET-UG candidates seeking entry into medical and dental colleges in Karnataka nearly doubled from 28,064 in 2023 to 53,616, reflecting the direction provided by last year’s results when those repeating the test outperformed first-time aspirants.Of the 11,000 MBBS and BDS seats at stake in the state in 2023, repeat candidates filled 7,012.Unlike JEE for technology courses, there is no bar on the number of attempts an aspirant can make to clear NEET. Data suggests strong competition, with nearly 24 candidates for every medical seat.“Repeaters land more seats because they are dedicating more time exclusively to cracking the entrance test ,” said H Prasanna, executive director of the Karnataka Examinations Authority that oversees admission to undergraduate professional courses in the state.The number of students who registered for NEET this year included 11,111 from the 2023 batch and 10,658 who cleared their Class 12 exams in 2022. Two students from 1997, too, appeared for NEET-UG this year, along with aspirants from 1999, 2000 and 2002.Successful repeaters in NEET-UG 2023 included a candidate each from the 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014 batches. At 4,600, the highest number of repeat candidates to land MBBS or BDS seats were from the 2022 batch. Another 1,640 were from the 2021 batch.“Around 24 lakh students are vying for a lakh seats this year. Writing NEET is becoming like the civil services, and cracking it at first attempt is becoming harder each year. Many bright first-timers lose seats to those who would have spent an extra year or two preparing for the test,” said Sridhar G, founder of a coaching centre that is starting a batch exclusively for repeat candidates.","Of the 11,000 MBBS and BDS seats at stake in the state in 2023, repeat candidates filled 7,012.

Rahul Gandhi: Rahul Gandhi raises concerns over compensation for Agniveer's family,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhi-raises-concerns-over-compensation-for-agniveers-family/articleshow/111524315.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid claims and counterclaims, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reiterated his assertion that deceased Agniveer Ajay Kumar ’s family has not received any compensation till date though it has been six months since he died.With Kumar’s father saying that he has only received insurance with a private bank, Rahul included it in a video to say, “There is a difference between compensation and insurance.He has not got ex-gratia , salary arrears yet. Whatever govt may claim, this is the truth.”Rahul’s remarks on Agnipath scheme and Agniveers touched off a controversy in Lok Sabha during the debate on motion of thanks, with top BJP ministers led by Rajnath Singh contradicting his claims and asking him to validate his assertions in the house. In his video, the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha said the country now has two grades of martyrs — one who gets the status of a martyr accompanied by pension, canteen and other benefits, and an Agniveer who does not get that.Congress ex-servicemen department head Rohit Chaudhry and Anuma Acharya, both former defence officers, said Agnipath scheme should be scrapped as it is inimical to national security and the welfare of soldiers.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reiterated his assertion that deceased Agniveer Ajay Kumar ’s family has not received any compensation till date.

A Rourkela sessions court sentenced her on Dec 20, 2014.Sunita, now 64, filed an HC appeal the same year. In its order on Thursday, an HC bench of Justices S K Sahoo and Chittaranjan Dash held that there was ""no clinching evidence against the appellant (Sunita)"".The bench observed the circumstances on record do not form a complete chain to conclude with certainty that the woman committed the crime. ""The findings of the trial court are not justified, the circumstances in favour of the appellant have been ignored and, thereby, it has resulted in miscarriage of justice,"" the bench added.Setting aside Sunita's conviction by the trial court under Section 302 of IPC (murder), the HC ordered her release. The bench observed that the trial court had jumped to conclusion that Sunita had committed the murder despite lack of direct evidence.""In a case based on circumstantial evidence, there is always a danger that conjecture or suspicion may take the place of legal proof,"" the bench said.","Sunita Mundari had poured kerosene on husband Mangal and set him on fire at Jhirpani village in Sundargarh on Nov 28, 2011.

Green Party's Sian Berry defeated AI Steve with a margin of over 28,000 votes, according to the data presented by BBC.After winning the election, Berry took her X and said, ""What an incredible night. Thank you, Brighton Pavilion! And a huge thank you to all the volunteers who have worked so hard to earn every single vote we got. I can’t wait to get to Parliament so I can take your all of your voices with me and hold this new Government to account.""Endacott was an independent candidate for the Brighton Pavilion constituency in the southern seaside town.

The AI then proposes policy ideas and asks for suggestions from the community.Earlier, the Electoral Commission, the elections watchdog, clarified that if AI Steve wins, it is Endacott who will serve as the member of parliament, not the AI version of him.Meanwhile, in the UK General elections, Labour Party won a decisive victory on Friday, ending more than a decade in opposition. This electoral success means Labour leader Keir Starmer will become prime minister later in the day.The sweeping win, achieved in Thursday's vote, ousted Conservative leader Rishi Sunak from office and presented Labour with the substantial challenge of revitalizing a stagnant economy and a dispirited nation.","Businessman Steve Endacott's AI-generated avatar, AI Steve stood from Brighton Pavilion constituency.

"Change at 10, Downing Street renews hope of FTA movement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/change-at-10-downing-street-renews-hope-of-fta-movement/articleshow/111526683.cms,"Top Picks For You 29 new desi MPs elected to House of Commons, set new record

NEW DELHI: Keir Starmer 's election as the next British Prime Minister has renewed hopes of movement on the proposed free trade agreement , where negotiations moved slowly during Rishi Sunak's term, with the Indian side also hoping that his presence in 10, Downing Street will be a buffer against extremist elements who have been engaged in anti-India propaganda.India's relations with the Labour Party suffered a major blow in 2019 after the latter, under its previous leader Jeremy Corbyn, called for self-determination for Kashmiris and also demanded that international observers be allowed to enter the Union Territory, after India revoked J&K's special status. Starmer, however, corrected course by reaffirming commitment to the UK's official position that J&K is a bilateral issue .""Any constitutional issues in India are a matter for the Indian Parliament, and Kashmir is a bilateral issue for India and Pakistan to resolve peacefully,"" Starmer later said, participating in a meeting with Labour Friends of India .Reaching out to the Indian diaspora, with whom he wants to rebuild Labour's relations, Starmer has also assured them there's no place for Hinduphobia in the UK. As a part of his outreach, he has joined Diwali and Holi celebrations in London.""The current leadership has moved ahead but it needs to be seen if those who espoused the cause of extremists were those at the fringe and how they are reined in,"" said Yash Sinha, India's former high commissioner to the UK.After the rift, there are signs of improved ties with the Indian govt remaining in touch with Labour leaders in the run-up to the elections, with the most significant meeting taking place between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Starmer when the former visited UK in November. Jaishankar said after the meeting that India valued the bipartisan commitment in the UK towards strengthening the relationship.Given Labour's manifesto and the emphasis on security, Sinha also expects greater cooperation on defence, cyber security and the need to keep the Indo-Pacific free and open.""The initial focus will be on domestic issues but when it comes to foreign policy, India will be right on top,"" the diplomat said. And the FTA - where 14 rounds of talks have been held so far with some ticklish issues still on the table - will be a major thrust.""We will seek a new strategic partnership with India, including a free trade agreement, as well as deepening cooperation in areas like security, education, technology and climate change,"" Starmer's party said in the manifesto.But trade experts see a tweak in the UK's negotiating strategy with business visas, social security and steeper cuts in import duty on Scotch being the focus of talks.Tariff cuts on cars and whisky are two issues on which India has not relented and is pressing hard for business visas and permits to allow more software professionals, doctors and nurses to work in the UK.""The Labour Party manifesto focuses on FTA with India and actually wants to expand the FTA to include other areas of cooperation such as new technologies, environment and security. Therefore, there is no reason to be apprehensive on this front. However, under the Scotland section, the party manifesto has references to working to achieve a significant tariff reduction in India through FTA, we hope that the proposed tariff reductions on Scotch meets their expectations. Moreover, there may be some minor tweaking in visas to professionals as well,"" said Ajay Sahai, director general at Fieo, which represents exports.India is hoping to get lower duty access for its garments and footwear, hoping to compete more favourably with competition from Bangladesh, which enjoys a massive tariff advantage due to its least developed country status.""There are two areas on which we need to keep a watch in the talks: one is the Labour Party's approach on social security. We expect a thrust on fintech and investment should intensify,"" said Sachin Chaturvedi, director general at think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries.","Keir Starmer's election as the next British Prime Minister has renewed hopes of movement on the proposed free trade agreement.

Wanted terrorist hiding in Pak dies of 'cardiac arrest',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wanted-terrorist-hiding-in-pak-dies-of-cardiac-arrest/articleshow/111525466.cms,"NEW DELHI/JALANDHAR: Pro-Khalistan terrorist Gajinder Singh , wanted in India and hiding in Pakistan for four decades since he hijacked a Delhi-Srinagar Indian Airlines flight in 1981, died at 73 in Lahore after purportedly suffering a cardiac arrest earlier this week.Gajinder, who co-founded the radical Sikh outfit Dal Khalsa and was an anti-India campaigner till his last days, had been put on a list of 20 most-wanted terrorists in 2002.He was cremated Thursday close to a gurdwara in the Pakistani city that harboured him, with his daughter Bikramjit Kaur lighting the pyre, Dal Khalsa functionary Kanwarpal Singh said.On Sept29, 1981, Gajinder and four terrorists hijacked flight IC 423 with 111 passengers and six crew members on board. The hijackers forced the pilots to land the plane in Lahore, from where they negotiated with former external affairs minister K Natwar Singh, who was then India's ambassador to Pakistan, for the release of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and several pro-Khalistan terrorists.Gajinder's gang also demanded $5,00,000, threatening to behead the pilots. The hijackers wrapped fruit in newspapers and claimed those were grenades with which they would blow up the aircraft.The hijack drama ended when Pakistani commandos entered the aircraft after diplomatic pressure from India. Although the then Pakistan govt claimed to have incarcerated the hijackers for years, pictures surfaced in 1986 showing them free. Satnam Singh and Tejinderpal Singh, the two who returned to India, were arrested, tried and acquitted.Gajinder travelled to Germany in 1996 but was barred from entering the country due to objections from India. He returned to Pakistan and stayed low for several years. While India kept seeking his deportation, Pakistan denied his presence in its territory.In 2016, Dal Khalsa merged with another radical outfit named Panch Pardhani, while retaining its name to push the secessionist Khalistan agenda.Gajinder's whereabouts remained unknown until Sept 2022, when a picture of him on social media revealed his location in Pakistan. He had posted the picture of him standing in front of Gurdwara Panja Sahib at Hasan Abdal in Pakistan's Punjab province.At a function in Hoshiarpur on the 41st anniversary of the hijacking, Dal Khalsa appealed to Pakistan to consider granting Gajinder political asylum.On April 14 this year, 11 years after Indian death-row convict Sarabjit Singh was killed in Pakistan jail, his arrested murderer, ISI henchman and LeT founder Hafiz Saeed's associate Amir Sarfaraz, was shot by bike-borne gunmen in Lahore's Islampura locality. Without naming India, Pakistani authorities ordered an investigation into his killing as a ""targeted attack"".",Pro-Khalistan terrorist Gajinder Singh died at 73 in Lahore after purportedly suffering a cardiac arrest.

"Tihar to Parliament, Baramulla MP Rashid engineers a new identity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tihar-to-parliament-baramulla-mp-rashid-engineers-a-new-identity/articleshow/111522790.cms,"Rap icon

Eminem

famously sang, ""Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?"", when his fictional alter ego seemed burdened by the weight of an image defined in the public imagination.

The persona of Sheikh Abdul Rashid , aka Engineer Rashid, stands at the cusp of a similar identity conundrum.So, who is this 1967-born Kashmiri incarcerated at Tihar since 2019 in a terrorist-funding case, who went head-to-head with Omar Abdullah and Sajad Lone in an election in J&K's Baramulla , and polled more votes than the two of them combined?Rashid's story begins at Mawar village in Langate tehsil of Kupwara at a time when Pakistan-backed terrorism was still to inflict wounds that would fester.As a teenager growing up in the 70s, Rashid was drawn towards the separatist sentiments brewing in his neighbourhood and beyond.He wouldn't have known then of the turmoil that would tear J&K asunder in the decades to come. But it was those early impressions that drove the trajectory of a life and career shaped by strong political convictions, marred by controversies, and riddled with ironies.Along the way, Rashid got a BSc degree in 1988 and, subsequently, a civil engineering diploma that helped him land a job in the state-owned Jammu and Kashmir Projects Construction Corporation.When he transitioned from construction sites to the political arena full-time in 2008, the epithet ""Engineer"" became Rashid's first name. That very year, he won an election for the first time as an Independent candidate for north Kashmir's Langate assembly seat.""I am the most misunderstood MLA in India,"" Rashid was quoted as saying on October 20, 2015, a day after he had his face sprayed with ink by intruders at Press Club of India in Delhi.Earlier that month, he had been slapped inside the J&K assembly for hosting an alleged ""beef party"" at a govt guesthouse. Rashid was then in his second term as MLA of Langate and laying the building blocks for his fledgling Awami Ittehad Party.In the public eye, Rashid often sought to debunk perceptions of the ideology his politics was anchored to. He would question why the media portrayed him as ""a secessionist masquerading as an MLA"" while separatists in J&K purportedly disliked him for ""embracing the Constitution"".Between these twin images at either end of the perception periscope possibly lies Rashid's truth.The newly elected Baramulla MP cut his teeth in politics when he joined slain separatist Abdul Gani Lone's J&K People's Conference in 1979. He went on to contest the Langate seat on a Muslim United Front ticket in 1987, making an unremarkable debut in an election that opponents of the then CM, National Conference's Farooq Abdullah, said was stage-managed.Rashid's first brush with the law came in 2005, when the Special Operations Group of J&K Police arrested and charged him with supporting terrorists. He was jailed under the Public Safety Act for three months and 17 days.Before his arrest by NIA in the ongoing case under UAPA, 2019 had been a windsock in some ways for Rashid as a politician. He unsuccessfully contested the Baramulla Lok Sabha seat that year as an Independent, but fetching over a lakh votes and finishing only 800-odd behind People Conference's Sajad Lone showed him where he stood.This time, contesting as an Awami Ittehad Party candidate with a call to ""progress, prestige and protection"", Rashid left it to his sons Abrar Rashid and Asrar Rashid to drive an emotive campaign that swept away Sajad Lone — the son of his former mentor — and former ex-CM Omar of National Conference as well as the other 19 candidates in the fray.","Sheikh Abdul Rashid is a 1967-born Kashmiri born in Mawar village in Langate tehsil of Kupwara. As a teenager growing up in the 70s, Rashid was drawn towards the separatist sentiments brewing in his neighbourhood.

Naidu intends to highlight the strain and the absence of development, which has seen disruption of the Polavaran irrigation project and his plans to build Amaravati as the new state capital, through a series of five white papers.Naidu said he will let people decide what is to be done. He is also looking to use his earlier experience to put Andhra back on the development path and rope in investors, both domestic and foreign. Apart from Union ministers, the Andhra CM also met several industry leaders and acknowledged that there were concerns over the political climate in case there was a change of guard in the state. ""They are concerned about the devil. We are assuring them that we will control it,"" Naidu said. He also insisted that his party is not demanding any seats or a common agenda as BJP and the alliance partners have released their own manifestos.""We did not ask for any ministerial post from the Centre, not even during Vajpayee's time. Whatever was offered, we accepted,"" he said and recalled accepting Lok Sabha Speaker's post during the Vajpayee era ""only to"" maintain good relations with the alliance.""The party's priority is rebuilding Andhra Pradesh, which has suffered irreparable loss in the last five years. Our aim is to rebuild the state in the next five years. The people of Andhra Pradesh have given mandate to NDA. We will work together,"" he added.On quotas for minorities, an issue that Modi flagged as a concern during the general elections, Naidu said his party had used economic backwardness, not other considerations, for giving reservation.","Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is starting a skill census in the state.

Mahua seeks FIR against Rekha Sharma



'Manifestations of depraved mindset'

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra has once again stoked controversy with her ""pajamas"" remark on Rekha Sharma, the chairperson of the National Commission for Women (NCW). The commission has reacted strongly to the TMC leader's ""derogatory, crude"" remarks and sought strict action against her. However, undeterred by NCW's FIR threat, the Trinamool MP dug up old remarks of Rekha Sharma and called her a ""serial offender"".On July 4, NCW chief Rekha Sharma went to Hathras to meet the women who were injured in the tragic stampede that claimed 121 lives. Videos showed the NCW chief at the stampede site with someone holding an umbrella for her.Reacting to the video, several users on social media wondered why the NCW chief could not hold the umbrella herself. Mahua Moitra reacted to one such post and took potshots at the NCW chief. ""She’s too busy holding up her boss's pajamas,"" the Trinamool MP wrote attacking Rekha Sharma, who is often accused by opposition parties of working for and at the behest of the BJP-led NDA government.Mahua Moitra's snide remarks evoked strong reaction from Rekha Sharma, who called the TMC MP a ""troll"". ""She is not interested in her work but just trolling people, and I don't give my time to trollers,"" the NCW chief said attacking Mahua Moitra. Rekha Sharma also clarified about the incident and said she was not inside the umbrella. ""I didn't ask for it nor did I realised that someone is carrying umbrella as there was so much rush & I was engrossed in the situation & talking to people,"" the NCW chief said in a post.Sharma also wrote letters to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Delhi Police Commissioner Sanjay Arora over Moitra's remark.The National Commission for Women later took suo moto cognizance of Mahua Moitra's derogatory remarks and sought an FIR against the Trinamool MP.""The National Commission for Women has taken suo moto cognizance of the derogatory remark made by Ms. Mahua Moitra, Member of Parliament, against Ms. Rekha Sharma, Chairperson, NCW. The crude remarks are outrageous and a violation of a woman's right to dignity. The Commission observed that this remark attracts Section 79 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, 2023. NCW strongly condemns these defamatory remarks and requests strict action against Ms. Moitra. An FIR should be registered against Ms. Moitra and a detailed action report should be communicated to the Commission within 3 days,"" the NCW said in a post tagging Delhi Police.However, the Trinamool leader remained defiant and undeterred by NCW's FIR threat and launched a counter attack. She dared the Delhi Police to come to Nadia in West Bengal and arrest her.""Come on @DelhiPolice please take action immediately on these suo moto orders. Am in Nadia in case you need me in the next 3 days to make a quick arrest. I Can Hold My Own Umbrella,"" Mahua wrote on X, responding to NCW's tweet on her remarks.Later in a post on X, Moitra shared several screenshots of Rekha Sharma's old remarks against various leaders like Arvind Kejriwal, Sonia Gandhi and Lalu Prasad. She called Rekha Sharma a ""serial offender"" and sought an FIR.In reply to Moitra's 'I can hold my own umbrella' tweet, Sharma put out a photo of the TMC MP with a person holding an umbrella for her.

Suspend life term only if trial court clearly erred: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/suspend-life-term-only-if-trial-court-clearly-erred-sc/articleshow/111527417.cms,"NEW DELHI: Distinguishing incarceration for a fixed period from life sentences, the Supreme Court on Friday said constitutional courts would not suspend a convict’s life sentence unless prima facie satisfied that the judgment under appeal is unsustainable.Dealing with the plea of suspension of life sentence in a murder case in which a convict was awarded life term, a vacation bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Ujjal Bhuyan said, “There is a fine distinction between sentence for a fixed term and life imprisonment.”“If the punishment awarded is for a fixed number of years, the appellate courts may exercise their discretion liberally to suspend the sentences pending adjudication of the convict’s appeal unless the prosecution points out exceptional circumstances to dissuade the court from suspending it,” it said.Recording the general principle of law that presumption of innocence of an accused gets obliterated upon his conviction by a trial court, the bench said, “When it is case of life sentence, the only test to be applied by the appellate court is whether there is anything palpable or apparent on the face of the record based on which the appellate court would form a prima facie opinion that the conviction is unsustainable or the convict has a good chance of succeeding in his appeal.”However, the SC said in such cases, the appellate court is not to re-appreciate evidence. The court’s order recording these observations came in a case from Gujarat. Justices Pardiwala and Bhuyan said as the HC has prima facie found the trial court to have correctly appreciated the evidence, there is little room for the SC to interfere.At this point, senior advocate Rauf Rahim argued that the man had no prior criminal antecedents and that his sentence is required to be suspended as he has to take care of his widowed daughter-in-law who has three minor children. He also informed the court that since the appeal against conviction was filed before the HC last year, there is little chance of it getting decided in the near future.Taking a humanitarian approach, the SC issued notice to Gujarat govt on the convict’s plea for suspension of sentence and posted the matter for hearing after four weeks.","Supreme Court distinguishes incarceration for fixed period from life sentences.

NEW DELHI: Self-proclaimed godman Surajpal Singh aka 'Bhole Baba' or Narayan Sakar Hari on Saturday broke his silence on the devastating Hathras stampede incident. In a video statement, he said that he has complete faith in the government and ""the one who created chaos in Hathras, would not be spared"".The incident occurred earlier this week during a 'Satsang' in Fulari village, Hathras district, which led to the death of over 120 people, mainly women and children.In a conversation with news agency ANI, ' Bhola Baba ' in Mainpuri said, ""... I am deeply saddened after the incident of July 2. May God give us the strength to bear this pain. Please keep faith in the government and the administration. I have faith that anyone who created the chaos would not be spared.""""Through my lawyer AP Singh, I have requested the members of the committee to stand with the bereaved families and the injured and help them throughout their lives,"" he added.Following the stampede at his 'satsang' in Hathras district, which claimed 121 lives and injured 31, Baba is said to be present at an ashram in Mainpuri.A large number of police personnel have been deployed outside the ashram, and officials remain tight-lipped about Baba's presence inside.Preliminary reports suggest that the stampede occurred when devotees rushed to seek blessings and collect soil from around the preacher's feet, but were stopped by his security personnel. This led to pushing and shoving, causing several people to fall and triggering the chaos that ensued.The police FIR indicates that approximately 250,000 people had gathered for the event, despite permission being granted for only 80,000 attendees.Meanwhile, Devprakash Madhukar, the main accused in the tragic stampede, surrendered to the Uttar Pradesh Police in Delhi on Friday night, as confirmed by his lawyer.Madhukar, the 'mukhya sevadar' of the 'satsang' where the stampede occurred, is the only accused named in the FIR filed at Sikandra Rao police station in Hathras.In a video message, Madhukar's lawyer AP Singh said, ""Today, we have surrendered Devprakash Madhukar, who has been called the main organiser in the FIR in the Hathras case, after calling the police, the SIT and the STF in Delhi since he was undergoing treatment here.""Singh emphasized that they did not seek anticipatory bail, asserting Madhukar's innocence. ""What is our crime? He is an engineer and a heart patient. Doctors said his condition is stable now and so we surrendered today to join the probe,"" he explained.Madhukar's lawyer urged the police to consider his client's health condition during the investigation. ""Police may now record his statement or question him but they must take into consideration his health condition and ensure that nothing wrong happens with him.""Singh also mentioned that questions were being raised about Madhukar's whereabouts, dispelling rumors of him fleeing. ""We did not do anything like filing anticipatory bail or moving court which would have been viewed as an effort to save ourselves and being scared,"" Singh stated.Madhukar will assist the investigation by providing information about the ""anti-social elements"" present at the event. Uttar Pradesh Police had earlier announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for information leading to Madhukar's arrest.In the aftermath of the tragedy, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi visited Hathras and met with the victims' families. During his journey, Gandhi also stopped in Aligarh to meet other affected families.Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath has announced financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh for the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for those injured.A three-member Judicial Inquiry Commission, chaired by Justice (retd) Brijesh Kumar Srivastava, has been established to ensure a comprehensive and transparent investigation.

The indigenisation efforts have been pursued aggressively,” it added.Moreover, increasing arms exports have also contributed to the overall growth in defence production.

List of demands revealed: Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu and Telangana CM Revanth Reddy's priorities in talks with PM Modi in Delhi

Telangana CM Revanth Reddy and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu list demands in meeting with PM Modi. Reddy asks for defense land, coal block allocation, IIM, and housing. Naidu seeks industrial incentives, funds for projects, and criticizes neglect of key projects by previous administration.

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh govt’s demand for financial assistance from the Centre, including loan restructuring , is meant to tide over a projected deficit of Rs 11,000 crore this year, with the state expecting to have a meagre surplus to deploy for development from next year.The Chandrababu Naidu govt has prepared a blueprint that seeks to revisit almost two dozen direct benefit transfer schemes started by the Jaganmohan Reddy administration and initiate a series of steps to bolster revenue, start capital works and provide assistance to the needy, sources familiar with the discussions with the Centre told TOI.Naidu held a series of meetings, including with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, defence minister Rajnath Singh and health minister J P Nadda on Friday.“The treasury needs revenue augmentation and release of funds for capital works. The previous govt stopped critical payments and there is an enormous loan burden. It will take five-six months for us to get it in shape and restart the cycle,” said a source, adding that Andhra will pursue central schemes and some of the focus areas of TDP govt.The Naidu administration is projecting that a series of measures will help generate up to Rs 37,000 crore by the fifth year of its tenure which can be deployed for the state’s development.The TDP govt wants to use the cluster near Visakhapatnam, which is close to Odisha, and the area around Karnataka to create industrial hubs with the proposed port in Duggirajupatnam being a crucial element of the plan. Central assistance for the port was promised at the time of bifurcation of Andhra and Telangana a decade ago, but there has not been any progress.","Andhra Pradesh govt’s demand for financial assistance from the Centre, including loan restructuring, is meant to tide over a projected deficit of Rs 11,000 crore this year.

The good show in sowing can be attributed to focus on sowing of less water-consuming crops such as pulses and oilseeds .Though both the years - 2023 and 2024 - reported deficit rainfall in June, the deficit this year (11%) was bigger than the deficit (9%) last year.Nevertheless, acreage of Kharif crops as on June 28 this year was 59 lakh hectares (over 32%) more than the corresponding period of last year.Agriculture ministry ’s acreage data shows that the total sown area in the country as on June 28 was 240 lakh hectares compared to 181 lakh hectares during the same period last year.The higher acreage is mainly due to an increase in sown area of oilseeds by 26 lakh hectares and of pulses by over 14 lakh hectares. On the other hand, the acreage of the most popular Kharif crop, paddy, remained flat at 22 lakh hectares as on June 28 compared to the same period last year.“Since many areas did not receive rainfall in June, farmers preferred to opt for less water-consuming pulses (arhar) and oilseeds (soybean) over water-guzzling paddy. Such smart choices could see higher acreage this June compared to the same month last year,” said an official.Besides pulses and oilseeds, sown areas of cotton also reported higher acreage. The sown area is expected to increase further in July as there is a forecast of ‘above normal’ rainfall for the month and the deficit has already reduced from 11% on June 30 to nearly 2% on July 5.The government has also been focussing on oilseeds and pulses through various interventions including a signal to farmers by approving higher hike in minimum support price (MSP) of oilseeds and pulses compared to paddy.",The country has reported higher acreage of summer-sown Kharif crops in June compared to the corresponding period in 2023.

"JUH seeks Muslim quota, opposes UCC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/juh-seeks-muslim-quota-opposes-ucc/articleshow/111521043.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind ended its two-day governing council meeting on Friday with a call for Muslim quota based on social, economic and educational backwardness, and reiterated its opposition to Uniform Civil Code (UCC).In a resolution, JUH said “reservation should not be based on religion, nor should it be hindered by religious considerations”, while highlighting that the Constitution provides for reservation for disadvantaged classes deprived of adequate representation.It said Other Backward Classes ( OBC ) at both central and state levels included many Muslim communities and the quota was based on social and educational backwardness. “The 4% sub-quota reserved for Muslim OBCs in Karnataka, as well as quotas in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, adhere to constitutional rights . The meeting urges other state governments to adopt this commendable practice without succumbing to political pressures,” the resolution said.The demand comes in the backdrop of ‘quota’ featuring prominently in the Lok Sabha polls with BJP and Congress targeting each other over quota-related issues.Jamiat’s resolution demanded that Dalits among Muslims be treated at par with Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist Scheduled Castes. “If a Hindu converts to Christianity or Islam, they forfeit their benefits under Section 341. This exemplifies severe religious discrimination ,” JUH claimed and demanded that the govt amend the Constitution to eliminate such religious restrictions.In another resolution, JUH reiterated its opposition to UCC and called it ""part of a broader conspiracy to undermine the religious freedom and constitutional rights of citizens"". Calling implementation of UCC by the Uttarakhand government as “arbitrary and unjust”, it urged the Centre not to proceed with any proposal for UCC.On Thursday, JUH had passed a resolution against “growing hate campaign” and called for a separate legislation to counter Islamophobia by punishing those who incite violence. JUH president Maulana Mahmood Madani had said, “The country cannot thrive on hatred.”The Jamiat also condemned the attempt by central and state govts to “saffronise” the education system and compel students to engage in practices that contradict their religious beliefs. Stating that the “govt’s imposition of compulsory orders for school students to perform surya namaskar, Saraswati puja, Hindu songs, shlokas, or wear tilak is an interference in religious freedom”, JUH appealed to the govt to refrain from such provocative actions.The governing council meeting was attended by nearly 1,500 members and prominent Islamic clerics and scholars from across the country.","Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind calls for Muslim quota based on social, economic and educational backwardness.

In such like cases, the presumption stipulated under Section 114-A ofIndian Evidence Act , 1872 cannot come to the aid of the prosecution/complainant,” held the court while allowing the petition filed by the accused against the FIR and the charges framed against him in the rape case.In this case both the complainant and the accused had met in August 2016 at the Delhi airport and after having extramarital affairs for around five years, the woman filed a complaint against him for rape in 2021. The accused is a senior officer with CRPF and the complaint was working in a private company.

The loco pilots drive trains over long distances, far from home, and are often pressed into duty without adequate breaks, the sources said.This causes great stress and lapses in concentration which is a major cause of accidents, they added.This has been acknowledged by the Indian Railways in multiple reports, including the recent probe in the accident in Vishakapatnam, they further said.The loco pilots demand a weekly rest of 46 hours, which means a train driver returning home on Friday afternoon will return to duty no later than Sunday morning.The Railways Act 1989 and other rules already provide for 30+16 hours of rest per week, which is not being implemented, the sources alleged, adding that aeroplane pilots also typically get this much rest.According to the party, the loco pilots demanded that two consecutive nights of duty should be followed by one night of rest, and trains should have basic amenities for drivers.The lack of rest is caused by understaffing due to the government halting recruitment of loco pilots, the party sources claimed.""Over the past four years, the Railways Recruitment Board has not recruited even a single loco pilot despite tens of thousands of vacancies,"" a party source claimed.Gandhi assured the loco pilots that he has been consistently raising the issue of ""railways' privatisation and lack of recruitment"", the sources said, adding that the Congress leader listened to their concerns and supported their demand for adequate rest.Gandhi expressed hope that this would significantly reduce accidents.As LoP, he promised to take up their demands with the government, the sources said.Since Gandhi undertook the over 4,000 km Kanyakumari to Kashmir Bharat Jodo Yatra from September 2022 to January 2023, he has held several interactions with a cross-section of society from mechanics to farmers and labourers.Gandhi had met labourers here on Thursday and asserted that providing full rights and respect to those involved in manual labour is the mission of his life. He had met workers at Guru Tegh Bahadur Nagar in Delhi and listened to their problems. Gandhi also did manual labour with them at a construction site.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also shared pictures from Rahul Gandhi's interaction with loco pilots.""Loco pilots who run trains in Indian Railways work in very difficult conditions. Long distance trains, long hours of duty, no sleep, no rest, they work under stress and this also leads to accidents. There are more than three lakh vacancies in the railways. Thousands of loco pilot posts are also vacant. The BJP government is not making recruitments,"" she said in a post in Hindi on X.The pilots fear that the Modi government is doing this deliberately with the aim of privatising the railways, she claimed.""Rahul ji assured the loco pilots that he would raise their issue in Parliament as the leader of the Opposition,"" Priyanka Gandhi said.","Gandhi assured them that he would raise their issues in Parliament.
