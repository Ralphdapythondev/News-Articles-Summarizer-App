Kakori centenary: This ‘dharamshala’ was revolutionaries’ resthouse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kakori-centenary-this-dharamshala-was-revolutionaries-resthouse/articleshow/112436769.cms,"TOI photo

Nestled in the bustling Aminabad market of Lucknow, the striking yellow façade of the 111-year-old Chhedi Lal Dharamshala is hard to miss.While many know that the building just in front of the iconic Jhandewalan Park is over a century old, only a few are aware of its role in India’s freedom struggle .This unassuming Dharamshala once sheltered freedom fighters who plotted and executed the Kakori Train Action , an act that shook the very foundation of British rule in India .It is believed that Ram Prasad Bismil , a key figure of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), resided in room number 227 of Chhedi Lal Dharamshala where he planned Kakori Action. Bismil, considered as the mastermind behind the daring operation, was a revolutionary dedicated to India’s independence from British rule. The Kakori Train Action itself was a daring attempt by HRA to acquire funds for their revolutionary activities. The plan involved robbing a govt treasury on a moving train.Current managers of the Dharamshala, Ram Prasad Verma and Ramnath Gupta, said that although they did not have the recorded history of Bismil’s stay due to a fire that occurred decades ago in which past records records were reduced to ashes, their predecessors had told them that Ram Prasad Bismil stayed there. Verma said that he came to know that nine other revolutionaries stayed in other rooms, all of whom had changed their names in the register to keep their identities secret. The revolutionaries used to go to another place to plan train action to avoid suspicion.“Even today, we keep room number 227 neat, clean, and maintained in remembrance of Bismil,” said Rajnath Gupta.To establish the authenticity of the stay of revolutionaries at Chhedi Lal Dharamshala, historian Ravi Bhatt said, “When Bismil was arrested for train action, a bedsheet was recovered from his paraphernalia. It is said that he had used it to wrap the money they looted from the British iron safe during the action.”Ram Prasad Verma, however, rued that though the dharamshala had historic importance, it was facing encroachments despite it being located in a no-vending zone.","Chhedi Lal Dharamshala once sheltered freedom fighters who plotted and executed the Kakori Train Action.

Kakori centenary: Treasure trove of history buried under ignorance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kakori-centenary-treasure-trove-of-history-buried-under-ignorance/articleshow/112436720.cms,"Only 22km from the state capital lies the quiet Kakori railway station which is home to a small two-room museum. Though the museum has many exhibits related to Kakori Train Action of 1925, it attracts not more than 20-30 visitors in a year, according to railway staff.On Aug 9, 1925, a group of revolutionaries , led by Ram Prasad Bismil, boarded the 8 Down train to target a cast iron safe carrying money that had to be deposited to the British treasury.The exhibits of the museum include the iron safe, a British-made brass bell used to signal arrivals and departures of trains on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, 18 documents bearing details of the day’s events, and a bench that was a witness to the event.Despite its historical importance, the Kakori railway museum fails to draw significant attention. To attract more visitors, murals of Kakori martyrs were added and Northern Railway developed the parks at the station as part of ‘ Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav ’ celebrations. However, these efforts failed to draw visitors to the museum.“Only twice a year, in Aug, when the robbery took place, and in Dec, when the revolutionaries were executed, 8-10 people from various walks of life request us to open the museum,” a railway employee said on condition of anonymity. He said that despite govt’s efforts, there was a lack of interest among the people in this crucial chapter of India’s history . Many residents of Kakori are even unaware of the museum’s existence.“I pass by the station every day, but I did not know that there was a museum here. There are no clear signages to attract the people’s attention,” claimed Rajesh Singh, a local shopkeeper. Sunita Devi, another resident, said: “I’ve lived in Kakori my whole life, but I heard about the museum only recently. There is little awareness among people.”Anjali Sharma, a college student, said there was a need for public outreach and steps to popularize the museum. “We were never taught about this museum in school. More educational programmes and field trips could help spread the word,” she said.Kakori Shaheed Smarak , located 2km away from the museum, attracts 50-100 visitors daily, most of them college students.Residents claim that the memorial requires better maintenance. Only two persons, a PWD employee and a volunteer, are responsible for the upkeep of this memorial. The memorial sprawls on 8 bigha land and has over a hundred trees, a temple of revolutionaries, an open theater, waiting area, and a bookstore.Maintaining such a large area with just two people is a major challenge, according to Kakori residents.Rajkumar Mishra, a PWD employee, said: “Pujari Baba (the volunteer) and I clean the site. As the site is big, I also hired a private worker to pick up leaves and cut grass. I’ve requested for more staff, and the district administration has promised to provide five employees, including a gardener.”Prem Yadav, a local resident, pointed out the issue of maintenance. “There are problems like peeling plaster, broken benches, and overgrown grass. The caretakers work hard, but more manpower is required.”Vikas Singh, a resident, said only those who know about Kakori Train Action visit the spot. “The bookstore has about 250 books on the freedom struggle, but people aren’t interested in reading,” he said.Reshma Bano, a Class 8 student, said, “If connectivity and facilities are improved further, the place will attract more visitors.”","Kakori railway museum has many exhibits related to Kakori Train Action of 1925.

Hindu-Muslim unity & amity were last wish of Kakori martyrs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindu-muslim-unity-amity-were-last-wish-of-kakori-martyrs/articleshow/112436664.cms,"HRA embraced Marxist Socialism



Movement fortified



Compelled Congress to reinvent



The Kakori Train Action not only shook the foundation of the British Raj but also brought into limelight the camaraderie between a staunch Hindu and a dutiful Muslim. That pious bond between Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan trumped the British govt’s favourite tool of ‘divide and rule’.“The message given by Kakori Action was much bigger than the action it spoke for.It sent ripples of Hindu-Muslim unity among people and the powers that be,” says Prof Sushil Pandey, a faculty member at the department of history, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (BBAU).A few days before his hanging, Bismil poured his heart out in a letter, urging the people of the country to commit themselves to Hindu-Muslim unity if they had an iota of respect for the sacrifice being made by him and others. Citing Ashfaqullah as a case in point, Bismil also trashed the notion that “Muslims aren’t trustworthy” and asked Hindus and Muslims to work together for the nation’s freedom.“Sarkar ne Ashfaqullah ko Ram Prasad ka dahina haath karaar diya. Ashfaqullah kattar musalman hokar pakke Arya Samaji Ram Prasad ke krantikari dal ke sambandh mein yadi dahina haath bante, tab kya naye Bharatvarsh ki swatantrata ke naam par Hindu Musalman apne niji chhote chhote fayedon ka khayal na kar ke aapas mein ek nahi ho sakte? (Govt has called Ashfaqullah the right hand of Ram Prasad Bismil. If a staunch Muslim Ashfaqullah can work as the right hand of Arya Samaj follower Ram Prasad Bismil, why can’t Hindus and Muslims shun their vested interests and unite for the cause of freedom),” Bismil wrote.“Main toh apna karya kar chuka. Maine Musalmanon mein se ek navyuvak nikalkar Bharatvasiyon ko dikhla diya – jo sab parikshaon mein poorna utteerna hua. Ab kisi ko yeh kehne ka sahas na hona chahiye ki Musalman par vishwas na karna chahiye (I have done my bit. I emerged as a youth from among the Muslims who showed to people of India that he cleared all the tests with flying colours. No one will now have the courage to say that one cannot trust Muslims),” he added.Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh had also penned an essay titled ‘The Last Message of the Martyr of the Nation Shri Ram Prasad Bismil’, published in Kirti in Jan 1928, under the pseudonym ‘Vidrohi’.Citing one of the letters by Bismil, he wrote: “Now my only request to the countrymen is that if they feel sorry at our death, then, with whatever means, they must establish Hindu-Muslim unity; that was our last wish and only this can be our memorial. Whatever I am saying, same is the opinion of Ashfaqullah Khan Warsi. At the time of making the appeal, I talked to him in Lucknow.”Experts are also of the view that the bond between Bismil and Ashfaq became a template and ready reference to counter the divide and rule policy of the British.“Since the revolutionaries were young, their bravery resonated well with the youth whose energy eventually drove the freedom movement in subsequent years,” he said, adding that the years in 1920s and 1930s, had established the revolutionary might of the youth.The main takeaway from the World War I (1914-18) and Russian Revolution (1917-23) was that youth drove revolutions and that labour class and peasants were crucial stakeholders. The opinion had many takers in India as well.Historians are of the view that the simmering sentiment fueled the success of Mahatma Gandhi’s Non-Cooperation Movement. The energy lost its direction with the campaign’s abrupt end after Chauri Chaura violence, but it ignited many Muslims who were lent a face by Ashfaqullah Khan.References establish that the British made serious efforts to convince both Bismil and Ashfaqullah to become approvers. While Bismil was told that he would be saved from death penalty and sent to a foreign land with an allowance, Ashfaqullah was told that Hindustan Republican Alliance (HRA) was a Hindu outfit and that as a Muslim he had no place in it.In his autobiography, Bismil has detailed how British secret services officers played divisive tactics during their visits.The Hindustan Republican Association started as an organization that aimed to establish a federated republic of the United States of India by an organized and armed revolution. After Kakori Train Action, HRA reorganized its tenets and embraced Marxist socialism – a nationalist thought popular in those days. And so, HRA rechristened as Hindustan Socialist Republican Association ( HSRA ).Under Chandrashekhar Azad ’s leadership, all young revolutionaries, Bejoy Kumar Sinha, Shiv Varma, Jaidev Kapur, Bhagat Singh, Bhagwati Charan Vohra, and Sukhdev met at Feroz Shah Kotla ground in Delhi on Sep 8-9, 1928, and reorganized HRA into HSRA. The idea of socialism was introduced and included as a main objective by Bhagat Singh so that India doesn’t just attain political freedom but also economic self-reliance.HSRA became aligned with the movements of farmers and workers. In his book, ‘Modern India’, historian Sumit Sarkar wrote: “Bhagat Singh’s transition to Marxism must be placed in the context of what was in some ways the most striking feature of 1928-29 – a massive labour upsurge (particularly in the railways, cotton textiles and jute).”Marxist influence on HSRA also created a ripple effect and provided an impetus to young socialist leadership in the Congress which dominated Congress in coming years, including post-Independence till mid ’70s.In his autobiography, Ram Prasad Bismil has mentioned that in Kakori Action, three bags of money (bonds) were collected. The money was used to settle all loans of HRA. An amount of Rs 1,000 was invested for procurement of more weapons and the remaining was invested to relocate the heads of different HRA centres from UP to safer places in other states.In the meeting of HSRA, Azad was appointed the ‘Commander of the military division’ whose aim was to free India from the British through an organized armed struggle. However, the leadership also decided to move away from ‘individual heroic actions’ and focus on mass politics and collective action.In Dec 1928, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev avenged the death of Lala Lajpat Rai in police lathi charge by killing JP Saunders, assistant superintendent of police, Lahore.Likewise, on April 8, 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw bombs in the legislative assembly while discussion was on in the Assembly on the Anti-Labour Trades Disputes Bill and a bill to bar British communists and other supporters of Indian independence from coming to India.Citing references from various sources, Prof Pandey said that the Kakori Action compelled the Congress to take a fresh look at their efforts for India’s independence.Stating that Bismil was a member of the Congress and had even attended meetings related to the Lucknow Pact, besides being part of a voluntary reception committee given to Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Prof Pandey said: “From the days of its Kolkata Convention (1906), the Congress party had been pushing the idea of ‘swaraj’ (self-rule) but the party had not defined what it actually meant by it. The Kakori case became a turning point which compelled it to reinvent its ideology and leadership.”In its Lahore Convention (1929), for the first time, Congress pitched for ‘poorna swaraj’ and ‘internal and external sovereignty’. The party also appointed young Jawaharlal Nehru as its president to resonate with the youth,” he said.In the subsequent years, the Congress also formed the All-India Kisan Congress in solidarity with farmers who were also suffering at the hands of the British.Bismil also urged members from different political parties to shun differences and unite under the banner of the Congress to exert pressure on the British. He also wrote a letter to Congress leaders to invite representatives from different walks of life and religions in the party’s Madras Conference.",Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan were close friends. The bond between the two was used to counter the British divide and rule policy. The Kakori Train Action also brought into limelight the camaraderie between a staunch Hindu and a dutiful Muslim.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112436694,imgsize-205296,width-400,resizemode-4/112436694.jpg"
Govt halves income cap for interest subsidy in PMAY 2.0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-halves-income-cap-for-interest-subsidy-in-pmay-2-0/articleshow/112435269.cms,"NEW DELHI: Now urban households earning up to Rs 9 lakh annually will be eligible for interest subsidy scheme (ISS) on home loan for a property measuring not more than 120 sq metre under the newly approved PM Awas Yojna (Urban) scheme, which officials said is aimed at ensuring financial relief for “deserving” beneficiaries — poor, low income and middle income groups.Earlier, the income limit for interest subsidy benefit was Rs 18 lakh for properties up to 200 sq metre. Similarly, the maximum interest subsidy has been capped at Rs 1.8 lakh compared to earlier average of Rs 2.3 lakh.Govt has also brought in the provision of incentive for building affordable rental housing (ARH) for migrant workers , students and working women’s hostels in cities and towns. The entities building such facilities using new technologies would get assistance of around Rs 1.5 lakh for one bedroom (30 sq metre) from Centre and states.As per the norm, such dwelling units will comprise of single bedroom upto 30 sqm, double bedroom upto 60 sqm with living area, kitchen, toilet and bathroom and dormitory bed of up to 10 sqm carpet areas each. Officials said soon a web-based interface will be launched where the live details of such units and dormitories available can be viewed for booking. “The rent will be fixed by local authorities based on surveys of surrounding area. The rent can be revised every second year for not more than 8% and capped at 20% in five years,” a source said.Govt has introduced major changes in the interest subsidy scheme category to leave no room for violation of norms, sources said. As per the new norm, beneficiaries taking loan up to Rs 25 lakh for a house costing maximum Rs 35 lakh will be eligible for 4% interest subsidy on first Rs 8 lakh loan up to 12 years. The subsidy will be disbursed in 5-yearly instalments. Beneficiaries can access their accounts through website, OTP or smart cards.TOI on July 18 had first reported about govt’s move to reduce the income cap to avail the interest subsidy and spreading the disbursement of the subsidy over five years, instead of upfront for better monitoring.Besides ISS and ARH, the PMAY 2.0 has the third unified component of Beneficiary Led Construction (BLC) and Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP). Under these, households with income of less than Rs 3 lakh per annum falling in EWS Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category can get financial assistance of up to Rs 2.5 lakh for building a house on their own land or provided by govt or for buying a flat.Sources said the earlier component of in-situ slum redevelopment (ISSR) under the PMAY has been subsumed in AHP as such beneficiaries will get higher assistance of Rs 2.5 lakh compared to earlier norm of Rs 1 lakh.","Urban households earning up to Rs 9 lakh annually will be eligible for interest subsidy scheme.

Road Less Taken Part 3: Higher. Faster. Stronger

PARIS: Neeraj Chopra wiped the sweat off his face and got up to leave. It had been a long day. Midnight was just round the corner. His press conference duties were over. He was spent physically and mentally.""The TV duties are still there Neeraj, for the Indian media,"" came the reminder. He could have said 'no' and walked away.He did not. He was willing to tell his Paris story one more time. Tricolour draped around his shoulders, he walked wearily towards the L entrance gate. The cameras were being set up there. He was there till 2.45 am, talking about things he has never spoken about before.One saw two faces of Neeraj Chopra here. One after the qualification race on Tuesday. He had aced it, topped it with a throw of 89.34m. He was relaxed, smiling when he came to the mixed zone. There was no hint of apprehension, anxiety or any discomfort. He did not reveal anything about the groin niggle that had started to bother him again, putting doubts in his mind.He said he had healed well and was excited to defend his title. There were no doubts anymore. He was in a comfort zone, secure. Well, he was surprised and annoyed by how things changed two days later at the Stade de France.After he fouled his first throw, he was still relaxed. Then came the bolt. He saw Nadeem Arshad 's javelin travelling in the air, like a dream. It kept going on and on. When it landed, Neeraj's body language changed. 92.97m! How was he going to catch up with that?""I have been in the 88-89m range for years now. But I know deep inside that I have 3-4m (more) in me. There is a big throw inside me,"" Neeraj said later.Neeraj tried to find that when his turn to throw came. Going back to the video footage one can see that he was tense after Nadeem's throw. He was backing himself to go for his biggest one ever. 2-3m more than ever.""I felt good on that second throw. I believe in my arm. Accha jhatka diya (it was a good throw). But at the back of my mind, I was worried about a foul. I always am these days. I was worried about my leg block due to my groin niggle,"" he revealed later.Neeraj managed 89.45m. It was good for a silver medal . So far. But his mind had been taken over by that Nadeem throw. He was tense, he was worried, and he was angry at himself. Neeraj and Nadeem have been throwing on the international circuit together since 2016. Nadeem had never beaten him before Thursday night. That rivalry was certainly playing on his mind.Neeraj kept changing his mark on the runway, try after try. It did not help. He failed to get another valid throw. After his fifth foul, he simply shrugged his shoulders and packed his bag.Silver it was, then. but for him it was simply not enough.""My congrats to Arshad. I've been competing with him since 2016 ( SAF Games , Guwahati). And this is the first time that he has won competing against me.

Aman

beats Cruz to clinch sixth medal for India

PARIS: Aman Sehrawat is just 21 but mature way beyond his age. He has been to hell and back.He lost both his parents when he was just 11 years old. His mother took her own life after battling mental illness for years. His father also died soon after. Aman battled depression and tried to take drugs to forget his pain.He was in a dark place. But his uncle Sudhir Sehrawat was a pillar of support. He backed his nephew to concentrate on his wrestling career , take his mind off negative thoughts. His grandfather Mangeram also motivated him.Inspired by Olympian Sushil Kumar 's exploits, Aman had joined Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi two years before his father passed away. With his uncle holding his hand now, life changed. Aman found peace on the mat. He had a mission in life. He made steady progress, kept reaching new milestones and made newspaper headlines when he became the first Indian to win a gold medal at U-23 World Wrestling Championship .On Friday evening, at the Champs de Mars stadium, a makeshift arena right next to the Eiffel Tower, Aman took on Puerto Rico's Darian Cruz in the 57kg freestylebronze medal match, a weight category in which Ravi Dahiya had won silver for India in Tokyo.Aman dominated his seasoned 29-yearold rival, a three-time medallist at the Pan American Games. After an initial contest, he won comfortably at 13-5. The bronze medal was India's, the country's fifth medal at the Games here.In the first period, Cruz took the lead by grabbing Aman's left leg and pushing him out of the orange circle. 1-0. Aman tried hard to draw level and went up 2-1 soon as he pinned Cruz to the mat. Cruz returned the compliment to go 3-2 up.It was very close at this stage. But Aman started gaining confidence and started attacking more, lunging at Cruz's legs to get the crucial points. He managed to do that midway through the period, to get two points for a 4-3 lead. The Puerto Rican seemed to be tiring now and just before the hooter, Aman got a good grip, Cruz went down to avoid a takedown and Aman was 6-3 ahead.In the second period, Cruz came back determined and got two points. Aman was just a point ahead at 6-5 now. It could have gone either way, but Aman was not giving up. He took two points to go 8-5 ahead. There were just two minutes left for the final hooter. He was looking in control.At this point, Cruz opted for a break, pointing to his left knee. He was trying to catch his breath against the young Indian. After the medical assistance, Cruz was back on the mat, looking a bit tired. Aman saw that and went in for the kill. His strategy was simple. He attacked his rival by grabbing his leg, forcing him to go down and then got on top for two points.With a minute and 7 seconds to go, it was 10-5. With just 45 seconds left, it became 12-5. There was no way Cruz was coming back. Aman secured another point to emerge an easy winner and ran to his coach to celebrate his medal.Hailing from village Birohar in Haryana's Jhajjar district, Aman had a keen interest in mud wrestling as a kid. The move to the mat changed his life.The 21-year-old, the lone Indian in the men's section, had a good outing on Thursday here, posting two big wins to race through the pre-quarters and quarterfinals of the 57kg freestyle.In the quarterfinals, Sehrawat was up against Albania's Zelimkhan Abakarov. The verdict was 12-0 in the Indian's favour as he rattled up the points over the two periods. He had lost to Akabarov at the senior World Championships.Aman lost to his Japanese opponent in the semifinals but returned on Friday to fight for bronze. He was hungry, he was determined. He was the better wrestler.This medal would give some solace to India's wrestling contingent which was in a shock after Vinesh's disqualification.

KOLKATA: A volunteer who works alongside Kolkata Police personnel was arrested Saturday for the rape and murder of a second-year postgraduate trainee doctor at the city’s RG Kar Hospital the previous day.Sanjay Roy was held barely six hours after a seven-member special investigation team (SIT) was set up. The 35-yearold was produced in a local court, where no lawyer agreed to represent him.The court sent Roy to 14 days’ police custody after the public prosecutor likened the assault on the 31-yearold doctor to the 2012 Nirbhaya case.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said “if needed, the accused will be hanged”.Roy is a civic volunteer. Such volunteers help cops in non-law enforcement roles and, while they are paid by the state, they are not officially part of the force.Recruited in 2019, Roy had on multiple occasions been posted at RG Kar Hospital’s police outpost and, therefore, had easy access to every department. What gave him away was a torn earphone found in the seminar room on the third floor of the emergency building where the doctor’s body was found early Friday.CCTV footage showed Roy entering the emergency building at 4am with a Bluetooth device plugged into his ears. When he exited the building 40 minutes later, the earphone was missing. The device later paired with his cellphone, cops said.The postmortem report late Friday confirmed sexual assault on the doctor. The report said there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body -bloodstains on the face, eyes and face, scratch marks and wounds in the private parts. A collar bone was broken.“We arrested the accused due to his strong complicity in the case based on items collected from the spot and CCTV footage,” Kolkata police com- missioner Vineet Goyal said.Investigations revealed the doctor was asleep when Roy attacked her.She and her two juniors ordered food post-midnight and at least five doctors had dinner together in the seminar room while watching Neeraj Chopra win silver in the Olympics. Post-dinner, the others left while she decided to study and rest for a while.According to sources, she was spotted sleeping in the seminar room at least till 3am.Roy, sources said, first entered the RG Kar Hospital premises around 11pm. He was intoxicated.He left the hospital complex soon and reportedly drank some more. Around 4am, he was seen entering the emergency building. CCTV footage showed five others had accessed the area but only Roy could not explain his presence.He later confessed to the crime and admitted throttling the doctor after she put up a struggle.Waves of protests engulfed RG Kar all through Saturday even as junior doctors, house staff and interns in other city hospitals stayed away from work demanding better security and exemplary punishment for the accused.In her first reaction to the crime, the CM called it “despicable” and said the young doctor’s death felt “like a personal loss”.“I have directed it to be taken to a fast-track court. If needed, the accused will be hanged. Though I am not pro-capital punishment, he should be given the strictest punishment,” Mamata told a news channel. She made it clear she had no objections if the doctor’s family demanded a probe by a central agency.","Sanjay Roy was held barely six hours after a seven-member special investigation team (SIT) was set up.

India 'fully ready' to add to fleet 2nd submarine with nuclear-tipped missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-fully-ready-to-add-to-fleet-2nd-sub-with-n-tipped-missiles/articleshow/112433199.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is now all set to commission its second nuclear-powered submarine armed with nuclear missiles for strategic deterrence, while the project to build two nuclear-powered attack submarines with conventional weapons is also headed for final approval amid China’s fast-expanding naval footprint in the Indian Ocean Region.The 6,000-tonne INS Arighat , constructed at the ship-building centre (SBC) at Vizag, is “fully ready” for formal commissioning after extensive trials that saw some technical issues being ironed out with upgrades over an extended period.“The SSBN (naval parlance for nuclear-propelled submarines with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles) will be commissioned within a month or two. She will then join her sister INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018,” a source told TOI.Parallelly, on the conventional (non-nuclear) warfare front, the around Rs 40,000 crore project to indigenously construct two nuclear-powered submarines, armed with torpedoes, anti-ship and land-attack missiles, is now before the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the final nod after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations, another source said.The initial case was for six such 6,000-tonne `hunter-killer’ submarines (called SSNs) under `Project-77’ at the SBC. But it was first whittled down to three and now stands at two vessels. It will take at least a decade to build the first two SSNs, which will be around 95% indigenous, while the next four will be approved at a later stage, the source said.As per long-standing approved plans, India requires at least 18 diesel-electric submarines, four SSBNs and six SSNs to tackle the twin-threat from China and Pakistan, which is also turning collusive in the maritime domain after the land borders.The country, however, currently has only one SSBN in INS Arihant, which is propelled by an 83 MW pressurized light-water reactor at its core, and 16 diesel-electric submarines. Moreover, the conventional underwater combat fleet consists of six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines, apart from six new French-origin Scorpenes.China, in contrast, already has 60 submarines, and is fast building more. Its fleet includes six Jin-class SSBNs, armed with JL-3 missiles that have a strike range of 10,000 km, and six SSNs.INS Arighat will to a certain extent strengthen India’s weakest leg of the nuclear triad, or the capability to fire nukes from land, air and sea. The land and air vectors, with the Agni ballistic missiles and fighters with nuclear gravity bombs, are relatively more robust.While INS Arighat will also be armed with 750-km range K-15 missiles like INS Arihant, she can carry a larger number of them. The real teeth will come when the third SSBN, the slightly larger 7,000-tonne INS Aridhaman with 3,500-km range K-4 missiles, is commissioned next year.The fourth SSBN, which will be able to carry more K-4 missiles, is also being constructed under the secretive Rs 90,000 crore advanced technology vessel (ATV) project launched decades ago. There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs with much more powerful 190 MW reactors.Bigger SSBNs with longer-range missiles will give India’s deterrence posture greater credibility because they are the most secure and survivable platforms for assured retaliatory strikes after a first-strike by an adversary.The SSNs, in turn, are critical because they can discreetly operate at high speeds for long distances while remaining submerged for extended periods to take out enemy targets unlike diesel-electric submarines that have to surface or “snorkel” every few days to get oxygen to recharge their batteries.Till the indigenous SSNs roll out, India is slated to get an advanced Akula-class SSN on lease from Russia in 2026 under the $3 billion deal inked in Mar 2019, as reported by TOI earlier.","The 6,000-tonne INS Arighat is ‘fully ready’ for formal commissioning after extensive trials.

&quot;If an FIR has been filed against an unknown individual and a suspect is detained, their pictures cannot be released to the media. Only after the identification process, as prescribed by law, is completed can the images be made public. Even bringing a person to a press conference without concealing their face is a legal violation if the identification proceedings before the magistrate are incomplete. Allahabad HC advocate SFA Naqvi

MEERUT: The recent arrest of a suspected serial killer by Bareilly police has come under intense scrutiny after people noticed a striking similarity between a previously released sketch of the accused man and his latest photograph.The eerie likeness — down to matching shirt patterns, fabric creases, and facial shadows — has sparked widespread scepticism about the legitimacy of investigation in the case which spanned 14 months from June 2023 until July this year and involved the gruesome murders of nine middle-aged women within a 25km radius in the Shahi-Sheeshgarh area of Bareilly district.A tweet by a Twitter user that went out pointing to the coincidence had by Saturday evening notched up over 10 lakh views.Police defended their investigation. Bareilly SSP Anurag Arya, who led the operation, told TOI, “This was a comprehensive chase involving collaboration with villagers to identify the culprit. We received numerous leads, tracked over 180 suspects, and conducted many interrogations. We collected pictures of suspects while monitoring their movements and set them aside after ruling out their involvement, eventually zeroing in on three persons.”The police, however, going by their account, seem to have released the sketches of the suspects though they also had real photographs of the three men with them.Arya added as explanation: “The sketches of all three were shown to hundreds of villagers, and most of them pointed to the sketch of a man called Kuldeep…” He revealed that the photograph used to create the sketch of Kuldeep was indeed taken when the suspects were called in for questioning at the police station. “The purpose of releasing the sketches was to validate the feedback from our tracking and interrogation teams with input from the locals”.Fuelling the controversy is a growing theory that the Uttar Pradesh police might have arrested 35-year-old Kuldeep Gangwar well before they released the sketch.This theory has gained significant traction online, with social media users noting that the uncanny similarities between the sketch and Gangwar’s photo raise serious questions about the methods used to go ahead with probe in the case that has shaken Bareilly for over a year now.Many on social media asked whether the right man has been caught for the chilling murders.Arya contested the claim. “There is a clear-cut media policy of the UP Police issued in the form of SOPs in Oct 2023 that the accused’s face must not be revealed in front of the media before the completion of the identification process or even after the arrest. And this is why we could not have released the real pictures of the suspects.”The arrest has been contested by Kuldeep’s brother, Raj Kumar, who has staunchly defended his sibling. “He’s a simple soul, incapable of such heinous crimes. His mental faculties aren’t sound,” Raj said. “Yes, he would occasionally wander off into the fields, but committing murders? Impossible. We demand an impartial inquiry. An innocent man must not be wrongfully accused.”Meanwhile, in Kuldeep’s village, Bakarganj, residents have dismissed the police’s claims. “There has never been a single incident of violence or harassment by him in or around the village. We’ve known him for years. He was a man of unsound mind and often roamed around aimlessly, not returning home for months at a time. But the police know better what evidence they have found against Kuldeep,” former village head Mohd Rashid said.Villagers have also countered police claims that he was a drug addict. Lochan Singh, another villager, said, “He would readily accept a beedi from locals, but drinking or addiction is out of the question as he never had any money. He used to roam about and people would feed him out of compassion.""","Bareilly SSP Anurag Arya says sketches of three suspects were shown to hundreds of villagers, and most of them pointed to a man called Kuldeep.

MUMBAI: A sessions court acquitted a couple who had spent seven years in jail on charges of murdering the woman’s husband in 2017. The court pointed out that the probe was flawed and marked by negligence on the part of the investigating officer, which ultimately led to the couple being given the benefit of the doubt and acquitted.The body of Sachin Chari was found on their building terrace in 2017.It was alleged that accused Chetan Waghela and Sonali Chari killed him as he was a hurdle to his wife’s freedom. But the judge said prosecution had not produced evidence to show they were romantically involved. CDR of the two were not collected to show their connection.The couple’s then 12-year-old child’s allegations about her mother’s affair proved insufficient as evidence.The court noted it wasn’t established if the child knew Waghela. The child in her statement, had taken names of other men, one of them whose photo was the display picture of her mother’s phone and another who she claimed she was going to marry. The judge questioned why none of these men were investigated.“The IO has not collected CDR of mobile phones of accused 1 (Sonali) and 2 (Waghela) to show their interconnection. Thereby, there is no evidence to prove criminal conspiracy allegedly hatched between accused and the motive to commit the offence,” additional sessions judge Aditee Uday Kadam said.While a witness had claimed that the accused had confessed to him about the murder on a call when he was on the run, neither his cell nor the memory card on which it was recorded were seized by cops. The judge said that the IO hadn’t taken pains in probing the case by following due procedure of law.“He failed to collect relevant evidence available in the form of CDR and mobile or electronic evidence. He failed to follow procedure to collect electronic evidence or memory card.

Efforts by some to infuse a narrative that what happened in our neighbourhood is bound to happen in our Bharat, is deeply concerning. How can a citizen of this country having been a Member of Parliament, and the other who has seen enough of Foreign Service takes no time in saying that what happened in the neighbourhood will happen in India!,"" the VP said on X.Speaking at the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Rajasthan High Court in Jodhpur, Dhankhar also lambasted those who are exploiting India's constitutional institutions to hide or legitimize their actions.He accused these forces of using these platforms to set afloat narratives intended to derail the nation and its democracy.On August 6, Congress leader Salman Khurshid had said that though ""everything may look normal on the surface"", what is happening in Bangladesh could happen in India.Dhankhar also lauded the judiciary's steadfast commitment to the rule of law, while also reflecting on the Emergency period imposed in June 1975 by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.While describing the era of Emergency as ""the draconian darkest period"" since Independence, Dhankhar expressed concern that during this time, even the highest levels of the judiciary, typically a ""formidable citadel of basic rights,"" yielded to the ""brazen dictatorial regime"".""The highest court ruled that no one could move any court for enforcement of rights as long as the emergency lasted,"" the Vice President remarked, pointing out the severe implications of this ruling on the liberties of countless citizens.""Liberty was held to ransom by an individual, and thousands across the country were arrested without any fault except that they believed in Bharat Maa and nationalism at heart,"" he added.Jagdeep Dhankhar praised the courage of nine High Courts during this dark chapter, particularly the High Court of Rajasthan.","Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar takes a swipe at the Congress.

TV Somanathan to replace Rajiv Gauba as cabinet secretary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tv-somanathan-to-replace-rajiv-gauba-as-cabinet-secretary/articleshow/112433401.cms,"NEW DELHI: Finance secretary TV Somanathan was on Saturday named the new cabinet secretary , replacing Rajiv Gauba , whose term as the longest-serving top civil servant will end on Aug 30.A chartered accountant, cost accountant and company secretary, with a doctoral thesis on derivatives, Somanathan is known to speak his mind before political bosses and encourages other colleagues to present their views candidly.The 1987 batch IAS officer is a key person behind ushering in transparency in the Union Budget , under finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s watch, and an active supporter of reforms, including those related to capital gains tax and other areas.Having taken over as expenditure secretary just before Covid-19 struck the nation, Somanathan used the higher spending during the pandemic to also bring “below the line items” on to the Centre’s books — and has stuck to the principle.He also brought the issue of “off-budget borrowings” in states such as Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to the fore during the annual meeting of state chief secretaries and ensured that fund raising by mortgaging govt property and pledging future earnings was minimised.Although Somanathan ended up earning the displeasure of several colleagues, his push for ‘just in time’ release of funds has helped reducing govt money lying idle in bank accounts. It was also during his term in North Block that the Centre cleaned up the centrally-sponsored schemes, with the finance secretary advising states to ensure periodic reviews. One of his unfinished tasks will be the review of the new pension scheme, where consultations have been completed and some sort of a guarantee is likely. But that’s a task that he can complete as cabinet secretary. He is known to share a good personal rapport with PM Narendra Modi.In 1996, he joined the World Bank through the Young Professionals Program, as financial economist and went to become one of the youngest sector managers in the Budget Policy Group. He was part of M Karunanidhi’s CMO before moving to the World Bank for a second stint and then to Modi’s PMO in 2015.Somanathan’s appointment also signals govt’s intent to move ahead with changes after opting for “continuity” since June, when it returned to office for a third consecutive term and is expected to result in a top deck reshuffle.Next up, govt will decide if it intends to extend home secretary Ajay Bhalla’s term as home secretary one more time, especially when he will now be junior to Somanathan.In any case, the appointment initially as officer on special duty in the cabinet secretariat till he takes over on Aug 30, initially for two years. Civil servants are also watching how govt intends to use the services of Gauba, a trusted officer of the current dispensation.Somanthan’s elevation will force the govt to appoint a new expenditure secretary with Arvind Srivastava, additional secretary in the PMO seen as the top contender given his familiarity with the finance ministry, having headed the budget division.Besides, he is the point person on the PMO for several decisions related to the finance ministry, including the Budget.","Finance secretary TV Somanathan was on Saturday named the new cabinet secretary.

’ dreams aren’t crushed

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday visited landslide-ravaged Wayanad district in Kerala, and pledged Centre’s full support for relief, rehabilitation and rebuilding efforts. Nature had displayed its “furious form”, he said, assuring the victims that Union govt stood with Kerala and with them.CM Pinarayi Vijayan (along with governor Arif Mohd Khan in pic) thanked Modi for visiting and urged him to declare the July 30 landslide a national calamity .PM Narendra Modi on Saturday visited landslides-hit Wayanad district and assured that the central govt would “spare no effort” in helping Kerala in relief and rehabilitation, while describing the tragedy as “nature displaying its furious form”.Modi, who arrived in the hill district by helicopter from Kannur airport, conducted an aerial survey, walked through disaster-stricken Chooralmala to get a firsthand view of the destruction caused by the July 30 landslides, walked on the 190-foot-long Bailey bridge constructed by the Army after the disaster, visited a relief camp, and interacted with the survivors.The tragedy killed 229 people, and over 130 are missing.The PM was accompanied by Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and CM Pinarayi Vijayan during his visit. “I would like to assure survivors and victims that they are not alone in this time of distress. The nation, Centre, state, everyone, is with them. While we cannot replace the lives that have been lost, we should all try to ensure the future and dreams of those who survived are not shattered.In a meeting at the district collectorate here to review the situation and work out a plan for the rehabilitation of victims, Modi asserted that Centre would spare no effort in assisting with relief and rehabilitation activities. As soon as the state govt submits details about the building of houses, schools, roads, infrastructure and securing the future of survivors, especially children who lost their parents, “there will be full cooperation from our end,” he said. “Centre will stand with Kerala govt. I do not believe any work will be stopped due to lack of funds,” the PM added.Modi said even though his “heart was heavy” on hearing about the disaster, he came to Wayanad now as he did not want to hinder the rescue and relief activities earlier. He said he saw everything in detail and that it was easier to make decisions “when you have first-hand information”.Modi said he could understand the condition of the survivors here as he had seen a similar disaster in 1979 in Gujarat’s Morbi, when an earthen dam was destroyed in rains, flooding the city with 10-12 feet of water. Over 2,500 people had lost their lives.After the meeting, CMO issued a statement saying Vijayan asked the PM for financial support for rehabilitation and help to combat climate change. The CM also handed over a note of the extent of the damage to Modi, and pointed out that according to the preliminary assessment, the damage was to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees. He requested the landslides be declared a severe disaster and a “national calamity”.","PM Narendra Modi on Saturday visited landslide-ravaged Wayanad district in Kerala.

"No justice & roads no safer, says Mihika, who campaigned against underage driving after husband's death 4 years ago",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justice-roads-no-safer-says-mihika-who-campaigned-against-underage-driving-after-husbands-death-4-years-ago/articleshow/112432092.cms,"Waiting for closure

Justice delayed, justice denied

It's almost four years to the day that Mihika Gupta lost her husband, Alok, and her two sons a father. Out for a drive on a Sunday morning, Alok's Harley Davidson bore the full brunt of a collision by an EcoSport, driven by a minor, near Cyber City on Golf Course Road. Mihika and Alok's friends had, after that, started a campaign against underage driving but the sight of teenagers sitting at the wheel, speeding and doing stunts, isn't just a common sight, the menace has claimed more lives, like in Pune this May when a realtor's minor son ran a Porsche over a couple.Alok (49) was on his way to Greater Noida when the accident took place. Two allegedly drunk teens, aged 16 and 17, were in the Ecosport. The minor who was driving the car now studies abroad, as does the other minor who was with him in the vehicle.""On Aug 23, it will be four years of fighting the case, fighting for justice. But nothing has happened, nothing has moved at all. There has been no justice in any way,"" she told TOI. ""Those people are living their own lives. In fact, the children who were in the EcoSport and killed my husband, are now pursuing higher studies abroad. And here my kids and I are, going through emotional, mental and financial crises.""According to a high court ruling in June 2015, if anyone under the age of 18 is found riding a two- or four-wheeler, an FIR is to be registered against the parents or guardians of the minor under Section 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act, followed by a fine or jail term up to six months.The juveniles are now 21 and 17. ""Who's gone is gone. It's the people who are left behind who suffer. It's the families, the parents seeing their young child go so early, and it's the children, the wife,"" laments Mihika.""Every day is a struggle. We've not had a holiday in the last four years, the way we used to.""It was, she reminds, an open-and-shut case. ""There are witnesses to the case, the car number is known, the owner of the car is known - there is no flaw. My husband was wearing a helmet, he was in his riding gear, he had a valid driver's licence, he was driving on the right side and was not speeding,"" she said, relating the details of that harrowing day. ""Everything is clear but still there is no justice - what else is the court asking and looking for? What needs to be proved? I just don't understand. In these four years, not even once have the witnesses received any summons. There is no progress in the case - the date comes, there's a five-minute hearing, they don't turn up, then the next date of hearing is announced.""And too few people in authority are bothered about clamping down on the menace that is under-age driving. ""Nobody is even thinking about it, forget about being alert to it,"" argues Mihika. As far as she is concerned, the penalty must be according to the gravity of the crime, and it should be borne wholly by the minor. ""There should be zero challans, only punishment for minors driving on the road - whether it is driving while drunk, whether it is jumping red lights, or whether it's failing to wear a seatbelt.""Till the time they are not put behind bars, neither will the parents fall in line, nor will the children become aware. Heavy challans will not make any difference, punishment will,"" she stresses.""These incidents are happening because there is no punishment that is immediate and severe. Everyone thinks they can get away with it.""Ultimately, parents must take the blame, Mihika insists. ""If they are under 18, they are children, and till the time they are not adults, you are their guardians,"" she maintains. ""If the children are in your house, it is your responsibility to ensure that nothing goes wrong. If children can behave like this, then what values have their parents given them?""A week after Alok's death, his relatives held a series of protests and rallies urging strict measures against juvenile drivers and their parents, and in February 2021, Mihika began a 10km, 10-day campaign to grow awareness around underage driving and also to demand tough action against parents for allowing their children to get behind the wheel. This was at a time when Covid-19 continued to restrict the routines of daily life, but the pandemic did little to sidetrack Mihika from seeking justice for her husband.But even campaigning long and hard for justice in the months following the tragedy, proved an exercise in futility. Now, Mihika wants govt to intervene, to close as many such cases that are pending, as possible. ""Those campaigns just helped me file the case, because we weren't even able to file a challan,"" she recalls. ""The right sections were not being applied. That's how these protests helped me.""And she still hasn't received a single rupee in compensation. But she will not give up. ""I'm still fighting, and I will keep fighting.""It's no longer difficult. I've become so thick-skinned. I'm just waiting for justice, for my children and I,"" she adds. ""And it has to change the way people think. So, it all starts from home.""","Mihika Gupta lost her husband, Alok, and her two sons a father four years ago.

Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw in New Delhi on Saturday said there is a plan to provide more railway projects worth Rs 30,000 crore in the coming years.While three railway projects will connect south Odisha with western Odisha , the other three will connect the north and north-eastern part of the state with neighbouring Jharkhand and West Bengal.The tentative deadline for these projects is 2030. It may change keeping the external factors in mind, said official sources.The railway minister said the approval of the Junagarh-Nabarangpur new line and Malkangiri-Pandurangapuram via Bhadrachalam new line has created a straight corridor connecting western Odisha with south Odisha districts. Previously, Jeypore-Malkangiri new line and Jeypore-Nabarangpur new line projects have been sanctioned, he added.“Now Junagarh to Pandurangapuram line has been completely sanctioned.
