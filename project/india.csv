India set to renew engagement with Taliban in Moscow Format talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-set-to-renew-engagement-with-taliban-in-moscow-format-talks/articleshow/113922386.cms,"India will participate in the 6th round of Moscow Format talks on Afghanistan on Friday, looking to renew its engagement with the Taliban whose acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will also attend the meeting. While the world’s attention has been focused on the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts, India’s own regional security priority remains the need to ensure that Afghanistan doesn’t again turn into a haven for terrorists, especially those working for UN proscribed groups like JeM and LeT.Apart from special envoys of all Central Asian countries, representatives of Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and India are expected to participate in the Moscow Format dialogue, which was launched in 2017 to address issues related to Afghanistan.Addressing the humanitarian situation, formation of an inclusive and representative government, concerted efforts to counter terrorism and regional security remain high on India’s agenda for Afghanistan.Ahead of the talks on Friday, the head of the political office of the ‘Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’, Suhail Shaheen, told TOI that the Format should not be an instrument of pressure but a vehicle leading to positive communication and engagement between Afghanistan and the world. Under pressure to restore women rights and ensure inclusive government, the Taliban have maintained that they don’t want others to impose on them ``external models of governance’’.``Moscow Format has made efforts to resolve Afghan issues in the past and it can play an important role in solving the current issues facing Afghanistan like removal of sanctions, reduction in poverty, creation of job opportunities, paving the way for engagement between Afghanistan and the international community in various areas,’’ said Shaheen.Indian representative, MEA joint secretary JP Singh, is also expected to have a bilateral meeting with Muttaqi and other Taliban officials on the sidelines of the meeting. While India has not officially recognised the Taliban, it has surprised many by establishing a working relationship with the regime in Kabul, owing mainly to its humanitarian support to the people of Afghanistan. An Indian “technical team’’ has kept the embassy in Kabul running to oversee distribution of Indian aid, overriding the initial fear and trepidation at the return of the Taliban.Interestingly, while a UN report recently warned of serious threat from terrorist groups active in Afghanistan, the Taliban have blamed Pakistan for shielding key members of the Islamic State-Khorasan group. A Taliban spokesperson said earlier this week that from bases in Pakistan, the group was orchestrating attacks, both within Afghanistan and in other countries. India sees the remarks as a vindication of its position on Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism.","India will participate in the 6th round of Moscow Format talks on Afghanistan on Friday.

A mob took away around 21 firearms and 900 rounds of assorted ammunition from the armoury of Ukhrul police station in Manipur in a raid coinciding with Wednesday's gunfight 3km away involving two Naga villages, officials revealed Thursday as the death toll in the violence rose to four.While cops are still to report the number of weapons the mob snatched, sources said the loot included six INSAS rifles, three AK-47s, eight 9mm pistols, two 9mm carbines, an SLR and a Sten gun.The looting frenzy harked back to the peak of the ethnic conflict in the state last year, when mobs barged into several state armouries and took away hundreds of firearms.Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi said in New Delhi earlier this week that those episodes contributed to Manipur's society getting ""weaponised"" and feeding the flames of the conflict. Around 25% of the 4,000-odd weapons lost to looters have since been recovered, he said.The gunfight around which the latest instance of looting occurred was apparently over the choice of a disputed site for a Swachh Bharat Mission-linked programme.

The inquiry report must be submitted by November 18

MUMBAI: Bombay High Court on Thursday directed that the report of the magistrate’s inquiry into the death of the accused in the Badlapur school sexual assault case shall be placed before it on Nov 18.Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Prithviraj Chavan passed the direction while hearing a petition by the father of the accused, seeking a probe by a special investigation team into the “murder” of his son, registration of an FIR against erring officers, preservation of CCTV footage, and compensation.The incident took place on the Mumbra bypass after 6 pm on Sept 23 during a scuffle the accused had with the police. The accused was declared dead at 7.52 pm at Chhatrapati Shivaji Hospital, Kalwa.Advocate General Birendra Saraf, with Public Prosecutor Hiten Venegavkar, informed that the post-mortem report and inquest panchnama have been forwarded to the chief judicial magistrate. Saraf said other documents will also be forwarded.The judges directed that all necessary documents required for the inquiry shall be forwarded to the magistrate. “Needless to say, the learned magistrate will commence the inquiry no sooner on receiving the documents,” they added. The judges also directed that the father and all concerned persons will be heard in the inquiry. On Nov 18, the judges may consider granting the magistrate an extension of time if required.Saraf said that pursuant to the Sept 25 order, all directions have been complied with. He said the State CID has collected evidence. The judges had further questions regarding the collection of evidence. They asked whether fingerprints of the accused were taken from the bottle from which he drank water when one handcuff was unlocked, whether gunshot residue was picked and preserved, and whether empty shells were found from pistols fired by the accused and a police officer.They also asked whether police officer Nilesh More was injured by bullets fired by the deceased or by a different gun.The father’s advocate said from the FIR there is sufficient reason to believe that it was a fake encounter. “An FIR is not an encyclopaedia. It puts the criminal law into motion,” said Justice Chavan. The judges said therefore it is necessary to wait for the magistrate’s report into the inquiry into the custodial death . The judges again admonished the advocate for his statements to the media, saying, “You will be doing a disservice to your client by doing all this.”They disposed of the father’s interim application seeking land for the burial of his son. The accused was buried at Ulhasnagar crematorium on Sept 29. While Saraf said police in uniform have been deputed in the vicinity of their residence, the judges directed the police to consider the father’s application for police protection.","Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Prithviraj Chavan passed the direction while hearing a petition by the father of the accused.

Zakir Naik Welcomed in Pakistan: Is Islamabad Risking Conflict with India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-rolls-out-red-carpet-for-zakir-naik-is-islamabad-igniting-new-conflict-with-india/articleshow/113903850.cms,"Zakir Naik (right) with Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif

Naik's Pakistan visit to fuel tension?

Why NIA and ED are after him

NEW DELHI: Zakir Naik , a controversial Islamic evangelist who is wanted in India on terror-linked charges , landed in Islamabad on October 1 with Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcoming the fugitive with wide arms and cosy hugs.Pakistan's move to roll out the red carpet for Naik, who is there for a month-long visit, reek of mischief by the Sharif dispensation with the objective of opening up a new front of confrontation with India, which has virtually suspended its bilateral relations with Islamabad since the 2017 Uri and 2019 Pulwama terror attacks.India had carried out surgical strikes and Balakot air strikes in response to these terror attacks.The tension between India and Pakistan was palpable at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting last week, when external affairs minister S Jaishankar tore into Islamabad and warned that its ""cross-border terrorism policy can and will never succeed"".In a strong-worded reply to Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif 's UNGA speech where he accused New Delhi of ""escalating tensions"" in Kashmir, Jaishankar warned that Islamabad's ""actions will most certainly have consequences"".In the backdrop of such strained relations, Pakistan's invitation to Zakir Naik has raised eyebrows, with some experts of the view that the fugitive's visit is likely planned to fuel tension between the two nations.""As a purveyor of hate speech, Zakir Naik has been banned from several countries including India. In giving him a royal reception, Pakistan is announcing that it is committed to embracing fundamentalism and is willing to set aside global opinion,"" social activist Pervez Hoodbhoy told Deutsche Welle.Amit Ranjan, a research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore, said: ""As Pakistan is already facing violence related to social and political problems, giving space to Naik is nothing but an addition to the existing tensions.""In Naik's Pakistan visit, the only silver lining perhaps is that it provides New Delhi with a fresh opportunity to justify its claims that the neighbouring country continues to welcome and facilitate ""anti-India"" elements.""There is a lesson in this invitation to Zakir Naik for those who advocate some diplomatic opening towards Pakistan, be it in sports, trade etc. Even reviving SAARC. The NC and PDP in Kashmir want India to talk to Pakistan. Shehbaz Sharif’s speech at the UN was intemperate. Linked Kashmir to Palestine, talked of India’s colonial settlement project in Kashmir and the Islamophobic Hindu supremacist agenda in India. Not a discourse intended to lower tensions with India. Shehbaz may get “shabash” domestically but won’t improve Pakistan's condition. Jaishankar gave a befitting reply in the UNGA to Sharif,"" Kanwal Sibal, former Indian foreign secretary, wrote on X.The controversial ""televangelist"" has been living in Malaysia since India's anti-terror agency launched an investigation against him in 2016.Naik has been accused of promoting radical views similar to those of groups like the Islamic State and the Taliban, leading to bans on his speeches in India, Bangladesh, Canada and the United Kingdom.Naik has delivered over 1,500 public lectures since 1994, often asserting that Islam is the only true religion and criticising other faiths, as well as non-Wahhabi Islamic sects such as Shias, Sufis, and Barelvis.Naik is the founder of Peace TV , a channel on comparative religion with a reported audience of over 100 million. It faces a ban in India in connection with alleged money laundering and hate speeches.India also banned IRF in 2016, accusing it of encouraging followers to promote enmity and hatred. He fled India in July 2016 after Bangladeshi authorities claimed that one of the attackers on a cafe in Dhaka was inspired by Zakir Naik. The incident had left 22 people dead.The NIA filed a charge sheet under Section 10 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code, which has been replaced by Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. The investigation revealed that Naik is the founding trustee and a member of an ""unlawful association"" – IRF.",Zakir Naik is a controversial Islamic evangelist who is wanted in India on terror-linked charges.

NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday opposed the criminalisation of marital rape in the Supreme Court , stating that matter relating to marital rape needs ""a comprehensive approach"" rather than a ""strict legal approach"" as it can have very far-reaching socio-legal implications in the country.If sexual acts by a man with his own wife is made punishable as ""rape"", it may severely impact the conjugal relationship and lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage, the Centre told the Supreme Court, according to news agency PTI.In its preliminary counter affidavit in the top court on the martial rape issue, the Centre further said that ""while exercising such judicial review on such subjects (marital rape), it is to be appreciated that the present question is not only a constitutional question, but essentially a social question on which Parliament , after being apprised and being aware of all sides of the opinion on the present issue, has taken a position.""Centre informed the court that Parliament has decided to retain Exception 2 to Section 375 of IPC in 2013 while amending the said section in the year 2013.""Furthermore, it is submitted that striking down Exception 2 of Section 375 of IPC on the ground of its constitutional validity will have a far-reaching effect on the institution of marriage if sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife is made punishable as 'rape',"" the Centre said in its affidavit, according to news agency PTI.""It is submitted that the act colloquially referred to as 'marital rape' ought to be illegal and criminalised. The central government asserts that a woman's consent is not obliterated by marriage and its violation should result in penal consequences. However, the consequences of such violations within marriage differ from those outside it,"" the affidavit said.It said Parliament has provided different remedies, including criminal law provisions, to protect consent within marriage.""Given the nature of the marital institution in our socio-legal milieu, if the legislature is of the view that, for preservation of the marital institution, the impugned exception should be retained, it is submitted that it would not be appropriate for this court to strike down the exception,"" the central government told the Supreme Court.""It may severely impact the conjugal relationship and may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage,"" the government said.""This is more so since the issues involved have a direct bearing on the society in general and is a part of Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India,"" the Centre said.The affidavit said a husband certainly does not have any fundamental right to violate the consent of the wife, however, attracting the crime in the nature of ""rape"" as recognised in India to the institution of marriage can be arguably considered to be excessively harsh and therefore, disproportionate.""Therefore, it is respectfully submitted that if the legislature decides to exempt, from the rigour of such a charge, and such a label, husbands, vis-a-vis their wives, given the intelligible differentia that exists in a marital relationship vis-a-vis other relationships, the said decision and discretion should be respected and not interfered with especially when a separate suitably tailored penal remedy is provided by the Legislature,"" it said.In 2022, in an important verdict reinforcing bodily and decisional autonomy of the pregnant woman, the Supreme Court for the first time recognised marital rape for the purpose of unwanted pregnancy for abortion and held that rape under Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act includes a husband's act of sexual assault or rape committed on his wife.","The central government on Thursday opposed the criminalisation of marital rape in the Supreme Court. It said matter relating to marital rape needs ""a comprehensive approach"" rather than a ""strict legal approach"" If sexual acts by a man with his own wife is made punishable as ""rape"", it may severely impact the conjugal relationship, the Centre said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113914874,imgsize-904715,width-400,resizemode-4/113914874.jpg"
"Union Cabinet grants 'classical language' status to five more languages including Marathi, Bengali, Assamese",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/union-cabinet-grants-classical-language-status-to-five-more-languages-including-marathi-bengali-assamese/articleshow/113914557.cms,"Ashwini Vaishnaw (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet gave its approval to grant classical language status to five Indian languages: Marathi , Pali , Prakrit , Assamese , and Bengali , announced union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Thursday.""PM Modi has always focused on Indian languages... Today, 5 languages Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese and Bengali have been approved as classical languages,"" said Vaishnaw.He then added, ""By now, we had Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia were the notified classical languages... The government is taking many steps to conserve and promote the classical languages and to preserve the rich heritage of these languages..""""The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved to confer the status of Classical Language to Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese and Bengali languages. The Classical Languages serve as a custodian of Bharat’s profound and ancient cultural heritage, embodying the essence of each community’s historical and cultural milestone,"" said the government in a press release.""The primary states involved are Maharashtra (Marathi), Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh (Pali and Prakrit), West Bengal (Bengali), and Assam (Assamese). The broader cultural and academic impact will extend nationally and internationally,"" it added to its statement.With this, the number of classical languages will nearly double from 6 to 11. The government first introduced the ""Classical Languages"" category on October 12, 2004, when Tamil was declared the first Classical Language, followed by Sanskrit in 2005.Other languages included Kannada and Telugu declared in 2008, Malayalam declared in 2013 while Odia given the tag in 2014.The criteria for a classical language include an ancient history and literary tradition spanning 1500-2000 years, with a significant body of ancient texts that are still valued today. The language must have an independent and distinguished literary heritage, not derived from another language. Additionally, there may be a discontinuity between the classical language and its modern forms or offshoots, as the classical language and literature remain distinct from their later evolutions.""The inclusion of languages as Classical Language will create significant employment opportunities, particularly in academic and research fields. Additionally, the preservation, documentation, and digitization of ancient texts of these languages will generate jobs in archiving, translation, publishing, and digital media,"" said the cabinet in a statement.Soon after the announcement, PM Modi said, "" Our Government cherishes and celebrates India's rich history and culture. We have also been unwavering in our commitment to popularising regional languages. I am extremely glad the Cabinet has decided that Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, Pali and Prakrit will be conferred the status of Classical Languages! Each of them are beautiful languages, highlighting our vibrant diversity. Congratulations to everyone.""Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma thanked PM Modi for the decision and said, ""Thank you Hon’ble Prime Minister for this decision. Your love and affection for the Assamese language and culture is unparalleled and the people of Assam will be forever indebted to you for recognising our beautiful mother tongue as a Classical language.""Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis reacted to inclusion of Marathi and said, ""I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the entire Union Cabinet that they accepted our longstanding demand that Marathi language should be given the status of a classical language. From today, our Marathi language will be known as an elite language. This is a day to be written in golden letters. Prime Minister Modi Ji, thank you very much. Even when I was the Chief Minister and even now, the Maharashtra Government, under the leadership of Chief Minister Shinde Ji, continuously followed up on this issue and made efforts and also gave a lot of evidence in this regard and today all those evidence has been accepted and the Marathi language has now become a classical language. On behalf of the 12 crore people of Maharashtra and Marathi people living across the world, I express my whole-hearted gratitude to Prime Minister Modi.""Once a language is designated as a Classical language, the government offers several benefits to promote its study. These include two annual international awards for scholars excelling in classical Indian languages. Additionally, a Centre of Excellence is established for studies in the Classical Language, and the University Grants Commission is encouraged to create Professional Chairs in Central Universities to support and advance research and education in these languages.","The Union Cabinet gave its approval to grant classical language status to five Indian languages: Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese and Bengali.

"Haryana assembly elections 2024: Campaign ends, all set for BJP vs Congress contest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/haryana-assembly-elections-haryana-elections-bhupinder-singh-hooda-nayab-singh-saini-rahul-gandhi-pm-modi-haryana-polls/articleshow/113912319.cms,"NEW DELHI: Will people of Haryana give ruling BJP consecutive third term in office or will the Congress snatch power from the saffron party after staying in opposition for 10 years? With campaign for the October 5 assembly elections for the 90-member assembly drawing to a close, the stage is set for an interesting contest that will decide the fate of the two contenders.Both the BJP and the Congress went all out with a very aggressive campaign to woo the people of Haryana. While the BJP is banking on its development report card of 10 years, the Congress is trying to capitalise on anti-incumbency and on issues like the farmers protest and the Agnipath Scheme - which provides short-term recruitment in armed forces.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who led the BJP campaign, is confident that the Congress will fall flat on October 8 when the votes are counted. In a post on X, PM Modi said that he has observed the enthusiasm and support for the BJP after travelling all over the state.""The campaign for the Haryana assembly elections will end shortly. I have travelled all over the state in the last few days. The enthusiasm I have seen among the people gives me full confidence that the people of Haryana will once again give their blessings to the BJP. The patriotic people of Haryana will never accept the divisive and negative politics of the Congress,"" the Prime Minister said.PM Modi also blasted the Congress for its alleged divisive and negative politics and said the patriotic people of the state will never accept it. ""The Congress means a syndicate of fixers and son-in-law,"" he said in an apparent reference to controversial land deals involving Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra when the party was in power during 2004-14. He also targeted Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his MP son Deepender Singh Hooda and alleged that the main goal of father-son politics is only self-interest. Modi called the Congress a ""party of 'dalalon' (middlemen) and 'damadon'"".The Prime Minister held 4 rallies in the state and targeted Congress on issues like corruption in land deals, urban-Naxal agenda, reservations, appeasement, dynsaty politics and Article 370.The Congress campaign on the other hand focussed on issues of alleged misgovernance by former chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who led the BJP government in the state for almost 9 and a half years. BJP removed Khattar ahead of Lok Sabha elections and made Nayab Singh Saini the chief minister. Rahul Gandhi , Mallikarjun Kharge and Priyanka Gandhi addressed several rallies in the state but at the centre of Congress's campaign was senior leader and former state chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on which the party has placed all its bets. The move led to discontent within the party ranks with senior leader and prominent dalit face Kumari Selja staying away from most part of the campaign. Selja was reportedy unhappy with Hooda having complete say in party affairs, including ticket distribution.Selja has been open about her cold relations with Hooda but has vowed her commitment and loyalty to the party. In an interview with the Lallantop, Selja admitted that after leaving the party presidency, her communication with Hooda had almost stopped.""It's been a long time since I've talked to Bhupinder Singh Hooda. It's not about the bad political relationship, it's like I was in Delhi and he was in Haryana. After that, I was the PCC president, and he was the CLP leader. At that time we used to talk. Before that, from 2014 to 2019, we also used to talk. After quitting the party presidency, we almost stopped talking,"" she said.The grand old party would be wary of one of the predictions made by PM Modi during his campaign when he reminded the Congress about its electoral loss in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where the campaign was heavily centred around the state heavyweights - Kamal Nath and Ashok Gehlot. Both these leaders had a huge say in taking decisions during the assembly elections in their states. The Congress was routed in Madhya Pradesh and also lost Rajasthan to the BJP.The Congress campaign in Haryana gained strength when wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia decided to join party ranks. Besides, several leaders from other parties also made a beeline to join the grand old party ahead of the elections. Interestingly, hours before the campaigning ended, senior BJP leader and former MP Ashok Tanwar joined the Congress at Rahul Gandhi's rally. Ironically, two hours before jumping the ship, Tanwar was campaigning for the BJP candidate in Safidon assembly constituency and exhorting voters to bring it back to power for a third time. Tanwar, a Dalit leader who was considered close to Gandhis had left the Congress in 2019 following differences with Bhupinder Singh Hooda.Riding high on its success in Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, when Congress wrested 5 seats from the BJP to settle for a 5-5 scoreline, the grand old party would hope to form its government in the state after a gap of 10 years.","Campaign for the October 5 assembly elections for the 90-member assembly drawing to a close.

Tollywood's all-out against the minister's remark



KTR and Nagarjuna send legal notice to minister

NEW DELHI: Under fire from the Tollywood fraternity and slapped with multiple legal notices, Congress minister Konda Surekha on Thursday had to retract her controversial remarks over BRS leader KT Rama Rao 's involvement in actors Samantha and Naga Chaitanya 's divorce.""My comments are meant to question a leader's belittling of women and not to hurt your sentiments. The way you (Samantha) have grown up with self-power is not only an admiration for me, but also an ideal,"" the minister tweeted addressing the actor after a massive outrage.A host of stars such as Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, junior NTR, Venkatesh, Prakash Raj and Khushbu took strong exception to her remarks.Actress Samantha also took to social media and lashed out against the ""baseless"" allegations made by Konda Surekha. Meanwhile, veteran actor Nagarjuna and KT Rama Rao took the legal route and slapped the minister with legal notices on the remark they regard as ""baseless"".The controversy broke out after Telangana forest and environment minister Konda Surekha alleged BRS leader KTR's involvement in drug-related parties and claimed that he was responsible for Naga Chaitanya and Samantha Ruth Prabhu's divorce.In a public press meet, Konda Surekha insinuated that politician KT Rama Rao (KTR) made a deal with actor Nagarjuna, involving Samantha Ruth Prabhu, to prevent the demolition of the N-Convention Centre. She claimed that when Samantha refused to comply, it led to her separation from Naga Chaitanya. Surekha also alleged that Nagarjuna pressured Samantha, but she declined.“KTR is the reason why Naga Chaitanya and Samantha broke up in the first place. He has the habit of exploiting women and even heroines. He has gotten several heroines addicted to drugs. He even tapped their phones to get personal information. Doesn’t he have a mother, sister, and wife at home? Why doesn’t he respect and value women,” Konda Surekha said in the video that went viral on social media.Veteran actor Nagarjuna, who is also the father of Naga Chaitanya condemned Konda Surekha's remarks, labeling the accusations as false. He urged her to respect the privacy of individuals and avoid making baseless claims.""I strongly condemn the comments of Honourable Minister Mrs Konda Surekha. Don't use the lives of movie stars who stay away from politics to criticise your opponents. Please respect other people's privacy. As a woman in a responsible position, your comments and accusations against our family are completely irrelevant and false. I request you to withdraw your comments immediately,"" he wrote on X.Amala Akkineni expressed her displeasure over Konda Surekha's comments, calling the minister a ""demon"" and accusing her of ""preying on decent citizens as fuel for a political war."" She also appealed to Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition to prevent their ministers from making such ""venomous statements."" Amala also tagged Priyanka Gandhi in her post, demanding an apology to her family.“Konda Surekha garu, dragging personal lives into politics is a new low. Public figures, especially those in responsible positions like you, must maintain dignity and respect for privacy. It’s disheartening to see baseless statements thrown around carelessly, especially about the film industry,” actor Jr NTR said.Meanwhile, Naga Chaitanya addressed the situation, stating that the decision to divorce his former partner, Samantha Ruth Prabhu, was a painful one. He dismissed Konda Surekha's allegations as ""false, ridiculous, and unacceptable.""Actor Nani said it was ""disgusting to see politicians thinking that they can get away with talking any kind of nonsense"".Former Union minister and actor Chiranjeevi said he was ""extremely pained to see the disgraceful remarks made by an honourable woman minister"".“It is a shame that celebs and members of the film fraternity become soft targets as they provide instant reach and attention. We, as the film industry, stand united in opposing such vicious verbal assaults on our members,” he said.“We choose our leaders to make society a better place to live in, and not contaminate it by lowering the discourse. Politicians and people in honourable positions should set better examples,” he said.Actress and BJP leader Khushbu Sundar also hit out at the remarks made by minister Konda Surekha. “I thought it was only those who need 2 minutes of fame and indulge in yellow journalism who speak this language. But here, I see an absolute disgrace to womanhood. Konda Surekha garu, I am sure some values were instilled in you. Where have they flown out of the window? A person in a responsible position cannot make such baseless, appalling, and degrading statements about my industry, my place of worship,” she said.Meanwhile, BRS leader KTR and Nagarjuna Akkineni filed complaints against Telangana environment minister Konda Surekha's ""defamatory (and) derogatory"" remarks.In the legal notice, KTR's counsel stated that he had been subjected to ""scandalous attacks"" as a result of Surekha's ""vitriolic campaign,"" with the intent to harm his reputation.","Congress minister Konda Surekha had to retract her controversial remarks over BRS leader KT Rama Rao's involvement in actors Samantha and Naga Chaitanya's divorce.

Mohammad Azharuddin skips ED summons in money laundering case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mohammad-azharuddin-skips-ed-summons-in-money-laundering-case/articleshow/113910818.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricket captain and Congress leader Mohammad Azharuddin skipped summons from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday in connection with a money laundering case related to alleged financial irregularities in the Hyderabad Cricket Association ( HCA ), according to official sources quoted by PTI.The 61-year-old former MP was summoned to record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at the ED office in Hyderabad.However, he requested more time and has been issued a fresh summons for October 8.The investigation pertains to alleged financial irregularities in the HCA. In November last year, the ED conducted searches related to the case, raiding the premises of former HCA office bearers, including ex-vice president and Indian cricketer Shivlal Yadav, Congress MLA and ex-president Gaddam Vinod, former HCA secretary Arshad Ayub, and the office of S S Consultants Pvt. Ltd. and the residence of its MD Satyanarayana.The money laundering case originates from three FIRs and charge sheets filed by the Telangana Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) for alleged criminal misappropriation of HCA funds amounting to Rs 20 crore. One of the FIRs was registered based on a complaint by HCA CEO Suneel Kante Bose after an interim forensic audit report found certain transactions with third-party vendors to be ""not genuine"" and detrimental to the association's interest.The police charge sheets allege serious irregularities in the procurement of DG sets, firefighting systems, and canopies for the Rajiv Gandhi Cricket Stadium in Uppal, Hyderabad. Despite deadlines, several works were delayed, leading to increased costs, budget enhancements, and corresponding losses to the HCA. The office bearers of the HCA, including its then secretary, president, and vice-president, allegedly colluded with private parties to allot tenders and works to preferred vendors at inflated prices without following proper tender processes and even before receiving quotations.The ED's raids last year resulted in the seizure of digital devices, ""incriminating"" documents, and ""unaccounted"" cash of Rs 10.39 lakh. The forensic report noted that ""Mohammad Azharuddin, the then president of the association in the 9th Apex Council meeting held on March 3, 2021 had sought to take up discussions regarding firefighting equipment. However, subsequently, without assigning any reasons, the tender was not allotted to any of the bidders. Thereafter, HCA had floated a second tender for the same work"".Azharuddin, a recipient of the Padma Shri and Arjuna Award, began his political career by winning the Moradabad Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh in 2009. He currently serves as the working president of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC).",Former Indian cricket captain Mohammad Azharuddin skipped summons from the Enforcement Directorate. The 61-year-old former MP was summoned to record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) He requested more time and has been issued a fresh summons for October 8.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113911485,imgsize-441087,width-400,resizemode-4/113911485.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday convicted former MLA and RJD functionary Vijay Kumar Shukla alias Munna Shukla and Mantu Tiwari for the 1998 murder of former Bihar minister Brij Bihari Prasad and awarded them life imprisonment . The court, however, granted benefit of doubt to five other accused including former MP Suraj Bhan Singh, acquitting them of conspiracy charges.The order marked another twist in the sensational case that had rocked Bihar politics in the late 1990s and established the dominance of dreaded gangster Shri Prakash Shukla over the notorious crime syndicates of Bihar and adjoining Uttar Pradesh.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Sanjay Kumar and R Mahadevan passed the order on an appeal filed by CBI and Prasad's wife, former BJP MP Rama Devi, who had challenged Patna HC order acquitting all the accused in the case.""Mantu Tiwari and Vijay Kumar Shukla alias Munna Shukla are directed to surrender within two weeks to the concerned jail authorities/court to serve the remainder of their respective sentences. In case of failure to surrender, authorities shall take appropriate measures to arrest and detain them in accordance with law,"" the bench said.Brij Bihari Prasad, an influential OBC leader whose rise was seen as part of the challenge that Mandal politics posed to upper caste supremacy in Bihar, was killed on June 13, 1998, at Indira Gandhi's Institute of Medical Sciences in Patna where he was undergoing treatment.His upper caste rivals approached Shri Prakash Shukla, a ruthless killer who had already reached the top of the notoriety graph after carrying out a spate of killings and kidnappings in UP, to eliminate Prasad who was guarded by a well-armed police posse round the clock.Shukla, who knew Prasad's rivals, agreed to carry out the job for the sake of his friends and got himself admitted in the same hospital by feigning illness. Soon after, he gunned down Prasad, the audacity of the crime shocking people and multiplying Shukla's fear. The murder forced UP Police to set up a STF to nab him.The court said HC erred in acquitting all the accused on the basis of minor discrepancies in the statement of witnesses. It also noted HC adversely commented on the versions given by witnesses as to who had reached the hospital at an earlier point in time.""Considering the efflux of time of more than 4-6 years between the date of occurrence and recording of court testimony, these issues are at best superficial and peripheral and would not warrant disregarding the prosecution case. The questions posed to the witnesses were more in the nature of a memory test rather than questions posed to test the truthfulness and credibility of their core testimony,"" the bench said, setting aside HC's order.""Regarding the question of conspiracy and evidence against Suraj Bhan Singh, Mukesh Singh, Lallan Singh, Ram Niranjan Chaudhary and Rajan Tiwari, there is no direct ocular evidence implicating them through the testimonies of Paras Nath Chaudhury and Mahanth Ashwani Das.

Keep marital rape out of IPC to protect institution of marriage: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/keep-marital-rape-out-of-ipc-to-protect-institution-of-marriage-government/articleshow/113919622.cms,"Govt: Committed to 'fully' protecting

women dignity

NEW DELHI: Opposing criminalisation of marital rape, the Centre on Thursday told Supreme Court that a husband and wife share a unique multifaceted relationship which is not exclusively centred on sex and stressed if Parliament has thoughtfully carved out an exception for marital rape in the penal provisions (in Sec 375 of IPC), it should not be struck down by the court.Responding to a clutch of PILs seeking criminalisation of marital rape, the Union home ministry in an affidavit said, ""Given the nature of the marital institution in our socio-legal milieu, if the legislature is of the view that, for preservation of the marital institution, the impugned exception should be retained, it is submitted that it would not be appropriate for the SC to strike down the exception.""A husband certainly does not have any fundamental right to violate the consent of the wife, the Centre said, but to equate marital intercourse with rape, would be excessively harsh and disproportionate.The Centre clarified it is committed to ""fully and meaningfully"" protect liberty, dignity and rights of every woman. ""Govt attaches highest importance to ending all kinds of violence and offences causing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional and economic abuse including domestic violence against women The central govt asserts that a woman's consent is not obliterated by marriage, and its violation should result in penal consequences. However, the consequences of such violations within marriage differ from those outside it,"" it said.""Parliament has provided different remedies, including criminal law provisions, to protect consent within marriage. Sections 354, 354A, 354B, 498A IPC, and Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, ensure serious penal consequences for such violations,"" it added.Govt said, ""Consent of the woman is not evaporated rather breach of consent results in different penal consequences. It cannot be a fundamental right under Article 21 that breach of consent in all eventualities would necessarily entail the consequences of Section 375/376 of IPC. If breach of consent results in altered penal consequences thereby creating a sufficient deterrence, the said provision and exception to Section 375 cannot be faulted.""The Centre said marriage is an institution with social aspects and implications. ""Between a husband and wife, who spend their days and nights together, living in a house which, by the dint of their joint effort, they make a home, there exists a bond which defies, and indeed transcends, all known and identifiable parameters. In our country, it is submitted, marital vows are still regarded as inviolable,"" it said.""Considering the social impact involved, the intimate familial relations being the subject matter and ground realities prevailing in different parts of society of this large, populous and diverse country, taking a decision merely based upon the arguments of PIL petitioners, may not serve the ends of justice,"" govt added.It contended that since marriage is an institution which creates reciprocal conjugal rights, it therefore renders it incomparable to the concept of ""consent"" in any other situation outside the marriage. ""Parliament, after appreciating this subtlety and variation in the concept of 'consent' within a marital relationship, has approved the exception while providing for other suitable remedies recognising the constitutional right of the parties to the marriage,"" it said.It said since marital rape issue relates to marriage, which is in the Concurrent list, views of states and UTs were sought. It said of the 19 states and UTs which responded to its query, only Delhi, Karnataka, Tripura were opposed to the exception to marital rape under Section 375 of IPC. Those which supported the exception included UP, MP, Gujarat, Assam, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Goa and Manipur.","The Centre said a husband and wife share a unique multifaceted relationship which is not exclusively centred on sex.

The accused, who was eight years old when his father was crushed to death in a similar manner, grew up hearing stories about the killers, and nursed a deep grudge and an intense desire to avenge the murder On Tuesday afternoon, Nakhat Singh Bhati (50), who was employed as a security guard at a residential colony in Thaltej area of Ahmedabad, was riding his bicycle when he was run over by a pickup truck.It was initially believed to be a fatal accident.

It sported the logo, and cashiers and a manager who looked busy and business-like. Chhapora village felt like it had arrived.The trusting villagers had no way of knowing it was an elaborate fraud. Even the house owner, who gave it on rent to 'SBI' had no clue it was fake.The villagers were, in fact, overjoyed that the bank was recruiting, and the 'shortlisted candidates' from nearby districts readily gave Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh each for the jobs. The fake bank even held training sessions for them. It took around a week for the 'employees' to sense something was wrong - they sat twiddling their thumbs all day. The fraud was exposed in around 10 days but by then, the kingpins of the racket - who called themselves Rekha Sahu, Mandir Das and Pankaj - had vanished. Pankaj had posed as the branch manager. Police in Sakti have registered a case and are looking for the suspects. ""All transactions (for the jobs) were made through UPI. We are tracing them. Their phone numbers are untraceable and the addresses they gave were fake,"" said an officer. The fraudsters seem to have chosen Chhapora because of its remote location, around 250km from Raipur . Six people were 'hired' through walk-in interviews, and told to get more employees. tnnBy then, word had reached the manager of the nearby Dabhra SBI branch about the new 'Chhapora branch'.

He said he had no information of another branch opening in the region and his initial investigation suggests it's fake,"" said Kunwar.A police team immediately went to the 'branch'.

Bajra (pearl millet) and cotton are the main crops here. “Anaj sadh raha hai (Crops are rotting),” says Dharamvir Singh, a retired army man.Villagers partly blame a nearby power plant for the waterlogging mess. However, it is learnt that excessive rains, overflow from a nearby canal, as well as low-lying land, have combined to create a drainage problem. Whatever the reason, Goria is suffering.Ram Kishan says the submerged farmland has spawned a swarm of mosquitoes and bred water-borne diseases. “Villagers have been asking for a hospital for years. Public transport is almost zero. Just one or two buses come in the morning. Those who have private vehicles are okay. But for others, there’s nothing,” he says. It isn’t just the farmland. In the last week of September, the village main road was flooded.Goria comes under the vastly rural Jhajjar assembly seat, reserved for Scheduled Castes. About 19% of voters are SC. Congress ’ Geeta Bhukkal, 56, an advocate and a former education minister, has been winning the seat since 2009. But Bhukkal’s vote share has fallen sharply from a high 60% (2009) to a more modest 42% (2019). Her foremost challengers are BJP’s Kaptan Birdhana, a 54-year-old businessman, Dushyant Chautala-led JJP’s Naseeb Soni and BSP’s Dharambir Singh. BSP is in alliance with Abhay Singh Chautala’s INLD for the Oct 5 polls.Jats are numerically the largest caste in Goria, which has roughly 3,600 voters. Other castes include Brahmins, OBCs and SCs. Most Jats, says Mahinder Singh, chairman, Universal School, will stamp the ballot for Congress. “We will be voting for Congress for Bhupinder Hooda and Deepender Hooda,” says Mahinder. Manvir Singh, a kumhar (potter) by caste, says that most kumhars in the village have been traditionally Congress voters.In the Harijan chaupal, Dalits complain about absence of drainage and poor drinking water facility. “For us the choice is between Congress and BSP. Most are inclined towards Congress,” says Bhoop Singh, a dalit.Manu’s double bronze medal in Paris 2024 brought hordes of local politicians to Goria. Old felicitation posters still adorn the village walls. For all its misfortunes, the village is still exultant at her success. But the shooter isn’t the only successful sportsperson from the village.There’s Haney Goria, who claimed javelin (F37) gold, setting a record in the Asian Para Games in Hangzhou last year. “His unparalleled skill has ushered in boundless joy and pride for India,” PM Narendra Modi had gushed on X then.But Haney’s father Surendra is unhappy. “My son hasn’t received the cash prize that every Asian Games gold medal winner in Haryana is entitled to,” he says","Manu Bhaker is India’s lone sportsperson to win two medals in one Olympics. Goria is located on the edge of Jhajjar district, on the outskirts of Delhi. Villagers blame a nearby power plant for the waterlogging mess. Jats are numerically the largest caste in Goria.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113919242,imgsize-1213607,width-400,resizemode-4/113919242.jpg"

""My 24-year-old son is unable to get a job even after earning a degree.""Asked if she will cast her vote if there's no hope from any political parties , the resident of Dabla village, Sirsa, says: ""Ib ghar beth ke bhi ke kara (What will I do sitting at home [on polling day)?""Many from the lower castes share the sense of disillusionment.""We are living in our own homes like tenants. We are paying for all amenities, getting nothing from the govt,"" says Promila, a cleaner in Rohtak belonging to the Scheduled Caste community.She shows little enthusiasm for the elections. ""I do not feel like voting. Neither Modi nor Rahul Gandhi cares about uplifting us,"" she says. Despite this, she admits, ""I've always voted for BJP.""""It is usually my brother-in-law who tells me who to vote for,"" adds the 42-year-old widow who like many women in the state, notorious for its patriarchal values, depends on male family members to decide her vote.Another OBC voter Sooraj Prakash, 38, a resident of Shahidanwali village in Sirsa, says: ""We want change. Our MLA (Gopal Kanda) hasn't done anything for us. We face massive water-related issues. There has been no growth in the rural areas. Farming-related issues continue to trouble us.""These voices from Haryana's Dalit and OBC communities reflect a broader sentiment of disempowerment. While they may feel their votes don't matter, their choices are crucial. With Jat voters leaning towards Congress, and the Punjabi and Saini (OBC) communities largely favouring the BJP, those from the lower castes - Dalits and other marginalised OBCs - may hold the balance of power in deciding the state's next govt.According to experts, most Yadav votes in the state would go to BJP. Political analyst Satish Tyagi says OBC communities have been inclined to BJP for the last 10 years.""The current CM being a Saini will get BJP a good chunk of votes from the Saini community & Congress is expected to get 40% OBC votes .""""We are Yadavs. We are the Narayani Sena. But there's no regiment for us, nothing,"" a 30-year-old BJP supporter from Bhiwani laments, adding: ""Are only jats farmers in this country? We need leaders who bring talented people forward and work bias-free.""His bias issue represents an anti-Jat sentiment owing to the former regimes with a reputation of favouring the Jat community in govt jobs. ""In Lok Sabha elections, Dalit and Jat votes consolidated with Congress. The same pattern is running in Vidhan Sabha too,"" Rohtak-based journalist Virender Phogat told TOI.Noting Rahul's ""36 biradari ki Congress sarkar"" slogan, Phogat says his 'Save Constitution' drive and anti-incumbency ""will be a game changer for the Congress party"".Haryana has 40.9 lakh SCs comprising 19.4% of the state population - fifth largest in India. Will Congress' promise to conduct a caste-based survey in the state have a major impact? ""It is perceived that only chamars have benefitted to a large extent from reservation. A caste census would redefine share of other castes. The deprived SCs see that as hope...""""Brahmins, Punjabis & Sainis traditionally support BJP.

""Berozgari ( unemployment ),"" is Singh's single-word response to the dominant theme in the polls where the BJP is struggling to beat anti-incumbency, rebellion and intra-party feuds.Singh is one of the marginal farmers belonging to Kurukshetra, which with Karnal and Kaithal are popular as the ""rice bowl of India"". Others too echo Singh's viewpoint. For them ""naukri"" means ""sarkari (govt)"" and not ""private jobs"" for which they rue ""youth migration"" to Delhi and other metros.Ahead of polls, govt had sought applications to fill up an unspecified number sweepers' posts. A staggering 1.66 lakh applied, including over 40,000 graduates and 6,000 postgraduates. No wonder all parties put govt jobs on top of their manifesto.Sukhvinder Singh, belonging to one of the five Jat families from Indri village on Kurukshetra-Rohtak Road, however, is equally unhappy with the poor quality of roads. ""Go beyond highways ... you will see pathetic roads,"" says Sukhvinder.

He was a non-veg eater, and he was not against cow slaughter. He was modern in a way,"" Rao, a Brahmin himself, said, further stating that Savarkar's ""fundamentalist ideology"" stood in contrast to Indian culture.Rao also criticised Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, calling him ""a hardcore Islamist believer"" but distinguished between Jinnah and Savarkar.""Jinnah was not a fundamentalist like Savarkar. He used to drink wine and, it is said, ate pork as well, but he became a Muslim icon after the two-nation theory and politics. Jinnah was not a fundamentalist, but Savarkar was a fundamentalist,"" Rao added.Savarkar's grandson Ranjit Savarkar said it was Congress 's strategy to defame Savarkar, especially when elections were at hand. ""Congress wants to divide Hindu society into different castes in order to win elections. This was also the British policy of 'divide and rule',"" he said, adding that he would file a defamation suit against Rao.BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said Congress should know that Savarkar was the only freedom fighter in India's history who was sentenced to two life imprisonments but the opposition party, which was used to insulting sanatan tradition, had not done it for the first time.BJP MP Anurag Thakur accused Rahul Gandhi of promoting a ""tukde tukde"" ideology, saying the Congress MP was a ""modern Jinnah"". ""India will not tolerate the disrespect of Veer Savarkar, who dedicated his life to the country,"" he said.Shiv Sena's Sanjay Nirupam too criticised Congress for repeatedly maligning Savarkar, who is revered in Maharashtra.In response to the backlash, Rao issued a clarification on Thursday, saying his comments were based on statements made by Savarkar himself.""Savarkar, on many occasions, had stated that he was an atheist and ate meat. I did not say anything new,"" Rao said in a statement.He clarified that his remarks were not personal attacks on Savarkar but were meant to draw a comparison between the lifestyles of Mahatma Gandhi and Savarkar.""I mentioned Savarkar being non-vegetarian while comparing the lifestyles of Gandhiji, who strongly believed in the Hindu religion yet remained democratic, and Savarkar, who had an ambition of building a Hindu nation despite being an atheist.

IndianOil pipelines to raise bar against China in Nepal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indianoil-pipelines-to-raise-bar-against-china-in-nepal/articleshow/113918621.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will lay two pipelines for supplying petroleum products to distribution centres in upcountry Nepal in an affordable and environment friendly mode, a move that will raise the entry barrier for China in the Himalayan country’s oil market.State-run IndianOil and Nepal Oil Corporation on Thursday signed the framework agreement, paving the way for work on the pipelines to start.One pipeline will carry products from Siliguri in West Bengal to Jhapa in Nepal, covering a distance of 50 km. The other pipeline will be laid inside Nepal for pushing products upcountry from Amlekhgunj across Bihar’s Raxaul town to Lothar in Chitwan area, 62 kms away. Building two terminals are also part of the agreement.India currently meets Nepal’s fuel needs, estimated at about 1.5 million tonnes per annum. IndianOil supplies products to Amlekhganj through a pipeline from its Motihari depot in Bihar. Extension of this pipeline to Lothar will reduce the cost of transporting fuel across the country and the resultant pollution from tankers. The pipeline from Siliguri will open a second supply route and improve availability in eastern Nepal.The agreement follows a 2023 MoU between India’s oil ministry and Nepal’s ministry of industry, commerce and supplies. Both the pipelines have been under discussion since 2019, when peeved by India’s economic blockade a year earlier, Kathmandu had signed a trade and fuel supply pact with China. But the Himalayan logistics involved in carting fuel from China has made the option economically unviable.The pipelines and terminals will bind the two countries tighter by making Indian fuel more attractive for Nepal. ""Another milestone in #IndiaNepalFriendship!
