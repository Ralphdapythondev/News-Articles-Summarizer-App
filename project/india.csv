"NGO Report: 'Over 4400 child marriages take place everyday but cases registered during the last five years stand at a mere 3,863'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ngo-report-over-4400-child-marriages-take-place-everyday-but-cases-registered-during-the-last-five-years-stand-at-a-mere-3863/articleshow/111822638.cms,"NEW DELHI: Drawing attention to the gravity of the problem and the need for strong legal interventions , a new study highlights that every minute, 3 girls get married in India, and yet in 2022, only 3 cases were registered every day.On an average, only one case of child marriage per district was registered for prosecution in 2022, shows an analysis of govt data, by 'India Child Protection’ research team which is part of 'Child Marriage Free India' (CMFI) network of civil society organisations.The report draws its analysis from Census 2011, National Crime Records Bureau and National family Health Survey 5 (2019-21).Calling for legal action to end child marriage, the report highlights Assam as a case study that the country can learn from. The analysis cites 81% reduction in the instances of child marriage across 1,132 villages 20 districts of Assam between 2021-22 and 2023-24. In absolute numbers, the incidence of child marriages has declined from 3,225 cases in 2021–22 to 627 cases in 2023–24. The survey was carried out in these villages in the backdrop of the Assam govt's crackdown on child marriages last year which resulted in over 3000 arrests. The report claims that 98% percent of the respondents believed that the Assam government’s strict law enforcement initiatives in 2023 had a substantial and striking influence on the reduction of child marriages within their communities.On the national front, the report shows that the total number of child marriage cases as per National Crime Records Bureau registered during the last five years from 2018-2022 was only 3,863. On the other hand the 2011 census of India estimates suggest that approximately 16,21,257 child marriages are taking place every year in the country, which roughly translates to 4,442 marriages every day. Even the latest round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) estimates shows that 23.3% of women aged 20–24 were married before the age of 18 years.Prolonged trials in courts and poor conviction rate are cited as key concerns. “In 2022, out of the total 3,563 child marriage cases listed for trial in courts under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, a mere 181 cases were successfully concluded in terms of trial completion,” it is stated. Infact, this slow disposal rate has resulted in a persistently high pendency rate, which stands at 92%. Moreover, despite the fact that there are only 3,365 cases pending, with the current rate of disposal, the country may take 19 years to clear the backlogs as of 2022.As far as the conviction rate in cases filed under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act goes, in 2022, a mere 11%of these cases resulted in convictions, contrasting sharply with the overall conviction rate of 34% for all crimes committed against children during that year.The report also highlights that civil society organisations associated with CMFI successfully prevented 14,137 child marriages in 2023-24 by using legal interventions and prevented 59,364 child marriages with the help of panchayats. A sample of 2436 child marriage succefully stopped by NGOs shows that in 42% of the cases the boys were also a victim of child marriage and in 58% cases the boy was over 21 years of age. In almost two thirds of cases the victims were going to be married to boys above 21 years, where the age difference was over 3 years. In 12 percent cases the same was over 7 years with the groom being over 25 years and above.“This clearly establishes that majority cases of child marriages are instances of exploiting the vulnerability of the girl child with older men taking advantage of their position of authority and the vulnerability of these girls,” it is highlighted.","In 2022, only one case of child marriage per district was registered for prosecution in India.

GHAZIABAD: Like many others, Dhanveer Singh Negi (57) stopped when he saw a crowd gathered on a culvert. But he was the only one to jump into the opaque waters of the canal running below and drag to safety a man who was about to drown.""I'm a soldier. I can't watch anyone die in front of my eyes,"" the ex-Navyman told TOI on Wednesday of his plunge into the Hindon canal on Monday afternoon when a young man thrashed around to stay afloat, his father cried plaintively on the banks and onlookers captured it all on their cellphone cameras.Negi, a former petty officer with the Navy 's marine commandos (Marcos), wasn't the youngest in the crowd but parked his scooter and jumped in immediately.I saw people taking videos and pictures, but no one had the courage to save the boy. Probably, they didn't know how to swim,"" he said.It's some of these videos that would tell the tale of Singh's rescue act to the wider world, drawing lavish praise on social media. The 18-year-old youth who Negi saved had, according to witnesses, jumped into the canal near Gaur Green Avenue in Indirapuram after an argument with his father, who drives an e-rickshaw for a living.Negi, who lives in Indirapuram, was returning home. It was around 4.30pm when he spotted the man in the canal.Originally from Pauri Garhwal, Negi completed high school in 1985 and moved to Mumbai to join the Navy as a technical support specialist (electrical). His training took place at Mandvi, Goa. After a year, he went aboard a ship.""I learned underwater diving skills and afterward joined Marcos. Currently, I am a trainer at a merchant navy institute in Sector 1 in Noida,"" said Negi, who retired on July 31, 2000.""When I took the boy out of water, I also gave him CPR. After that, some people stopped an e-rickshaw and put the boy into it to take him to a hospital for treatment. I don't know him, and I didn't try to get to know him. I learned during my Navy training that soldiers work to only save people and move forward. I did the same,"" he added.One video of 35 seconds shows Negi getting into the water. Another shows him pulling the youth to the banks and getting out. The person recording the video asks him his name and he replies that he is D S Negi, a local resident. The father of the youth, meanwhile, thanks Negi with folded hands.Manan Bhatt, a Navy veteran, heaped praise on Negi, saying his act demonstrated that heroism and service transcend retirement. ""Negi's act of courage extended beyond the rescued man. It serves as a powerful reminder to society that age and profession are no barriers to service and valour.

3 girls are forced into child marriage per minute in India: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-girls-are-forced-into-child-marriage-per-minute-in-india-study/articleshow/111821799.cms,"NEW DELHI:

With 81% drop in 3 years,

a case study in curbing child marriage: Study

Times View In India, child marriage was first banned back in 1929. The Act has been improved upon on several occasions. However, as this data shows, the regressive practice is alive and kicking. This is a national disgrace and cause for serious concern. Ending child marriage can also help improve maternal and infant mortality rates, female labour force participation and gender equality. The 2021 bill, which sought to amend the prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006, should be taken up afresh. But the truth is that no regressive practice survives without social sanction. That’s why authorities as well as NGOs should act in mission mode

We are 24 years into the 21st century, but every minute, three girl children are forced into marriage in India. Not that you will know this from crime data, which captures a fraction of child marriages in the country. Take 2022, for example. Only three cases were registered per day nationwide. It gets grimmer: in most cases, the groom was over 21.These shocking numbers are courtesy a new study by 'India Child Protection' research team, part of the ' Child Marriage Free India' network of civil society organisations.The report analysed data from Census 2011, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21).Per the report, NCRB data for 2018-2022 records 3,863 child marriages. But, as the study points out, extrapolating from Census estimates, 16 lakh child marriages take place every year.That translates into over 4,000 child marriages every day. NFHS-5 estimates show that 23.3% of women in the 20-24 age bracket were married before they were 18.Assam is cited as a case study in curbing child marriage. The report says, between 2021-22 and 2023-24, there was an 81% drop in child marriages across 1,132 villages in 20 districts of the state. In absolute numbers, the decline is from 3,225 cases in 2021-22 to 627 in 2023-24. Last year, there were over 3,000 arrests for this crime.In a survey carried out in these villages, 98% of respondents believed that the state's strict law enforcement is a major reason child marriages are declining in number.The picture is different everywhere else. The report says prolonged trials in courts and poor conviction rates encourage those intent on marrying off girl children. ""In 2022, out of the total 3,563 child marriage cases listed for trial in courts under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, a mere 181 cases were successfully concluded in terms of trial completion,"" the report said. Case pendency rate is 92%. Conviction rate is 11%.Analysing data of child marriages that were prevented by various NGOs, the report says, a ""majority of cases of child marriages are instances of exploiting the vulnerability of the girl child, with older men taking advantage of their position of authority and the vulnerability of these girls"".","In 2022, out of the total 3,563 child marriage cases listed for trial in courts under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, a mere 181 cases were successfully concluded.

Usha Vance carries rich Indian cultural values and has a strong legal background, making her a key figure in this political partnership.Usha Vance, daughter of Indian immigrants, is a litigator at a national law firm.She graduated from Yale University with a bachelor's degree in History and earned a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge. A corporate litigator at a prestigious law firm in San Francisco, has clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court , as well as for Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his tenure as an appeals court judge.Raised in a suburb of San Diego, California, Usha's upbringing emphasised education and hard work. Her academic journey saw her serving as Managing Editor of the Yale Journal of Law & Technology and Executive Development Editor of The Yale Law Journal. As a Gates fellow at Cambridge, she engaged with left-wing and liberal groups and was a registered Democrat in 2014.Usha and JD Vance first met at Yale Law School and were married in Kentucky in 2014. Their wedding included a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. The couple has three children together.Usha Vance has been instrumental in her husband's political success. She played a key role in helping JD Vance organise his thoughts on the social decline in rural white America, which inspired his best-selling memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy."" The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.In the past, Usha has made some rare public appearances alongside JD Vance during his campaign from the Ohio Senate seat.As the US presidential elections approach, former President Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his Vice Presidential pick. Trump confirmed Vance's candidacy through a social media post.""Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants—and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket,"" said AI Mason, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and entrepreneur, speaking to ANI. ""She knows the Indian culture and all about India.

Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better,"" said Usha Vance.On supporting her husband, Usha told Fox, ""There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people. And so I think I've seen that...the power of that in my own life, and I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him.""The interview was conducted three weeks before JD Vance was announced as Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential elections.JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when he was a toddler. Raised by his grandparents, Vance's challenging early life shaped his perspectives.The Trump campaign has stated that following his near-death experience, the former president will focus on calling for unity in times of tragedy, instead of criticising his political adversaries. This approach will be pivotal as he faces off against President Biden in the 2024 election rematch.","Usha Chilukuri Vance is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections.

"Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Are you paying excess tax? You may be paying Rs 43,226 extra on Rs 10 lakh income",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-are-you-paying-excess-tax-you-may-be-paying-rs-43226-extra-on-rs-10-lakh-income-find-out-why/articleshow/111800608.cms,"Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: Are you paying excess tax?

Let's examine the tax liability for a taxable income of Rs 10 lakh.

The old regime results in a tax liability of Rs 1.17 lakh, which translates to an effective tax rate of 11.7%. In contrast, under the new tax regime, the tax liability stands at Rs 62,400, or 6.24%, says Bankbazaar.

Adjusting the 2013-14 tax (Rs 1.33 lakh) for inflation, the tax should have been reduced to Rs 73,774, or 7.3%.

Taking inflation into account, Rs 10 lakh in 2013 is equivalent to Rs 5.5 lakh in 2024. Consequently, the 'real' tax rate under the old regime is 21%, while it is 11.3% under the new regime.

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: Budget 2024 should look to change tax slabs under the old tax regime and also consider changes to the new tax regime to inflation-adjust the tax burden borne by salaried taxpayers , says Bankbazaar.com in its Pre-Budget 2024 primer.The old tax regime income tax slab rates, which have remained unchanged since 2013, have not been adjusted for inflation, resulting in taxpayers paying higher tax rates despite the rising cost of living, says Bankbazaar.Considering 2012-13 as the reference point, the value of every Rs 1 earned has effectively decreased to Rs 0.55 in 2024-25. Consequently, an income of Rs 10 lakh in 2012-13 now has the purchasing power of only Rs 5.50 lakh, while Rs 20 lakh is now equivalent to Rs 11 lakh in terms of buying capacity, it notes.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income tax relief for salaried taxpayers, railways capex in focus To put it simply, an income of Rs 10 lakh in 2012-13 would need to be Rs 18.15 lakh today, and an income of Rs 20 lakh would need to be Rs 36.30 lakh to have the same buying power.Bankbazaar’s analysis says that when inflation-adjustment is not taken into account for income tax brackets, and considering the 2012-13 inflation figures as the starting point, it leads to the inference that taxpayers are shelling out more than what they should.Under the old tax regime, earnings exceeding Rs 5 lakh are being subjected to excess taxes. In the new tax regime, this threshold is set at Rs 15 lakh, it says.For instance, on an income of Rs 10 lakh, excess taxes paid in the old regime are Rs 43,226, or Rs 3602 per month. At Rs 20 lakh, excess taxes paid are Rs 1.84 lakh in the old regime and Rs 67,978 in the new regime.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 5 things FM Sitharaman should do for taxpayers - from tax slab changes to hiking standard deduction The new regime appears to be more favorable in terms of inflation adjustment. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that the positive impact of the new tax regime is limited to incomes up to Rs 15 lakh. Within this income range, the effective tax rates seem to be lower compared to the inflation-adjusted values from 2013-14.For incomes exceeding Rs 15 lakh, the new regime does not provide any inflation adjustment. In comparison, the old regime fails to offer inflation adjustment for any income above Rs 5 lakh, it says.","Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: Budget 2024 should look to change tax slabs under the old tax regime, says Bankbazaar.

NEW DELHI: Sharad Pawar is back with a bang. Almost a year after he lost control of his Nationalist Congress Party following a rebellion led by his estranged nephew Ajit Pawar , the Maratha strongman is once again on the centrestage of Maharashtra politics.The recent surprise visit of Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal , who had sided with Ajit Pawar after last year's rebellion, and the return of several NCP leaders into his party fold have come as a boost to the veteran leader, who led his party to its best-ever performance in the national elections.It was on July 2 last year that Ajit Pawar carried out a meticulously planned coup that left his uncle Sharad Pawar surprised and isolated. He joined the Eknath Shinde-led NDA government as the ""national president"" of Nationalist Congress Party displacing Sharad Pawar, who founded the party in 1999. Ajit Pawar walked away with majority of MLAs and eventually also got the name and symbol of the party.A year later, the wheel of fortune has turned full circle and today Ajit Pawar stands isolated in the BJP-led Mahayuti after a disastrous Lok Sabha show. What's worse, the RSS has repeatedly pointed to BJP 's mistake in aligning with Ajit Pawar.So, is Sharad Pawar is ready to let bygones be bygones and welcome back Ajit Pawar if he decides for homecoming?When asked about the possibility of taking back his nephew, Sharad Pawar made it clear that he would first consult all his (party) colleagues who stood with him before taking any step in this matter.Ajit Pawar faces a tense future in the ruling Mahayuti. His party's demand for a Cabinet minister berth for senior leader Praful Patel was ignored by the BJP. As the ruling party gears for the assembly elections later this year, Ajit Pawar knows that he faces an uphill task to regain the lost ground.Sharad Pawar also took a dig at NCP leader and minister Chhagan Bhujbal over his unscheduled visit to the NCP (SP) chief's residence recently.""I was resting because I was unwell when Bhujbal visited me. I was told that Bhujbal had been waiting for me for one hour and was not ready to go without meeting me,"" Pawar said.""Bhujbal's recent remarks about me in a couple of speeches showed that he had tremendous 'aastha' (faith) in me,"" Pawar said sarcastically, indirectly referencing Bhujbal's remarks at a rally held on Sunday.Bhujbal had claimed Maha Vikas Aghadi leaders backed out from attending an all-party meeting convened by the government at the last minute after receiving a ""phone call from Baramati"", alluding to Pawar.",Maratha strongman Sharad Pawar is once again on the centrestage of Maharashtra politics.

: What is the contentious bill?

Andhra Pradesh versus Karnataka over quota

The Karnakata government has decided to put the controversial job reservation bill on hold for the time being facing massive pushback from industries. Chief minister Siddaramaiah said the bill will be revisited and the future course of action will be decided in the coming days. ""The bill approved by the cabinet to provide reservation for Kannadigas in private sector organizations, industries and enterprises has been temporarily put on hold,"" the chief minister issued a statement on X.The Karnataka State Employment of Local Candidates in the Industries, Factories and Other Establishments Bill, 2024 was passed in the Cabinet meeting on Monday.It said any industry, factory or other establishments shall appoint 50 per cent of local candidates in management categories and 70 per cent in non-management categories.If the candidates do not have secondary school certificates with Kannada as a language, they would have to pass a Kannada proficiency test, the bill stipulated.The Kannada-must provision drew flak from industry leaders as they argued that Bengaluru will lose skilled talent if such a bill is adopted. Another genius move from Govt of Karnataka. ""Mandate LOCAL RESERVATION & APPOINT GOVT OFFICER IN EVERY COMPANY to monitor. This will scare Indian IT & GCCs. Short sighted,"" Assocham co-chairman RK Mishra said.Karnataka's move is similar to a bill introduced by the Haryana government, mandating 75 per cent reservation in private sector jobs to residents of the state. It was, however, struck down by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on November 17, 2023.A bill enforcing 50 per cent reservation for administrative posts and 75 per cent for non-administrative posts for Kannadigas in private industries is the bone of contention.Initially, the government was defensive about the move of prioritizing the Kannadigas as Siddaramaiah said the government does not want the Kannadigas to be deprived of job opportunities in the state. ""We are a pro-Kannada government. Our priority is to look after the welfare of the Kannadigas,"" Siddaramaiah said.With the industries expressing concerns that they may have to shut shops in Karnataka if Kannada becomes a qualifier for jobs, Andhra Pradesh minister Nara Lokesh did not miss the opportunity to try to lure away the industry honchos.""We understand your disappointment. We welcome you to expand or relocate your businesses to our IT, IT services, AI and data center cluster at Vizag. We will offer you best-in-class facilities, uninterrupted power, infrastructure and the most suitable skilled talent for your IT enterprise with no restrictions from the Government. Andhra Pradesh is ready to welcome you. Please get in touch!"" Nara Lokesh posted.Karnataka minister Priyanka Kharge replied to Lokesh and asked whether the minister does not want Andhra Pradesh companies to employ Andhra people.""Karnataka has always excelled in the most sector due to our consistent relationships and consultative approach with industry leaders, advisory bodies, and consortiums in drafting policies and schemes. As with previous initiatives, this draft bill will include recommendations from our industry partners,"" Kharge wrote.""Our goal is to develop a global workforce using local talent, while also encouraging global investments and creating employment opportunities.""""By the way, wouldn’t you also like to ensure that every company invested in Andhra Pradesh employs deserving, trained and skilled individuals from Andhra Pradesh? Dear @nasscom, be rest assured, we will not do anything that will not withstand legal scrutiny. This is your Government and as always we are just a call away,"" Kharge assuaged Nasscom.","The Karnakata government has decided to put the controversial job reservation bill on hold for the time being.

In today's highly competitive landscape, knowledge led businesses will locate where talent is as attracting skilled workers is crucial for success,"" the statement said.The statement from Nasscom said that the technology sector contributes to 25% of Karnataka's gross domestic product and also that the state houses a quarter of India's digital talent with over 11,000 start-ups and 30% of the total global capability centres (GCC).""It's deeply disturbing to see this kind of bill which will not only hamper the growth of the industry, impact jobs and the global brand for the state. Nasscom members are seriously concerned about the provisions of this bill and urge the state government to withdraw the bill,"" the statement added.The bill proposes that all industries, factories, and other establishments in the state reserve 50% of jobs in managerial roles nad 70% in non-managerial jobs for local candidates. It also stipulates that candidates not possessing a secondary school certificate with Kannada as a language will need to pass a Kannada proficiency test.","TDP leader and minister Lokesh Nara invited ""disappointed"" Nasscom to relocate its enterprise to Andhra Pradesh.

Haryana govt faced similar blow

NEW DELHI: The Karnataka government's quota bill to facilitate reservation for locals in private jobs has been put on hold after massive uproar.The decision by the Siddaramaiah government came after stakeholders expressed disappointment and multiple concerns over the outcome which would pan out following the bill's implementation.Karnataka State Employment of Local Industries Factories Establishment Act Bill, formulated to cap employment for non-locals in private companies in the state, proposes to reserve 50 per cent of jobs in managerial roles and 70 per cent in non-managerial jobs for local candidates .The quota shall be applied to all industries, factories, and other establishments in the state.It also stipulates that candidates not possessing a secondary school certificate with Kannada as a language will need to pass a Kannada proficiency test .The bill, which has now been put on hold, will not be immune to challenges even if the Karnataka assembly passes it with ease down the line.Taking a cue from Haryana and Bihar 's similar push in the past, Karnataka's quota bill might not pass the muster of law -- as happened with the two northern states.Last month Patna high court struck down a 65 per cent reservation cap set by the state in government jobs and educational institutions.The court pronounced the judgement after hearing petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the increase in quota for backward, extremely backward classes, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes from 50 per cent to 65 per cent in government jobs and higher educational institutions in the state.The petitioners had challenged the constitutional validity of the amendments made in reservation laws. On November 21, the state government had notified the amended reservation laws.The Bihar government in November last year had officially notified in the state gazette two bills, aiming to raise the quota for deprived castes from 50 per cent to 65 per cent in government jobs and educational institutions. With the enactments, Bihar held the highest reservation percentage among larger states, reaching a total of 75 per cent.According to the gazette notification, the revised reservation percentages included 20 per cent for scheduled castes, 2 per cent for scheduled tribes, 18 per cent for backward classes, 25 per cent for extremely backward classes, and the EWS has 10 per cent quota in the state.The amendments represented an increase in the quota for scheduled castes from 16 per cent to 20 per cent, scheduled tribes from 1 per cent to 2 per cent, extremely backward classes from 18 per cent to 25 per cent, and backward classes from 15 per cent to 18 per cent.The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, providing 75 per cent reservation in Haryana industries for the domiciles of the state was passed by the state legislative assembly on March 2, 2021.On November 6, 2021, a notification was also issued by the state's labour department regarding its applicability.However, last year, the Punjab and Haryana high court had set aside the law.The division bench comprising Justice G S Sandhawalia and Justice Harpreet Kaur Jeewan of the HC passed these orders after hearing several petitions filed by various Industrial bodies of Haryana.The main grievance of the industrial bodies was that by introducing policy of ""Son of Soils"", the Haryana government wants to create reservation in private sector which is infringement of the constitutional rights of the employers because private sector jobs are purely based on the skills and analytical blend of mind of the employees who are citizen of India having constitutional rights on the basis of their education to do jobs in any part of India.",The Karnataka government's quota bill to facilitate reservation for locals in private jobs has been put on hold.

But the train could slow down to only 40 kmph before it crashing into Kanchenjungha.

Jo vipaksh chunav ke pehle himmat haar ke baith gaya tha wo aaj phir se uchhal kood karne ka karya kar raha hai ( BJP paid the price for its over-confidence. Our opponents, who were despondent before the polls, now have a spring in their step),"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said at a meeting of the state executive in Lucknow on Sunday, which saw him lamenting the failure to check ""fake narratives"" - a reference to opposition's allegation about the plot to finish quotas.His audience included BJP president J P Nadda.""Hamare yahan sangathan sadaiv sarkar se bada raha hai. Sabhi mantriyon, vidhayakon aur jan pratinidhiyon ko karyakartaon ka samman karna chahiye. Main pehle ek karyakarta hoon aur uske baad up-mukhyamantri (In BJP's scheme, the organisation always takes precedence over govt and it is, therefore, incumbent upon all ministers, MLAs and public representatives to respect workers and take care of their dignity. I am a party worker first and deputy CM second,"" Keshav Maurya said at the same venue.Few of the lakhs of BJP workers in the politically key state, trying to come to grips with the unexpected reverses in LS polls, would have found the statements to be problematic.However, if none of them is amused, it is because of the not-so-subtle message driven home and the backdrop of the feud that the party's underwhelming performance has sparked.In the current tense times, Yogi's message, although factually correct, has been seen as aimed at the state unit and sullen colleagues like Maurya who have sought to pin the unexpected losses on the CM. He made it clear that he had no intention to be reduced from the poster boy of modern Hinduva to the whipping boy.Ditto for Maurya. His concern for the respect of workers has been seen as echoing the complaint of the anti-Yogi faction about the organisation being reduced to an adjunct of the govt.The utterances have brought to fore the simmering differences between the CM and an influential set who have chafed at his popularity and dominance.Right since the 2017 landslide, scripted by Union home minister Amit Shah, then the BJP chief, which brought the party to office, Yogi loomed large over the organisation by the sheer force of his appeal. Maurya, state party chief at the time of assembly elections who saw himself as the natural claimant for the spoils, always found it difficult to reconcile himself to being the second fiddle but had to acquiesce to his existence as a junior partner.Although the second term saw restraints being placed on Yogi's powers to placate wounded aspirations, in the public imagination Yogi still dwarfed everyone else. The appearance of govt-organisation tandem also somehow held until the disappointment on June 4 exposed the cracks and set the stage for an open season of blame game where an assortment of considerations - from course correction on caste in view of SP's gains among non-Yadav OBCs and Dalits to the need for better chemistry with cadre and levelling the playing field among state functionaries - have been bandied about.Nadda had a first-hand experience of the rumblings in the state which was crucial for BJP's back-to-back victories in 2014 and 2019. He has since thought it fit to hold deliberations with Maurya and state chief Bhupendra Chaudhary, a nondescript figure who has lately acquired a profile by framing himself as the voice of the ""party worker"".Significantly, Chaudhary's meeting with PM Modi on Wednesday sparked speculation that he has been asked to step down, something which he rushed to deny.Maurya taking up cudgels for the cadre has been seen by some as a joust for the important portfolio of public works department which he held in the first term. Maurya was shifted to rural development in the second term with PWD going to Jitendra Prasada who has since been elected to LS and appointed a minister. The department has since been lying vacant.But others say Maurya, an OBC, has his sights higher and that by positioning himself as an ""organisation man"" he could, in fact, be trying to be the party chief, the argument being that the party needs to bring the non-Yadav OBCs back.Senior members acknowledged that comments from several functionaries in the state have dented its image of a disciplined party but added that it was expected as they needed to vent their feelings after suffering a defeat few saw coming.""In a way, it is good the pent-up steam has been blown,"" said a senior BJP source, adding that the top priority now would be to do well in the assembly bypolls to 10 seats. The Election Commission is likely to announce the date soon.Sources said the meetings could be the beginning of the much-expected exercise to rearrange the organisational chess board in the state in a bid to boost the morale of workers and put the house in order. This could be the first sitting of central representatives to take feedback of the UP brass with regards to the party's poor performance in the LS polls. Sources said more meetings of UP BJP members, including Yogi meeting the central brass, are expected soon.","Yogi Adityanath: ""BJP paid the price for its over-confidence.

: Just because SC carved out an exception, law being misued

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has said that it is wasting a lot of judicial time these days as people convicted in serious offences are filing frivolous petitions long after dismissal of their appeals claiming to be juveniles at the time of committing the offence.Twin factors have given wing to such pleas - an SC ruling of 2012 that a convict can at any time, even after dismissal of appeal by SC, raise the plea of juvenility for the first time; and Juvenile Justice Act, which bars incarceration beyond three years.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices PS Narasimha and J B Pardiwala on Tuesday was confronted with a plea of juvenility filed by a convict more than a year after SC dismissed his appeal against conviction. The trial court had convicted him for a 1997 murder in 1999 and Madhya Pradesh high court had upheld his conviction in 2017.He had never whispered a plea about being a juvenile during the past 27 years, when the case against him rolled from trial court to the apex court. His plea for juvenility was scrutinised by SC because of its Oct 10, 2012 judgment in Abuzar Hossain case, where it ruled that ""claim of juvenility... may be raised for the first time before SC as well after final disposal... The delay... cannot be a ground for rejection of such a claim.""The CJI-led bench on Tuesday said, ""Now that a plea of juvenility can be raised at any stage... Most of them are completely bogus and a waste of the court's time.""The murder convict, serving life term, had submitted a bogus birth certificate and a sarpanch's panchnama as a supporting document. SC had ordered an inquiry and the district authorities concerned reported back that there was no evidence to substantiate his juvenile claim .After dismissing the plea, CJI Chandrachud said, ""Just because an exception was carved out by the SC judgment, this is how the law is being misused... The convicts must be careful in filing such applications in future.""Section 9(2) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 contemplated that whenever a claim of juvenility is raised before any court, the court shall make an inquiry and take such evidence as may be necessary.",Supreme Court has said that it is wasting a lot of judicial time these days.

SC warns against coercive action on NCR homebuyers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-warns-against-coercive-action-on-ncr-homebuyers/articleshow/111821724.cms,"'Banks disbursed loan to builder but didn't link it to

construction stages

'

NEW DELHI: In a relief to many homebuyers who booked flats under the subvention plan and have not received possession of their flats in various projects across the NCR due to inordinate delays by developers, the Supreme Court has directed that no coercive action be taken against them by banks or builders regarding payment of EMI, and no complaints shall be entertained against them in cheque bounce cases.Under the subvention scheme, banks disburse the sanctioned amount directly to the accounts of builders, who are then to pay EMIs on the sanctioned loan amount until possession of the flats is handed over to the homebuyers. As builders started defaulting in paying the EMIs to the banks as per the tripartite agreement, banks initiated action against the buyers to recover the amount.Aggrieved by the action of banks, a large number of homebuyers had approached Delhi high court, which had in 2023 refused to grant them relief saying, there were alternate remedies available to them. Subsequently, they knocked the doors of the apex court, which granted them interim protection.As homebuyers are facing the threat of cheque bounce cases, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan on Monday directed that no cheque bounce complaint against such homebuyers be entertained while the issue is pending.""In the meantime, there shall be interim stay in all matters, to the effect that no coercive action including complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, shall be entertained on behalf of the banks/financial institutions or builders/developers against the homebuyers,"" the order, granting protection to all such homebuyers.Challenging the HC order, the aggrieved homebuyers submitted that they were victims of illegal disbursal of loan by the bank directly into the account of the builder in violation of RBI guidelines .""This is the classic case where one rich man (bank/financial institutions) gave money to another rich man (builder). The rich man who received the money (builder) ran away with it without fulfilling his obligations. The rich man who gave the money (bank/financial institutions), disbursed it in violation of the law of the land. The poor man (homebuyer) is now made a victim and is pushed into litigation by the bank when he has not received a single rupee. And is deprived of his dream home,"" a petition, filed by advocate Anshul Gupta on behalf of a batch of homebuyers, said.They alleged that the main violation was that the banks disbursed the loan amounts directly to the builder without linking it to the stages of construction, in gross violation of RBI circulars as well as National Housing Bank (NHB) guidelines.""The high court failed to take note of the fact that the builder as well as bank both acted hand in glove. The poor homebuyer is used as a medium to get the loan sanctioned and money transferred from the bank to the builder. The homebuyer herein is pushed into the litigation for the amount which he himself has never seen or actually received. The acts of both builder and banks are in violation of tri-partite agreement and also in violation of RBI/NHB statutory guidelines,"" the petition said.""The homebuyers are taken for a ride and there exists no legal framework to address the issues when the insolvency proceedings are initiated against the real estate developer and banks still keep charging EMIs/pre-EMIs even when the liability of repayment is of the real estate builder,"" it said.Agreeing to examine the grievances of homebuyers, SC directed builders/developers two weeks' time to file reply affidavit including details of their assets and the court made it clear that it would be constrained to take coercive action against them if they failed to comply with its order.","Banks disbursed loan to builder but didn't link it to stages of construction, petition says.

Indian K9 squad on duty at Paris Games,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-k9-squad-on-duty-at-paris-games/articleshow/111821313.cms,"NEW DELHI: Five-year old Vast and three-year old Denby - the two Belgian Malinois K9 'soldiers' of the CRPF - will be part of the 10 K9 squads, comprising the dogs and their handlers, assigned to be part of the security paraphernalia at Paris Olympics beginning next week.The 10 dogs - drawn from different central armed police force (CAPFs) including the CRPF, NSG, SSB, ITBP - will be in Paris for a month until August 11, carrying out sniffing and patrolling duties under the overall supervision of the French authorities handling security of all Olympics venues and events.The K9 teams have been deputed for the Olympics assignment on the request of the French govt. This is the first international deployment of an Indian K9 unit drawn from the CAPFs, for purposes other than disaster relief.Like Vast and Denby, the dogs for the Paris Olympics security squad have undergone stringent training and special conditioning for their foreign assignment. Their trainers too are said to have been put through basic familiarisation with French language.""Vast and Denby were trained at the dog breeding and training school of the CRPF at Taralu near Bengaluru.

Who are zero-dose children and why it doesn't mean no shots given,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-are-zero-dose-children-and-why-it-doesnt-mean-no-shots-given/articleshow/111821296.cms,"WHO defines zero-dose children as those who lack access to or are never reached by routine immunisation services. They are operationally measured as those who did not receive their first dose of the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus) vaccine. It is mainly used to communicate about immunisation gaps and to push for concerted efforts to bridge them.It is calculated as the difference between estimated surviving infants and the estimated number of children who received the first dose of DPT.Not necessarily. Since zero dose means those babies who did not receive the first dose of DPT - which in India is given at six weeks - it's possible that most zero-dose children have got most or all vaccines that are given at birth. The latest National Family Health Survey (2019-21) indicates that 88.6% births are institutional or those happening in a health facility. However, the proportion of children less than two years of age who received the birth dose of the BCG vaccine against TB is 95%. This indicates that even children who were not born at a health facility were accessing immunisation services . According to the latest UN estimate, there were 1.6 million zero-dose children in India in 2023, up from 1.1 million in 2022. With an estimated 23 million births every year, it would mean that 6.9% of surviving infants in 2023 were zero-dose children.Vaccines given at or soon after birth include BCG (given at birth or as early as possible till one year of age), Hepatitis B vaccine (given at birth or as early as possible within 24 hours), and oral polio vaccine (OPV; at birth or as early as possible within the first 15 days). At six weeks, the baby gets a single dose fractional inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), another dose of OPV (oral rotavirus vaccine), first of two doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and first of three doses of pentavalent vaccine, which is a combination of diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Hepatitis B and Haemophilus Influenzae type B (Hib) vaccines. Hence, if a baby has missed the first dose of DPT, it is assumed that they have likely missed all the others to be given at six weeks. In WHO/UN estimates, not receiving the first dose of DPT-containing vaccine is understood to signal a lack of access to routine immunisation as a whole, which might not be the case.A study supported by the Gates Foundation published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in Feb 2023 looked at zero-dose immunisation over 29 years (from 1993 to 2021; see chart) using anonymised data from all five rounds of India's National Family Health Survey (NFHS). It found that the proportion of zero-dose babies decreased from an overall 33.4% to 6.6% between 1993 and 2021.In absolute numbers, there was a huge fall in the number of zero-dose children in 10 years from 2006 to 2016. From about 85 lakh zero-dose children in 2006, it fell to just over 16 lakh by 2016. However, the annual relative decrease was highest in the five-year period between 2016 and 2021 at 7.4% per year. This was after the launch in 2014 of Mission Indradhanush, which aimed to cover all unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children. After the setback that the immunisation programme suffered during Covid, when the number of zero-dose children went up to 27 lakh, India managed to bring it down to 11 lakh in 2022 according to Unicef estimates. However, in 2023 that number has gone up to 16 lakh, according to Unicef.","WHO defines zero-dose children as those who lack access to or are never reached by routine immunisation services.
