"In global election season, AI avatars & deepfakes in the fray",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-global-election-season-ai-avatars-deepfakes-in-the-fray/articleshow/110131731.cms,"First major ethical test

Boosting transparency

Much like it took Imran Khan to win a Cricket World Cup for Pakistan, it took this allrounder-politician to sensitise the world on how AI could influence elections. Imprisoned by Pakistani govt, he was not allowed to physically campaign across the country in the general elections in early 2024. However, much to the delight of his supporters and angst for the opposition, Khan started to appear across the country, addressing rallies, exhorting voters and declaiming against the govt.The election resulted in massive wins for independent candidates backed by him, turning the electoral results on their head. The twist in the tale: while Khan was firmly confined behind bars, it was his AI avatar which was roaming the country, canvassing for the candidates!2024 is the year of democracy around the world, with elections in India, US, Indonesia and many other countries. It also promises to be the year when AI will experience its first major ethical test – on whether AI, including the deepfakes it helps generate, can help democracy or help subvert it. While deepfakes existed before GenAI, products like Sora and Stable Diffusion have democratised the production of deepfakes, making them easier, faster and cheaper to make at scale.We are also at peak social media , with TikTok, WhatsApp and the like making global distribution of deepfakes a piece of cake. Case in point – Bangladesh, where an opposition leader was shown to be lax about his support for Palestinians – a disastrous position to take in the country. A fake voice of Biden urged people not to vote in the US primaries.Deepfakes, born of an AI technology called generative adversarial networks (GANs) are not new; since 2013 they have been overwhelmingly abused for revenge and celebrity porn. However, of late, the world has discovered a new use case: subverting democracy. In India, we have already seen instances of this happening in the ongoing elections – fake videos of the home minister, deceased politicians rising from their graves, Bollywood stars ‘criticising’ the prime minister.Many elections are fought on emotive grounds, and such fake discourses and narratives can heavily influence voting. While authorities are alive to this threat and have banned the same, I believe that we need much stronger legal remedies, a crackdown on social media spreading these, and a well-articulated educational campaign for the electorate to detect what is genuine and what is fake.There is a silver lining to this worrisome cloud, however, with AI also having the promise to boost transparency, inclusivity, and efficiency in polls. AI can monitor and analyse data real-time, identifying irregularities indicating fraudulent activity. AI can improve the security of electronic voting systems, and threat detection algorithms can identify and thwart potential cyber threats . GenAI can help educate and sensitise voters through hyper-personalised and hyper-local content on candidates and manifestoes in their local dialect at scale with much lower costs, thus empowering even the less moneyed candidates.AI as a technology is twofaced: it has huge promise, but also immense destructive power. We need to take the good and minimise the bad for humans and our democracy to thrive in the upcoming age of AI. Jaspreet Bindra has worked at Microsoft, Tata Group, and Mahindra Group. He is an AI expert and adviser, and recently did a Masters in AI & Ethics from Cambridge University","2024 is the year of democracy around the world, with elections in India, US, Indonesia and many other countries.

Hockey dribbles through poll rhetoric in Sundargarh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hockey-dribbles-through-poll-rhetoric-in-sundargarh/articleshow/110131379.cms,"It’s peak time but Sundargarh in western Odisha seems unaffected by the intense political atmosphere gripping the state. Unlike politicians trying to checkmate each other with their election campaign rhetoric, teenagers in this tribal district are busy dribbling the ball past their opponents using crude, handcrafted hockey sticks to make a mark in the sport.“We have to play for some time before the sun becomes harsher,” says Johan Tirkey, an 18-year-old school dropout of Sadhumunda village in Kutra block.As the region prepares to vote on May 20, candidates are leveraging the sport’s popularity to connect with the electorate, often prioritising it over other pressing matters such as rising prices, healthcare access, educational opportunities, and job creation.Known as the nursery of Indian hockey, Sundargarh has produced numerous talented players who have represented the nation in both men’s and women’s teams.BJD’s key poll strategist and star campaigner V K Pandian, while canvassing in Sundargarh, spoke about Naveen Patnaik’s commitment to hockey, besides tribal arts, culture and traditions. BJD has been showcasing the holding of two consecutive men’s hockey World Cups — in Bhubaneswar (2018) and Bhubaneswar and Rourkela (2023) — as success stories. The Birsa Munda Stadium in Rourkela, which is part of Sundargarh Lok Sabha constituency, is being projected as among the world’s best.The political scene has been charged up due to the candidacy of Dilip Tirkey, Hockey India president and former Indian captain. He is running for Lok Sabha as a BJD nominee. BJP has strategically aligned its campaign with Prabodh Tirkey, another former Indian hockey captain who is supporting Jual Oram, a former Union minister and candidate of the saffron party. Prabodh’s involvement in BJP’s campaign comes after his bitter departure from Congress. He was selected as a Congress candidate for Talsara Vidhan Sabha, but was dropped later. Feeling slighted, Prabodh joined BJP.Candidates vying for votes in this hockey heartland focus their promises on improving facilities and opportunities for the sport, recognising its importance to the community. Jual, a five-time MP from Sundargarh, says hockey infrastructure in the region got a massive boost because of District Mineral Foundation (DMF) funds, thanks to the Modi govt’s initiative of amending the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act in 2015. It ensured massive fund inflow into minesbearing districts to spend for welfare in catchment areas. Sundargarh district has got more than Rs 6,400 crore DMF funds. DMF money helped build a world-class hockey stadium at Rourkela and astro-turfs across the district in the last five years, he said, adding, “people deeply appreciate the same and have faith that the infrastructure will improve further in Modi’s third term as PM”.Sundargarh’s passion for hockey is evi dent in the way the sport shapes the region’s identity and aspirations. Dilip says people of Sundargarh have been expressing their joy and satisfaction with the world-class hockey facilities provided by the Naveen Patnaik-led BJD govt. “As a candidate, wherever I am going to campaign in the constituency, I can see sports lovers’ happiness because of the world-class facilities,” he adds.He further says, “Naveen babu has done a lot for the development of hockey in Sundargarh, which includes 16 hockey training centres and the world-class stadium at Rourkela. The chief minister gave Sundargarh its cherished identity by organising the World Cup Hockey.”Dilip had lost to Jual in 2014 and had not contested in 2019 when BJD had fielded Sunita Biswal, daughter of former Congress CM Hemananda Biswal.Prabodh, who has been campaigning for BJP, says though hockey training centres have come up, many former players from Sundargarh district, including Olympians, were not hired as coaches. Instead, coaches from outside Odisha have been employed, which is disheartening for the district’s wellknown former players and sends out a wrong message. “People are not happy with the BJD govt because the work for hockey does not involve the entire community of hockey lovers and players,” he adds.Some people scrutinise govt work on other aspects, too. Francis Tirkey, a 50-year-old man of Saunamara village in Balisankara block, which happens to be the native place of Dilip, besides another Indian hockey player Amit Rohidas, says, “We are facing difficulty in getting water for cultivation, which is very much essential. Though initiatives on hockey are good for the future of children, the state govt should also pay attention to other issues,” he adds.The contest in Sundargarh, having 15.8 lakh voters, this time is largely between Jual and Dilip though eight candidates are in the fray. Congress has fielded former MLA Janardan Dehury. The constituency reserved for tribals has 8 lakh tribal voters, 2.9 lakh Christians and 75,000 Muslim voters.","Known as the nursery of Indian hockey, Sundargarh has produced numerous talented players who have represented the nation in both men's and women's teams.

cricketer...

Read on…

This is your first coaching stint in the IPL. How difficult is it to be a coach these days, especially in such high-profile franchises?

Coaching staff in teams have ballooned since your playing days…

In franchise cricket, the money rolls in fast. Superstars are made very easily. Do you think ego then becomes a big issue for players?

There is a perception players’ heads get turned by so much money floating around, with so many brands chasing you…

If we look at the greatest cricket teams of the past, there’s always an inherently strong sense of team bonding. How do you create that in a franchise environment, with so many different players from all over?

How does Australia invariably rise to the occasion in World Cups?

How do you handle the fear of failure?

How important is it to take care of the mental health of players who are always such pressure?

What impact will this season’s IPL have on the upcoming World Cup? Teams are scoring heavily this season…

Who are your favourites for the T20 WC?

The Indian coach’s position is up for grabs. Will you apply?

What is it like to face a fast bowler, say like Shoaib Akhtar?

Do you miss the Pakistan team of the past – tough and competitive?

Recently in the eye of what he termed “a storm in an espresso cup,” Justin Langer, head coach of the LSG, seemed in awe of cricket’s evolution from a one-coach-one-physio endeavour in his early playing days to the heaving 90-man entourages of the IPL today.Sitting back in his chair at a plush city hotel and gesticulating with his eyes and hands while speaking, Langer’s train of thought veered from past to present and onward to the future.The one-time foot soldier of the formidable Australian team of the 1990s is one of the sharpest cricketing brains around, and he was excitedly pouring his thoughts out on the game. The TOI Sports team just happened to be present.When you’re a player, you have control. You take absolute responsibility for your performance. The only thing that's out of your control is selection, or what the media writes or what people think of you. You focus only on watching the ball. If you make runs, the only currency of value is runs. If you make runs, you get selected. If you get selected, you get a contract.I went straight from playing to coaching – as an assistant coach, which is the best coach job in the world. You work about two hours a day, everyone's your best friend, and you’ve got no accountability. Then you become head coach, oh man, then you work about 16 hours a day. No one likes you. And you’ve got 100% accountability!I took a break from coaching for two and a half years for the first time in my life (after the Australia stint). I had do my writing, my speaking, I did my board roles. I had complete control. It's like being a batsman, again, there's freedom in that.And then I came back into coaching. And you realise again that you've got your hands tied. In football, the coach has control over the match. Whereas in cricket, the captain does everything on the field, right? So, you manage your people, you make them feel happy, you make them ready to play, you help them with peak performance, you help the superstar and the kid who's just coming in.You’ve to mentor them and coach them differently. But you must understand they are all different people – some introverts, some extroverts. You have got to learn how to manage. So as head coach, you are purely a man manager. You have to manage them well so that they perform on the field. And that's tough.When I started playing with the Australian cricket team, Bob Simpson was the coach. When I started playing professional cricket, we used to train on a Wednesday afternoon, we all had full-time jobs. We had one coach who was part time, and I think we had a physio, and you only got paid if you made the first 11.Now there are coaches everywhere. Things have changed. It’s a 12-month business. We have three different formats of the game which guys play all year round. Now they play in different franchises, they play international cricket. Yes, times have changed. But there's still a role for an assignment, right? We call it professionalism. We try to look after people well.Let’s face it. There wasn't an IPL when Ian Chappell was around. There were no franchises. There were no broadcast rights. If we expect the players to be high-performing individuals, then they expect high-performing services and that comes in the form of coaches and physiotherapists and doctors and people who throw balls all day.I worked full time in a bank, or in a stock broking firm until I was 28 years old. Then Middlesex rang me and asked if I wanted to go and play. I played three years at Middlesex and then I became a full-time cricketer.In the Australian team I played in, we had Matthew Hayden, Shane Warne, Glen McGrath, Ricky Ponting. They were superstar players because of their performance, not because of how much money they made. One of the challenges we have today is that we still judge players on the performance, not on how much money they get paid.There's so much money in the game. But you still have to be a high performer. MS Dhoni is MS Dhoni not because he's made a lot of money.My point is that Dhoni, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul are incredibly wealthy, but they are superstars because of the way they perform. Dhoni won a World Cup and was one of the greatest finishers of the game. People will never forget those performances.In India, with 1.4 billion cricket-loving people, you could pick five teams which can beat most countries. There's so much talent. I’m blown away. So my point is, I also see how much pressure these young players are under because I they all want to be a Dhoni, they all want to be a Virat Kohli or Rahul or Rohit. But they’ve got a long journey to get to that point. The only way they can survive here is by performing and performing and performing.When I went to the IPL mini-auction, I saw several players going unsold. There are lot more heartbreaks than success. For the ones who make it, there is a lot of money in the game. That’s just the joys of the money from broadcast rights. But the ones who make it must be very good cricketers. They're the cream rising to the top.Yeah, they might be getting the brands, and they might be doing the rounds of social media. But if they don't perform, they get destroyed. They either get dropped or get destroyed by social media. So, the pressure, in some way, balances it all out.When I played my third Test, the great Allan Border gave me some amazing advice. I still give it to the players today. He was wearing expensive, branded shoes and I asked him if he could help me get a shoe sponsorship. He told me, you make all the runs in the world, you become the best batsman and you will get all the shoes, or the sunglasses or the fame or the money you could ever imagine. Focus on that. Nothing's changed.Shane Warne turned up for the first session with Bob Simpson – peroxide hair, earring, a mobile phone in one hand and a packet of cigarettes in the other. These guys were like, who’s this young upstart? But he was real. And he performed so well he was great. All these kids now say Shane loved fast cars, loved women, loved smoking cigarettes. But he was brilliant. He made a lot of mistakes off the field, but he was a great performer. We miss him.It’s a challenge when you're here only for 10 weeks. This is why I really admire Chennai. They have a solid foundation, the same Stephen Fleming’s (head coach) been there since Day One, I think. I respect that. They've won five times. Let's face it, Lucknow Super Giants is a very young franchise. It's still a work in progress.I imagine what we're all striving for is when players come to their franchise, it's like coming home.Tom Moody told me IPL is like the Olympics, you've never seen anything like it.From my experience of four years with the Australian team, I can say building an international team it is exhausting. It is tough. If you don't perform, the whole country lets you know about it. And that is exhausting, right?The hardest thing about being head coach in Australia is selection. If you a player from one state, the other state complains. International cricket is not like franchise cricket.We only play six months of the year, but you have the full pre-season. You build up the family, you build up the culture and you build up all these inputs over 12 months. It is very tiring.When you play cricket for Australia, the expectation is you're going to win because we win. That might sound very simplistic, but this is the Aussie mindset.In IPL, there is so much pressure to win. Then there's pressure just to be in the team. When we started winning, then suddenly there was this load of expectations. You could feel the pressure building.In contrast, we Australians just go with the flow, stay relaxed. It's about having fun. And they know they've got so much talent on the park. They just go about their business. They are used to winning. They are used to doing it their way. It is like, we don't take it too seriously, even though we take it very seriously. It's almost like a paradox. That's the secret.When you walk into the Australian dressing room, it’s like being in a nightclub 24/7, I'm not joking. It was so much fun. We had so much respect for each other, and it was so much fun. And that's the difference.If the pressure builds, you’ll never perform at your best. And I know that as a player. The harder you try, the worse it gets. And in big games, if things tighten up, you're dead. But if you just stay relaxed…. my heroes were the West Indies, the early West Indies team I watched while growing up. Like Viv Richards, they just seemed so chilled out all the time. They knew they were talented.I'm sure individuals think about the fear of failure. I lived with it until I was 28 years old. And it is paralysing, the fear of failure. It can drive you, but living in a world of fear of failure is a dangerous world.We are human beings. I remember seeing Steve Waugh suffer that. He was a run machine but had got a duck. He was going through a small run of failures. I remember he got out just before stumps in Johannesburg and got in the bus after that — he had his collar up, had his cap down and wore sunglasses. I went and sat with him. I said, ‘How’re you feeling, captain?’ He goes, ‘Pretty rubbish.’ So, even the greats have doubts and insecurities. That's being human, right?There is more acceptance now. I respected Glenn Maxwell for coming out a couple of years ago and say he had mental-health issues. I see guys like Will Pucovski . He is a supreme talent, but he's got issues. He suffered from concussion. Yeah, so the concussion is one thing, but that is also linked with some mental-health issues.We are human, we all are on a spectrum of mental health. And it’s just about dealing with that. It is about man management, knowing that everyone has to look after their mental health every single day of their lives. That's one thing about being a coach, you got to keep observing all the time. And you can see it in their body language, you can see it in the way they perform, you can see about in their actions, you can see it in all these things.As the head coach, you got to be like a father, like a school teacher, be a psychologist, be a mentor. All these things rolled up in one. In IPL, the team entourage comprises 90 people. You have to deal with 50 people who are all trying to do the same thing. And they're all on their own journeys in life to get to winning. That is a huge challenge.I'm fascinated by the impact-player rule. That's had an effect. I'm on the MCC world cricket committee and one important thing we talk about is the cricket pitches. You want Test cricket to survive, get the pitches right.Like it’s a contest between bat and ball in Australia. The ball swings around and bounces. Awesome. You come to India and the ball spins, contest between bat and ball. You can't leave the screen because the batsman could get out any ball. It is addictive.At the upcoming World Cup, it will all depend on what the pitches are like. I can't imagine that the wickets in the West Indies are going to be that flat, maybe Barbados. I've got no idea what's going to happen in America because they're drop-in pitches.My belief has always been that we should never forget about the defensive side of T20 cricket . You look at the teams doing really well in this in this IPL, like KKR and Rajasthan Royals. They have good bowlers and so are performing well. Never forget the defensive side of the game. LSG has suffered because a lot of our bowlers dropped out before the league began.So, when it comes to the World Cup, often the teams with the best bowling attacks will have the best chance to win.If you if you look at the trend of World Cups, it's often the same group of teams on paper. There's a lot of very good teams. India will obviously be strong. Australia on paper look scarily strong. New Zealand always are the underdogs. They love playing for their country, so they are strong. It is tough to predict at the start of the season who's going to win. There might be some injuries. It is impossible to predict.(After a laugh and a long pause) Well, I am curious. I've never ever thought about it. I have deep respect for any international coach because I understand the pressure, but coaching the Indian team would be an extraordinary role. From what I've seen with the amount of talent I've seen in this country, it would be fascinating.If you are facing fast bowlers, you’ve got to have physical courage. The second thing is, if you see the ball come out of the bowler’s hand, it's like slow motion. All I tried to do was getting my stance right and have proper balance. If you can see the ball released out of the bowler’s fingers, then everything will be okay. It’s then very hard to get out.You see the ball release because you have hit so many cricket balls. It doesn't matter how quick it is. But if your stance is just a little bit out and you start falling across or you're moving at release of the ball, it is like living in a fast-forward movie cartoon. And that's when you get hit on the body and then it's not fun.Yeah, just as we miss a competitive West Indies team. I grew up watching the great West Indies team. You want to see them strong, and you want to see all the other countries strong. We talk about this in the MCC world cricket committee meeting regularly. How do we keep sustaining the health of the other countries? It’s important to have West Indies strong, as important to keep Pakistan strong and as important to keep New Zealand and Sri Lanka strong because that is important for the health of world cricket.",LSG head coach Justin Langer talks about the changing dynamics of the game. Langer also discusses the all-encompassing role of the modern coach. He also discusses how real stardom is still an elusive quest for the typical cricket player.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110099050,imgsize-44010,width-400,resizemode-4/110099050.jpg"

People have praised my cooking. But will Modi ji accept my food? Will he trust me? I will cook whatever he loves.""The TMC supremo had said, ""I love both vegetarian foods like Dhokla and non-veg foods like macher jhol (fish curry).

"After finding faith, Tamil Sikh tests Punjab poll waters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/after-finding-faith-tamil-sikh-tests-punjab-poll-waters/articleshow/110127356.cms,"Periyar, Kanshi Ram icons of our party: Tamil Sikh in poll fray from Hoshiarpur

CHENNAI/JALANDHAR: In his yellow turban and long grey beard, Jeevan Singh Malla looks the part.He's just had a series of small, informal meetings with community leaders in Punjab 's Hoshiarpur, seeking their support for his electoral debut as a candidate for the Lok Sabha seat. ""I have the backing of Dalit activists, too,"" Malla says, clasping his hands.It's only when the words roll out of his mouth with a curious accent that you realise he may be the odd one out in the roster of Sikh candidates for Punjab's 13 Lok Sabha seats.Malla is a Tamil-origin Sikh who heads Bahujan Dravida Party, which owes its origins as much to his choice of faith as to the cause of fighting caste discrimination .The purpose of my contesting a seat in Punjab goes beyond immediate poll results. The messaging is both political & cultural. Egalitarianism was Guru Nanak’s fundamental principle, and we also want to spread that,” he says.Malla loosely translates his party’s motto, Begumpura Khalsa Raj, as “Nanak’s freedom raj without sorrow”.The 51-year-old, who was always fascinated by tenets of Sikhism, was at Singhuborder along with a few others from his native state in 2021 to show solidarity with the protesting farmers.What was meant to be a march against farm laws turned out to be an exploration of what he calls Sikh fortitude. He saw in farmers’ steadfastness an extraordinary sense of purpose strengthened by their faith. He knew he must belong.Three years later, Jeevan Kumar is officially Jeevan Singh Malla. He now recites the Gurbani. He has converted his house at Korampallam into “School of Miri Piri” (School of Politics and Culture), where Tamil Sikhs occasionally meet for discourse and prayers. His BDP has fielded Tamil Sikhs in seven LS seats in Tamil Nadu and 40 others in seats across other states. The law graduate had first visited a gurdwara in Punjab in 2019 to become a Sikh, only to be told to return in six months. “I was asked to grow a beard,” he recounts with amusement. Today, Tamil Nadu has about 25 practicing Tamil Sikhs and many others who are learning about the faith. On why he chose Hoshiarpur, Malla says, “Bahujan Samaj Party founder Kanshi Ram contested the seat and became an MP from there in 1996. He remains a source of motivation for us. Periyar and Kanshi Ram are icons of our party.”BDP’s state president, Tirath Singh, who joined Kanshi Ram’s movement in 1981 and was closely associated with BSP until 2003, has been Malla’s constant companion on his political journey through Punjab. Tamil Sikhs pray at gurdwaras in Chennai and Rameswaram. Malla’s organisation, Tamil Sikhs Brotherhood and Education Foundation, plans to build a gurdwara in Thoothukudi, formerly Tuticorin. “Before that, we want to spread the message of the Gurus on eradicating caste from society,” says the lawyer. Discrimination in Tamil Nadu’s caste cauldron is one of the reasons for many being drawn to Sikhism. SCs like Pallar and Vannar bear the brunt of caste bias, sometimes facing harsh treatment from even their own. “Being a Sikh, I am not identified by caste anymore,” says Malla.",Malla is a Tamil-origin Sikh who heads Bahujan Dravida Party.

NEW DELHI: In an unusually frank reaction, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said that many nations in the West want to ""influence India because many of these countries feel that they have influenced this world for the last 70-80 years"".Speaking at an event organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the EAM said there are western countries that ""actually feel that they influenced the world for the last 200 years, how do you expect someone who's been in that position to give up those old habits so easily?""The minister was responding to a question on allegations made against India by Canada and the US of poll interference, and conducting operations on foreign soil.Jaishankar said these countries ""are seeing an India which is not in a sense compliant with their image of how India should be"".""Western media in some cases have openly endorsed candidates and political parties, they don't hide their preference ... they will reputationally damage you, somebody will bring out an index and put you down in that ... they want a certain class of people really to rule India. And I think they are disturbed when the Indian population feels otherwise,"" he said.""Countries which have to go to court to decide the result of their election are giving us lectures about how to conduct the election,"" the minister added, to a round of applause. Jaishankar was making a veiled reference to the ongoing legal battle by Donald Trump to overturn the 2020 election results, which he lost to Joe Biden.The EAM also spoke about the prevailing tense situation in PoK where there has been sporadic violence and civil unrest.""Today, there are certain ferments happening in PoK ... the analysis of it is very complex but definitely I have no doubt in my own mind that someone living in PoK is comparing their situation with someone living in J&K and saying how people there are progressing nowadays. They know the sense of being under occupation or being discriminated badly...it (PoK) has always been India and it will always be India,"" he said.The minister added that till Article 370 was invoked, there wasn't much discussion about PoK.""In 1990's, some pressure was put on us by Western countries and then at that time Parliament unanimously passed a resolution on PoK, after public interest in this country receded ... When we actually moved on Article 370 and finally put an end to what was a temporary provision of the Constitution, which should never have continued for that long and which was in a way fueling the separatism, violence and terrorism,"" said Jaishankar.On the topic of China and rising border tensions, Jaishankar said the deployment of forces at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China is ""abnormal"" and the security of the country should not be disregarded.""After 1962, Rajiv Gandhi went to China in 1988 in many ways that were the key step towards normalising the ties (with China) ... there was a clear understanding that we will discuss our boundary differences but we will maintain peace and tranquillity on the border. And the rest of the relationship will carry on,"" the minister said.Since then, it has been the basis of the relationship with China, he said.""What changed now is what happened in 2020. In 2020, the Chinese, in violation of multiple agreements, brought a large number of forces to our border and they did it at the time when we were under COVID lockdown,"" he said.Jaishankar said ""India responded by counter deployment of forces"" and for four years now, forces have been deployed ahead of the normal base positions at Galwan.""This is a very abnormal deployment along the LAC. Given the tension between the two countries...

, my image was deliberately tarnished: PM Modi

VARANASI: Saying he had resolved not to get drawn into ""Hindu-Mussalman"" politics, PM Modi declared Tuesday after filing his nomination for UP's Varanasi Lok Sabha seat that the day he resorted to such methods, ""us din main sarvyajanik jeevan me rehne yogya nahin rahunga (I won't be fit for public life)"". The statement was part of PM's clarification in an interview with Network 18 that he never meant Muslims while talking about ""infiltrators"" and ""those with more children"" in his campaign speeches.""I am shocked. Who told you that whenever one talks of people with more children, the inference is they are Muslims? Why are you so unjust towards Muslims?"" Modi said. ""Main 'Hindu-Mussalman' nahin karunga; yeh mera sankalp hai (I won't play 'Hindu-Muslim' card; that's my vow).""The PM said having more children than families can afford to feed, clothe and educate was a common problem among the country's poor, irrespective of faith.He peppered the interview with instances of how living among Muslim families in his neighbourhood gave him insights into their customs and practices. “Eid would be celebrated in our house, too, just as other festivals were. There would be no cooking that day as food would come from our Muslim neighbours. On Muharram, if we had to go out, I knew that we would have to pass under the tajiya. I grew up in that society. I have so many friends who are Muslims... Just that I don’t like to advertise this aspect.”Asked whether he would acknowledge being unable to break the perception that “Modi doesn't belong to Muslims”, the PM said, “This issue is not about Muslims. “Irrespective of how supportive individual Muslims are of Modi, there is a wave of thought that dictates to them, ‘do this, do that’.

After 2002, after Godhra, my image was deliberately tarnished.”On whether he was sure Muslims would still vote for him, Modi said, “The people of the country will vote for me.”Earlier in the day, flanked by a VIP congregation that included Union ministers, CMs of three NDA-governed states, ex-CMs and allies, the PM filed his nomination for a third consecutive term as MP from Varanasi at the auspicious ‘Pushya Nakshatra’ muhurat decided by Kashi scholars. The 26-strong group assembled at the collectorate included home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri, UP CM Yogi Adityanath and BJP chief JP Nadda.The alliance partners from UP included Apna Dal (Sonelal) president Anupriya Patel, SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, Nishad Party chief Sanjay Nishad, and RLD president Jayant Chaudhary. Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde, Union minister Ramdas Athawale, and NCP’s Praful Patel were also present.From Bihar, LJP’s Chirag Paswan and Pashupati Paswan, ex-CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and Rashtriya Lok Morcha chief Upendra Kushwaha landed in Varanasi to be by the PM’s side. Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma, Assam minister Atul Bora, and Pramod Boro of the Bodoland Territorial Council were there, too, along with former Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu, Jan Sena chief and actor Pawan Kalyan. GK Vasan and Anbumani Ramadoss from Tamil Nadu, and Thushar Vellappally from Kerala completed the line-up. Modi wrote a series of posts on his official X handle later, describing his bond with the millennia-old city of Kashi. “My relationship with my Kashi is amazing, integral and unmatched… It cannot be expressed in words,” he said. “Filed my nomination papers as a candidate for the Varanasi LS seat. It is an honour to serve the people of this historical seat. With the blessings of the people, there have been remarkable achievements over the last decade. This pace of work will get even faster in the times to come.”Before filing his papers, the PM visited Dashaswamedh Ghat for Ganga aarti on the occasion of Ganga Saptami and boarded the MV Vivekanand Ro-Ro to reach Namo Ghat. He also visited the Kaal Bhairav temple by road.","PM said he never meant Muslims while talking about ""infiltrators"" and ""those with more children"" in his campaign speeches.

Lok Sabha polls: Nearly a quarter of BJP candidates are defectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-polls-nearly-a-quarter-of-bjp-candidates-are-defectors/articleshow/110128252.cms,"Leaders who have changed allegiances being given a ticket to contest the elections is nothing new in Indian politics , but the scale at which this has happened with BJP’s list for Lok Sabha polls is unusual. Almost a quarter of the list, or 106 of the 435, consists of those who have switched to the saffron party at some point in the last 10 years. Of them, 90 joined BJP in the last five years.The highest proportion of such candidates is in Andhra Pradesh, where BJP has put up six candidates. All but one of them has come from another party between 2019 and now. That includes switches not only from Congress and YSRCP, but ironically even from its current ally, TDP.In neighbouring Telangana, nearly two-thirds of the BJP’s 17 candidates are imports from other parties, mainly BRS but also Congress. Six of the 11 such candidates have joined BJP in the run-up to these elections.While Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are states where BJP has had at best a limited presence in the past, even in Haryana, where it has been helping the state govt for a decade, six of its 10 candidates are those who have switched sides from 2014 onwards. Two of them — Naveen Jindal and Ashok Tanwar — joined in the run-up to Lok Sabha polls.Next door, in Punjab over half the party’s 13 candidates have been drawn from those who were in other parties till not too long back. Some of them were in Congress but quit along with Amarinder Singh and became part of BJP when he merged his fledgling outfit with the saffron party.Jharkhand is similar to Punjab with seven of the 13 having been members of other parties till a decade or less back. In this case, the imports are from JMM, Congress and the erstwhile Jharkhand Vikas Morcha, the most high-profile of them being Sita Soren, sister-in-law of the state’s former chief minister, Hemant Soren.Perhaps the most surprising among the states with a high proportion of candidates who have sitched sides is Uttar Pradesh, where BJP has been dominant in elections over the last decade, be it parliamentary polls or state assembly. Of the 74 BJP candidates here (not including one ally contesting on the party’s symbol), 23 have joined BJP sometime between 2014 and now. That’s 31% of the party’s candidates in the state.A high proportion of such candidates in Odisha (29%) and Tamil Nadu (26%) is not very surprising, given that these are not traditional strongholds of BJP. A quarter of the candidates in Maharashtra being those who’ve switched sides is arguably symptomatic of the considerable churn that the state’s politics has witnessed, particularly over the last five years.West Bengal has a similar proportion of such candidates as Maharashtra, but all other states have lower proportions. Yet, even the ultimate BJP stronghold, Gujarat, has two candidates who have moved to the party since 2014.This analysis excludes allies contesting on BJP tickets. It does include five cases of what might be termed “gharwapsi” — BJP members who had moved to other parties but have since come homing back to where they started from. The five include Jagdish Shettar in Karnataka, Udayanraje Bhonsale in Maharashtra and Sakshi Maharaj in Uttar Pradesh.","Almost a quarter of the list consists of those who have switched to the saffron party at some point in the last 10 years.

NEW DELHI: ED on Tuesday told Delhi HC that AAP would be made a co-accused in the next prosecution complaint that the agency would file in Delhi excise policy case . ED's disclosure came while opposing the bail plea of Delhi's ex-deputy CM Manish Sisodia in a money laundering case related to the larger matter.AAP said, ""The intention behind the fake probe is to frame AAP, arrest its top leaders and crush the party."" The case was built on statements of accused-turned-approvers, all of whom had links to BJP , it said.Last year, Supreme Court had touched upon the issue of making AAP an accused in the case and asked ED why the political party was not named if the porbe agency's claim is to be believed that it benefited from the alleged kickbacks in the liquor policy case. ""A political party is said to be the beneficiary of this, but it is neither an accused nor impleaded in the case. How do you answer that?"" SC had then remarked, but clarified a day later that its query was ""not to implicate any political party"" but ""just a legal question"" aimed at the agency.AAP national chief and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has already argued in his petition pending before the HC that a political party is not covered under the anti-money laundering law. However HC, while upholding Kejriwal's arrest in the case, had noted that Section 70 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which deals with companies, is attracted in the case, after ED reiterated that AAP is similar to a company and Kejriwal its director, while fixing liability for the alleged scam.During the hearing on Tuesday, ED claimed that there were concerted efforts by accused persons to delay the process of framing of charges in the case even as CBI also opposed Sisodia's bail plea in the corruption case and blamed him for the delay. It expressed apprehension that Sisodia might tamper with evidence if released.However, Sisodia's legal team highlighted that he is entitled to bail and pointed out that the ED and the CBI are still arresting people in the money laundering and corruption case, so there is no question of early conclusion of the trial.Senior advocate Mohit Mathur, representing Sisodia, said the trial court judge, while dismissing the bail plea, has not shown how the AAP leader has contributed to the delay. ""I had filed an application to physically meet my wife. Thereafter, I moved an application to sign a cheque. How does it delay the trial? How have I contributed to the delay in the proceedings? The trial court has said that out of 38 applications, 13 were filed by Sisodia. But the court has not said how my application contributed to the delay,"" he countered the ED's allegation. The former CM also sought parity on the ground that other accused in the case have got bail. ""Post dismissal of my earlier bail, three accused have gotten some relief from the Supreme Court. Benoy Babu in ED case. Sanjay Singh, again in ED case and Arvind Kejriwal most recently. There is no threat as far as my running away is concerned. I (Sisodia) have been in custody for 14.5 months,"" he argued.Reacting to the ED's submission in court that it was going to make AAP an accused in the excise policy case, the party in a statement said the probe agency was functioning like a political wing of the BJP.Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma after hearing the arguments reserved it for orders. AAP claimed that even after two years of investigation and over 500 raids, not a single rupee or a piece of evidence had so far been recovered from any of the AAP functionaries. ""If at all there is any money trail recovered so far in the alleged Delhi liquor scam, it is the Rs 60 Crore that the kingpin of the scam, Sharath Reddy, has given to BJP (through electoral bonds). Had ED been doing an impartial investigation, it would have immediately arrested BJP President JP Nadda and made the party the prime accused in the scam. But unfortunately, it is acting as a political wing and a mouthpiece of the BJP,"" AAP said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that it was AAP's standard practice to accuse the investigating agencies of being political in case of any adverse development against them. ""Instead of giving media reactions, AAP should fight the allegations in the courtroom where their leaders' pleas fail repeatedly,"" Kapoor said.",ED says AAP will be co-accused in next prosecution complaint in Delhi excise policy case. ED's disclosure came while opposing the bail plea of Delhi's ex- deputy CM Manish Sisodia in a money laundering case related to the larger matter.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110127882,imgsize-1865988,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110127882.jpg"

Maharashtra deputy CM

Devendra Fadnavis

tells

TOI’s Clara Lewis

that Sena is trying to fill the deficit in Marathi votes with Muslim votes. Excerpts from the interview:

After Ajit Pawar

NCP

joined the BJP-led alliance there was anger among

supporters.

If you say justice for all, appeasement of none, then would BJP consider abolishing caste-based quota?

Are you disappointed that despite being given benefits the Muslims are voting en masse one way.

On seat-sharing, there is discontent amongst BJP workers especially in Thane.

It is perceived that there is sympathy for Uddhav and Sharad Pawar.

The

Marathi voter

is seen as being with Uddhav Thackeray. It will be a close contest on five seats in Mumbai.

The Muslim voter seems to favour the Shiv Sena

How do you view polarisation of Maratha and OBC votes?

You made allegations against certain people and now they are candidates.

What will be the post-election scenario?

What happens to you?

The Shiv Sena-BJP alliance is an emotional alliance while the alliance with NCP is a political one.If you consider the original NCP of Sharad Pawar, it has no ideology as such, it is a party of a regional satrap. We have no issue with their ideology, we have a problem with appeasement. Where it is being said the right on resources is of the Muslim we say that the first right is of the poor irrespective of caste and religion.Initially our voter was angry (with the NCP alliance) but eventually Ajit Pawar's conduct has ensured there is no contempt now. You will see this in the Baramati result from how the Khadakvasla voter, who is essentially a BJP voter, votes.It (abolition of caste for reservation) is not on any agenda. If caste is to be abolished, society will do it eventually. When reservation was first debated there was a proposal that we should give religion-based reservation, but unanimously the Constituent Assembly said the basis of reservation is social backwardness, economic, educational backwardness. So far as other religions were concerned it was debated that these religions claim that there is no caste, and there is no social discrimination if there is no caste system. So, it was unanimously resolved that there can be no reservation based on religion.There is some disappointment but in a way this is the last attempt of Congress and similar parties. If this fails, then Muslims will have no confidence in them. Till date by instilling fear in minorities they (Congress) have taken their votes. Attempts have been made to tell Dalits that the Constitution will be changed but Modi's credibility is very high.It is natural that any party would want more seats. We were hoping for 30 seats but got 28. We were insisting on Thane. But the CM said even if this seat is yours we have held it for seven elections. If I let go of Anand Dighe's seat it would demoralise my workers. He urged that we not insist on it.There may be sympathy among their cadre, but overall I see no sympathy. Pawar broke parties and homes. Their parties split because they wanted to pass on their legacy to their children. By making someone else a villain, no one becomes a hero. Ajit Pawar was made a villain as Pawar wanted to pass on his legacy to Supriya. Similarly, Eknath Shinde found the ground beneath his feet shifting as Aditya was being projected and Shinde's wings being clipped though he did all the organisational work.That the Marathi voter is only with the Shiv Sena is a myth. In the 2017 civic elections we won 82 wards against their 84. In 2014, we fought assembly polls separately and BJP got more seats than the Sena. In 2019 we fought as an alliance and Sena fought one seat more than us but got five seats less. I am also Marathi and so is Ashish Shelar. People have repeatedly voted for us. Modi's popularity is beyond caste and language.There is more appeasement being done by Sena than Congress. One can see more Muslims in Shiv Sena offices. At Thackeray rallies, Allah-ho-Akbar slogans are being given by those wearing Shiv Sena scarves. I think they are trying to fill the deficit in Marathi votes with Muslim votes.In a state like Maharashtra, it will disturb the social fabric. This has happened in 4-5 constituencies.It is the Shiv Sena which decided to give them candidature. As an alliance we will campaign for the candidate. After all, the fight is not about Yashwant Jadhav, Yamini Jadhav. We are fighting against the kingpin who ran the corporation.We are the big party, we will get the larger share of seats (for the assembly polls). Also our strike rate is good.The way I understand the party, the way I see things in Maharashtra, I will be here.","Devendra Fadnavis tells TOI's Clara Lewis that Sena is trying to fill deficit in Marathi votes with Muslim votes.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAMAmrita (25) never thought that she would find herself in a quandary at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport on May 8 after hospital authorities in Oman asked her to quickly take a flight to see her critically-ill husband one last time. Now, the woman from Karamana in Thiruvananthapuram is grappling with a tragedy due to the unexpected strike by Air India Express employees.The cancellation of flights stopped her emergency travel to Oman and her husband Nambi Rajesh (40), an IT project manager based in Muscat, succumbed to his illness on Monday. The undeclared strike by Air India Express employees last Wednesday left numerous passengers, including Amrita, stranded. She shared her plight with the media. Despite her desperate pleas to company representatives at the airport, no one came to her aid so that she could see her husband one last time.Amrita's mother, Chitra, recounted with teary eyes how her daughter begged them repeatedly, in vain. Chitra expressed her frustration and disappointment saying airline officials were unsympathetic. ""Because of their strike, my daughter could not see her husband. This is outrageous. We lost our sole breadwinner,"" she told TOI.Amrita is a BSc nursing student and mother of two children, aged five and three. The family is uncertain about their future in the wake of this tragedy. Chitra said they intend to take legal action against the airline and seek compensation for their loss.Earlier, Amrita's family had immediately booked tickets for her on an Air India Express flight on May 8. But flight cancellations thwarted her trip. Despite being notified of her scheduled departure on May 9, she was unable to travel due to the unavailability of flights on that day.Subsequently, she encountered difficulties in securing tickets on another flight as the ticket fare was not refunded. Rajesh's health deteriorated again on Monday and he died at the hospital.Chitra said Rajesh's mortal remains will be brought home on Wednesday. The family will decide on his last rites after Amrita's sister, who is pursuing medical education in Georgia, returns. ""The funeral may be held at the crematorium in Karamana day after tomorrow,"" she added.Meanwhile, the airline informed the family that ticket fare could be refunded. But the family made it clear that the airline is responsible for Amrita's current situation and they will file a case against the firm.","Amrita (25) never thought that she would find herself in a quandary at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport.

The US diplomat also said the joint Indo-US satellite NISAR , considered to be the world’s most expensive satellite, will also be launched by year-end.Garcetti said the Indian govt has also suggested the name of the astronaut who will fly to the ISS.He, however, did not reveal the name, telling a news channel that the “Indian government has indicated who that astronaut is. I’ll let them, you know, announce that at the proper time”. Nasa administrator Bill Nelson, during his visit to India last year, had also indicated about the US helping train and send an Indian astronaut to the ISS by the end of 2024. “The selection of the astronaut will be done bu Isro. Nasa won’t be a part of it. Details of the mission are being worked out by Isro,” Nelson had said.Since its first modules launched at the end of 1998, ISS has been orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 400 km. Five space agencies of the US, Russia, European countries, Canada and Japan have collaborated on the development and operations of the ISS, and astronauts from 18 countries have gone to the space station till now. It will be a big opportunity for an Indian astronaut to visit the ISS as the space station is going to be retired by 2030, when Nasa plans to crash it into the ocean.In a video post, Garcetti, who completed his one year as the US ambassador to India, said, “From the seabed to the stars, the US-India relationship is reaching new heights, including all the way to space where this past year we made huge strides in NISAR (NASA-ISRO SAR mission), the first satellite that Nasa and Isro are making together. It will blast off later this year so that you know, babies like Teigen (giving an example) will enjoy a future... and will be happy one day when we put him in space.”India and the US have been working on the development of the world’s most expensive earth imaging satellite NISAR since 2014.The total cost of the satellite project is $1.5 billion, which comes to around Rs 12,500 crore in Indian currency. NISAR will use its advanced radar imaging technology to map the elevation and movement of Earth’s land masses and ice sheets four to six times a month, at a resolution of 5-10 metres. The main aim of the satellite is to observe the most complex natural processes of the planet, including ecosystem disturbances, ice-sheet collapse, as well as earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.","An Indian astronaut is likely to reach the International Space Station (ISS) on an American mission this year, US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said on Monday.

Four hoardings and the BPCL petrol pump (on which the hoarding collapsed) are managed by the Railway Police Welfare Fund Association.Ghatkopar resident Salim Pathan told TOI that in Aug 2023, he submitted written complaints to BMC and GRP about the danger posed by illegal hoardings. GRP denied receiving a complaint. While BMC allows a hoarding size of maximum 40x40sqft, the collapsed hoarding measured 120x120sqft. ""But, BMC made no mention in its letter that the dimension was an issue,"" said a GRP officer.Sources in GRP said the hoardings were certified as ""structurally safe and stable"" by a structural consultant in April 2023. The hoarding that crashed had even made it to the record books for being the largest in Asia.RTI activist Anil Galgali said GRP was equally responsible for the tragedy, and police and the state govt must take action against errant officers. DG (railway police) Dr Pradnya Sarvade will be filing a report before the state about the incident. After Monday's crash, the District Disaster Management Authority wrote to GRP, asking them to immediately remove the other three hoardings in the area.The rule book does affix accountability. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare said if GRP has possession of the land, it would be state land and BMC permissions would be applicable. So, the civic body was right in issuing a notice to GRP to remove it. Sections 328 and 328A of the BMC Act deal with civic permissions for hoardings to exhibit advertisements on premises other than one's business premises. The conditions ""require NOCs from the landlord or cooperative housing society, from the police commissioner (traffic) in case of illuminated hoardings, from the civil aviation dept if the hoarding is in funnel area, the Mumbai heritage committee if in heritage buildings or precincts, from MCZMA if in CRZ areas, structural design and stability certificate from a licensed engineer, a certificate under Shops and Establishments Act"".On March 1, 2018, Bombay HC had held that even for a hoarding to be erected on Airports Authority of India land in Juhu, the advertising agency had to get permission from BMC as the competent authority.In its defence now, BMC claims that it was hamstrung by the fact that to avoid payment of licence fee and seek licence from it, railway police had in July 2021 said GRP falls within the definition of railways. It claimed ward officials had been ""pursuing the matter"" with GRP. On May 13, the day of the tragedy, the N ward officer wrote a letter to the agency, saying the hoarding had been erected without permission since April 2022, adding that it owed BMC over Rs 6 crore. It instructed the agency to remove its eight hoardings in the area within 10 days.Meanwhile, Thane Congress prez Vikrant Chavan alleged an unholy nexus between the administration and political leaders of being partners in advertising agencies that install massive hoardings. BJP MLA Sanjay Kelkar demanded action against errant officials who permit such structures.(With inputs by Manoj Badgeri)",Mumbaikars are bewildered by the collective negligence of govt authorities that allowed this mishap to occur.

Death sentence clause in SC/ST Act valid? Top court to examine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/death-sentence-clause-in-sc/st-act-valid-top-court-to-examine/articleshow/110127100.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to examine the validity of a provision of the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 that mandates imposition of capital punishment on a person if false and fabricated evidence given by him leads to conviction, imposition of death penalty and execution of a SC/ST community member.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and K V Viswanathan was hearing a challenge to the rarely used provision on the ground that it is not consistent with the ""rarest-of-rare"" benchmak set by SC for awarding capital punishment.A five-judge SC bench in the Bachan Singh case on May 9, 1980, had ruled that death penalty could be imposed by courts on persons convicted only in 'rarest of rare' murder cases involving extreme brutality. The SC had said, ""... for persons convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception... concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law's instrumentality. That ought not to be done save in rarest of rare cases when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed.""PIL petitioner and advocate Rishi Malhotra pointed out to a bench of Justices Kant and Viswanathan that Section 3(2)(i) of SC/ST Act provided that if an innocent member of a SC or ST community was ""convicted and executed in consequence of such false or fabricated evidence, the person who gives or fabricates such false evidence, shall be punished with death"".He informed the court that Section 303 of the Indian Penal Code, which imposed mandatory death sentence on a person who committed a murder while serving life sentence for another murder, was struck down as unconstitutional by another five-judge bench in Mithu vs Punjab case in 1983 by applying the Bachan Singh judgment ratio.Justice Kant said SC/ST Act is not one of those archaic colonial laws but one enacted by Parliament in 1989. ""The provision may have been consciously enacted to send a strong message not to implicate people belonging to poor and marginalised sections of the society in criminal cases,"" Justice Vishwanath said the norm is life sentence and capital punishment is an exception. Malhotra argued that Bachan Singh case 'rarest of rare' jurisprudence was further developed over the decades by the SC to make imposition of death penalty a rarity by vesting discretion with the judiciary to decide the quantum of punishment for a gruesome murder by examining several aspects relating to the crime, accused, circumstances, and most importantly amenability to reform.Attorney general R Venkataramani told the court that since the IPC, CrPC and Evidence Act has undergone reforms, he would consult the govt about introduction of reforms in other penal laws. The bench said that would be better and posted the matter for hearing in July.The court repeatedly asked whether there are instances of persons suffering the death penalty under Section 3(2)(i) of the SC/ST Act. Both the AG and Malhotra said they have not come across a single case.","Supreme Court agrees to examine validity of a provision of the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The provision mandates imposition of capital punishment on a person if false and fabricated evidence gives by him leads to conviction, imposition of death penalty and execution of a SC/ST community member.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110127101,imgsize-156566,width-400,resizemode-4/110127101.jpg"

They could top even if they lose their last game, provided RR don't win both their remaining games.RR are not sure of topping even if they win their remaining games, but their chances of being sole toppers are a respectable 25%. They also have a nearly 40% chance of finishing sole second. But they are still not guaranteed qualification. If they lose both games, they could end up tied second with three other teams - SRH CSK and LSG depending on results in other games.Third placed CSK have a better than 90% chance of making the top four on points, singly or jointly, but their qualification is far from certain. They could end up tied second with three other teams (RR, SRH and LSG) or tied third with up to four other teams or tied for fourth with three other teams. What helps is their better net run rate at this stage than any of the other teams competing for the last two qualifying slots. Also, a loss against RCB in their last game will not necessarily rule them out.Fourth placed SRH have an even better chance (96.9%) of making it to the top four slots on points, singly or jointly, thanks to the extra game in hand. But they too are unsure of qualification with the possibility of four-way ties for second, five-way ties for third or three-way ties for fourth looming. The good news is that they don't have to necessarily win both their remaining games.Fifth placed RCB's chances of making it to the top four spots on points, singly or jointly, are just above 40%. Their last game against CSK is a must-win, but even winning it is not enough. Other results will need to go their way.Sixth placed DC's chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, are barely over 31%. And if they lose to LSG, the best they can hope for is sixth.For seventh placed LSG, the game against DC is not a must-win because they have another game in hand. The bad news, however, is that despite a 56% chance of making the top four slots on points, they are looking at possible ties with up to three teams for second, up to four teams for third and up to three teams for fourth and their NRR is the worst among all the teams they could tie with.Monday's washed out game effectively ended GT 's slim chances of qualification, making them the third team after MI and PBKS to get knocked out.",Gujarat Titans are the third team to be knocked out of the Indian Premier League playoff race. Their game against Kolkata Knight Riders was washed out on Monday. KKR now have a 75% chance of finishing sole toppers and a 25% chances of ending up in sole second spot.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110098799,imgsize-89176,width-400,resizemode-4/110098799.jpg"
