From cut-off to court

Two key issues

Appointments Overruled

Revision ordered

What next?

Allahabad high court last week directed UP government to draw up a fresh list for the appointment of 69,000 assistant teachers, setting aside selections made in June 2020 and Jan 2022. Revising an earlier order, the court held that reserved category candidates who qualify for the general category merit list should be migrated to that category.In December 2018, UP government announced the Assistant Teachers’ Recruitment Test-2019 (ATRE-2019), which was at the time the state government’s biggest recruitment drive for the selection of 69,000 primary teachers in the basic education department.About 4.3 lakh candidates registered of which approximately 4.1 lakh appeared for the test on January 6, 2019.The exam was a qualifying exercise and no caste-based reservations applied and neither was any cut-off criteria announced. It was also clarified that merely by qualifying via ATRE-2019, the incumbent would not have any right to appointment since it was only a test to establish eligibility for appointment to the post of assistant teacher.On January 7, 2019, UP government fixed 97 out of 150 (65% marks) as the cut-off for general category and 90 (60% marks) for the reserved category. A few candidates moved high court against this cut-off. On March 29, 2019, a single-judge bench set 40% and 45% marks, respectively, as cut-offs for the reserved and general categories. However, a division bench on May 6 of that year upheld the government’s initial eligibility criteria.Thereafter, the basic education department started the recruitment process based on ATRE results released in June 2020. On Oct 11, 2020, appointment letters were given to 31,277 candidates and, on Nov 30, 2020, 36,590 more candidates were recruited. Thus, 67,867 of the 69,000 posts were filled with 1,133 posts of ST candidates shown as lying vacant due to non-availability of suitable candidates.After the final merit list of June 2020, a large number of reserved category candidates moved high court. They had two main grievances:➤ The compartmentalisation of candidates for implementing vertical reservation was not mentioned at the time of the ATRE-2019 exam though it was an open competitive examination for the post of assistant teacher.➤ Two select lists were published without declaring category-wise cut-offs and that more than 50% of general category candidates were selected without giving due representation to reserved category candidates per their prescribed quota.That had led to MRCs — or Meritorious Reserved Category students, who made it to the merit list without availing the quota cut-off — being placed in the reserved category instead of general category under the provisions of Sec. 3(6) of the Reservation Act, 1994. That meant reserved category candidates were deprived of their right of reservation per Sec. 3(1) of the Reservation Act, 1994 read with Section 3(6). It was alleged that as many as 19,000-reserved category candidates, hence, missed out on quota benefits.In court, UP government admitted that the provisions of the Reservation Act, 1994, were not properly followed in the selection of 69,000 assistant teachers. Which is why, on January 5, 2022, an additional list was published of 6,800 more appointments from among the reserved category candidates. But that list was also challenged in Allahabad high court on the grounds that it was finalised without due procedure.A single-judge bench of high court on March 3, 2023, set aside the appointment of the 6,800 additional teachers from the reserved category. It also directed that the basic education department revise the original merit list of June 1, 2020, to select 69,000 assistant teachers. The court said that any reserved-category candidate who had benefited from relaxation of marks shall not be migrated from their respective category to the unreserved category while preparing the list per the quality points based on Appendix I of Service Rules, 1981.Both reserved and unreserved category candidates challenged this order. Some petitioners said that MRC candidates had been kept in the reserved category despite securing more than the cut-off marks fixed for the unreserved categories. Petitioners from the unreserved category pleaded that some reserved category candidates, who had taken the benefit of quota cut-offs, had been wrongly kept in the unreserved category.A high court division bench on August 13, 2024, modified the single-bench order. While the single-judge bench had asked UP government to revise the merit list of June 2020, the division bench said that the June 2020 list should be totally ignored and a fresh list prepared within three months in line with Sec. 3(6) of Reservation Rules, 1994, and Basic Education Rules, 1981.The court, however, asked UP government to follow the ATRE-19 results. It ruled that reserved-category candidates would be migrated to the general category if they secured marks that were higher than the prescribed cut-off for the general category.“If a reserved category candidate acquires merit equivalent to the merit prescribed for the general category, the MRC candidate shall be migrated to the general category per the provisions contained in Section 3(6) of the Reservation Act, 1994,” the court ordered.Further, the bench refused to interfere in the single-bench decision rejecting the additional list of 6,800 candidates of reserved category that were identified for appointment on January 5, 2022.With the entire list set to be redrawn, some candidates are bound to get adversely affected. However, the school education department said no injustice would be done to any selected candidate.The court said that “while preparing the fresh lists... if any one of the working candidates is affected by the action of the state government/competent authority, they shall be given the session benefit so that the students may not suffer.”After a meeting chaired by CM Yogi Adityanath on Sunday, UP government decided in principle to not challenge the HC order. A government statement said the CM was of the opinion that SC aspirants must get the benefit of quota per the Constitution but, at the same time, there should be no discrimination against any candidate.","Allahabad high court last week directed UP government to draw up a fresh list for the appointment of 69,000 assistant teachers. The court held that reserved category candidates who qualify for the general category merit list should be migrated to that category. About 4.3 lakh candidates registered of which approximately 4.1 lakh appeared for the test on January 6, 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112639894,imgsize-1127940,width-400,resizemode-4/112639894.jpg"

"India-Japan 2+2: Security, defence and Quad on agenda",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-security-and-defence-on-agenda-at-india-japan-22/articleshow/112635782.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid growing convergence on strategic issues , particularly the common agenda of ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, India and Japan are in talks to revise and update the joint declaration on security cooperation they signed in 2008. The third India-Japan 2+2 foreign and defence industrial meeting on Tuesday will look to carry forward the ongoing dialogue for the same, paving the way for a formal announcement at the summit level later this year.Foreign minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh will host their counterparts, Yoko Kamikawa and Minoru Kihara respectively, looking to further intensify defence and security cooperation between the 2 countries.Recognising the need to work together for peace and stability in Asia and their common interest in the safety of sea lines of communications, the landmark 2008 declaration had laid the foundations for stronger security cooperation through, among other things, strategic dialogue between the foreign ministers and consultations between the defence ministers and NSAs.The 2 sides are also expected to discuss India’s proposal for a Quad summit, which PM Narendra Modi has to host this year, on the margins of the UN General Assembly next month in New York City. With the US preoccupied with the November presidential election, this will effectively be the last chance for India to have the meeting in 2024.The chances of the Summit taking place in the US in September received a boost this week, with reports from Tokyo suggesting that Kishida, who will step down as PM after the ruling LDP leadership poll in late September, is considering visiting the US just before he demits office to participate in the General Assembly and to also meet President Joe Biden. Significantly, former Japan PM Yoshihide Suga too had travelled to the US in September, 2021, to participate in the first in-person Quad summit just before he stepped down. Quad has emerged as a key foreign policy pillar for India, Australia, Japan and the US as they work jointly to ensure a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific that is resilient and free from coercion.In the 2+2, Japan and India are also expected to discuss the proposed transfer by Tokyo of stealth ship antennas and related technology to the Indian Navy. The Tokyo based Nikkei Asia reported last week that Japan will announce an agreement for the same during the talks on Tuesday. The 2 countries are already cooperating in areas like Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)/Robotics.Apart from the increasing Chinese assertiveness in the region talks are also expected on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the Gaza crisis with both sides likely to reaffirm their commitment to a rules-based global order that respects sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, as also the need to follow international law and not do anything to unilaterally change the status quo.","India and Japan are in talks to revise and update the joint declaration on security cooperation they signed in 2008.

Law banning 'triple talaq' enacted as SC verdict non-deterrent: Centre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/law-banning-triple-talaq-enacted-as-sc-verdict-non-deterrent-centre/articleshow/112635737.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Union government on Monday told the Supreme Court that Parliament was compelled to enact a law in 2019 to make Muslim men who instantaneously divorce their wives through ' triple talaq ' liable to imprisonment as the SC's 2017 ruling declaring it unconstitutional did not prove to be a deterrent against such unilateral sudden snapping of marital relationships that left abandoned married women destitute.Defending validity of The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, whose validity was challenged by 'Samastha Kerala Jamiathul Ulema', the Centre said despite a 5-J bench ruling in 2017 in Shayara Bano case, ""there have been reports of divorce by way of 'talaq-e-biddat' from different parts of the country.""""It was seen that setting aside 'talaq-e-biddat' by the SC has not worked as a sufficient deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims,"" the govt said, adding this was the reason why it felt the pressing need for giving effect to SC's ruling through a law to protect the dignity of married Muslim women.It said, ""Parliament in its wisdom has enacted the law to protect the right of married Muslim women who are being divorced by triple talaq. The law helps in ensuring larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women and helps subserve their fundamental rights of non-discrimination and empowerment.""The Centre termed as baseless the petitioner's claim that marriage being governed by personal law must be exempt from the ambit of criminal law. ""Marriages are a social institution which the State has a special interest in protecting. It is beyond doubt that the State can protect the stability of marriages by resorting to the device of criminal law,"" it said, citing enactment of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.It also justified the law holding Muslim husbands alone accountable by saying it is he and his relatives who indulge in such practice.

To another question, he said, ""Yes, we are ready for a second strike"", adding that India had sufficient nuclear weapons.This led to a major flutter, both in South Block and across the globe.

"Ties with Russia, Ukraine not a zero-sum game: India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-will-travel-to-ukraine-meet-zelenskyy-on-friday/articleshow/112635477.cms,"Modi in Kyiv but shift unlikely in Indian position

NEW DELHI: Ahead of PM Narendra Modi’s ""landmark and historic"" visit to Ukraine, the Indian government indicated Monday its position on the Russia-Ukraine war – that ensuring peace is possible only through dialogue and diplomacy and the involvement of both parties in any peace initiative – remains unchanged.Modi will undertake a 10-hour journey from Przemysl in Poland, on the border with Ukraine, to arrive in Kyiv on Friday for an 8-hour visit that will see him holding bilateral talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and also interacting with Indian students in Ukraine.Modi is likely to reiterate India’s position before Zelenskyy, who had described the Indian PM’s embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last month as a devastating blow to peace efforts, that it’s ready to offer any assistance within its means for restoration of peace. The ""clear and consistent"" Indian position has seen it backing peace efforts with the caveat that these must involve Moscow too, but without coming up, unlike China, with any proposal of its own for political settlement or mediation.As foreign minister S Jaishankar said earlier this year, India is open to the role of a mediator if it’s approached, but it doesn’t want to initiate anything on its own. India has so far not condemned Russia’s actions in Ukraine and has also not endorsed Zelenskyy’s 10-point peace plan.Asked about Modi’s ""balancing act"" and the apparent pressure from the West under which the visit is happening, MEA secretary (west) Tanmaya Lal said India has broad, substantive and independent ties with both Russia and Ukraine. ""This not a zero-sum game,"" he said. On Ukraine’s invasion of Russia’s Kursk region, the official reiterated India’s position for a solution through dialogue and diplomacy saying the same was shared by a vast majority of countries.""Lasting peace can only be achieved through options that are acceptable to both parties and it can only be a negotiated settlement. India continues to engage with all stakeholders,"" he said, adding India is also ready to assist reconstruction efforts in Ukraine.The visit will also look at steps to expand bilateral cooperation, including through restoration of trade to the level it had reached before the war. Lal listed defence cooperation along with agriculture, health and education among the issues both sides will discuss but without sharing any detail about it. Zelenskyy’s office said a number of documents will be signed during the visit, the first by an Indian PM in the history of India-Ukraine relations.""Prime Minister’s engagements in Kyiv will touch a range of aspects of bilateral ties including political, trade, economic, investments, education, cultural, people-to-people exchanges, humanitarian assistance and others. PM will also interact with the Indian community, including students during the visit. PM’s landmark visit to Ukraine will help further consolidation and expansion of bilateral ties,"" said the Indian government in an official statement.On his way to Kyiv, Modi will also be in Poland on August 21-22 for what will be the first visit by an Indian PM to that country in 45 years. He will call on President Andrzej Sebastian Duda and hold bilateral talks with PM Donald Tusk, while also interacting with the Indian community in Poland.",PM Narendra Modi will arrive in Kyiv on Friday for an 8-hour visit that will see him holding bilateral talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Second CM from Karnataka to face prosecution

BENGALURU: In a significant blow to Karnataka ’s 15-month-old Congress govt, governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot on Saturday sanctioned the prosecution of chief minister Siddaramaiah in relation to the alleged Mysore Urban Development Authority ( Muda ) land allotment scam.The decision prompted immediate demands from the opposition BJP-JD(S) for Siddaramaiah to step down on moral grounds, causing concern among the Congress leadership.The governor's sanction was granted under ""Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and Section 218 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023,"" following petitions submitted by activists Pradeep Kumar SP, TJ Abraham, and Snehamayi Krishna.The petitioners are anticipated to approach the court in the coming week. TJ Abraham, one of the complainants, expressed his intention to seek the special court for public representatives to acknowledge the governor's sanction.The controversy revolves around the alleged irregularities in the allotment of compensatory sites. At the heart of the scam is a 3.2-acre parcel of land that was gifted to the Chief Minister's wife, Parvathi, by her brother Mallikarjunaswamy in 2010.Following the acquisition of the land by Muda, Parvathi sought compensation and was subsequently allocated 14 plots. These plots are said to be substantially more valuable than the original piece of land.The opposition parties claim that the total value of the scam could potentially fall within the range of Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 4,000 crore.Karnataka's chief minister Siddaramaiah, aged 76, is facing prosecution while in office, making him the second CM in the state's history to face such charges. The first was BJP's BS Yediyurappa in 2011. Ironically, Siddaramaiah, who demanded Yediyurappa's resignation as opposition leader in 2011, now faces similar charges and growing demands for his own resignation. The current situation resembles the events of 2011.In Yediyurappa's case, the then governor HR Bhardwaj approved the prosecution on December 12, 2010, based on a petition from advocates Sirajin Basha and KN Balaraj. The sanction was granted under ""Section 19(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act1988, and Section 197 of Criminal Procedure Code-1973."" This decision led to controversy and widespread protests by the BJP.Despite pressure, Yediyurappa did not resign immediately. He held a cabinet meeting to condemn the governor's decision and engaging in a lengthy legal battle. He eventually resigned after months of political pressure and following an indictment by the then Lokayukta Santosh Hegde in the illegal mining scandal.The sanction against Siddaramaiah adds to the list of rare but significant instances in Indian political history where governors have taken decisive actions against chief ministers. Similar scenarios have occurred in other states, such as the cases of J Jayalalithaa, AR Antulay, and Lalu Prasad Yadav, all of whom resigned following the sanction to prosecute them.","Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah is facing prosecution over the Muda scam. The scam involved the allotment of sites under the 50:50 scheme.

NEET PG 2024: Check revised normalisation process

The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) is expected to announce the NEET PG examination results soon. Once released, candidates can check their results on the official website, natboard.edu.in.Based on previous year trends, the NBEMS releases the results first, followed by the individual scorecards a few days later.In addition to the NEET PG result, the board will also publish the category-wise cut-off marks.Last year in 2023, the entrance test for postgraduate medical courses was held on March 5, with the results announced on March 14. This year, the test was conducted on Sunday, August 11, and the results are expected anytime soon. Here’s an overview of the trends from previous years-In 2022, the NEET Post Graduate exam result was declared by the National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences within a record time of just 10 days from the date of the exam. Although the result was initially scheduled for June 20, 2022, it was released earlier on June 1, 2022.It is worth noting that prior to 2013, aspiring medical postgraduates in India competed for admission through the All India Post Graduate Medical Entrance Exam (AIPGMEE). This exam was conducted to fill postgraduate seats in various medical colleges across the country. However, to streamline the medical entrance examination process and ensure a common platform for all aspirants, the AIPGMEE was replaced by NEET PG. Subsequently, after a period of transition the AIPGMEE exams were replaced with the NEET PG exams.The National Board of Examinations (NBE) will prepare the NEET PG 2024 results using a normalisation process similar to that used by AIIMS for other exams, including the INI CET. The normalisation process entails converting raw scores into percentiles to ensure fairness across multiple exam shifts.Candidates' final grades are calculated by first determining their raw scores and then converting them into percentiles. The top scorers, or toppers, are assigned a percentile of 100. All other candidates are assigned percentiles based on their relative performance. The top scorers in each shift of the NEET PG 2024 exam, which will be administered in multiple shifts, will receive a perfect score. To ensure precision, each candidate's percentile score will be calculated to seven decimal places.","The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) is expected to announce the NEET PG examination results soon.

The way this information has come to light is also a matter of concern for me because I am a part of this government and have the platform to raise these issues.""""Speaking on behalf of my party, we are absolutely not in favor of this.

Gandhi alleged that the Modi government was favoring recruits with affiliations to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).Several opposition leaders echoed the sentiments, arguing that this move threatens the reservation policy and constitutional rights.Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav described the move as a 'big conspiracy' against the country. He claimed that the policy is designed to deprive Pichhde, Dalit, and Alpsankhyak (PDA) communities of their reservation rights and opportunities within the government.Meanwhile, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw backed the policy and said that the Congress' criticism shows its ""hypocrisy"", and asserted that the BJP-led NDA government has created a transparent method to implement the concept developed by the UPA dispensation.In a post on X, Vaishnaw said the reform measure implemented by the NDA government will improve governance. ""INC hypocrisy is evident on lateral entry matter. It was the UPA government which developed the concept of lateral entry,"" he said.""UPA period ARC recommended recruitment of experts to fill the gaps in roles that require specialised knowledge,"" Vaishnaw added.The recent UPSC notification for recruiting joint secretaries, directors, and deputy secretaries undermines the reservation rights of SCs, STs, and OBCs, the opposition argues.The introduction of lateral entry into government positions has ignited a heated debate, with opposition leaders calling for reconsideration of the policy to protect reservation and ensure fair representation in India's administrative system.","Chirag Paswan says all government appointments must adhere to the established provisions of reservation.

Modi's visit to Kyiv will be the first by an Indian PM since bilateral relations began over 30 years ago.Before Kyiv, PM Modi will be in Poland on August 21-22. He is expected to take a train from Poland to Kyiv. The PM's trip to Poland is also historic as it is the first such trip by an Indian PM to the country in 45 years.Tanmaya Lal, secretary west of ministry of external affairs (MEA), said: ""PM Narendra Modi will undertake an official visit to Ukraine later this week on Friday, August 23, on the invitation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy .This is also a landmark and a historic visit since this will be the first time an Indian PM will be visiting Ukraine in more than 30 years since we established our diplomatic relations. This visit will build upon the recent high-level interactions between the leaders.""The MEA further said that India has always been advocating diplomacy and dialogue to resolve conflict in Ukraine. ""India has maintained a very clear and consistent position that diplomacy and dialogue can resolve this conflict and which can lead to enduring peace, so dialogue is absolutely essential. Lasting peace can only be achieved through options that are acceptable to both parties and it can only be a negotiated settlement. on our part, India continues to engage with all stakeholders,"" he said.""Prime Minister Modi has had conversations with leaders of both Russia and Ukraine as you know and the PM also visited Russia, recently.

This is the first visit of an Indian PM to Ukraine in the history of our bilateral relations. During the visit, in particular, the talks with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be held to discuss issues of bilateral and multilateral cooperation. It is also expected that a number of documents between Ukraine and India will be signed.""The visit comes following criticism from Kyiv over PM Modi's embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a recent visit. The visit to Poland and Ukraine signals PM Modi's attempt to navigate India's longstanding ties with Moscow alongside cultivating closer relations with Western nations.The trip also comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned PM Modi for hugging Putin during his visit to Moscow in July, which happened just after a Russian attack on several Ukrainian cities caused significant casualties and damage.Modi's government has consistently called for peaceful dialogue to resolve the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, avoiding direct condemnation of Russia's actions. India and Russia share historical ties dating back to the Cold War, a period during which the Kremlin emerged as a major arms supplier to India.Since the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict , Russia has emerged as a critical supplier of discounted crude oil to India. This has bolstered economic ties, helping India save billions of dollars while also aiding Russia economically despite Western sanctions.Western countries have encouraged India to distance itself from Russia while seeking to strengthen their own relations with New Delhi. India is part of the Quad grouping with the United States, Japan, and Australia, which serves as a counterbalance to China's increasing influence in the Asia-Pacific region.On the significance of PM Modi's visit to Poland, Chargé d’affaires of Poland to India Sebastian Domżalski said: ""I am very happy about PM Modi's visit to Poland. This is the first visit of the Indian PM to our country since 1979...This is a very significant visit of PM Modi and we are celebrating 70 years of India-Poland diplomatic relations...We will be looking forward to finding new avenues of cooperation...There will be three priority areas. Technology will be a very important priority area.

NEW DELHI: A day after the AIADMK insinuated that the ruling DMK is covertly working with BJP under a ""secret pact"", the DMK supremo MK Stalin on Monday cleared the air. The Tamil Nadu chief minister outright rejected claims of any secret tie up with the saffron party, saying he would never compromise on principles, merely for the sake of politics.""We don’t have the necessity for secret ties.We would never give up on our rights. This has been the path laid down for us by(CN Annadurai) and(M Karunanidhi)"".“Just because we have invited Rajnath Singh, they have circulated news that DMK will ally with the BJP,” he said.The chief minister also flayed AIADMK's Edappadi Palanisamy, saying that the DMK ""did not have the habit of crawling to get posts"" like the ex-chief minister.“AIADMK men who chant 'Amma' round-the-clock and carry her (Jayalalithaa’s) picture in their pockets and do prayers have not held a single condolence meeting for her. They do not have any right to criticise the coin release function,"" Stalin said.However, to the surprise of many, the Dravidian leader heaped praise for defense minister Rajnath Singh for presiding over the event to mark the birth centenary of his father. The chief minister said the union home minister accepted the invitation without thinking twice, and he was overwhelmed with happiness, so much so that ""his sleep” was compromised on Sunday night.In, fact he went one step further to shower more praise by saying that the defense minister's speech was unparalleled and deserved to be ""recorded in history.""""Rajnath Singh spoke greatly about our leader Karunanidhi in such a way that even our DMK men would not,"" he said.Stalin further added that “there was no compulsion for Rajnath Singh to laud Karunanidhi . There was no necessity. But minister Rajnath Singh spoke the truth straight from his mind.”The chief minister also said Leader of Opposition was not invited to the event purely because it was orgainsed by the Centre and it was not a doing of his.""Edapadi Palani Sami has asked why Rahul Gandhi was not called for yesterday's centenary celebration of Karunanidhi, he should know that this is not organised by DMK but it's a union government programme,"" he said.The charges by AIADMK leader Edappadi were apparently fueled by DMK's participation in Governor's Independence Day event and subsequently, Union defense minister 's presence at Karunanidhi coin release ceremony on Sunday.""DMK announced that it will not take part in High Tea. But when Annamalai said that he would take part in the coin release function and asked DMK to take part in high tea, immediately, Stalin participated while DMK released a statement claiming that he was representing the Tamil Nadu Government and not DMK. Isn’t this funny as Stalin is the Head of DMK and Duraimurugan, who is the General Secretary of DMK participated. So, this is only showing the 'two-faces' of the party. This only shows their relationship"", Palanisamy said on Sunday.""I’ve said this many times. It was being said that there was a secret relationship between DMK and BJP, even our administrators were saying so. Now the media has also started to raise this question. So it has come to light that the BJP and DMK have a secret relationship"", the ex TN CM Palaniswamy added.( With inputs from ANI, PTI)","Tamil Nadu chief minister rejects claims of any secret tie up with the saffron party.

What is lateral entry into bureaucracy? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-lateral-entry-into-bureaucracy-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/112625939.cms,"What triggered the political debate?

Why is the opposition criticising the move?

How has BJP defended the move?

NEW DELHI: Lateral entry into bureaucracy is a practice that involves recruiting individuals from outside the traditional government service cadres to fill mid and senior-level positions.Lateral entry into bureaucracy was formally introduced during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure, with the first set of vacancies announced in 2018. Candidates are typically hired on contracts ranging from three to five years, with potential extensions based on performance.The aim is to address complex governance and policy implementation challenges by tapping into external expertise.The concept of lateral entry has historical precedence. It was initially recommended by the Second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) established in 2005 during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government led by Congress. The ARC, chaired by Veerappa Moily, advocated for lateral entry to fill roles requiring specialised knowledge unavailable within traditional civil services. These recommendations emphasised recruiting professionals from the private sector, academia and PSUs to improve policy implementation and governance.The Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ) issued an advertisement seeking applications for lateral recruitment to 45 senior positions , including joint secretary, director and deputy secretary in 24 ministries of the Union government.These posts are key decision-makers and administrative heads within departments. Candidates with appropriate qualifications and experience from state/UT governments, PSUs, statutory organisations, research institutes, universities and the private sector are eligible to apply.Reservation in public jobs and universities is implemented via the 13-point roster policy. However, a Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) circular notes that there are no mandatory reservations for appointments on deputation, and the current process of filling posts through lateral entry is considered a close approximation of deputation.""In a single post cadre, reservation does not apply. Since each post to be filled under this scheme [lateral entry] is a Single Post, reservation is not applicable,"" files obtained from the DoPT state.Opposition leaders argue this lacks reservation for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC), while the government defends it as a means to bring in specialised talent and expertise.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has criticised lateral entry, accusing the Modi government of using it as a backdoor to recruit officers loyal to the BJP's ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). ""Lateral entry is an attack on Dalits, OBCs, and Adivasis. BJP's distorted version of Ram Rajya seeks to destroy the Constitution and snatch reservations from Bahujans,"" Gandhi said on social media platform X.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge described lateral entry as part of a 'well-planned conspiracy' to exclude marginalised communities from government jobs.Rashtriya Janata Dal's Tejashwi Yadav and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati have also condemned the move, arguing that it deprives underprivileged candidates of opportunities for advancement within the government.""A question to the honorable judges and the central government who are forcibly looking for creamy layer in OBC/SC/ST: Where does the so-called creamy layer of these classes go when they are in these posts?"" Chandrashekhar Aazad of the Azad Samaj Party questioned.BJP has countered these criticisms by pointing out that the concept of lateral entry was developed during the Congress-led UPA government.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw tweeted, ""INC hypocrisy is evident on lateral entry matter. It was the UPA government which developed the concept of lateral entry. The second Admin Reforms Commission (ARC) was established in 2005 under UPA government. Shri Veerappa Moily chaired it.""In total, 63 appointments have been made through lateral entry in the last five years, as per minister of state for the DoPT Jitendra Singh. Presently, 57 lateral entrants occupy positions in various ministries/departments.","Lateral entry into bureaucracy was formally introduced during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure.

'Mamata Banerjee wants to destroy evidence'

NEW DELHI: As politics over the Kolkata rape-murder go up multiple notches with war of words erupting between the BJP and TMC, a statement by TMC MP warning doctors that “we will not save you” from public wrath, has added to the recent spate of tensions between the two parties.The BJP on Tuesday took strong exception to controversial statements made by TMC netas in support of Mamata Banerjee , who after the brutal rape-murder of the trainee doctor at a state run hospital, has come under fire from various quarters for handling of law and order situation in the state.“In the name of the movement, you may go home or go about with your boyfriend. If a patient dies because of your strike and public anger falls on you, we will not save you,” TMC MP Arup Chakraborthy was quoted as saying in a rally in West Bengal by media reports.The BJP was quick to pounce on the loose statement, with BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla likening ""TMC"" to ""Talibani Mindset & Culture"".""Any more evidence needed that Mamta Govt stands with the rapists not with the doctors, those crusading for justice or with the victim’s family. Will she step down? Will the MP be sacked?,"" he added.However, this is not the first time in recent week, a TMC politician's remark has drawn similar ire from the saffron party. Earlier on Sunday, TMC state minister Udayan set off a similar political storm by threatening to to ""break the fingers"" of those calling for chief minister Mamata Banerjee to step down amid protests over the PG trainee doctor's rape-murder in a state run hospital.The saffron party's spokesperson in an apparent reference to opposition attacking BJP over ""fascism"", chose to accuse the TMC of the same. ""This is real fascism,"" he said in the post on X.""Dictator Didi minister Udayan Guha who insulted & mocked Women’s 14th August midnight march now gives chilling warning 'If you point finger at CM, fingers will be broken', "" he added.Poonawala then went on to refer the recent developments in the state such as cancelling of the football match, violence against protesters by state police, the recent sacking of TMC spokesperson Shantanu Sen for ""speaking on Sandip Ghosh"". This, he suggested are all elements of ""real fascism"". """"Kolkata police issues threat notices to citizens, summons doctors -football match cancelled to avoid protests - Shantanu Sen sacked as spokesperson for speaking on Sandip Ghosh, Sukhendu Roy summoned -Talibani order to transfer 43 doctors which was halted"", he listed his post.The saffron party's spokesperson then went ahead to refer the recent ""break your finger"" threat by the minister and said, ""Now open threats!""The BJP spokesperson also referred to the parents of the deceased, who have cried ""betrayal"" by the TMC government and have accused the state government of trying to protect the accused. ""Parents of victim have also spoken on how Mamata is suppressing the truth,"" the saffron party's spokesperson said.Earlier in the day, BJP's Gaurav Bhatia also held a press conference, where the spokesperson accused the West Bengal government of being ""hell bent"" to muddy the evidence and save the accused in the rape-murder case.Addressing the media, BJP's national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia demanded Mamata's resignation and said, ""Mamata Banerjee is the chief minister of West Bengal who also holds the Home Ministry and the Health Ministry.The main purpose of today's press conference is to demand her resignation and justice for our sister, who was brutally raped and murdered. Mamata Banerjee should resign.""""A chief minister, through her deeds or inactions acts of commission or omission, destroyed the evidence which is vital to ensure that the accused get the punishment they deserve and as per the new criminal law. destroyer is hell-bent on destroying the evidence"" he added.Kolkata Police summoned TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy on Sunday, hours after he demanded that the CBI interrogate Kolkata Police commissioner and former principal of Kar Medical College and Hospital.Kolkata Police also issued summonses to former BJP MP Locket Chatterjee and two well known doctors for allegedly spreading rumours and disclosing the identity of the woman doctor who was raped and murdered at R G Kar Medical College.","The BJP on Tuesday took strong exception to controversial statements made by TMC netas in support of chief minister Mamata Banerjee.

Kharge retaliated against PM Modi govt's charge that Congress had ushered in the policy, stating that UPA had brought lateral entry for ""handful of experts in sector specific posts"", while the Modi govt is deploying it ""not to appoint experts but to snatch the rights of the SC/ST/OBCs.""Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge also pointed out that government sale of PSUs has ended 5.1 lakh posts in last ten years, ""casual and contract employment"" has increased by 91% and SC/ST/OBC posts fell by 1.3 lakh till 2022-23.Congress brass recently met to renew its pledge to oppose the privatisation of PSUs and outsourcing of jobs as attacks on reservation, and the party has seized upon the Prime Minister Modi govt's celebrated scheme to paint it with the same brush.The offensive is significant in view of coming assembly elections, and indications are that Congress will use the lateral entry to further accuse the ruling BJP of being anti-reservation - an extension of its Lok Sabha election campaign that the BJP is seeking ""400 paar"" to change the Constitution to the detriment of the backward classes.The LS results, especially in key states of Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, convinced the opposition that the line of attack resonated with key communities, and that is the reason why Congress has been alert to any opening to attack the BJP on social justice front.""SC, ST, OBC, EWS posts will now be given to people of the RSS.

"Lateral entry today is a contentious issue, but it has been around since Nehru's days",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lateral-entry-today-is-a-contentious-issue-but-it-has-been-around-since-nehrus-days/articleshow/112635406.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government's latest move to induct 45 mid-level specialists through the lateral entry route has stirred a political controversy . But ever since the industrial management pool days in the 1950s, to inducting specialists such as IG Patel, Manmohan Singh, V Krishnamurthy, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, and RV Shahi, government has always had lateral inductions , although it was largely limited to senior posts.If it was the absence of economists that prompted the Centre to rope in Bimal Jalan, Vijay Kelkar and Rakesh Mohan, the fous now, as the latest UPSC advertisement to recruit joint secretaries and directors suggests, is on technology and environment like sectors where the current civil service set up does not allow specialisation.In 1959, PM Jawaharlal Nehru started the industrial management pool that saw the likes of Mantosh Sodhi join the government and later become secretary of heavy industry. V Krishnamurthy, who successfully led PSUs such as BHEL and SAIL, was another lateral entry who was the heavy industry secretary. Similarly, D V Kapur went on to head three ministries - power, heavy industry and chemicals and petrochemical. Before then, in 1954, I G Patel joined as deputy economic adviser from IMF and later went on to become economic affairs secretary and RBI governor.In 1971, former PM Manmohan Singh joined as economic adviser in the commerce ministry before moving on hold several other assignments. During Janata government M Menezes, a railway engineer, was made secretary defence production.Rajiv Gandhi appointed K P P Nambiar, chairman of the Kerala Electronics Development Corporation, as the electronics secretary and Sam Pitroda joined to lead the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT).In 2002 the Vajpayee government inducted R V Shahi from the private sector to push electricity reforms as power secretary.Several of the economists who joined government in 1980s and 1990s came at additional secretary level and then went on to hold secretary level posts.It is only since 2018 that the Modi government has gone for a lateral hiring strategy on a bigger scale, and at the middle level.While it cited the recommendations of the second administrative reforms commission to hit back at Congress, the failure to attract the best talent in government jobs has played a role, more so because several IAS officers are not keen to come for central deputation.In any case, there are few who are able to develop the expertise during their career, having had to handle a diverse set of jobs.The lack of qualified officers, leave alone specialists, has led to the emergence of the Big Four syndrome where consultants work on everything from designing investment strategies to even presentations that secretaries often make to the PM's Office.""With the level of expertise available now through regular UPSC recruitment (MBAs, engineers, doctors, candidates with high computer science knowledge), there is enough talent within the services...It is a question of finding the right person for each job. government should focus on creating a results oriented administrative system. We retain our old process oriented colonial system of administration with hardly any change while many other countries have moved on with new public management and new public governance systems,"" said former cabinet secretary K M Chandrasekhar, who is not a supporter of the lateral entry system.Overnight reorientation is unlikely given that bureaucracy is resistant to change, said a secretary rank officer.""In NITI Aayog we institutionalised lateral entry at the level of joint secretaries, directors and young professionals, who brought in a lot of fresh ideas and young energy, which helped us roll out several initiatives, including PLI, aspirational districts and AI,"" said Amitabh Kant, who was the CEO of the government think tank. Kant advocates a five-year term, instead of three for such joinees. ""Lateral entry should be a two-way street with government officers allowed to work in the private sector, international agencies and civil society organisations working at grassroot level.""","Government's latest move to induct 45 mid-level specialists through the lateral entry route has stirred a political controversy.

The court outlined the failure of banking entities, which were ""under legal obligation to report"" the suspicious transactions, but did not do so.The court noted the transactions were of the year 2012-13, and there was no way Bhatnagar could have found out it was laundered money. ""The accused was not a Nostradamus to have known that it was crime money,"" court said.ED said Bhatnagar had introduced a real estate company (IPF Real Estate Brokers LLC) to help John Docherty and Ratul Puri receive $20 million funds from Rajiv Saxena, an accused in the case.The prosecution alleged that Docherty, Puri's close associate, asked Bhatnagar to arrange a real estate company to facilitate a fictitious transaction to help transfer $20 million and project it as untainted.The court pulled up the agency saying money had gone through a hawala channel but ED did not record statement of any hawala dealer.The court also slammed ED for relying on the statements of Rajiv Saxena, who had turned approver in the AgustaWestland scam case. Court said ED was ""singing songs of praise"" for Saxena in one of its chargesheets, which was ""utmost surprising and deplorable"".","A Delhi court has discharged Nitin Bhatnagar, a close aide to senior Congress functionary Kamal Nath's nephew Ratul Puri.

Most of them, however, have remained inconclusive.While one needs to await the course of action of the CJI-led bench on Tuesday in the RG Kar hospital incident, a matter dealing with the remission policy of Chhattisgarh which attracted the SC's suo motu attention six months ago, is yet to be listed.In another instance, the SC took cognisance on its own of the Madhya Pradesh HC terminating the services of six women judicial officers. Though proceedings were initiated on December 17 last year, a bench led by Justice B V Nagarathna is yet to reach a conclusion.Another Calcutta HC judgement passing sweeping remarks gratuitously asking adolescent girls to ""control sexual urge as in the eyes of the society, she is the loser when she gives in to enjoy the sexual pleasure of hardly two minutes."" SC titled its proceedings 'In Re: Right to privacy of adolescent' and expunged the observations. But the judgment, reserved on May 17, is yet to be pronounced.Between 1991-2022, it took suo motu cognisance of 50-odd cases, 10 of those, prompted by the depredations of the Covid pandemic in 2020, including taking stock of oxygen supply to Delhi and states, providing proper healthcare to patients and dignified handling of bodies in hospitals, ensuring adequate rest to doctors working tirelessly through the challenging times, keeping judiciary functional through virtual mode and asking govts to provide relief and rehabilitation to children orphaned by Covid.This year's first suo motu civil case was registered by the SC on January 28, when it permanently stayed Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay's order asking SC secretary general to send him the documents that were placed before the CJI. Gangopadhyay has since resigned as a judge of Calcutta HC and got elected to Lok Sabha on BJP ticket.Two more suo motu proceedings were initiated by the SC relating to recruitment of persons with disabilities and visually impaired in judiciary. In April, the SC had taken out proceedings against Gautam Budh Nagar District Bar Association office bearers for alleged assault on SC Bar Association members, who had appeared before the trial court despite a strike call.In May, CJI DY Chandrachud had initiated suo motu proceedings for expediting the shifting Bombay high court to a new building. The HC, functioning since January 1879 from a four-storied stone structure resembling a castle built in gothic style and reflecting Mumbai's multi-cultural ethos and exuberance, would move to a modern building to be constructed at a 30-acre plot in Bandra East.The last suo motu proceedings before the CJI were provoked by the audacious order of a Punjab and Haryana HC judge, Rajbir Sehrawat, who had cast doubts on the wisdom and majesty of the highest court. The SC had expunged the judge's unwarranted remarks with a warning.In 2023, the SC took suo motu cognisance in three matters, one relating to management of Sariska Tiger Reserve and a temple within it attracting thousands of devotees. SC had constituted a committee to find a solution to this issue that could be a flash point between environment proection and pursuit of faith.","Supreme Court has exercised its suo motu power a record 10 times this year taking cognisance of diverse issues.

India, of course, remains worried about the tightening strategic clinch between China and Russia.On Monday, the discussions Between Admiral Moiseyev and Gen Chauhan “underscored the mutual commitment towards enhancing maritime security, deepening strategic cooperation and fostering a stronger defence partnership between the two nations”, an official said.Another official added, “The visit is a testimony to the longstanding relationship between the navies of Russia and India. The visit aims to strengthen bilateral naval relations , as also to explore new avenues for naval cooperation.”The Russian Navy chief’s visit, which will also see him touring the Western Naval Command and Mazagon Docks in Mumbai, comes ahead of the delivery of two guided-missile frigates being built in Russia for India. The delivery of the frigates as well as the remaining two squadrons of the five S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems for the IAF have been delayed due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, as reported by TOI earlier.The first of the two 4,000-tonne multi-purpose frigates is now likely to be delivered by the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad within a couple of months and will be commissioned as INS Tushil. The second one, INS Tamal, in turn, will be delivered by early next year.India in October 2018 had inked an umbrella agreement for the procurement of the four Grigorovich-class frigates. While the first two frigates are to be imported from Russia for around Rs 8,000 crore, the next two are being built at the Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore, as was earlier reported by TOI.All the four frigates will be armed with the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, apart from other weapon systems and sensors. They will add to the six such Russian stealth frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted into the Indian Navy from 2003-2004 onwards.","Admiral Aleksandr Alekseyevich Moiseyev, on an official visit to India from Aug 19 to 22.
