India plans to position itself as global green hydrogen hub: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-plans-to-position-itself-as-global-green-hydrogen-hub-pm-modi/articleshow/113275747.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday announced his plan to make India a global hub for green hydrogen (GH2), building upon the country's achievement of becoming the first among G20 economies to meet green energy commitment made at 2021 Paris UN climate change conference (CO) nine years ahead of the 2030 target.""We are not resting on these achievements and the nation remains focused on strengthening existing solutions while also looking at new and innovative areas.This is where green hydrogen comes into the picture... We aim to position India as a global hub for production, utilisation, and export of green hydrogen. National Green Hydrogen Mission ( NGHM ) launched in 2023 is a critical step toward realising this ambition. It will drive innovation, build infrastructure, stimulate industry growth, and attract investment in the sector,"" he said in his inaugural speech delivered virtually at the 2nd International Green Hydrogen Conference.Pointing out India's installed non-fossil fuel capacity ""increased 300% and solar energy capacity received a boost of 3,000%"" in the past 10 years, Modi said GH2 can help decarbonise heavy industries and long-haul transport. GH2 is produced through electrolysis using renewable power as opposed to extraction from natural gas, which is termed 'grey'.The rapid expansion in renewables capacity since 2014, when Modi first became PM, provides the foundation for NGHM with a target of achieving five million tonnes of annual GH2 production capacity by 2030. Govt is offering a production-linked incentive of Rs 13,050 crore for GH2 production and Rs 4,440 crore for electrolyser manufacturing.Renewable energy minister Pralhad Joshi said NGHM has the potential to attract Rs 8 lakh crore in investments, generate six lakh jobs and lead to savings of Rs 1 lakh crore by reducing natural gas and ammonia imports. Oil minister Hardeep Puri said NGHM will reduce 15 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.","PM Narendra Modi announced his plan to make India a global hub for green hydrogen.

Looking at the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, your party was not able to agree on seat-sharing policies with your alliance partner Mamata Banerjee-led TMC. You also have partners like Hindutva-based Shiv Sena. If elected, how would you effectively run a government with such a divided coalition which does not seem to agree on anything except for the removal of the Prime minister Modi"", the student asked.Rahul, addressing the larger issue of the alliance ’s vision, was quick to correct, “INDI is BJP’s framing, it’s INDIA alliance,” he said.However, the persistent student then questioned what the “A” in INDIA stood for.The brief silence then followed from Rahul. After a pause, he replied that “A” stood for “Alliance,” a moment that seemed to throw the crowd off balance.The student further asked whether it wouldn’t make it redundant to call it the INDIA alliance.Rahul did manage to clarify the ideological foundation of the INDIA bloc. “No, it’s not redundant because the whole idea of the alliance was to put across to the people of India that India is being attacked,” he said, bringing the conversation back to what the alliance stands for, describing it as a united front to challenge BJP’s monopolization of power.Critics from the ruling party were quick to pounce, painting the moment as a representation of the opposition’s broader internal confusion.This comes amid a row over Rahul's remarks where he said that today the ""fight in India is whether a Sikh person will be able to wear his turban, kada, and visit Gurdwara"".","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi at the center of an unexpected candid exchange with a student about the opposition’s much-touted ‘ INDIA Alliance ’ The episode, which began as a straightforward question on coalition dynamics, quickly transformed into a moment that went viral on social media.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113231415,imgsize-502422,width-400,resizemode-4/113231415.jpg"
Kolkata doctor horror: How a shadowy ‘North Bengal lobby’ shapes hospital decisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-doctor-horror-how-a-shadowy-north-bengal-lobby-shapes-hospital-decisions/articleshow/113243481.cms,"Posters against the North Bengal lobby appeared on the RG Kar campus as protests intensified last month (left); Sandip Ghosh (right)

What is the North Bengal lobby?

How does it function?

What is the RG Kar link?

Two doctors linked to ‘North Bengal lobby’ suspended

KOLKATA: With the agitating junior doctors and students putting up the heat on those allegedly part of the ‘ North Bengal lobby’ across medical colleges, an FIR has been lodged against three doctors – Birupaksha Biswas , Avik De and Ranjit Saha – all linked to ‘North Bengal lobby’ and close aides of former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh – at Bowbazar police station.Police have compiled all complaints into one FIR and have registered a case under section 351 (assault as making a gesture or preparation that causes someone to believe that they are about to be subjected to criminal force) of BNS.➤ The ‘North Bengal lobby’ refers to a group of officials and doctors working in govt-run hospitals and medical colleges. The shadowy group has dominated newspaper headlines, social media posts and canteen conversations since Aug 9, when a young RG Kar doctor was raped and murdered at her workplace. Here, we try to make sense of what it is and who constitute it for readers not familiar with the group.➤ This is not a geographical identity. The name tries to deﬁne a group of doctors who are close associates of an orthopaedic surgeon who passed out of the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH). A whole lot of doctors who owe allegiance to the group and its leader may not have been students of the NBMCH. And not everyone who has passed out of this reputable medical college belongs to this lobby.➤The North Bengal lobby has, according to its critics and senior state health ofﬁcials, come to control much of the day-to-day functioning of govt hospitals and medical colleges. Its inﬂuence on health administration far outweighs its number or ofﬁcial designations of its members. The lobby, for example, has come to decide many of the transfers and ""punishment"" postings of those who refuse to fall in line as well as transfers to ""coveted"" institutes or departments for those who need to be rewarded.➤ Almost all controversial decisions of the recent past have been attributed to the North Bengal lobby by seniors in the state health department. A case in point is the posting of the now-shamed former RG Kar principal, Sandip Ghosh. He was twice transferred out of RG Kar by the state health department in the last couple of years but, each time, got back this prized posting within days or weeks. Senior health department ofﬁcials have attributed this only to his being an important part of the North Bengal lobby.➤ Many of these decisions seem devoid of any logic or rationale and bypass the usual hierarchy of the health department. The names of some of the beneﬁciaries of the North Bengal lobby's largesse have appeared in mainstream media recently; they include Avik De, Birupaksha Biswas, Susanta Roy and Suhrita Paul. The names of some of these doctors have also cropped up repeatedly in connection with the attempted cover-up of the RG Kar crime.➤ RG Kar, more than any other medical college and hospital, has been under the North Bengal lobby’s control, say health department ofﬁcials. A crosssection of the hospital staff has identiﬁed former principal Ghosh as the spearhead.➤ Many of those whose names have cropped up in connection with the crime’s coverup were also seen in the vicinity of the crime scene, say hospital ofﬁcials. They include Biswas, De and Ray. None of them had any direct link with RG Kar (one, for example, worked in Burdwan, about 110 km away) but were often seen on the campus.➤ The RG Kar campus had almost become the North Bengal lobby’s unofﬁcial headquarters for some time, say state health department seniors. “We are not surprised by the scale of corruption at this hospital and the maladministratin that gave rogues like Sanjay Roy , the key accused in the rape-murder case, so much control over the campus and its day-to-day affairs,” a senior health department ofﬁcial said.➤ Earlier, the state health department suspended two doctors Avik De and Birupaksha Biswas who are in the eye of a storm in medical colleges across the state. Names of the two appear prominently in posters of the 'health syndicate' that were found recently in medical colleges.Both are also known to be close associates of RG Kar ex-principal Sandip Ghosh. De is the man in red-T shirt in the crime scene who Kolkata Police touted as a fingerprint expert which IMA Bengal challenged. He used to work as an RMO in Burdwan Medical College who is now a first-year surgery PGT at IPGMER.➤ Birupaksha Biswas, senior resident doctor of pathology, too, has been embroiled in controversy. Junior doctors said he too was present in R G Kar on Aug 9 whereas he had no locus standi to be present. Audio clips where he is heard threatening other students and junior doctors have gone viral even as Biswas had dismissed those as AI-generated.He was transferred to Kakdwip Sub-Divisional Hospital last Aug from Burdwan Medical College but his release order was issued only on Tuesday. Protest had also erupted in the Kakdwip hospital over his transfer there.","FIR lodged against three doctors linked to ‘North Bengal lobby’ and close aides of former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh.

Adarsh, who arrived at the spot, issued ban orders under CrPC 144, restricting the gathering of four or more people in groups.Additional police forces from Mandya, Bellur, and Bindiganavile were deployed to regain control of the situation. The police resorted to lobbing tear gas shells to control the mob.The Ganesha idols have been temporarily placed near a temple, and devotees are demanding the arrest of those who caused disturbance to the procession.

According to news agency ANI, the doctors refused to attend because it was said to be a closed-door meeting.""The mail that we received yesterday was from the principal secretary and it was written that there is a meeting with senior government officials, stating it to be a closed-door meeting. We refused it because we were against the closed-door meeting,"" a protesting doctor was quoted as saying.The junior doctors' email reply read, ""We want to send a delegate team of at least 30 representatives. We want the meeting to be live telecasted for the sake of transparency among all parties. We are re-emphasising our point that we want our discussion to be in the presence of chief minister. We want the meeting to be based around our 5-point demands.""Responding to the demands, the West Bengal government said that it was not ready to accept any condition for a meeting. ""Setting conditions for talks is not a reflection of coming with an open mind to find solutions to problems which plague the doctors. The government is ready to listen to whatever they have to say. But they can't set preconditions for such a meeting,"" Statehealth minister said addressing a press conference.The minister confirmed that the state will stick to the Supreme Court's direction on rejoining duties of the agitating doctors. ""You will see what steps we take about this as and when it happens,"" Bhattacharya said.The West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front earlier issued a five point demand, which included holding everyone responsible for the rape and murder to be punished, implement strict disciplinary action against ex Principal Sandip Ghosh , resignation of Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal , eliminate the alleged ""threat culture"" in hospitals and colleges, ensure adequate security measures for healthcare workers.The protesting doctors have also been calling for the dismissal of key officials in the state health department, including the health secretary, the directors of health services and medical education. A similar invitation for dialogue was extended by the health secretary on Tuesday evening, but the doctors refused it, questioning the logic of engaging in talks with the very person whose suspension is one of their main demands.“One of our main demands is the suspension of health secretary Narayan Swarup Nigam .

Protestors demand to seal mosque

CM Sukhu to set up panel

NEW DELHI: Tension prevailed in Himachal Pradesh 's Sanjauli as protestors hit the roads on Wednesday against the alleged illegal construction of a mosque.Hindu groups, who had called for a bandh, came out on streets along with the people in the hill state as they were irked by the Shimla Municipal Corporation's slow pace in deciding the legality of the mosque's construction -- which has been pending since 2010.The case has been heard nearly 45 times, but the final decision on the matter is yet to come.The protest turned ugly when the agitators clashed with the police and removed barricades to enter the Dhalli tunnel that leads to the Sanjauli area, where the mosque stands. The cops pushed against the protesting crowds by resorting to lathi-charge and also used water cannons to disperse the gatherings.Himachal Pradesh minister Vikramaditya Singh , to persuade the enraged protestors, assured action once the decision on the matter comes and said the mosque ""will be demolished if it is found to be illegal""""This matter has been pending for a long period. As far as the construction of illegal buildings is concerned, the government has taken cognisance of it. I have also strongly said in the assembly that as soon as the decision comes on this within the ambit of law action will be taken, it will be demolished if it is found to be illegal,"" Singh said.The minister said the government will ""move ahead with the process of law"" and that an ""atmosphere of peace should prevail in Himachal Pradesh"".Several protesters complained that the government first denied them permission to hold a peaceful demonstration and now was arresting them.Vijay Sharma, one of the demonstration's leaders told news agency PTI that the police lathi-charge on the protesters led to the volatile atmosphere in the area.""We demand that the structure be sealed till the hearing is concluded, all outsiders coming to the state be registered and a vendor's policy formulated on a population basis with 95 per cent licence to Hindus,"" Sharma said.Many women also joined the protest and recited Hanuman Chalisa at Dhalli before breaking the barricades.Sunita, who was among the protesters, claimed police lathi-charged children as well.""We are neither from the Congress nor from the BJP, we are Hindus and want these street vendors out,"" she told PTI.Janvi, a student of Class 6 of SPM Public School in Sanjauli, the students were scared as they were stuck in the school due to the protest.""We were allowed to leave when our parents came to collect us,"" she added.Amid the protests against the illegal construction of the mosque, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, on September 9, assured that his government will constitute a committee to frame a street vendors' policy and to issue licences only after their verification.The CM, on the concluding day of the 11-day monsoon session of the Himachal assembly, said either a cabinet sub-committee or a vidhan sabha committee will be constituted to address this issue since Congress and BJP were equally responsible for maintaining communal harmony in the state.He said the state had a history of various communities co-existing peacefully, but action will be taken as per law in case of any illegal activity.","Hindu groups, who had called for a bandh, came out on streets along with the people in the hill state.

NEW DELHI: Faced with a huge financial burden caused by the ruling of a nine-judge bench of Supreme Court enabling states to collect royalty on extracted minerals and to levy tax on mineral-bearing land, Centre has sought a review, pointing out several ""errors apparent in the judgment"".Interestingly, the Centre has roped in Madhya Pradesh as a co-petitioner to seek review of the July 25 judgment in an open court hearing and argued that the issue raised by it ""pertains to the fundamental rights of the citizens of the country and raises larger issue of public interest and grave injustice would ensue if the application for oral hearing of the review petition is not allowed"".When senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi , appearing for some mineral-rich states, sought early listing of pending cases relating to dues before a regular bench to follow the nine-judge verdict and give the intended financial relief, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate A M Singhvi told a bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud about filing of the review petitions by the Centre and a Tata group entity.""Review of a Constitution bench judgement,"" exclaimed the CJI.Dwivedi said the review plea was indicative of the fact that PSUs, who have benefited immensely from extraction of minerals without paying royalty or tax on mineral-bearing land for decades, did not want to pay the minimum amount fixed by the apex court.After Centre and private companies requested the court to make the levies on minerals by states prospective, the nine-judge bench, with Justice B V Nagarathna dissenting, had clarified on Aug 14 that arrears of royalty and tax on mineral-bearing land would be paid in instalments to states from 2005 over the next 12 years. It was also clarified that arrears would not attract interest.The financial implication for public sector undertakings, without interest, has been estimated to be Rs 70,000 crore. This jumps to 1.5 lakh crore if the arrears due from 2005 to be realised from private sector industries are included. Mineral-rich states which will benefit majorly are Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan.Pleading with SC for prospective implementation of its nine-judge bench ruling, Union govt had argued that retrospective application would create a burden humongous enough to ruin many PSUs and industries, dent the larger economy and send prices of almost every product soaring.","The Centre has roped in Madhya Pradesh as a co-petitioner to seek review of the July 25 judgment.

Talking to reporters, he vowed to fight against PM Narendra Modi ’s “narrative of naya Kashmir”, and took a dig at NC vice-president Omar Abdullah, saying he was only concerned about coming to power.“PM Modi’s narrative of ‘naya Kashmir’ has miserably failed. That was proved by the people of my constituency on June 4. The vote for me was actually a referendum against Modi’s narrative… I will fight against his narrative of ‘naya Kashmir’ and for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue till my last breath,” he said.Replying to a question about Omar, Engineer Rashid said Omar was fighting for the chair while his fight “is for my people”. “My fight is much bigger than what Omar Abdullah is fighting for. There is a difference between spending five years in London and spending this time in Tihar jail, where prisoners crave for medical attention,” said the Baramulla MP, who had defeated Omar in the parliamentary polls by over two lakh votes.Rashid said he would go to the people to unite them, and not to divide them. “If that’s a crime, I am proud to commit this crime again and again. If I will have to spend my entire life in Tihar for this crime, I am ready,” he said. “I won’t exploit my people. Let youth study, businessmen do business; leave politics to us.”BJP’s election in-charge for J&K, Ram Madhav, strongly responded to Rashid’s anti-Modi rhetoric. “This rank separatist, in jail for the last 5 years under UAPA for indulging in anti-India activities, is out on bail to further vitiate Valley politics. Look at the language… anti-Modi rants, restoring Article 370 , freeing terrorists from jails… no different from what Omar or Mehbooba or even others… — the Gupkar Gang — are saying. He wants to defeat Modi’s dream of ‘naya Kashmir’. We accept the challenge. Naya Kashmir’s march will go on unrelentingly,” Madhav said in a post on X.Reacting to Er Rashid’s release, Omar and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti insinuated that he and his party were being propelled by BJP to weaken the mainstream parties in Kashmir.Talking to reporters in Kupwara, Omar said, “When Arvind Kejriwal was allowed to campaign, they (BJP) opposed the move and questioned how a person could be released from jail for electioneering, but today they welcomed the release of Er Rashid.”Mehbooba said Rashid’s release raised doubts, and wondered how AIP seemed to have no dearth of money even when its leader was behind the bars, while her party was struggling to fund campaign rallies. “I am surprised to see AIP carrying out huge rallies in vehicles. Who is funding AIP?” she asked, while speaking to reporters in Shopian.","Sheikh Abdul Rashid walked out of Tihar jail a day after he was granted interim bail by a Delhi court.

He went on to say, ""The fight is about whether a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India, or a kada. Or if, as a Sikh, he will be able to go to a gurdwara.

The SC dismissed the appeal. The woman officer was reinstated. The male officer moved the SC saying if there was no truth in the allegation of illicit relationship between him and the woman judicial officer, he should also be reinstated in service and the termination order of 2009 should be quashed.On April 20, 2022, the SC set aside the HC's Oct 25, 2018, order dismissing the male officer's writ petition, the termination of service order of the Punjab govt of Dec 17, 2009, and requested the full court of Punjab and Haryana HC to reconsider the matter relating to his termination.

In any case, the appellant was entitled to salary from April 20, 2022, the date of judgment, till fresh termination order was passed on April 2, 2024. The appellant would thus be entitled to full salary for the above period to be calculated with all benefits admissible treating the appellant to be in continuous service.""For the period between Dec 18, 2009, when his services were terminated, till April 19, 2022, a day before his appeal was allowed by the SC, the bench directed the state to pay 50% of back wages while treating him to be in service continuously.","Punjab Haryana high court, on the judicial side, ruled for the protection of life and liberty of two judicial officers in an ""extra-marital relationship"" On the administrative side, the HC dismissed them for the affair, an allegation levelled by the male officer's wife.
