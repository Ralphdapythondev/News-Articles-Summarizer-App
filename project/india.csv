The belief that it was around the corner could be seen in the glint of her eyes, in the clenching of teeth when she smiled.Manu wanted another medal badly and she got it on Tuesday: a second bronze medal, which made her the first Indian after Independence to win two medals at the same Olympic Games.Norman Pritchard , a sprinter born in 1875 in then Calcutta, bagged two silver medals in the 1900 Games, which incidentally was also held in Paris . But that was 124 years ago, lost in the pages of India's Olympic history. While IOC lists him as an Indian, World Athletics credits his medals to Britain.Manu's second bronze came in the company of another 22-year-old, a first-time Olympian - the shy Sarabjot Singh - in 10m air pistol mixed team event.For Manu, it was a reward for believing in herself when she was going through a dark period. It was the karma thing she has been talking about here. ""Do your work - the hard yards - the result will come,"" she again said on Tuesday.The two medals… it is all sinking in, yes, but I must keep my emotions in check. I have one more event left to play,""Manu said. Two in the bag, but she is not done yet. Manu has been shooting well and a third medal one now looks a real possibility. The 25m pistol individual is her pet event.Manu showed her form again in the mixed battle for bronze. She looked composed when she walked in 30 minutes before the competition to set up her station. She did some shadow shooting, took a deep breath and walked out as if lost in thought. When she returned with Sarabjot for the competition, she looked ready. No sign of nerves. Sarabjot's face showed nothing, but he said later that he was feeling the pressure.The South Korean pair consisted of Lee Wanho and women's 10m air pistol individual gold medallist Oh Ye Jin. The way the Indians and the South Koreans shot was an interesting contrast to watch. Manu shot consistently. She had seven consecutive 10s. Sarabjot struggled a bit. Wanho shot like a dream, Jin had a night mare of a time. That made the difference.Manu started well with a 10.2. Sarabjot had a terrible 8.6. India was down 0-2. The winner needed to get to 16 first, which meant eight wins.Manu got 10.7 in the second try and Sarabjot shot a 10.5. The Koreans were way behind this time. 2-2. The Indians then hit a purple patch with both hitting 10s in their third and fourth tries to go up 6-2. Manu again shot a 10.5, Sarabjot managed just 9.6 but Jin's poor form helped. The Indians were up 8-2.That was when Wanho decided to find a rare zone. 10.8! It was 8-4 now. But the Koreans slipped again in the seventh shot and the Indians were cruising at 10-4.Then Manu had her first bad shot - 8.3. The Koreans had reduced the gap to 10-6. From there, it was 12-6 and 14-6. Jin's meltdown was surprising, not pretty to watch. The Indians were not complaining. They needed just two more points.Wanho staged a late comeback. He had not given up. He shot two consecutive 10.8s, which helped the Koreans reduce the gap again - 14-10. The 13th shot sealed the issue. Wanho shot a miserable 9. Manu had a 9.4, but Sarabjot shot 10.2. That was enough.India took two timeouts in between when the pressure seemed to mount. It helped them calm their nerves.Job done, Manu and Sarabjot stood on the stage with the Tricolour wrapped around their shoulders, and posed, as a small contingent of Indian supporters made quite some noise in the stands. It was the fans' time to get trigger happy.While the celebrations were on in the stands, Jaspal Rana was long gone. The medal assured, Manu's coach picked his bag, put on his shades and got up to leave. He accepted a hug and a handshake. ""Salute to you, Jaspal. You gave the girl confidence and courage."" He smiled, struggling to control his emotions and walked away swiftly.",Manu Bhaker becomes first Indian post-1947 to win 2 medals at 1 Olympic Games. Bhaker wins bronze in 10m air pistol mixed team event. She is the first Indian after Independence to win two medals at the same Games. Norman Pritchard won two silver medals in the 1900 Games.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112153728,imgsize-104908,width-400,resizemode-4/112153728.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India pulled off an astonishing victory against Sri Lanka, completing a 3-0 clean sweep, in a nail-biting finish to the third and final T20I of the series in Pallekele.The hosts required just 9 runs off the last two overs with six wickets in hand, but the game took an unexpected turn when captain Suryakumar Yadav handed the ball to Rinku Singh , a player who had never bowled in his 23-match T20I career.On a spin-friendly track, Rinku Singh's entry into the bowling attack was a surprising and risky decision. However, it turned out to be a masterstroke.Rinku's first delivery was a dot ball, with Kusal Perera attempting a reverse-slog but failing to connect. The tension was palpable, and head coach Gautam Gambhir 's reaction of 'oohh' was caught on the telecast, reflecting the high stakes of the moment.The turning point came with Rinku's second ball. He bowled a short-of-a-length delivery that Perera mistimed, resulting in a top edge. Rinku moved swiftly towards the off-side and completed a caught-and-bowled dismissal, taking his maidenT20I wicket .This crucial breakthrough brought a smile to Gambhir's face, a rare sight in such tense circumstances.Rinku's over didn't stop there. On the final delivery, he claimed the wicket of Ramesh Mendis , ending the over with remarkable figures of 2 for 3. His two wickets and three runs conceded drastically altered the equation, leaving Sri Lanka needing six runs off the final over.Suryakumar took it upon himself to bowl the last over. Displaying nerves of steel, he managed to restrict the hosts and push the game into a Super Over. India emerged victorious in the Super Over , securing a thrilling win that will be remembered for Rinku Singh's unexpected heroics and Suryakumar Yadav's bold captaincy.","India beat Sri Lanka in the third and final T20I of the series in Pallekele.

BENGALURU: Scientists from Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP) have identified Ladakh as an ideal location for India's first Mars and Moon analogue research station . Their proposal leverages past research as well as their own field work experience.The research work, carried out by Binita Phartiyal from BSIP along with IISc’s Aloke Kumar and Shubhanshu Shukla — one of India’s four Gaganyaan astronauts — comes as India accelerates its ambitious space programme , including plans for a space station by 2035 and a Moon landing by 2040.An analogue research station, Kumar explained: “is a place where activities meant for Moon and Mars can be planned and practised. For example, if you’re planning an astronaut habitat, you can build a habitat there as there are some similarities (geological, for example) with extra-terrestrial conditions. You can also use it to see how microbes and other organisms respond to such extreme environments.”Phartiyal and Kumar, lead authors of the proposal, highlight Ladakh’s unique geographical features that closely resemble both Martian and Lunar environments. The region’s cold, arid desert landscape, rocky terrain, and geomorphological similarities to early Mars and the Moon make it an exceptional candidate for simulating extra-terrestrial conditions.“Ladakh offers a natural laboratory for testing equipment, training personnel, and conducting crucial scientific studies. Its environment provides geochemical, geomorphological, and astrobiological fidelity to Mars and Moon,” says Phartiyal.Phartiyal, who has been visiting Ladakh for research work nearly every year since 2000, has studied the landscape closely. “...Being there often makes me feel that you are on a different planet altogether,” Phartiyal, who also participated in Nasa’s Spaceward Bound India programme (2016), which cited Ladakh’s high altitude mountainous ecosystem possessing Mars-analogous topological features, said.The proposed research station would serve multiple purposes: Testing platform for space technologies, advancing Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), engineering integration, human studies and crew training and geological and astrobiological research.The establishment of such a facility would significantly boost India’s space programme, particularly the Indian human space programme and future Mars exploration plans. It would also provide valuable opportunities for studying extremophiles and conducting comparative research with samples from India’s existing polar research stations.“This is an opportune time for India to join the global community in establishing analogue research stations. It will not only benefit our space programme but also promote astro tourism and support local communities in Ladakh,” Kumar said.This proposal follows India’s recent milestone of inducting four astronaut designates into its ranks, underscoring its growing commitment to space exploration.“As India positions itself as a major player in the global space arena, the Ladakh analogue research station could prove to be a crucial step towards realising its extra-terrestrial ambitions, providing a vital resource for scientific research, technological development, and astronaut training in the years to come,” Kumar said.As reported earlier by TOI, Kumar pioneered the concept of creating space-bricks from biologically consolidated lunar and martian regolith and has an interest in developing extra-terrestrial habitats for human colonies.","Scientists from Indian Institute of Science have identified Ladakh as an ideal location for India's first Mars and Moon analogue research station.

Insurance premium GST is like tax on life's uncertainties: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/insurance-premium-gst-is-like-tax-on-lifes-uncertainties-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/112177278.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has urged finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to consider suggestions for removing GST on life and health insurance , a demand that is unlikely to be met, although it has generated tremendous interest.While forwarding a representation from the Nagpur Divisional Life Insurance Corporation Employees Union, the minister, a three-term Lok Sabha MP from the constituency, said: ""Levying GST on life insurance premium amounts to levying tax on uncertainties of life...Similarly, the 18% GST on medical insurance premium is proving to be a deterrent for the growth of this segment of business, which is socially necessary.""Citing other demands in the memorandum, he went on to say: ""The union feels that a person who covers the risk of life's uncertainties to give protection to the family should not be levied tax on the premium to purchase cover against the risk... you are requested to consider the suggestion of withdrawal of GST on life and medical insurance premium on priority as it becomes cumbersome for senior citizens as per rules with due verification...""Insurance was one of the biggest contributors to service tax kitty, which was subsumed into GST from July 2017. While Centre levied 15% service tax, GST Council, the all-powerful ministerial panel chaired by finance minister, settled for 18% tax on insurance, which is seen to be burdensome by consumers. Several other services, such as telecom, attract the same levy.In all likelihood, the rationalisation rates, and possible merger of slabs, will see a reduction in levy although a removal of tax will result in those providing services to insurance firms being denied tax credits.A final call on the change in rates will only be taken up once a group of ministers led by Bihar deputy chief minister Samrat Chaudhary submits its report to the GST Council. After the last meeting of the GST council, Sitharaman had said that preliminary discussions may take place when ministers reassemble in Aug. Congress MP Karti Chidambaram latched on to Gadkari's communication, claiming that he'd made a similar demand earlier.The letter from Gadkari, however, has come as a surprise, although he is seen to have forwarded a representation that was made to him.","Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has urged finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to consider removing GST on life and health insurance.

She has now failed Class 12, being unable to pass physics. She scored just 22 in physics in the supplementary exam, compared to 21 on her first attempt.In chemistry, she got exactly the passing mark of 33 on her second attempt. She had scored just 31 marks in chemistry in the March exam. Sources said supplementary exam results cast serious doubts over the validity of her NEET score.""At a time when irregularities in NEET were pursued by the apex court this case can't be ignored.

The stark contrast between the two results - NEET score and board exam score of just 352 out of 700 - received widespread attention. While sources confirmed the validity of these scores, TOI has not yet been able to independently verify that the mark sheets indeed belong to the same individual.Her NEET score was later reduced to 700 after a Supreme Court-appointed committee made a ruling on one question in the test. Her NEET score puts her in the top 99.89th percentile in physics, 99.14th percentile in chemistry and 99.14th percentile in biology, ranking in the 99.94th percentile overall. It is a high score that would typically earn a free seat in a top medical college.

"'Trinamool trying to break Congress, listen to party workers ... ': Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury's strong message to Delhi leadership",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trinamool-trying-to-break-congress-listen-to-party-workers-adhir-ranjan-chowdhurys-strong-message-to-delhi-leadership/articleshow/112173153.cms,"NEW DELHI: Is Adir Ranjan Chouwdhury on his way out of the Congress? Well, we do not know for now, but the West Bengal Congess leader has surely dropped clear hints of rebellion amid imminent change of leadership in the state unit. The West Bengal Congress leader, who represented Behrampore Lok Sabha constituency for five terms, lost the 2024 Lok Sabha elections to cricketer-turned-politician Yusuf Pathan of the Trinamool Congress.He lost his stronghold of Baharampur by nearly 74,000 votes. Adhir, a staunch critic of ruling Trinamool Congress , resigned as the president of the West Bengal unit after the Lok Sabha elections.In a strongly-worded post on social media, Adhir attacked the Congress high command for reportedly asking the state unit to go soft on Mamata Banerjee 's Trinamool Congress.""Who else other than us will speak on behalf of our party workers who are being beaten up every day by the ruling Trinamool Congress activists in West Bengal? The ruling party in the state is trying to break Congress on a daily basis. Despite officially being a part of the INDIA bloc, they have not stopped oppressing us,” the West Bengal Congress leader said in his post.Asserting that the rank and file of the party at the grassroots is against any tie-up with Trinamool, Adhir said, ""Delhi needs to speak to those party workers in West Bengal who are struggling daily and protesting on the streets to keep the party flag. Their opinion is important and hence they should also be called to Delhi.""""I will be there on the streets with my party colleagues and carry forward their movement. I will not compromise with injustice. I will never do that,"" Adhir added.Adhir has been vocal about his opposition to Trinamool Congress and has openly targeted the West Bengal chief minister, mcuh to the discomfort of the party's high command.A latest example of this was seen when the Congress expressed solidarity with TMC chief Mamata Banerjee over the developments at the NITI Aayog meeting, while on the same day, Chowdhury wrote a letter to President Droupadi Murmu, alleging that West Bengal is in an ""anarchic condition"" and sought her intervention to ""restore law and order"" in the state.In fact, Adhir was instrumental in ensuring that the Congress did not align with the Trinamool in the last Lok Sabha and also assembly elections. However, Congress bid to contest these two elections in alliance with the Left Front failed to make any impact as the party failed to open its account in either of the two elections.After losing his seat and the grand old party's drubbing in Lok Sabha elections in the state, Adhir has been isolated within the Congress, with the high command gradually distancing itself from his acerbic attacks on Mamata. The West Bengal chief minister, on her part, has often accused Adhir of working as an agent of the BJP.Dropping hints at the widening gap with the party leadership, Adhir recently claimed that he got to know during a meeting that he was no longer the state Congress chief. ""I was aware that a meeting had been called under my presidency and I was still the West Bengal Congress president but during the meeting, Ghulam Ali Mir while addressing said that the former president is also here. At that time, I got to know I had become former president (of West Bengal Congress),"" Adhir said.The Congress is in the process of carrying out changes in the West Bengal unit. Congress general secretary, organisation, K C Venugopal recently held a meeting with senior party leaders from the state and discussed several issues, including ties with the ruling Trinamool Congress. The meeting was attended by Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury , general secretary AICC in-charge West Bengal Ghulam Ahmad Mir and Pradip Bhattacharya, among others.Meanwhile, in an interesting twist, Union minister and Republican Party of India (A) leader Ramdas Athavale has extended Adhir an invite to join the NDA.""I request Adhir Ranjan ji that if he is being insulted in Congress, then he should leave Congress. I invite him to join NDA or my party RPI,"" Athavale said. ""It is because he (Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury) lost from West Bengal that he is being ignored and insulted.

PATNA : A six-year-old pre-primary student of a Bihar school carried his father's licensed pistol to class Wednesday and ended up ""mistakenly"" pulling the trigger on a 10-year-old boy inside a classroom. The bullet struck the Class III student's left palm.Police said the owner of the gun, a guard at the same school in Supaul district's Triveniganj , took away his son and the weapon after being informed of the shooting.Both have been untraceable since.Triveniganj SDPO Bipin Kumar said the injured child's relatives vandalised the school and blocked the town's main road until police intervened. The boy is out of danger, he said.Investigators dismissed speculation about the shooting being linked to a land dispute involving the school and the injured student's family. ""How the child entered the campus with a gun in his bag is the focus of the investigation. The boy who was shot at told police that he had nothing against the junior who fired the weapon,"" Kumar said.""Prima facie, the bullet was fired mistakenly.

Quad Meeting in Tokyo: Quad Condemns China's South China Sea Tactics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-raps-china-for-scs-manoeuvres-backs-philippines/articleshow/112117977.cms,"China expectedly loomed over the Quad foreign ministers’ meeting in Tokyo Monday as India, US, Australia and Japan expressed serious concern over Beijing’s “dangerous manoeuvres” in the South China Sea ( SCS ) and called for an Indo-Pacific in which no country dominates and no country is dominated.In a first, India also joined others in upholding in a joint statement the 2016 arbitral tribunal award that refuted Beijing’s expansive claims over SCS waters in its maritime dispute with the Philippines as the basis for peacefully resolving such disputes.Foreign minister S Jaishankar and his US, Australia and Japan counterparts - Antony Blinken, Penny Wong and Yoko Kamikawa respectively - called the award a significant milestone and.India had for the first time last year, in a joint statement with the Philippines, unambiguously asked China to adhere to the legally binding tribunal award Beijing has always called null and void. Before that India had restricted itself to only calling for respecting the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), under which the tribunal was instituted.As they reassembled in Tokyo after the recent China-Philippines tensions, the ministers said they’re determined to contribute to maintaining and developing the free and open maritime order consistent with UNCLOS in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and for this purpose, to enhance collaboration with regional partners. They also announced initiatives to enhance regional maritime domain awareness in the Pacific through satellite data, training and capacity building. “In line with such efforts, we intend to geographically expand the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) to the Indian Ocean region,” said the joint statement.The ministers also committed to soon having the 2024 Quad summit which PM Narendra Modi is now looking to host on the margins of the UNGA in New York in September, pending the availability of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida. Japan is yet to confirm because the date for ruling LDP election might clash with the General Assembly session, making it difficult for him to travel abroad.In his opening remarks, while talking about the need for Quad to uphold a rules-based order, Jaishankar said it’s only Quad collaboration that can ensure that the Indo-Pacific remains free, remains open, stable, secure and prosperous.“It is therefore essential that our political understanding strengthens, our economic partnerships grow, our technology collaborations expand and our people-to-people comfort intensifies. Our meeting should send a clear message, that the Quad is here to stay, here to do and here to go,” he addedIn their pushback against China, the Quad ministers backed sovereignty and territorial integrity, while also expressing commitment to address debt crises through sustainable, transparent and fair lending and financing practices. They expressed serious concern about the situation in the East and South China Seas, reiterating their strong opposition to any unilateral action to change the status quo by force or coercion.“We continue to express our serious concern about the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating manoeuvres in the South China Sea. We also express our serious concern about the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels, the increasing use of various kinds of dangerous manoeuvres, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities,” said the joint statement.According to the ministers, Quad is also looking to contribute to the region through capacity building cooperation for enhancing maritime security. “We intend to launch a Quad Maritime Legal Dialogue under the Quad Maritime Security Working Group to focus our expertise on international law of the sea issues in support of our efforts to uphold the rules-based maritime order in the Indo-Pacific,” said the statement.","India, US, Australia and Japan expressed serious concern over Beijing’s ‘dangerous manoeuvres’ in the South China Sea ( SCS ) The ministers said they’re determined to contribute to maintaining and developing the free and open maritime order consistent with UNCLOS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112117994,imgsize-1556167,width-400,resizemode-4/112117994.jpg"

In his letter, Gadkari requested Sitharaman to withdraw the 18 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) on life and medical insurance premiums.Union minister Nitin Gadkari relayed the concerns of the Nagpur Division Life Insurance Corporation Employees Union, which had presented him a memorandum addressing issues in the insurance industry.Referring to the memo regarding issues in the insurance industry, road transport and highway minister said, ""Levying GST on life insurance premiums amounts to levying tax on the uncertainties of life. The Union feels that the person who covers the risk of life's uncertainties to protect their family should not be taxed on the premiums paid to purchase this cover.""Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh responded on X, sharing Gadkari's letter as indicative of dissent within the government. Ramesh said, ""Mr. Nitin Jairam Gadkari's letter to the FM on the Budget is a sure sign of internal dissent and rumblings against the non-biological PM.""In his letter, Gadkari elaborated on the issues raised by the union, focusing on the GST withdrawal for life and medical insurance premiums. He also mentioned concerns over differential treatment of savings through life insurance, the re-introduction of income tax deductions for health insurance premiums, and the consolidation of public sector general insurance companies.Both life insurance and medical insurance premiums currently face an 18 percent GST rate, a point of contention highlighted by the union and addressed by Gadkari in his request to the finance minister.Meanwhile, Congress MP Karti Chidambaram also took a jab at the BJP, expressing approval that Gadkari had called on the finance minister to remove the GST on insurance. Chidambaram highlighted that he had previously suggested the same during the Budget debate in the Lok Sabha.""I am very happy that Cabinet Minister Mr Gadkari has endorsed my demand that I made yesterday on the floor of the House to remove the 18 per cent GST levied on Health and Life Insurance premium,"" Chidambaram said.He further added, ""We are a very under-insured country, and we must encourage people to insure themselves. By levying GST you are making the premiums expensive. You must treat insurance not only as a social cover but also as a mode of saving. So they should remove the GST.""","Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari requested Sitharaman to withdraw the 18 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) on life and medical insurance premiums.

Retrospective royalty on minerals will ruin economy: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/retrospective-royalty-on-minerals-will-ruin-economy-government/articleshow/112179501.cms,"Mining levy trial pits BJP-led Odisha, TDP's AP against Centre

Ripples will be felt from nanotech to healthcare: Attorney general

NEW DELHI: Pleading with the Supreme Court for prospective implementation of its nine-judge bench ruling allowing states to levy royalty on extracted minerals and tax on mineral-bearing lands, the Union government on Wednesday said retrospective application would create a burden humongous enough to ruin many PSUs and industries, dent the larger economy and send prices of almost every product soaring.The hearing in Supreme Court on Wednesday on whether the court's verdict allowing states to collect royalty on minerals extracted from their jurisdiction as well as tax on mineral-bearing tracts could be applied retrospectively saw BJP-governed Odisha, partner TDP-led Andhra Pradesh and some local bodies diverging from the stand of the BJP-led central coalition.The Chandrababu Naidu government opposed the Centre's fervent plea for prospective implementation of a nine-judge SC bench's ruling empowering states to levy royalty and tax on minerals, which has been unpaid for the last 35 years and could run into lakhs of crores of rupees.The difference was palpable before a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, A S Oka, B V Nagarathna, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, S C Sharma and A G Masih which is deciding whether its July 25 judgment granting states the right to levy royalty on extracted minerals and tax on mineral-bearing land should operate prospectively, or retrospectively.As states were not able to realise these levies for 35 years, since the 1989 judgment in India Cement case, the cumulative arrears on these two levies run into lakhs of crores of rupees. The Centre pleaded for prospective implementation citing huge financial impact on the economy, industries and PSUs. SG Tushar Mehta said ultimately, the burden would be passed on by industries to the people, who would bear brunt of price rise.The Andhra Pradesh government, however, opposed the Centre's plea and said the HC had upheld the validity of an AP legislation imposing such levies in 2005 and the SC had only stayed operation of the law, which meant it was alive even if inoperative. After the nine-judge bench ruling, the state law came into effect from the day it was enacted, and the state had a right to recover arrears, AP's counsel said.Attorney general R Venkataramani told a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, A S Oka, B V Nagarathna, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, S C Sharma and A G Masih, “There will be multi-polar impact on the economy and industries, which is not visible to the court today. If mining sector gets impacted, ripples will be felt from nanotechnology to healthcare.” Solicitor general Tushar Mehta elaborated on the adverse impact of retrospective implementation of the constitution bench ruling to enable states to recover the arrears of royalty and tax, which had been on hold since 1989 when the SC, in a 7-1 ruling in the India Cement case, said states had no right to levy royalty on extracted minerals or tax on mineral-bearing land.Supported by various sectors of industries represented by senior advocates Harish Salve, A M Singhvi and Arvind Datar, the SG said, “In India, 55% of the total commercial energy production is coal reliant, and 68% coal production is used in the generation of electricity. Power is not only an essential input across every other industrial sector but also meets the daily energy requirements of domestic and rural consumers.The Centre said as per a preliminary estimate, retrospective application of the verdict would mean a cumulative burden of Rs 70,000 crore on PSUs engaged in energy production and mining.","BJP-governed Odisha, partner TDP-led Andhra Pradesh and some local bodies diverging from the stand of the BJP-led central coalition.

Observing that the facts of the case were very peculiar, the court invoked its extraordinary power to do complete justice and came to her rescue.""We would, in these circumstances, having regard to the peculiar facts of the case and in order to do complete justice, observe that Jay Narayan Maharaj and Radha Devi had lived and cared for each other, post the death of Ram Sawari Devi (first wife ) on April 20, 1984. Radha Devi at the old age should not be denied the 'status of spouse', which entitles her to receive family pension. This would help her live with dignity and help her financially.

NEW DELHI: Even as Congress on Wednesday filed a notice of breach of privilege against PM Modi for tweeting BJP MP Anurag Thakur 's speech with content that had allegedly been expunged, there was little likelihood of the move making any headway, report Akhilesh Singh & Subodh Ghildiyal. Congress notice submitted by Charanjit Singh Channi , ex-CM and a Dalit, claimed PM Modi had shared expunged parts of Thakur's speech.A BJP functionary called the Congress move a ""joke"".A Congress notice said PM Modi had praised Anurag Thakur’s speech that “disparaged the SC/ST/OBC communities for their demand of caste census”. If the notice is accepted by the Speaker, the privilege motion under Rule 222 of the Rules of Procedure would be moved against the PM.Congress submitted records of proceedings and Modi’s tweet of Thakur’s video in which the PM said the “speech by my young and energetic colleague Anurag Thakur is a must hear. A perfect mix of facts and humour, exposing the dirty politics of the INDI Alliance”.Sources in LS Secretariat, however, said that the complaint is unlikely to pass muster. “Congress members’ primary grouse against Thakur’s speech was to his remarks where talked about the lack of clarity about the caste of the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi. However, that part was not expunged since the BJP MP did not name anyone,” said a source familiar with the procedures.“If Congress’ notice of privilege motion is based on this part of the former Union minister’s speech, it cannot be deemed valid as that portion was never expunged,” said another source even though he said that the final decision on the matter will be that of Speaker Om Birla.Sources said that the only bit in Thakur’s speech which was expunged was his use of the word “lie”, twice, an unparliamentary expression. Amid Congress’ protests, presiding officer Jagdambika Pal, told Thakur that he could not use “lie” and suggested using “falsehood” instead. Thakur heeded the suggestion. “It does not warrant a privilege motion,” said sources in LS secretariat even as they reiterated that Birla will form an opinion after talking to Channi.“It is ironical that those whose own caste is not known are going around demanding caste census?” BJP MP had saidBJP was combative in response to Congress’s move and said there is a history of Congress MPs, including Rahul Gandhi, sharing video links of speeches of which large portions were expunged. Congress’ notice is nothing but politics, they claimed. “Congress functionaries should have done homework before taking such a move, which sounds like a joke as the parts of Thakur’s remarks, about which the party has mentioned, have not been expunged from the proceedings,” a senior BJP functionary said.In the notice, Channi said, “The PM’s tweeting of remarks which had been expunged from the proceedings of LS clearly amounts to a breach of privilege and contempt of the house.” He urged the Speaker to allow his notice to move the motion. Thakur’s speech on Tuesday triggered a furore as his remark about Rahul’s caste, albeit without naming, provoked a reply from the leader of opposition.","Congress filed a notice of breach of privilege against PM Modi for tweeting BJP MP Anurag Thakur's speech with content that had allegedly been expunged.

She said that though SC intervened, it only appears a temporary respite in view of BJP's intent, pointing out how the Centre has amended rules to permit bureaucracy to join RSS activities - noting that RSS calls itself a cultural outfit, but is the support base of the governing party.Sonia addressed the Congress parliamentary party meeting, touching upon various issues including the Budget, which she said has shown the govt brass as ""self-delusional"" in the wake of acute unemployment. ""There has been widespread disappointment in spite of the PM, finance minister and others talking up the Budget"", she said.She slammed the govt's unwillingness to hold Census, which is pending since 2021, pointing out that it will prevent an updation of national population, especially of SCs and STs, while excluding 12 crore citizens from the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana.Sonia also expressed concern over national security in view of rising terror attacks in J&K which ""makes a mockery of the claims of the Modi govt that all is well.""

Additionally, they will explore the possibility of conservation efforts. The meetingwill seek to underline how access to some of the artefacts will benefit the visitors - something that is the norm across the world. Another key issue will be the 'red list' dealing with theft, where states can play a crucial role.""We are at the pre-preparation stage. We are seeking to ensure better planning for good execution,"" a source, familiar with the deliberations, told TOI. The governance template, or the law on museums, is expected to be tabled either in the current session of Parliament or during the winter session. A scheme for transfers and internships is also being prepared for eight museums of national importance. Also, a consortium of 10 museums from France, including the Louvre is collaborating with the ministry of culture.The more challenging physical aspects are being handled by the ministry of housing and urban affairs, which will oversee the restoration of the North Block, currently home to the finance and home ministries.After the removal of multiple partitions in North Block, an architect will be brought in. South Block will become available only after the Prime Minister's Office and the ministries of defence and external affairs have moved out, but that may take some time. Other aspects, such as the entry of visitors into the high-security zone - which is currently off-limits to tourists - will also be finalised.","The Centre is gradually putting in place the building blocks for Yuge Yugeen Bharat Museum.
