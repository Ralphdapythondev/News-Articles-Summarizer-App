The recommendations have come at a time when several states are offering bonus over MSP or political parties have made this poll promise before getting elected.It made these recommendations in its latest 'Price Policy for Kharif Crop' report, which contains MSP for summer crops. It recommended that procurement of rice and wheat should be restricted in those states that impose high charges and pay bonus, in order to bring parity among states. Odisha is the latest state to announce bonus on MSP for paddy after BJP came to office this month.""Unsustainable and uneconomical practice of offering bonus over and above MSP for paddy procurement by state govts creates distortions in the market.

In addition, the duty differential between crude and refined oil should be kept at 10-15%.","Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) has urged states not to announce bonus over MSP fixed by Centre for paddy as this ""distorts the market"" Odisha is the latest state to announced bonus on MSP for paddle after BJP came to office this month.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111213711,imgsize-1184298,width-400,resizemode-4/111213711.jpg"

Tajikistan bans hijab in campaign against public religiosity: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tajikistan-bans-hijab-in-campaign-against-public-religiosity-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/111195960.cms,"Ban on hijab in Tajikistan: All you need to know

Tajikistan president Emomali Rahmon gave his assent to the bill to prohibit hijab, AKIpress reported. The lower chamber of parliament approved the bill on June 8, reported Asia Plus. The law mostly targets the hijab, or Islamic head scarf, and other traditional items of Islamic clothing, which started coming to Tajikistan in recent years from the Middle East. Tajikistan sees hijab associated with Islamic extremists. Penalties for offenders vary from the equivalent of 7,920 somonis for individuals and to 39,500 somonis for legal entities. Government officials and religious authorities reportedly face much higher fines of 54,000 somonis and 57,600 somonis, respectively, if found guilty. There was an unofficial ban on hijab in Tajikistan for years. The education ministry banned both Islamic clothing and western-style miniskirts for students in 2007. The government wants to promote Tajik national dress instead and conducted campaigns for the same in recent years. Tajikistan has also unofficially banned bushy beards. There are existing laws in the country to restrict Islamic prayer to specific locations. Two years ago, selling black clothes was banned in the countryâs capital city Dushanbe. The official hijab ban has been condemned by the Union of Islamic Scholars and clerics in Afghanistan, and by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""Banning the hijab is a violation of religious freedom and such bans on religious attire should have no place in any nation that respects the rights of its people,"" said CAIR director Corey Saylor.

Tajikistan parliament has approved the law banning hijab referred to as 'alien garments' ahead of Eid al-Fitr and Eid Al-Adha imposing penalties for offenders. The move comes as part of the government's continuous efforts to curb public display of religion and to promote Tajiki culture. It also banned Idi, the custom in which children seek gift and money during Eid. The Muslim-majority country is dominated by various sects of Islam -- Sunni Muslim population in majority.","Tajikistan president Emomali Rahmon gave his assent to the bill to prohibit hijab.

Rise in high scorers in MHT-CET 2024 signals shift in engineering course preferences

Most engineering aspirants who took the MHT-CET exam scored between 60-70 percentile, impacting admission cutoffs. Preferences of students may influence cutoff trends for popular courses like computer engineering.

Nine of 37 in MHT-CET 100 percentile from Mumbai

37 students, including 9 from Mumbai, scored 100th percentile in MHT-CET for engineering and pharmacy courses in Maharashtra. CAP schedule to be declared soon. CET Cell results showed a drop in cut-offs for popular courses like computer engineering. Principal Hari Vasudevan of DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering mentioned the job scenario is bleak.

MUMBAI: The state has decided to hold another CET for BMS , BBA and BCA admissions . Admitting to teething problems since a CET for the courses was held for the first time this year, an official said the centralised admission process (CAP) rounds will commence only after the results of the second exam are out. Students have been asked to visit the CET cellâs portal regularly for updates on the exam.CET is not applicable to colleges that have opted for a change in nomenclature of the courses â for instance, BMS to BCom (Management Studies). Students who have appeared for the first CET can take the test again to improve their scores .A principal from a city college, however, expressed concern about the development affecting academic schedule. âFor BMS and BBA, we will now have to follow a completely different schedule since most other admissions are almost coming to an end. Also, after two months of studying other courses, if students move out to secure admissions in BMS or in a better college, then many will be left with vacant seats in the middle of the term,â the principal said.Several students were not aware of the first CET.

You must have seen the sadness in my eyes when I stood in front of the media and told about the decision. Why should I be so sad? I met you five years ago. I came that day to request the support of each and every one of you. I was a stranger to you. And yet you believed me. You received me with unspeakable love and affection.

"Amid 'darknet' threat, NTA now in complete meltdown",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-darknet-threat-nta-now-in-complete-meltdown/articleshow/111212936.cms,"Big shake-up in tech needed to secure exams: Official

NEW DELHI: The National Testing Agency ( NTA ) is experiencing a complete meltdown , with staff unsure about safe delivery of any exam due to the 'darknet' threat. Despite the challenges, there is still an expectation to conduct and announce results on time to prevent delays in the academic calendar, which managed to get back on track last year after the Covid-19 disruptions in 2020.Another major concern is keeping the agency together amid rumours of officials on deputation looking to leave.Veteran staff members believe that whether exams are computer-based or offline, it will be difficult to regain confidence until the agency's fundamentals are regrouped. The NTA has had to cancel three national-level tests, including two - National Common Entrance Test (NCET) 2024 for admission to the four-year integrated teacher education program (ITEP) and the University Grants Commission-National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET) - after the exams were conducted. CSIR-UGC-NET was postponed days before the exam.""A big shake-up in technology and capacity building is needed,"" said a senior official. He noted that merely looking at exam models proposed by the forthcoming high-powered committee will not be enough. For example, the computer-based ITEP had to be cancelled ""despite having a comparatively smaller number of candidates. Each file was around 5GB, and when downloaded at the centres, they received distorted question papers"".ITEP is the entrance test for select central and state universities, IITs, NITs, RIEs, and govt colleges for integrated teacher education programmes.Sources in the IT department are confident that CUET-UG results could be ready by June 30, but they are uncertain about the rescheduling of the cancelled and postponed exams. Citing the example of the All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT) paper leak in 2004, where CBSE managed to hold the exam within a week, an NTA source said the agency's secrecy department, IT, and administrative staff ""don't feel it's possible now"" due to fears that organisations using the 'dark web' have completely hacked into NTA'ssecurity protocols and ""have decided to expose the chinks this year"".""They are not going to stop. The dark web is used by terrorist organisations. We are not sure how safe even our black box (where question papers are stored) is,"" said a worried official, indicating that NTA doesn't have the capacity to thwart such ""organised attacks"". A source in the govt added, ""A national level think tank needs to work on such threats.""While questioning the recent functioning of the agency, insiders insist there have been no ""paper leaks in Bihar"". ""Two days ago, Bihar Police asked for details of six candidates, sharing their roll numbers. Two of the roll numbers don't exist, in another two, the names and roll numbers don't match. There are so many contradictions, including the timing of the seizures, which was post-exam when all the question papers are already in the public domain,"" said an official from NTA's computer section.Within the autonomous organisation, there are strong rumours of a ""big exodus"" of officials on deputation who feel their careers are at stake.","Staff unsure about safe delivery of any exam due to the 'darknet' threat.

CBI registers FIR in alleged NEET-UG paper leak case, say officials

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing controversy over the irregularities in national-level examinations and paper leaks, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor took a swipe at the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government with a âUttar Pradesh kise kehte hain? (Define Uttar Pradesh .)â meme. The post, however, has drawn sharp criticism from the BJP accusing Tharoor of stereotyping the state.In a post on X, the Congress MP on Saturday shared a viral post, showing an image of an answer sheet with a question asking the students to 'define Uttar Pradesh'. And the answer: ""Wah pradesh jahan pariksha se pehle uttar ka pata chal jaaye, usse Uttar Pradesh kehte hai (The state where the answer is known before the exam is called Uttar Pradesh).""This post, however, didn't go well with the BJP and the senior Congress leader faced backlash.Responding to Shashi Tharoor's post, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, ""This gentleman frequently indulges in satirizing various cultures (first Northeast and now UP) with remarkably caustic words. He has succumbed to the beguiling whispers of lunacy, his mind adrift in the ethereal mists of derangement.""Meanwhile, Union minister Jitin Prasad said that Tharoor's remark is an insult to UP is deplorable and must be condemned.BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan called Tharoor a ârepeat offenderâ and alleged that he had earlier insulted the people of the northeast by âridiculing their traditional attire as outlandish.ââTo belittle a serious issue, implying that the state of UP is a state of cheaters is indefensible and unpardonable. Splattering fancy English words does not necessarily make one civil and dignified,â he added.State minister AK Sharma also responded to Tharoor's post and said that after winning the election the 'dead Congress' even didn't thank people properly and had already insulted those who had voted for their party. He also highlighted some great leaders born in the UP.""Congress, which has insulted Uttar Pradesh in this manner, should apologise to the people of the state. Otherwise, the people here will take revenge from them. This mentality of Congress is highly condemnable,"" he added.Former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar, who lost against Tharoor in the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha seat, said, âShameless crass politics of shaming other fellow Indians - thats the Congress way, ably demonstrated by this self-titled Global citizen.âReferring to the recent controversy around Sam Pitroda's description of Indian nationals from different parts of the country, he added, âRuns deep in the Cong DNA, this type of superiority complex.âBJP leader and Rajasthan minister Rajyavardhan Rathore said, âShashi, you having to resort to frivolity!! And in doing so condemning people of an entire state? You donât see UP as yours, since you are deriding it. When a person of your stature and intelligence mocks a State, why wouldnât others do? And then what!!âThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a First Information Report (FIR) regarding alleged irregularities in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Undergraduate (NEET-UG) conducted on May 5, according to officials on Sunday. The agency is also taking measures to include cases filed by police in various states under its jurisdiction.This development follows the Centre's announcement on Saturday that the investigation into the alleged irregularities would be transferred to the CBI. The agency has initiated a new case against unidentified individuals under sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), among others, based on a reference from the Union education ministry.The NEET-UG examination was conducted across 4,750 centers, with approximately 24 lakh candidates participating. The decision to hand over the probe to the CBI was made after a review, in response to demands from students protesting in several cities for an investigation into alleged malpractices during the examination.""Certain cases of alleged irregularities, cheating, impersonation and malpractice have been reported in NEET-UG which was conducted on May 5,"" a senior education ministry official said.""For transparency in the conduct of the examination process, it was decided after a review that the matter be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for a comprehensive investigation,"" the official added.Meanwhile, minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas of India Hardeep Singh Puri in his X post said, ""Seriously, Shashi Tharoor is this the level to which you wish to take this discourse? Uttar Pradesh is not only known for its contribution to our civilisation but has also produced innumerable literary luminaries, political stalwarts & achievers. Ironically, it is also home to the first family, to which all Congress leaders pay obeisance.

files FIR over

alleged irregularities

in NEET-UG

Key developments since May 5 NEET exam

The CBI's involvement follows the education ministry's announcement to hand over the probe, a move that some protesting students had demanded. The CBI has registered a new case against unidentified individuals under Indian Penal Code sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating), among others.

The development comes after widespread protests and student litigation regarding paper leak claims. The accusations of irregularities led to protests in various cities, legal battles, and political disputes, with the opposition accusing the government of jeopardising students' futures.

Ten students have approached the Supreme Court, seeking directions for the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to investigate the alleged irregularities in NEET-UG. Their petition also requests that the Bihar Police expedite their investigation and submit a report to the apex court.

In another instance, the Supreme Court has asked the Center, the National Testing Agency (NTA), and others to respond to multiple petitions, including those calling for the cancellation of the NEET-UG 2024 exam and a court-monitored probe. The court has also paused proceedings on similar petitions in various high courts.

Following criticism over alleged discrepancies in various competitive exams, the central government has replaced NTA Director General Subodh Singh. Additionally, a seven-member panel led by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan has been established to review the NTA's functioning and suggest exam reforms.

NEW DELHI: National Testing Agency (NTA) on Sunday said that 750 of 1,563 students who were awarded grace marks skipped the retest conducted for NEET-UG candidates. Meanwhile,813 appeared for the retest after an order from the Supreme Court.The retest took place at seven centers. An official reported, âAs many as 813 of the 1,563 candidates who were earlier awarded grace marks in NEET-UG appeared for a retest on Sunday.âAmong them was an exam center in Chandigarh which was set up with all necessary arrangements including police and invigilators. However, it closed its gates after two students scheduled for the NEET-UG retest on Sunday did not show up.The NEET-UG exam, administered by the NTA on May 5, took place across 4,750 centers in 571 cities, including 14 international locations. Over 23 lakh candidates participated in the examination.An unprecedented number of studentsâ67âscored a perfect 720, raising concerns about potential irregularities. Among these, six students from a center in Faridabad, Haryana, have attracted particular suspicion.Controversy also arose over grace marks awarded to students affected by time loss at six centers due to a late start. The Center informed the Supreme Court that these grace marks would be scrapped, and 1,563 affected students would be offered a retest.The NEET-UG examination is a critical pathway for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH, and other related courses in both government and private institutions nationally.The NEET-PG entrance exam has also been postponed, marking the fourth entrance exam affected recently.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed an FIR over alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG exam conducted on May 5, following a reference from the Union education ministry.

"From paper leak to training students, tech-savvy 'handlers' run exam racket",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/from-paper-leak-to-training-students-tech-savvy-handlers-run-exam-racket/articleshow/111212849.cms,"NEET Row: Tharoor's Uttar Pradesh Jibe Irks BJP Netas; 'Insulting State...'

PATNA: When it comes to job description, the versatility of a ""handler"" is no longer limited to airport cargo, the police dog squad, political campaigns, or even a spy ring.Investigators piecing together the conspiracy behind the NEET-UG paper leak have a handle on how "" handlers "" operate in the shady realm of the nationwide exam racket whose roots have been traced to Bihar and Jharkhand ""The nine handlers arrested in the NEET-UG case so far - six in Jharkhand and three in Bihar - are tech-savvy individuals who played a crucial role in orchestrating the leak of question papers, training examinees who paid for these to memorise the answers, and even escorting them to their respective centres,"" a senior police officer said.The six handlers arrested from Jharkhand's Deoghar used to reside in rented accommodation, masquerading as labourers. Their brief was to ensure the leaked papers reached the intended recipients while maintaining high secrecy and anonymity.""Once a particular exam got over, they would get to work on identifying the chinks in the system for the next one,"" the officer said.To expand their client base, these handlers would look for opportunities to connect with coaching centres, schools and colleges on some pretext. They would seek out individuals associated with the exam process, aiming to bribe them into getting useful information.Bihar Police's raid on a safe house based on a tip-off on the morning of the May 5 NEET-UG exam threw up evidence of these handlers herding around 30 candidates into this meeting place at Ram Krishna Nagar on Patna's outskirts on the eve of the test.""The examinees were there through the night to memorise answers to the leaked question papers. The handlers then transported them to their exam centres in private vehicles, taking all necessary precautions to ensure their safety,"" the officer said.Online form submission for entrance exams was introduced nationwide around 2010, replacing the earlier method of sending applications by mail. The older system had loopholes that fraudsters and corrupt officials would easily exploit.""Before the introduction of online forms, examination conducting agencies would assign roll numbers based on when they received the application envelopes. Criminals exploited this system by sending multiple application forms in a single envelope, using codes like 'bogie' and 'engine' to refer to candidates and their proxies, respectively,"" said an IPS officer of the Bihar cadre.""This strategy ensured that all these candidates were allocated roll numbers for the same examination centre and hall, facilitating cheating.""Another senior IPS officer said paper leaks could occur at various stages-from when these papers are compiled to their storage in bank currency chests before being transported to the exam centres.He said the older cheating methods included replacing candidates with proxies after videography verification at the exam centres and altering optical mark recognition (OMR) sheets later. ""Handlers gathering their clients in one place to memorise answers under their guidance is a new trend. This is meant to eliminate a paper trail.""Vishal Kumar, an IPS officer formerly with the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) probing the NEET-UG paper leak in Bihar, said three significant gangs were active in the state. One is suspected to be led by Ranjit Kumar Singh, alias Ranjit Don, accused of masterminding multiple paper leaks before foraying into politics.","Nine handlers arrested in the NEET-UG case so far - six in Jharkhand and three in Bihar.

Around 35% of the investment will come from the private sector.TOI has learnt that the master plan for highway development has been proposed in two phases. Officials participating in the inter-ministerial meeting chaired by road transport secretary Anurag Jain said the ministry has finalised the roadmap to tender all projects under phase-1 by 2028-29 and complete them by 2031-32. The Rs 22 lakh crore estimate is for projects to be taken up in the first phase.The ministry has requested 10% annual increase in budgetary allocation for project implementation. In the interim budget, govt had allocated Rs 2,78,000 crore for the ministry, marking a 2.7% increase from the previous financial year.The financial estimate in the second phase to develop 28,400 km will be determined later. As per the plan, sanctioning and awarding of stretches under phase-2 will be completed by 2033-34, with construction finishing by 2036-37.The ministry highlighted how it has planned the development of NH and expressways after carrying out assessment of GSTN data, including commodities transported from point to point and has also taken into account transportation of cargo by trains.The analysis of GSTN data showed nearly 73% of freight was transported by road in 2021-22, with railways accounting for around 23%. The data also showed that for commodities transported less than 350 km, 82% was moved by road, and for distances over 600 km, 62% was transported by road.Once completed, the average travel speed of trucks on the national highway network will go up to 85 kmph from the current 47 kmph. The average travel speed on highways is over 100 kmph in the US and 90 kmph in China. Govt expects that increasing the average speed will help India achieve its target of reducing logistics costs to 9-10% of GDP.High-speed corridors have been identified to ensure that such stretches are accessible within 100-150 km from any part of India. Currently, only 3,900 km of high-speed corridors are operational, and by 2026-27, this figure is expected to rise to around 11,000 km.","Road transport and highways ministry has sought Cabinet approval for Rs 22 lakh crore investment in a highway development plan covering around 30,600 km by 2031-32.

The apex court, which is scheduled to hear the matter on July 8, has not stopped the counselling process, but has not ruled out cancellation. Sources debunked allegations that the toppers were bunched in ""particular centres"".NTA sources said of the 19 suspects identified by Bihar Police, two were not ""valid candidates"".

""India needs a flexible and less stressful exam system like the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), the admission test for colleges in the US,"" Pradhan told the media.Bihar Police submitted a report on the investigation sought by the education ministry on Saturday. ""Prima facie from the report, the incident seems localised. But to get to the root of the matter is important, which is why a thorough investigation is being sought by CBI,"" a senior govt official said.Pradhan said, ""Let the professional agency do the probe.

""Action on NTA and reform of the agency has been initiated, and the probe handed over to CBI.""Pradhan also said this was the time to ""reduce the anxiety of students and rebuild their trust by safeguarding their interest"", and refused to comment on the allegations levelled by the opposition as well as the demand for his resignation. He, however, indicated that he would put the facts before the House during the first Parliament session of the 18th Lok Sabha starting on Monday.Govt sources said apart from NTA reforms, the ""coaching mafia"" had also emerged as a concern, indicating that the whole irregularities issue was driven by it. They said expensive private coaching was made a ""compulsion"" among the middle class, whereas NEET-UG 2024 results showed that students from rural areas and those without coaching could also perform well.","National Testing Agency ( NTA ) on Sunday maintained that the ""leak"" was a localised affair.

The ministry of education has announced the formation of a high-powered committee to review all aspects of the examination process and functioning of NTA. Some experts argue that computer-based tests (CBT) are more secure than traditional pen-and-paper exams.Under scanner, NTA officials acknowledged challenges of conducting exams securely in both formats despite adhering to all security protocols. They suggested a year-round exam model similar to scholastic aptitude test (SAT) conducted by college board, educational testing service in the US, allowing candidates to appear multiple times and use their best score for college admissions.While NEET-UG has traditionally been a single-sitting pen-and-paper exam, UGC-NET, which has been computer-based since 2018, reverted to a pen-and-paper OMR mode on Tuesday. However, the exam was cancelled following inputs from national cybercrime threat analytics unit of Indian cybercrime coordination centre (I4C) indicating it had been compromised.Some believe that computer-based testing is the future due to reduced human involvement. Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council, said: ""it may be a good idea to make the NEET-UG exam computer-based. The govt can allow the exam to be taken twice a year to make the process more efficient and avoid any shortage of computers or other infrastructure related problems.""A senior official from Greater Noida Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) also supports adopting CBT models to minimise paper leak risks, stating that such allegations undermine integrity of the examination process and the medical profession.In 2018-19, the education ministry proposed a computer-based multi-session mode for NEET-UG, similar to the JEE (Main), but this did not gain traction within the health ministry. Former HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal had mentioned the possibility of biannual and digital NEET-UG exams, but he later retracted his statement.A senior govt official said CBT spread over multiple days or sessions would limit impact of single-day/ session leak and would make it easier to track due to digital footprints, as seen in 2021 JEE (Main). S Vaidhyasubramaniam, vice-chancellor of SASTRA deemed university, Chennai, advocated for combination of CBT and board exam marks weightage. He said ""not only is CBT more reliable, but mixed weightage for class XII and NEET scores will reduce coaching class syndrome and provide balance.""",The ministry of education has announced the formation of a high-powered committee to review all aspects of the examination process and functioning of NTA.

Indignation was directed at the National Testing Agency (NTA), which many candidates called âirresponsibleâ.Among the 2 lakh candidates who were to sit for NEET-PG, there were many who had travelled long distances and following carefully nurtured dreams to reach the exam centres â like Neha Tabassum, who came to Noida from Jammu with her husband, spending Rs 12,000 on tickets and a hotel, money that went down the drain. âI discovered the exam was postponed only when I was on my way to the centre in the morning. It took two years of preparation, and this would have been my second attempt. What kind of exam arrangement is this? Itâs frustrating,â she said.Sunanda Pansari, who came to an exam centre in Bhubaneswar from Kalahandi in Odisha, 600km away, said it was exasperating that the examâs dates had been changed four times. âThis is extremely wrong. I have travelled 600km to attend the exam. We should have been informed at least 24 hours in advance about the decision. There is also no information (from govt) on the paper leak as of now,â she said, referring to the NEET-UG fiasco.K Nageswara Rao, whose son was to take the exam in Visakhapatnam, travelled 200km to reach the Andhra Pradesh capital from East Godavari. âIt was a bolt from the blue,â he said of the sudden cancellation. âNo one has a clue when the exam will be held next. My son quit his job to prepare for a year. Now, he is not sure what to do, go back to working immediately or wait till the exam dates are announced again,â he said.Sankha Mandal, a medical officer with the railways who was to appear for NEET-PG at a centre in Kolkata, was similarly distraught. âItâs very tough to prepare for such a tough competitive exam while working a full-time job. The indefinite wait for the next date is painful,â he said.Outside iON Digital Zone in Noida, one of the exam venues in Delhi-NCR, K Murli from Bangalore, who has been staying in Delhi to prepare for NEET PG, said the examâs dates had anyway been changed three times already and the uncertainty has driven up stress levels. âThe first date for NEET PG this year was March 3, then it was postponed to July 7 and again advanced to June 23. Now, it has been postponed till further notice, this time just 12 hours before the exam. This uncertainty is extremely stressful. The exam system and management need to think from a studentâs perspective,â he said.Lambasting NTA, whose director-general Subodh Singh was removed by govt on Saturday evening as the nodal examination body battles a crisis, Atul, an MBBS graduate from Delhi, asked, âHow does one pursue academics in such a shaky and mismanaged scenario? This is the third major exam to be cancelled within a week after UGC-NET and CSIR-UGC NET.âAnother MBBS grad, Ankit, who lives in Ghaziabad, said he left his job just to prepare for NEET PG. âI am shocked by the uncertainty over a national exam like NEET,â he said.Neelam Upadhyay, a Delhi resident, knew about the postponement, but felt she could not trust anything till she saw for herself because of the amount of misinformation that swirls around. So, she landed up at the Noida centre. âI came just to check if the notification about the exam cancellation was real or fake news,â she said.Renu Aggarwal, the chief medical superintendent of the district hospital in Noida was there too, not as a govt representative but as a mother. Her son was to appear for NEET PG. âIf they wanted to postpone the exam for security reasons, they should have done it earlier, giving time to students. Many students got harassed due to this sudden change,â she said.Ankita, a candidate from Gurgaon, said postponement was annoying, but âit is better this way than to rewrite the paper, if a paper leak were to be foundâ.Outside an exam centre in Jaipur, Yash Dubey, a practising doctor, pointed out that the delay would prove costly for some candidates. âThere are many candidates who are opting for Institute of National Importance Combined Entrance Test (INI-CET) counselling to get a PG seat at AIIMS. Those who get a seat via INI-CET but give it up have to pay Rs 3 lakh. Now, with a delay in NEET-PG, candidates who thought of bettering their rank and landing a seat in their desired course at AIIMS will have to take up seats in whichever courses they have got at present through INI-CET. This will at least assure them of a PG seat. Later, however, if they get their desired course through NEET-PG, they will have to vacate the INI-CET seat, and for this, have to pay Rs 3 lakh. How is this fair?â he asked.(With inputs from Uma Mahesh in Vizag, Nirupa Vatyam in Hyderabad, Suparna Roy in Jaipur and Poulami Roy in Kolkata)","Only 52%, or 813, of the 1,563 candidates across seven centres, who were earlier awarded grace marks due to loss of time in the NEET-UG exam, appeared for the retest on Sunday. The others have opted for their original score without the grace marks. No candidates appeared in Chandigarh, while the numbers were 291 in Chhattisgarh, one in Gujarat, 287 in Haryana, and 234 in Meghalaya.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111212910,imgsize-1665634,width-400,resizemode-4/111212910.jpg"

Pakistan opposition contests PM Sharifâs nationwide military operation plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-opposition-contests-pm-sharifs-nationwide-military-operation-plan/articleshow/111212313.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Opposition parties in Pakistan criticised PM Shehbaz Sharifâs decision to initiate a nationwide military operation named Azm-i-Istehkam (Commitment for Stability), which aims to eradicate extremism and terrorism in the country. The move came shortly after Beijing warned Islamabad and identified security as a critical challenge threatening China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).Former PM Imran Khanâs Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party, alongside other opposition lawmakers, rejected the military operation without prior parliamentary consultation. âIt is our demand that if there is any operation, whether intelligence-based or full-fledged or in certain districts, villages, or tehsils, it is necessary to take this parliament into confidence,â PTI chairman Gohar Khan said. He called for an in-camera briefing by military officers, referencing previous practices.Leader of the opposition Omar Ayub Khan echoed the call for parliamentary approval for military operations. âChinese officials, during their visit, expressed concerns over CPEC security,â he said.Militants have increasingly targeted Chinese interests in Pakistan, particularly in the northwest and southwest regions, including CPEC. In March, two attacks highlighted the ongoing threats: an attempted breach of Gwadar Port Authority complex by Baloch Liberation Army and a suicide bombing in Shangla district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa targeting a convoy of Chinese engineers, resulting in multiple fatalities.High-ranking Chinese official Liu Jianchao underscored the security threats to CPEC as primary hazards to the projectâs cooperation and success. âAs people often say, confidence is more precious than gold. In the case of Pakistan, the primary factor shaking the confidence of Chinese investors is the security situation,â Jianchao said at the third meeting of the Pakistan-China joint consultative mechanism.PM Sharif âs office announced Saturday the operation, asserting the deployment of Pakistanâs comprehensive military, diplomatic, legislative, and socio-economic resources to counter terrorism and extremism decisively.",Opposition parties in Pakistan criticised PM Shehbaz Sharifâs decision to initiate a nationwide military operation named Azm-i-Istehkam.

Kavach is an automatic train protection system that can prevent train collisions on the same track.Chairing a review meeting on the latest version of Kavach 4.0, Vaishnaw instructed officials to install the system on all locos as soon as it is ready. Officials said while currently there are three manufacturers of Kavach system, more manufacturers are developing it and these are in various stages.Officials said the railways has set the target to complete installing Kavach on Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Howrah route by March 2024 and tenders for another 6,000-km would be floated by this year end.Most major railway systems in the world moved to automatic train protection system (ATP) akin to Kavach in the 1980s. Indian Railway started this journey with approval of the first version of Train Collision Avoidance System (TACS) in 2016. The system went through trials and was tested to achieve SIL-4 in 2019, the highest level of safety certification.This was subsequently approved as the national ATP system in 2020.","Kavach is an automatic train protection system that can prevent train collisions on the same track.
