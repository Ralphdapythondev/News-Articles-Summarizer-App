'MSP for stubble should be fixed': Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/msp-for-stubble-should-be-fixed-congress-leader-bhupinder-singh-hooda/articleshow/114388115.cms,"CHANDIGARH: Addressing the issue of stubble burning , Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda stated that a Minimum Support Price ( MSP ) should be set for stubble, highlighting its various potential uses, according to the PRO.Hooda on Saturday, said, ""MSP for stubble should be fixed. The question is, what will small farmers do with the stubble? Not purchasing crops from farmers is wrong. A solution must be found for this.Stubble has numerous other uses, including electricity generation. It needs to be utilised effectively.""Earlier on Saturday, environmentalist Vimlendu Jha pointed out that stubble burning was one of the primary causes of increased pollution in North India.Speaking to ANI, Jha remarked, ""Stubble burning is one of the reasons for the rise in air pollution in North India. In addition to this, Delhi has yet to experience the winds from Punjab. The local sources of pollution here are dust and vehicular emissions. Both the state and central governments need to collaborate to find solutions.""However, Jha also emphasised that the primary causes of pollution in Delhi were vehicular emissions and dust.""Roadside dust contributes 30%, and public vehicles account for another 30% of the pollution. Stubble burning only lasts for 25-30 days. The rest of the year, local factors are the main contributors to pollution,"" he explained.On October 16, the Supreme Court summoned the Chief Secretaries of Punjab and Haryana, demanding an explanation as to why legal action had not been taken against stubble burning in their states.Recent figures from Punjab and Haryana show an increase in stubble burning over the past week compared to last year, raising alarms as another Delhi winter approaches.Stubble burning has become a critical concern in Delhi, as the winter season traps pollutants, leading to hazardous air quality and dense smog. The burning of crop residue in neighbouring states significantly exacerbates pollution, posing serious health risks to residents.","Stubble burning has become a critical concern in Delhi, as the winter season traps pollutants, leading to hazardous air quality and dense smog.

"RJD fumes after JMM, Congress declare Jharkhand seat deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rjd-fumes-after-jmm-cong-declare-jharkhand-seat-deal/articleshow/114383864.cms,"Not just RJD, Left also absent during Hemant presser

RANCHI: INDIA bloc ’s election campaign in Jharkhand hit choppy waters on Saturday after an alleged unilateral seat-sharing arrangement between JMM and Congress left RJD fuming.Trouble began in the afternoon after CM and JMM executive president Hemant Soren , accompanied by netas of Congress, announced that JMM and the grand old party would field candidates in 70 of the 81 assembly seats.“We will also have a new partner in our alliance — Left parties,” Hemant said.That RJD was not happy with the deal was made clear as its senior functionary and former Bihar deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav , who was in town, was not seen with Hemant and Congress politicians when the announcement was made. The RJD politician had called upon Hemant soon after arriving on Friday night. Soon after the seat-sharing announcement, Tejashwi went into a huddle with senior politicians and members of his party’s Jharkhand unit.Meanwhile, sources said that of the 70 seats between them, JMM is eyeing contesting 44 seats while Congress will settle for 26. Hemant, however, stopped short of announcing the candidates. He said the “candidates will be finalised in consultation with our alliance partners”. What struck observers was the absence of not only Tejashwi but also members of the Left during the announcement at Hemant’s residence.RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha said, “We are saddened and unhappy with the unilateral announcement made by Congress and JMM regarding seat-sharing. Due consultation process was not followed even as our top leaders, including Tejahswi, were in Ranchi.”RJD’s discontent stemmed from the fact that its netas were eyeing 15 to 18 seats. “We have a strong presence in several districts. The alliance partners should make the decision taking in view the prevailing circumstances.” Jha said, stressing that the party was keeping all its options open. “No party can neglect the sentiments of its representatives and workers,” he added.Notably, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and Hemant arrived at the hotel where Tejashwi was holding a meeting with other RJD politicians. Subsequently, minister Satynand Bhokta told the media that differences within the alliance would be removed. Later in the evening, Tejashwi and the RJD entourage met Hemant at his home.For the Left’s part, CPI-ML politburo member Janardhan Prasad said, “We strongly object to the announcement made by just two parties regarding the seat-sharing. They should have consulted other parties as well.” CPI-ML state secretary Manoj Bhakt said his party was preparing for 13 seats but there are at least six seats where it would fight the election. He said the announcement was vague about how many seats CPI-ML would get.","Trouble began in the afternoon after JMM and the grand old party would field candidates in 70 of the 81 assembly seats.

Extradition of ex-RAW agent Vikash Yadav may take years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/extradition-of-ex-raw-agent-may-take-years/articleshow/114383618.cms,"India may send US Headley extradition reminder

NEW DELHI: The arrest of Vikash Yadav , a former RAW officer who has been accused by the US of masterminding a plot to kill pro-Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on American soil, may complicate efforts by the US to get him extradited.While a US move to secure the extradition of Yadav looks to be a logical corollary of the decision to put him on the “most wanted” list, Delhi Police ’s allegation about his complicity in offences of robbery and kidnapping, each punishable with 10 years, may prove to be a tough obstacle.Yadav, an assistant commandant with CRPF before he joined RAW on deputation, was held in Dec last year. He is out on regular bail and is sure to contest the charge that he took to serious crime after being discharged from service due to the US allegations.Going by the speed at which such cases move in Indian courts, it might be quite a while before the case is adjudicated.Yadav can be extradited only after the conclusion of the trial and not before he, if adjudged guilty, has served his sentence.There are also indications that India may send another reminder to the US about its pending request for the extradition of David Coleman Headley, aka Dawood Gilani, an operative of Lashkar-e-Toiba , who conducted recce for the gang that carried out the bloody 26/11 rampage in Mumbai, killing over 150 innocent civilians who, importantly, included US citizens. A US citizen of Pakistani origin who also worked as an informant for the US Drug Enforcement Agency, Dawood had travelled to India on a US passport to dodge the scrutiny that Pakistani nationals are subjected to.India’s request for the extradition of Tahawwur Rana , a Canadian travel agent of Pakistani origin who helped the Lashkar plot by arranging for tickets for Headley, is also pending. While the US court has cleared Rana’s extradition from a Los Angeles prison, his lawyers have deployed fresh tricks to frustrate India’s effort to face the law here.Rana had filed a habeas corpus petition to oppose his extradition, but it was rejected, and the extradition was approved last year. In its ruling, the panel also held that India had presented adequate and competent evidence to back the magistrate judge’s determination of probable cause that Rana was involved in the charged crimes. The jury found him guilty of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organisation and conspiring to support an abortive Lashkar plot in Denmark.Of the two, handing over Headley, currently in Chicago prison, may be more difficult for the US because of his deep links with DEA which appears to have led to overlooking of signs pointing to his links with LeT.Last year, Vikash Yadav and his alleged associates were booked on charges of robbery and kidnapping for ransom on the complaint of one Rajkumar Walia, the owner of Markaz Cafe and Lounge in Delhi. Both offences carry a punishment of 10 years.In his complaint, Walia had alleged Yadav and his aide Abdullah Khan had abducted him in an Ertiga car and taken him to a room in Defence Colony in south Delhi. Once there, Walia was informed that his Dubai-based rival named Jalaluddin alias Sameer had ordered a hit on him and that the matter could be settled if he paid money. They allegedly demanded Rs 20 lakh and took away Rs 50,000, besides a chain and a ring.","Former RAW officer Vikash Yadav has been accused by the US of masterminding a plot to kill pro-Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on American soil.

Nagpur’s bomb bazaar makes explosive profits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nagpurs-bomb-bazaar-makes-explosive-profits/articleshow/114383436.cms,"Nagpur companies shipped out Rs 900 crore arms in 3 months, Rs 3,000 crore to go

NAGPUR: As the flash of guns light up the Russia-Ukraine war front and rockets fly in West Asia, cash registers are ringing at explosives manufacturing units in Nagpur, more than 4,500 km from the battle zones. The city is already informally known as India’s explosives capital where representatives of global arms corporations window-shop along a 30-km stretch on Nagpur’s outskirts.The buyers thronging Nagpur are mostly from Bulgaria, Spain, Germany, South Africa, Vietnam, Poland, Brazil, and even Saudi Arabia.There are no conflicts in these countries, yet there’s huge demand from them. These countries are stashing ammunition on a war footing.Sources told TOI the final destination of these munitions could be somewhere else. Shells of 155mm calibre, fired from howitzer guns, and 40mm shoulder-fired rockets have high demand, say top sources in the business. In the last three months, orders for Rs 900 crore worth of shells, rockets and other bombs have been dispatched and orders of at least Rs 3,000 crore are under execution. A similar count is expected for raw explosive powder, say industry sources.From listed companies and mid-sized ancillary units to newly formed defence public sector undertakings, it’s raining orders. “No, we aren’t supplying even a single round of ammo to any nation at war,” the manufacturers insist.Buyers from other countries are issuing end-use certificates and, based on these, Indian manufacturers are getting govt licences to sell. Exports are banned to certain countries due to geo-political equations, said top arms industry sources.Since countries are issuing end-use certificates, it means the munitions are for their own consumption. Officially, the Indian military industry is not profiteering from war, said manufacturers here. The ministry of commerce maintains district-wise export figures. Data from fiscal 2021-22 till the current fiscal is available on the website.This year, there is a new category in the export list from Nagpur: bombs and grenades. Bombs worth Rs 770 crore have been exported from Nagpur from April to June. Figures for the next quarter are yet to be compiled. Consignments were sent from neighbouring Chandrapur district, too, over the last two years. In the last fiscal, consignments of bombs worth Rs 458 crore were sent out from Chandrapur. The value of exports from April to June this year stands at Rs 171 crore for the district.The bombs and grenades category stands for complete ammunition. These are ready-to-fire rounds. In Nagpur, Yantra India Ltd (YIL), a PSU formed out of Ordnance Factory Ambhajhari three years ago, makes shells. In 1999, when India fell short of shells during the Kargil war, the same unit stepped up production on a war footing to feed the Bofors guns that changed the game on the glaciers.Another PSU, Munitions India Ltd (MIL), has ordnance factories at Chandrapur and Bhandara that load shells with explosives. Both public corporations (MIL & YIL) share a symbiotic relationship and have a fat export order book these days, say sources.This is just one aspect, say sources in the business. Apart from ammunition-like shells and rockets, there is great demand globally for high-energy raw material too, which Nagpur companies are catering to. Here, the private sector also has a major say. Solar Industries is one of the major players in this product category, along with MIL, a PSU.TOI also accessed records maintained by private portals on the basis of export filings made by exporters to govt agencies. It shows sizeable exports of raw materials for manufacturing rockets, shells and bombs — HMX, RDX and TNT. The raw powder was sold to arms corporations across Europe, the Far East, and West Asia, shows data from official records.","In the last three months, orders for Rs 900 crore worth of shells, rockets and other bombs have been dispatched and orders of at least Rs 3,000 crore are under execution.

I have suggested that the critical mineral MoU be converted to a critical mineral partnership agreement and become a starting point for an FTA,"" commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal told reporters Saturday. The US govt, at present, is not pursuing trade agreements with any country.India, along with the US, Australia and Japan are working to secure the critical minerals supply chain, ranging from mining to processing and final use as they seek to catch up with China that controls most of the mines and production facilities. Japan and the US had signed a partnership agreement, which will entitle non-American companies to get advantages, including duty benefits.A decision is unlikely in the coming months given that US presidential election is just three weeks away.Goyal sounded upbeat on the overall outcome of his recent discussions with US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, US trade representative Katherine Tai and top industry and business leaders, suggesting that almost all ticklish trade issues had been addressed by both sides.Apart from investment interest, the minister said, there is keenness on co-development in crucial areas such as pharma, digital technology, telecom and defence, along with technology transfer. ""There is massive change seen in the intellectual property system. They are seeing a perceptible difference,"" he said.Goyal said that there was a nudge to American semiconductor companies to invest in India with a fabrication unit also expected in the coming months.

He moved the civil court after she repeatedly refused.Shah won the civil case in 2017, but Singh contested the ruling in Nainital sessions court. On Thursday, district judge Subir Kumar upheld the previous judgment, saying, ""Singh's failure to secure alternative housing provided grounds for eviction.""Advocate Neeraj Sah, representing Navy officer, told TOI, ""Rose Bank Cottage was rented to Harpal Singh in 1966 at a nominal rent.

The will was later registered, and Neelam was informed about it. Mridul told court that apart from this property, he had no other house.

It found her at age 19 when fresh from winning gold at 2012 Asian Junior Championship at Kazakhstan's Almaty, Malik faced what she describes as one of the most traumatic experiences of her life.In the autobiography, Malik, who became the first Indian women wrestler to win a bronze at Rio Olympics , writes that she was taken to wrestling federation chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh 's hotel room after her win on pretext of speaking to her parents from Singh's mobile.She alleges, ""Singh connected me to my parents. It seemed harmless. When I spoke to them telling them about my match and my medal, I remember thinking that perhaps nothing unsavoury might happen after all. But right after I ended the call, he tried to molest me while I was seated on his bed. I pushed him off and started to cry.""She alleges, ""He stepped back after that. I think he realised that I wasn't going to go along with what he wanted. He started saying that he had put his arms around me 'papa jaise' (as a father would). But I knew that was not what it was. I ran out of his room all the way back to mine, weeping.""Malik and five other women wrestlers had staged a protest at Jantar Mantar in Jan 2023 accusing Singh of multiple incidents of sexual harassment. The wrestlers filed FIRs and in May this year, a Delhi court framed charges of sexual harassment , intimidation and outraging the modesty of women against Singh who is ex-Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and six-time Lok Sabha MP. Singh has previously denied these allegations terming them a political conspiracy against him. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges in court. Singh did not respond to multiple calls and messages asking for a response to Malik's charges.In the memoir written with Jonathan Selvaraj, Malik says Singh made repeated calls urging her to ""stay in his favour"", offering facilities like protein supplements. Malik writes that she shared information about the Almaty incident with her camp roommate Anita Sheoran and her mother. ""Although I didn't intend to spread the story, it did. Everyone knew what happened with me at Almaty. No one spoke out about it. Neither did I.""Malik says fear and anxiety affected her performance at 2012 Junior World Championships a few months later where she was a favourite after winning a bronze in the previous edition. She ended up in 17th place. This was not the only occasion when Malik had to face sexual harassment, she says. She was assaulted by a tuition teacher when she went to his home to study. ""I had been molested in my childhood too, but for a long time I could not tell my family about it as I thought it was my fault. My tuition teacher used to harass me. He would call me over to his place for classes at odd times and sometimes tried to touch me. I was scared to go for my tuition classes but I could never tell my mom. This continued for a long time and I kept quiet about it,"" she writes.Malik finally opened up to her mother who was supportive of her. ""My mother supported me not just during the incident with the tuition teacher but also when Singh started pursuing me. I tried to forget about what had happened at Almaty. That's what my parents advised me to do too. They told me to focus on my training and competition. It doesn't seem like much today, but I was grateful that I was allowed to continue to train, at least.""","Sakshi Malik is the first Indian women wrestler to win a bronze at the Rio Olympics.

North American Sikh organisation calls for dialogue between India and Canada amidst rising tension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/north-american-sikh-organisation-calls-for-dialogue-between-india-and-canada-amidst-rising-tension/articleshow/114366526.cms,"Satnam Singh Chahal

The escalating diplomatic tension between India and Canada will have a serious fallout for the Sikh community , not just in Canada, but in the US and in other countries around the world too, feels Satnam Singh Chahal , founder executive director, North American Punjabi Association ( NAPA ).“Constructive dialogue between India and Canada is the pressing need to safeguard the rights and well-being of the Sikh community across both nations and globally,” Chahal, who lives in northern California, told the Times of India, speaking as a representative of NAPA, a global non-partisan and non-sectarian organisation, founded in 2011, dedicated to serving and empowering the Indian diaspora worldwide.Chahal feels that the strong differences between India and Canada, that started with the murder of Khalistan activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, Canada; have highlighted the existing challenges faced by the Sikh diaspora community in western countries regarding issues of identity, safety, and political representation . “We are deeply concerned about the potential ramifications of strained diplomatic relations between India and Canada on the Sikh diaspora, which has long been a bridge between vibrant cultures,” Chahal, who was a nominated commissioner of Santa Clara county in California, said.Born and raised in Punjab, Chahal, who immigrated to the US with his family in 1997, feels that the growing animosity between India and Canada has been hitting the Sikh community hard in Canada as well as the US. “Globally, the Sikhs have been known for our philanthropic activities and service to the community wherever we are based. But now, the present acrimonious situation has created a deep rift even within some of our gurdwaras. The foundation of our religion is the concept of ‘sewa’ and we are a religious group that helps others always with service towards the larger community,” he said. But Chahal finds that the recent tensions, which have been highlighted by the falling out between the Indian and Canadian governments, have led to a changing perception about the Sikh community in North America.The killing of Nijjar, and the following stand-off between India and Canada, has exacerbated an existing divide within the Sikh diaspora, Chahal feels. “Some community members view the Canadian government’s stance as a legitimate defence of human rights, while others see it as an affront to India’s sovereignty. This polarisation can create rifts within families and social circles, leading to heated discussions and estrangement,” he said.He added that there was a lack of outreach to the Sikh community, in the US, on the part of the Indian government in the past several months. “All these factors have been hitting the American Sikh community hard with growing incidents of discrimination and racism being reported at schools, universities and workplaces by younger members of the community who wear turbans and have beards,” Chahal said.He added that in North America, many Sikh families are having to navigate complex relationships with non-Sikh neighbours and friends. “Misunderstandings about the community’s political affiliations can lead to stigmatisation or social isolation, especially if there are perceptions that they support militant factions. Within the diaspora, there can be significant pressure to take sides in the political narrative. Activists may push for solidarity with Nijjar’s cause, while others may urge caution to maintain good relations with India, particularly for those with family ties back home. Further, social media has amplified voices within the community, creating echo chambers where certain narratives dominate,” Chahal said.He feels that Sikhs in America and Canada are depending on the support of the US, Canadian and Indian governments to face such challenges and adds that many Sikhs in Canada, too, are feeling anxious about their safety and the possibility of backlash as tensions rise between India and Canada. “NAPA calls on both the Indian and Canadian governments to ensure the protection of all communities, particularly minorities. Our organisation also urges community members to engage actively in the political process, advocating for their rights and ensuring their voices are heard in discussions that impact their future,” Chahal added.","The escalating diplomatic tension between India and Canada will have a serious fallout for the Sikh community, says Satnam Singh Chahal, founder executive director, North American Punjabi Association. “We are deeply concerned about the potential ramifications of strained diplomatic relations,” he said.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday spurned the Union govt’s invitation to direct application of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) to citizens irrespective of their religion and personal laws but suggested that Parliament should consider outlawing child betrothals as well.Delivering a 141-page judgment on a PIL highlighting the persistence of child marriages on an alarming scale despite enactment of PCMA 18 years ago, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said, “The issue of the interface of personal laws with the prohibition of child marriage under PCMA has been subject of some confusion.”Union govt, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, had in a written note on behalf of WCD ministry submitted that there were conflicting opinions of HCs on precedence of PCMA over personal laws.“SC may consider issuing directions pronouncing that PCMA will prevail over the personal law governing marriage,” it requested.Authoring the judgment, CJI Chandrachud said Centre has not provided details of conflicting judgments from HCs and that PCMA was silent on the validity of child marriages. “Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was introduced on Dec 21, 2021. The bill was referred for examination to department-related standing committee. The bill sought to amend PCMA to expressly state the overriding effect of the statute over various personal laws. The issue, therefore, is pending consideration before Parliament,” SC said, refraining from ruling as requested by Centre.However, it laid down elaborate guidelines to strengthen measures to prevent child marriages. The CJI-led bench widened the scope of issue before its consideration to bring in betrothal of minors, and said PCMA was silent on this issue. “Marriages fixed in the minority of a child have the effect of violating their rights to free choice, autonomy, agency and childhood. It takes away from them their choice of partner and life paths before they mature and form the ability to assert their agency. International law such as CEDAW stipulates against betrothals of minors,” it said.“Parliament may consider outlawing child betrothals, which may be used to evade penalty under PCMA. While a betrothed child may be protected as a child in need of care and protection under the JJ Act, the practice also requires targeted remedies for its elimination,” the apex court bench added.Appreciating efforts of advocate Mugdha, appearing for the NGO ‘Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action’, in bringing to the court’s notice loopholes in implementation of PCMA, the bench said a studied approachby all stakeholders was needed for prevention of child marriages and protection of minors while penalising approach for violation of PCMA should be last resort.",Supreme Court spurned the Union govt’s invitation to direct application of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) It suggested that Parliament should consider outlawing child betrothals as well.

Its other key suggestion, made in July this year, was to amend the DGCA Civil Aviation Requirements to put hoax callers on ""no-fly"" list for five years.As of now, the rules cover only unruly passengers travelling or boarding aircraft, not non-passengers, and leave it to the airline to decide on duration of the 'no-fly' ban. BCAS had said Indian Penal Code (IPC) provisions are not deterrent enough in the light of the serious impact hoax calls and messages, mostly from pranksters, tend to have on flight schedules and the related losses, besides the inconvenience caused to the passengers and public.BCAS is said to have submitted that introducing a dedicated provisions in the Aircraft Act, 1934, against hoax calls, including stricter bail and stern punishment, would keep pranksters from making that hoax call or posting a false bomb threat.The Bill to amend the Aircraft Act, 1934 - the Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak, 2024 - was passed by the Lok Sabha in August this year. The bill, however, did not incorporate the BCAS suggestion to include a dedicated legal framework to deal with hoax bomb threats to flights.Aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said Thursday ""a strict barrier"" was being created for ""people trying to do these kinds of pranks"" and hinted at changes in rules and legislation to achieve this.","Aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said Thursday ""a strict barrier"" was being created for ""people trying to do these kinds of pranks"" Aviation ministry is taking a fresh look at old suggestions of the Bureau of Civil Aviation and Security.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114383304,imgsize-1299043,width-400,resizemode-4/114383304.jpg"
