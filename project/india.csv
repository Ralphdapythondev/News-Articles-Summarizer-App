‘Second time my father was forced to release terrorists’: Omar Abdullah on how Rubaiya Syed kidnapping set a 'benchmark' for IC814 hijack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/second-time-my-father-was-forced-to-release-terrorists-omar-abdullah-on-how-rubaiya-syed-kidnapping-set-a-benchmark-for-ic814-hijack/articleshow/113141698.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah revealed that 1999 IC814 hijacking incident was not the first time his father Farooq Abdullah was compelled to release individuals, drawing parallels to the 1989 kidnapping of Rubaiya Syed , daughter of then-home minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.""This is the second time my father was forced to release people. With Rubaiya Syed and families of the hijacked victims, they used the Rubaiya Syed incident as the benchmark,"" Abdullah said in an interview with ANI.""They said when you could release terrorists for a home minister's daughter, is our family not precious? Why is it only she is precious to the country? Then if she is precious to you, then our family is precious to us.So we set a benchmark that had to be followed,"" Abdullah added.The Central government, led by VP Singh, had agreed to release five imprisoned terrorists of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front in exchange for Rubaiya Syed's release. This precedent, Abdullah said, played a significant role in shaping the demands made during the IC814 hijacking.The IC814 hijacking has garnered renewed attention, partially due to its depiction of hijackers in the Netflix series ""IC814: The Kandahar Hijack,"" directed by Anubhav Sinha. The series delves into the controversial decision to release terrorists in exchange for the safety of the hostages.Abdullah highlighted the difficult position the government found itself in, saying, ""I think the Government of India had an option. At the time of Rubaiya Syed's kidnapping, they could have chosen not to negotiate with terrorists. But once you do it once, you have to do it again.""Speaking on the execution of Afzal Guru, Abdullah said that the ""J&K government had no role"" in the process, adding that the execution ""did not serve any purpose"".The National Conference and the Congress are contesting the upcoming Jammu and Kashmir assembly polls together.

'Maut ka kuan' gets global spotlight but its riders are barely hanging on,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maut-ka-kuan-gets-global-spotlight-but-its-riders-are-barely-hanging-on/articleshow/113141217.cms,"As a ' maut ka kuan ' ( well of death ) pro, Rubel Sheikh, a native of Malda, West Bengal, has been flirting with danger for over a decade. Ironically, fame or money still hasn't come his way even though the viral music video of Indian rapper Hanumankind aka Sooraj Cherukat has catapulted his sport from small-town melas to the global spotlight. ""For Rs 18,000-20,000 a month, we endanger our lives daily for the entertainment of others.Those who shoot videos with our stunts go viral. Can we also make videos and increase our audience? But we don't know how to edit,"" rues Sheikh, the sole earning member in his family of five.The 28-year old is a builder too, using nuts and bolts to join the wooden beams for the 22-ft-high arena. He then scales its near-vertical walls with Maruti 800 cars and old Yamaha and Pulsar bikes.'Well of Death', known as 'maut ka kuan' in India, is a daring motorbike or car stunt performance that originated in early 20th-century American carnival sideshows. Riders defy gravity as they loop endlessly around a wooden cylinder, suspended by sheer centrifugal force. They pop in and out of cars to hold and release riders while still in motion, thrilling audiences watching from above.The spectacle used to be a staple of circuses and melas in the pre-cable and internet era. Munira Abdul Sattar Madni, who began riding in 1971 when she was 7, was the first female rider to take on this death-defying act, inspired by her father who built these structures across the country.Despite a glut of motorcycle influencers performing heart-stopping wheelies for an internet audience today, the 'maut ka kuan' performances still hang on, like its riders, in smaller towns and villages.Accidents are common. In April, a stuntman and his female associate were injured after the car had a flat tyre midway. Last year, nearly nine people were injured after a bike stuntman lost control and rammed into the audience at a fair in West Bengal's Asansol.""Once you start your vehicle inside the well, there is only danger. But we can't wear a helmet while doing these stunts. Riders have to look sideways and back to interact and collaborate. Someone or the other keeps breaking an arm or a leg. We give full hospital support to fix it,"" says Sajan Seth, who started a small company of 'maut of kuan' performers after 15 years in the profession. He is now camped at a mela in Raiganj in the Uttar Dinajpur district of West Bengal and plans to entertain the 20-odd visitors with a Maruti 800 riding the well. Two other bikers will slip off the edge of their seats to add some more drama. ""When we were new, we would get terrible vertigo. Now, we are used to it,"" says Seth, who trained under an 'ustad' for a couple of years in Jammu & Kashmir.Rising fuel costs and modest ticket prices mean the profit margin is slim. Old models of Maruti and Yamaha RX100 are stripped of silencers so that the roar heightens the thrill for audiences who often dangle currency notes from the edge of the well for riders to catch mid-stunt. ""The high-pitched sound of the bikes prevents us from getting permission to perform in big cities. This is a major issue, restricting us to smaller towns and villages although we would like better opportunities,"" says Anil Khan, 46, who has been a rider for 30 years now.Several professional stunt artists in the film industry have tried the well of death, albeit with more protection and support. Saharanpur-based stunt double Javed Gauri, who enacted the 'Maut Ka Kuan' sequence for Salman Khan in the 2019 film 'Bharat', has the highest respect for practitioners of the sport. ""It is the most dangerous of all the vehicular stunts I know. It has the maximum chance of death. And if even one biker falters, others invariably go down with him,"" says Gauri, who says he has pulled off motordrome acts on a scooty in melas in Saharanpur. ""I have also done it for college and corporate shows for brand promotions. I got my stunt double gig for 'Race 3' in Dubai after Salman bhai was impressed by my performance in 'Bharat',"" says Gauri.Sheikh, currently near India's border with Bhutan where he will perform at an expo, is far from finding fame. When the show season passes, he returns to the village and tills the fields. Yet, the thrill of the well keeps calling him back. ""It makes me happy to see the audience happy,"" he says.","'Well of Death', known as'maut ka kuan' in India, is a daring motorbike or car stunt performance that originated in early 20th-century American carnival sideshows.

'Why ad hoc Jharkhand DGP chosen in violation of SC ruling?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-ad-hoc-jharkhand-dgp-chosen-in-violation-of-sc-ruling/articleshow/113141156.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday asked Jharkhand govt to respond why contempt proceedings be not initiated against its chief secretary Lalbiaktluanga Khiangte for shifting out a regular DGP and appointing Anurag Gupta as acting DGP in blatant violation of SC's 2006 judgment mandating a minimum two-year tenure for a state top cop.After hearing senior advocate Madhavi Divan for PIL petitioner Naresh Makani, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra issued notice to the Hemant Soren govt, its chief secretary and the acting DGP saying appointment of acting DGP on ad hoc basis was banned by the SC in Prakash Singh judgment .It sought responses in two weeks.Divan said Jharkhand govt has made a habit of appointing acting DGPs in contravention of the Prakash Singh judgment and claimed that a similar appointment was objected to by the SC in February last year leading to its correction.Though a regular DGP was appointed last year, the chief secretary on July 25 this year appointed on ad hoc basis Anurag Gupta as acting DGP of the state. Following Prakash Singh judgment, the SC had in 2018 said, ""None of the states shall ever conceive of the idea of appointing any person on the post of DGP on acting basis for there is no concept of acting DGP as per decision of Prakash Singh case"". The SC had asked the states to approach the UPSC well in advance for a panel of senior cops from which it could choose DGP.Makani said Anurag Gupta is a 1990-batch IPS officer of Jharkhand cadre and had faced complaints in which disciplinary actions had been taken against him. ""In the light of these facts, appointment of Anurag Gupta as acting DGP on ad hoc basis and in supersession of Feb 14, 2023 notification is not only questionable and arbitrary but also in blatant violation of Prakash Singh judgment,"" the petitioner said.Had the process of empanelment of names for selection of DGP taken place, it would have precluded Gupta from figuring in the list due to his track record, the petitioner claimed.",Supreme Court asks Jharkhand govt to respond why contempt proceedings be not initiated against its chief secretary Lalbiaktluanga Khiangte.

The woman had said she did not wish to return to her father due to physical harassment by her brothers, who have been pressuring her to return to her abusive husband, from whom she has separated.""If a fully mature adult, capable of making her own decisions, has clearly expressed her desire to live independently, the court cannot override her will. It cannot, and should not, compel an adult to return to the custody of another, even if that person is a well-meaning parent,"" Justice Kaul said.In her statement before the magistrate - recorded on the HC's directives - the woman said she was residing separately of her own free will. The lower court confirmed this, saying there was no external influence on her decision.Justice Kaul observed that the argument about a father being a better custodian of an adult woman than herself was not only antiquated but also ran contrary to the constitutional guarantee of personal liberty.""The identity and autonomy of an adult woman are not defined by her relationships or familial obligations. The Constitution safeguards her right to live freely and make her own choices, without external interference,"" Justice Kaul said.","HC emphasised that an adult woman, like any other citizen, possesses the right to be treated as an independent and autonomous individual, free from coercion and undue influence.

But a tad arduous process of getting the exemption has raised eyebrows.A senior public works department official said a self-declaration proforma will have to be downloaded from the state govt's website, filled and pasted on thick, black paper.This will then have to be taped on the FasTag sticker outside the vehicle so that the RFID reader skips it. To err on the side of caution, motorists have been advised to tape black paper behind the FasTag sticker, too.

BHUBANESWAR: Less than two months after BJD's Mamata Mohanta quit Rajya Sabha and the party and joined BJP , the Naveen Patnaik-led party suffered another blow with another RS MP Sujeet Kumar resigning from the Upper House and BJD on Friday.Later, he joined BJP, boosting the party's prospects of increasing its tally in RS. Sujeet, who joined BJP at an event in Delhi in the presence of Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan , said he was fed up with corruption within BJD and the leadership's reluctance to listen when he tried to bring it to their notice.Sujeet's resignation letter from RS, 18 months ahead of his six year-term which is supposed to end on Apr 2, 2026, did not provide any specific reason for his decision to step down. On whether he was promised re-nomination to Rajya Sabha, the lawyer-turned-politician said, ""I am ready for whatever responsibility is offered to me."" Pradhan said ""Sujeet can make meaningful contributions to BJP's focus on Viksit Odisha and Viksit Bharat"".Given that BJP has 78 members in the 147-member Odisha assembly , the party is comfortably placed to win the Rajya Sabha bypoll whenever it is scheduled.

VIJAYAWADA: In a chilling case reminiscent of Kerala's notorious Koodathayi murders, three women from Tenali in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh have been arrested for a series of killings using cyanide, targeting vulnerable people over the past two years. Police have so far identified three victims but suspect there could be more.The accused, identified as Munagappa Rajani (40), Mudiyala Venkateswari alias Bujji (32), and Gontu Ramanamma (60), all residents of Tenali, have so far admitted to killing three with cyanide-laced drinks and food to rob them of gold and money .Police said they would get to know if there were other victims once their interrogation is over.The group systematically targeted individuals, including family members and neighbours, and are believed to be involved in multiple murders since 2022 besides failed attempts to kill three others.Police said the accused purchased cyanide from a man named Krishna, who works at a gold shop in Tenali, for Rs 4,000 on two occasions. Krishna is on the run.According to Guntur SP S Satish Kumar, investigation began after the decomposed body of one Shaik Nagoor Bee was found in a field near Vadlamudi village about two months ago. Police initially registered a case of suspicious death due to causes unknown.After analysing mobile data and questioning multiple witnesses, including an auto driver identified as Mahesh, police pieced together the chilling conspiracy .Investigation revealed that the accused lured the victim to the outskirts of Vadlamudi on June 5, under the pretence of a friendly outing. They spiked her drink with cyanide-laced alcohol, causing her death, and then stole her gold ornaments.The auto driver confirmed that he had picked up the accused women and the victim. He said he also saw them purchasing alcohol that turned fatal for Nagoor Bee.Guntur special branch inspector A Srinivas told TOI that the accused systematically targeted vulnerable women to steal their valuables. Their modus operandi involved mixing cyanide into drinks and food, a strategy reminiscent of Kerala's Jolly Joseph, who was convicted of killing six family members with cyanide over 14 years.Among their other victims were accused Venkateswari's mother-in-law, Subbalakshmi, who they killed to inherit property and gold, and Nagamma, the accused's 65-year-old neighbour, who was killed in Aug last year to evade a loan repayment of Rs 20,000.In another incident, they killed a man in collaboration with his wife, Bhudevi, in April this year to claim his insurance and pension.Apart from the murders, the group also attempted to kill three other women. Annapurna, who worked as a village volunteer, was given cyanide-mixed food, but she grew suspicious and did not consume it.One Muragappa Varalamadi was also given food mixed with cyanide, but she got a call from her husband at the same time. When she informed him that she was present with the accused women, they dropped their plan of killing her for fear of getting caught.","Three women from Tenali in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh have been arrested for a series of killings using cyanide.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a petition by Sandip Ghosh , arrested ex-principal of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, seeking to intervene in proceedings before Calcutta HC which had ordered CBI probe into an alleged scam in biomedical waste disposal in the hospital and whether it had a nexus with the rape-murder of a doctor on Aug 9.""You (Ghosh) have no locus standi to intervene in the PIL.You were the principal when the alleged offence took place. The HC is not commenting on the merit of your involvement in corruption or the offence. Both are matters for investigation. As an accused, you have no locus standi to intervene in a PIL in which the HC has transferred the investigation to CBI and is monitoring it,"" a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said.For the ex-principal, senior advocate Meenakshi Arora said her client was prejudiced by the HC observation indicating a nexus between the offence on Aug 9 and the alleged medical scam. The CJI said, ""That is itself a matter of investigation.""Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general S V Raju said the alleged nexus was the precise matter for investigation by CBI. Arora vociferously argued that the probe into financial irregularity and rape-murder case should be done separately and criticised the HC for drawing a nexus between the two cases.Both Mehta and Raju said an accused could not decide or direct how the investigation was to be conducted by CBI and could never be permitted to put fetters on the probe. CJI Chandrachud agreed and said even courts could not direct a particular course of investigation. ""Let us not stultify the investigation. We (SC) have also asked CBI to file status reports before us. As the highest court is looking into the matter, it will ensure that the investigation is fair. CBI will apprise us of what emerges during investigation,"" the CJI said.Arora tried to narrate why students, who have been agitating against the rape-murder of their colleague, were inimical towards Ghosh. She said Ghosh joined as principal in 2021 and had stopped the Covid-period practice of promoting students without examination. On financial irregularities in the hospital as alleged by the PIL, Arora said the plea was filed by ex-deputy superintendent of RG Kar Hospital Akhtar Hussain as a counter to the show cause notices he was served for lapses leading to his transfer to Murshidabad.The bench said it was not giving Hussain a clean chit. Arora said similar petitions alleging financial irregularities in disposal of biomedical waste had been dismissed earlier by the HC and argued that it could not continue to entertain petition after petition without being restrained by the principle of 'res judicata' (a matter that has been finally decided).""These are not matters which we can dispose of on a technicality. Three PILs were dismissed by the HC. But now it has entrusted the probe to CBI. At this stage, you do not have locus at all,"" the CJI said.Arora responded, ""When the PIL only alleged irregularities in biomedical waste, and did not draw any nexus with the Aug 9 offence, could the HC pass an order terming there is apparent nexus?"" The CJI-led bench said, ""The issue of biomedical waste is a trigger. The HC wishes that the entire matter is pursued to its logical conclusion.""","Sandip Ghosh, arrested ex-principal of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, sought to intervene in proceedings before Calcutta HC.

BJP may accommodate deprived candidates in other constituencies

CHANDIGARH/ROHTAK/PANIPAT: BJP's core committee called an emergency meeting on Friday in New Delhi as senior BJP politicians, including former ministers, MLAs and other party seniors, continued to fume at not finding a place in the list of candidates for the Haryana assembly polls or feared that they would be dropped.The meeting is learned to have been attended by Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Lok Sabha MP Biplab Deb, organisation secretary Phanindranath Sharma, Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini and state BJP president Mohan Lal Badoli.Though resentment in the party was discussed, sources privy to the outcome ruled out the possibility of alteration of the candidate list on this account.Later on Friday evening CM Saini told reporters there would be no change in candidates declared by BJP. He said everyone desires to get a ticket ""but the lotus flower is one and can be given to only one. It is natural for ticket-seekers to be angry. But they will be persuaded.""On Wednesday, BJP's central parliamentary board released its first list, of 67 candidates, for the 90-member Haryana assembly and dropped three sitting ministers, nine MLAs and other seniors and former ministers, including Bishambar Balmiki and Ranjit Singh Chautala. BJP Mahila Morcha office-bearer Latika Sharma, from Kalka, too, was dropped.Sources said that during the meeting, a strategy was formed to deal with the situation arising out of resentment among deprived ticket aspirants and measures to be taken, including counselling. ""There is very little scope of alteration in the list, unless any exceptionally high situation arises. However, there is a possibility of adjusting those deprived in other constituencies as we have 23 constituencies where candidates have to be finalised,"" a senior BJP functionary privy to the development said.Winnability was the sole criteria in picking candidates. All this has been done on the basis of rigorous exercises and surveys and meetings at various levels, hence there seems to be little scope for alteration, a politician said.Prominent among those who expressed surprise and made dissenting noises over the candidate selection were former minister Ram Bilas Sharma and his supporters, Karnal former mayor Renu Gupta, and former minister Kavita Jain and her husband Rajeev Jain in Sonipat.In a related development, former minister Karan Dev Kamboj attacked BJP, while Ratia MLA Lakshman Napa, along with hundreds of supporters, joined Congress in New Delhi. Napa did not receive a ticket and BJP picked former MP Sunita Duggal from that seat.Former BJP MLA Naresh Kaushik, who was denied a party ticket, broke down in front of supporters in Bahadurgarh, in Haryana's Jhajjar district, on Friday.","Senior BJP politicians fume at not finding a place in the list of candidates for the Haryana assembly polls.

In a major milestone, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) on Friday issued the rules for establishing vertiports - from where these vertical take-off & landing (VTOL) capable aircraft - will operate, paving the way for ""advance air mobility"" (AAM) in India. IndiGo parent InterGlobe Enterprises (IGE) plans to launch California-based electric air taxi-maker Archer Aviation 's e-VTOL 'Midnight' in the country around 2026. IGE chief Rahul Bhatia has signed up for upto 200 Midnights worth $1 billion.Issued after ""extensive consultation with all stakeholders,"" the DGCA circular ""provides comprehensive guidelines covering various critical aspects"". These include, basic infrastructure requirement specifications; physical attributes for vertiports; guidelines to ensure air taxis' safe and unobstructed take-off and landing; standards for visual aids to assist in landing; battery charging/energising requirements and emergency response planning.""Under this circular, site clearance and authorisation post-construction of the vertiport will be granted,"" the regulator said. Vertiports will be used by passengers to board and alight from air taxis; charging and parking these eVTOLs.Delhi-NCR, where IGE has its headquarters, is likely to be the first place in India to get air taxi service. Mumbai and Bengaluru are also expected to get the same in 2026. Hyderabad and Chennai could also get this traffic-buster.Archer, whose chief commercial officer is Indian origin Nikhil Goel , is working on a number of hi-tech innovations and features for vertiports. It expects the US FAA's approvals this year and then will start service in New York next year as the launch route. After the US, India and the UAE will get air taxis.Trial flights will be conducted here, with the regulator's nod, before commercial launch. Once they get the go-ahead, air taxis can start flying on the allowed routes. The UAE's aviation authority had this April granted operational approval for the country's first vertiport.Nikhil Goel had recently said the cost per passenger of using this service is likely to be just a ""slight premium"" over Uber. ""Delhi-Gurgaon, for instance, costs Rs 1,500-2,000 by Uber. An air taxi (per passenger) will cost upto 1.5 times of that or Rs 2,000-3,000,"" he had said.Archer's 12-rotter Midnight can seat a pilot, upto four passengers and some luggage. The same machine has been selected by the US mega carrier United, one of the backers of Archer, that has also firmed up two routes for launch next year - United hub Newark and downtown Manhattan, and Chicago O'Hare and the windy city centre.

In Aug 2017, he developed Tatkalforsure to help travellers secure Tatkal tickets, which are limited and reserved for last-minute bookings.While the Railways' Tatkal website took 5-7 minutes to generate a ticket, Dahake's tool could do it in just 45 seconds, making it very popular. Initially, the service was free, but in Feb 2020, Dahake limited the bookings through his extension to 10 and began charging Rs 30 per booking.This caught the attention of the Railways, and despite Dahake claiming to have paid relevant taxes and GST on all transactions, he was issued a notice on Sept 29, 2020. His laptop was seized, and based on his alleged confession, a case was registered.After three years, a final report was filed and the court took cognizance of the offence against Dahake under Section 143 of the Railways Act, which he challenged before the high court. Section 143 prescribes punishment for procuring and supplying railway tickets without authorisation.However, Justice M Nagaprasanna , after perusing the material on record, observed that the ingredients of Section 143 weren't present in this case, as Dahake had neither procured nor distributed railway tickets, which is necessary for an offence here.The judge also noted that Dahake had only created an extension to the IRCTC website, which sped up the process of securing Tatkal confirmation for potential travellers, benefiting the public.Since Dahake hadn't indulged in the unauthorized business of procuring and supplying railway tickets, permitting further proceedings would run counter to the law, Justice Nagaprasanna observed.","Gaurav Dahake, an entrepreneur, had previously founded'buyhatke.com ', a product price comparison online browser extension.

HC had questioned maintainability of the petition as it appeared to question the collegium system of selecting persons for appointment as HC judges.Ruling in favour of the two district judges, the bench said the petition was maintainable, pointing out a procedural lapse as the HC CJ had individually taken the decision when it should have been taken collectively by the CJ and two most senior judges of HC.""The decision of the HC CJ, on the suitability of the two petitioners as conveyed in his letter dated 6th March 2024, appears to be an individual decision.

""This court is mindful of the limited scope of interference in such matters. But this appears to be a case where there was no collective consultation amongst the threeConstitutional functionaries of high court i.e. the chief justice and two senior-most companion judges,"" he said.""Absence of the element of plurality, in the process of reconsideration as directed by the SC collegium, is clearly discernible,"" the bench said.HC had shown SC a letter written by one of the judicial officers giving vent to his hurt feelings for getting ignored by HC despite having an unblemished judicial record and argued that the letter was contemptuous.Brushing aside HC's argument, Justices Roy and Mishra said, ""We have perused the letter. It is definitely an expression of hurt by the judicial officer but will not bring the letter into the contemptuous category.""""In light of the above, the HC collegium should now reconsider the names of Chirag Bhanu Singh and Arvind Malhotra for elevation as judges of HC, following the SC Collegium decision dated 4th Jan, 2024 and law minister's letter dated 16th Jan, 2024. It is ordered accordingly,"" SC said.",Supreme Court rules that high court collegiums collectively decide on recommending names for appointment as HC judges.

SC to CBI: Probe ASI U-turn on Defence Colony monument

The Supreme Court has mandated a CBI investigation into the Archaeological Survey of India's change of stance on safeguarding the Lodi-era Shaikh Ali 'Gumti' monument in Delhi. The court seeks clarity on why the structure, occupied by Defence Colony Welfare Association since 1963, was not declared protected despite initial recommendations for its preservation.

Waqf board scam: ED arrests AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan in money laundering case

Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with a money laundering case linked to the Waqf Board, following a raid on his residence. The AAP claims this is politically motivated and intended to disrupt their work as elections approach, alleging misuse of central agencies.

Waqf board scam: Court sends AAP's Amanatullah Khan to 4-day ED custody

A Delhi court has ordered AAP leader Amanatullah Khan into four days of Enforcement Directorate custody. The ED is probing money laundering allegations tied to the Delhi Waqf Board and disproportionate assets. Following a raid at his residence, Khan was arrested for alleged non-cooperation and evasive responses during questioning.

NEW DELHI: As a fiery fourth meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, took place Friday, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said there were over 120 monuments under its protection that were claimed by different state waqf boards , sources said. The ASI presentation is learnt to have included an indicative list of 53 protected monuments that were declared waqf at different points of time.According to sources, the indicative list shared by ASI shows monuments that were declared ‘protected’ a century ago were claimed as waqf property in the 21st century. The list includes the tomb of Ahmad Shah, a Nizam ruler, in Ahmednagar, declared by ASI as a protected monument in 1909, which was designated a waqf property in 2006. Similarly, Safa Masjid of Belgaum, which was declared a protected monument in 1909, was categorised as waqf in 2005.Culture ministry officials, sources said, faced criticism from opposition members for raising concern that the law allowed waqf boards to declare any property as waqf. Pointing out that the law laid out a process for declaration of waqf, members said it was like peddling “WhatsApp university” misinformation to claim waqf boards could declare ownership of any property.Sources said dual control over monuments of national importance — by ASI and waqf boards — gave rise to conflicts and administrative complications. There are cases where waqf boards have undertaken construction, additions or alterations within premises or occupied portions of monuments. ASI raised issues ranging from commercial activities, installation of fittings, coolers and loudspeakers to operation of madrasas and worship inside monuments. Opposition members countered that these facilities were bound to be present in places of worship.Another member, sources said, countered ASI’s concern on encroachment and namaz being offered at monuments, saying ASI was responsible for upkeep of monuments and did not have jurisdiction to decide if prayers can be offered as that was covered under Article 26 which protects right to practise one’s religion.",The Supreme Court has mandated a CBI investigation into the Archaeological Survey of India's change of stance on safeguarding the Lodi-era Shaikh Ali 'Gumti' monument in Delhi.

The health ministry said in a statement that these patients will now be able to avail benefit of this shorter regimen.""With the other advantages, there will be an overall saving in cost,"" the health ministry said.

Not even an enquiry was conducted just because he is the governor.Rather, Bose called it a political conspiracy.

Sculptor: Shivaji statue collapse: Sculptor says he surrendered due to ‘dirty politics’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/sculptor-surrendered-due-to-dirty-politics/articleshow/113102884.cms,"NAVI MUMBAI/KALYAN: A court in Malvan on Thursday remanded sculptor Jaydeep Apte in police custody and extended the custody of structural consultant Chetan Patil till Sept 10 in the Shivaji statue collapse case .Apte had installed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's statue at Rajkot fort in Malvan. It collapsed on Aug 26.Apte's lawyer, Ganesh Sovani, claimed he surrendered because he was fed up with ""dirty politics"".""The allegations levelled against him are false. He spoke to his wife on Wednesday, who asked him to surrender. We then informed police,"" he said. Police, however, claimed that they arrested him on the basis of specific information.Patil had surrendered before police in Kolhapur last week. He is likely to be questioned on how he obtained the contract to execute the statue, the time period for its construction, its strength, whether any pressure was mounted on him to expedite the work, and financial transactions of the contract.Meanwhile, CM Eknath Shinde said it was unfortunate that the issue had been politicised . ""...be it Jaydeep Apte or anyone else, everyone is equal and no one is above law... He would have been caught no matter where he ran or hid. This is a big slap on the opposition, who were doing politics. Jaydeep Apte will be investigated.... This incident was unfortunate, but politicising it is even more unfortunate. Our govt's aim is to make a grand statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj there again,"" he said.","Apte had installed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's statue at Rajkot fort in Malvan.
