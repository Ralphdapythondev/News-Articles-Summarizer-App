NEW DELHI: India on Thursday signed the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement — called the ‘ High Seas Treaty ’ — that will allow the country to enhance its strategic presence in areas beyond its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and work for conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity .The agreement, signed by external affairs minister S Jaishankar on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, is an international treaty under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .It aims at addressing the growing concerns over the longterm protection of marine biodiversity in the high seas.“India is proud to join the BBNJ agreement, an important step towards ensuring that our oceans remain healthy and resilient,” Jaishankar posted on X after signing the treaty at the UN headquarters.The agreement, an international legally binding treaty, was agreed upon in March 2023, and is open for signature for two years, starting Sept 2023. It will enter into force 120 days after the 60th ratification. As of now, nearly 100 countries have signed it, and eight of them have ratified it.The treaty sets precise mechanisms for the sustainable use of marine biological diversity through international cooperation and coordination. Member countries cannot claim or exercise sovereign rights over marine resources derived from high seas and should ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits.Taking care of marine genetic resources, including fair and equitable sharing of benefits; measuring area-based management tools, including marine protected areas; environmental impact assessments; and capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology, are the four main focus areas of the treaty.Opening newer avenues for scientific research and development, the Agreement will address a number of “cross-cutting issues”, establish a funding mechanism, set up institutional arrangements, including a Conference of the Parties (COP) and various subsidiary bodies, a clearing-house mechanism and a secretariat.",India on Thursday signed the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement.

Congress puts up unity show with Selja & Hooda at Rahul rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-puts-up-unity-show-with-selja-hooda-at-rahul-rally/articleshow/113718206.cms,"Rahul Gandhi

CHANDIGARH: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi accused BJP of driving Haryana's youth to sell their land and move abroad, often illegally, due to widespread unemployment and lack of opportunities under the party's governance since 2014. His campaign rallies in Assandh and Barwala for the Oct 5 assembly elections also served as a show of unity between Congress arch-rivals Kumari Selja and Bhupinder Singh Hooda Gandhi criticised the Agnipath scheme , claiming it deprived soldiers of stable jobs and pension benefits allegedly to favour the Adani Group. He accused the conglomerate of benefiting from the defence budget, acting as an intermediary in arms deals.Gandhi said Agnipath was introduced to offset expenses incurred from the ""one rank, one pension"" (OROP) initiative, with the saved funds being directed to private conglomerates. He claimed these conglomerates purchased arms from Israel, reselling them to India with their label.""The recruitment system is being destroyed systematically by BJP,"" he alleged. ""The morale of soldiers recruited under Agnipath is down as they are working with soldiers recruited under the old recruitment policy.""Reflecting on his recent visit to the US, Gandhi shared experiences of meeting young people from Haryana who had risked their lives to reach America via ""donkey routes"". ""Most of them had either sold their farmland or taken loans on hefty interest rates to go abroad for jobs. After interacting with them and their families, I have come to know it was because of unemployment, a non-conducive environment for business, high inflation, and the BJP govt's new recruitment policy in the Army,"" Gandhi said.With BJP ramping up criticism of Congress over Selja's absence from the campaign, efforts from Hooda's camp have been made to reconcile with her. Tensions arose when loyalists of Selja were denied tickets in key constituencies. As a prominent Dalit politician, Selja's influence is crucial in a state where 21% of voters belong to the community and 17 assembly seats are reserved for scheduled castes.Hooda's faction included Selja's photographs on their posters and began mentioning her in speeches to smooth over the rift. Gandhi used his platform to appeal for unity across caste lines and urged voters to support Congress. He reiterated Congress's commitment to conducting a caste census.Presenting the Congress manifesto for Haryana, Gandhi promised Rs 2,000 a month to women, LPG cylinders for Rs 500, MSP guarantee for farmers, instant crop insurance payments, and 100-square-yard plots for the poor.Accompanied by Olympic medallist Bajrang Punia, Gandhi praised wrestlers but condemned the sexual harassment of athletes. ""Women wrestlers are being sexually harassed and are crying for justice, but BJP has been protecting that man,"" he said.(Inputs: Vijender Kumar)","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi accused BJP of driving Haryana's youth to sell their land and move abroad, often illegally.

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is expected to follow its tradition of commencing the Class 10 and 12 board exams around mid-February in 2025. Based on the previous few years, it is anticipated that the exams will begin in February, 2025. However, earlier this year in May 2024, news agency PTI informed via social media post on X that the exam is likely to commence from February 15, 2025.The official timetable, however, will be released in December 2024, providing students with a detailed schedule.The trend of conducting exams in mid-February started in 2019, after the board decided to reduce the exam duration for certain subjects. Since then, CBSE has continued with this pattern, marking February 15 as the starting date for most board exams, with only a few exceptions in 2021 and 2022 due to COVID-19 disruptions.The pandemic years of 2021 and 2022 were outliers in this trend. In 2021, the exams were delayed and started in May, while in 2022, the exams commenced in late April. These delays were necessary to accommodate the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure the safety of students. However, once the situation stabilised, CBSE returned to the February timeline in 2023 and has adhered to it ever since.In 2015, CBSE conducted both Class 10 and Class 12 board exams from March 2. The Class 10 exams concluded on March 26, while Class 12 exams ended on April 17. Similarly, in 2016, the exams started earlier, on March 1, with Class 10 exams wrapping up by March 28 and Class 12 by April 22.For 2017, CBSE delayed the exams slightly, beginning on March 9 for both classes. Class 10 exams ended on April 10, and Class 12 exams extended till April 29. By 2018, the exam period reverted to early March, starting on March 5. Class 10 exams concluded by April 4, while Class 12 exams ended on April 13.The significant shift occurred in 2019 when CBSE advanced the exam dates to February. Class 12 exams started on February 15, lasting until April 3, while Class 10 exams began slightly later, on February 21, and concluded by March 29. In 2020, this February timeline continued, with exams starting on February 15. Class 10 exams ran until March 18, and Class 12 exams until March 30.The pandemic severely disrupted the schedule in 2021, pushing exams to begin on May 4, and continuing till June 7 for Class 10, and June 10 for Class 12. In 2022, exams resumed later than usual but earlier than the previous year, starting on April 26 for both classes. The exams for Class 10 ended by May 24, while Class 12 concluded by June 15.By 2023, CBSE returned to its preferred February start date, commencing both Class 10 and Class 12 exams on February 15. The Class 10 exams concluded by March 13, and the Class 12 exams ended on April 5. A similar schedule was followed in 2024, where exams began on February 15 for both classes, with Class 10 exams finishing on March 13 and Class 12 exams concluding by April 10.","The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is expected to follow its tradition of commencing the Class 10 and 12 board exams around mid-February in 2025.

Water shortage in Bengaluru: Tanker bill per house goes up to Rs 25k here,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/water-shortage-in-bengaluru-tanker-bill-per-house-goes-up-to-rs-25k-here/articleshow/113683003.cms,"The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand.

BENGALURU: Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now, forcing them to rely on very few private water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand, and each household is spending anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 every month on water.BWSSB officials attribute the delay in addressing the issue to the pending activation of Cauvery Stage 5.Rishabh Aditya, a software engineer and new father, shared the difficulties faced by his family due to irregular water supply. ""I have an infant at home, and water has become a top priority for us. We need it for cooking, cleaning, and giving warm baths to the baby. Unfortunately, we receive no support from BWSSB, and we are forced to rely on tankers,"" he said.Aditya described the frustration of having to stay awake until late at night to ensure water delivery. ""Tankers supply water based on who books first. With more than 100 people in the layout, we often have to wait until 1am, which is exhausting,"" he said.The cost of water from tankers varies, with residents paying anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000 for a 5,000-litre load. For larger families, the expenses quickly add up. Naveenchandra Keshavmurthy, another resident, shared that his household spends Rs 20,000 to Rs 35,000 each month on water. ""We are in absolute misery because of the lack of BWSSB water supply. Despite our complaints, nothing has been done,"" he maintained.Senior citizens living in the area are also feeling the pinch, especially those who rely on pension and savings. Jaishankar V, an elderly resident, expressed concern over the financial strain caused by the ongoing crisis. ""It is painful for us, especially those who are retired. Depending on tankers every day is draining our savings, and monthly costs are overwhelming just for basic water supply,"" he lamented.Venkateshwar, a local tanker owner, said the challenges faced by operators in sourcing and supplying water to the area. ""There is a huge demand for water here, and it is difficult for us to source enough to meet everyone's needs. We charge reasonable rates, but residents still complain.""The residents approached BWSSB officials multiple times, but have only received assurances. According to BWSSB chairman Ram Prasath Manohar, the delay is due to the pending release of Cauvery Stage 5 water. ""These layouts, including Kamadhenu, were developed in 110 villages, and water supply was not originally allocated for them. However, in a few weeks, they will receive water from BWSSB. We are working to address the tanker mafia problem in the area,"" he said.","Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now.

"'No decision taken ... ': Congress, Himachal govt firefight after minister Vikramaditya Singh announces 'UP-like' diktat for shops, street vendors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-decision-taken-congress-himachal-govt-firefight-after-minister-vikramaditya-singh-announces-up-like-diktat-for-shops-street-vendors-to-display-ids/articleshow/113704474.cms,"Vikramaditya Singh

NEW DELHI: The Congress, which had vehemently opposed the ""display nameplate"" diktat for eateries on the route of Kanwar Yatra by BJP-led Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments, finds itself in an embarrassing situation with party's minister in Himachal Pradesh Vikramaditya Singh announcing a similar proposal for the state.Vikramaditya Singh, who is the state public works minister, had on Wednesday announced that it will be mandatory for all shopkeepers and street vendors in Himachal Pradesh to display their identity cards.Street vendors, especially those selling food items, will also be checked for hygiene and quality by the food supplies department, he had added. The Himachal minister defended the move citing internal security concerns, people's apprehensions and also drug menace in the state.The proposal comes in the backdrop of massive protests against the dispute over illegal construction in Shimla's Sanjauli mosque which put the spotlight on growing street vendors in the state and led to demands for a policy to identify, verify and register them. Following the incident, assembly speaker Kuldeep Singh Pathania constituted a seven-member committee of the assembly to make a street vendors policy.""The decision on ID cards was taken considering ""apprehensions"" expressed by several locals about rising number of migrants in the state,"" Vikramaditya Singh said. He had also mentioned that the decision was taken on the lines of the one taken by the Uttar Pradesh government. ""We have decided to make it mandatory for the street vendors to display their ID cards given by the street vendor's committee on the pattern adopted by the Uttar Pradesh government, which pioneered the idea,"" Singh had said.However, the move has raised a storm within the party. Senior Congress leader and former Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister TS Singh Deo has openly criticised the state government's move. ""I do not agree with the Himachal government's decision. I saw a video on social media showing crosses being marked above the shutters of minority-owned shops, indicating a boycott. This is condemnable, and if the Himachal government is doing this, questions will arise about whether it deserves to remain in power,"" Deo told news agency IANS.The Congress incharge for Himachal Rajeev Shukla said that connecting the Himachal move to Uttar Pradesh was not right. ""Vikramaditya has said that this is done to make sure only authorised persons can set up shops. The Himachal Pradesh assembly speaker has made an all-party committee to regulate hawkers and to give them licenses. Connecting this to Uttar Pradesh is not right,"" the Congress leader said.Reports say the Congress leadership is not happy with Vikramaditya going overboard with the announcements. The Himachal Pradesh government has tried to distance itself from Vikramaditya's remarks and clarified that the proposal is yet to get a cabinet nod. Shukla also presented a report to the Congress high command on the proposal, news agency ANI reported.The Himachal Pradesh government on Thursday issued a statement clarifying that no such decision has been taken.However, the BJP has been quick to latch on to Vikramaditya's announcements and not just welcomed it but has also taken credit for initiating the move during its government in the state. ""If the government is going to do this then I welcome it. There was already a street vendors policy which we had implemented but it was stopped after the Congress government came. Today we feel that it is needed, their minister himself has said this. I hope Vikramaditya Singh will stick to his word. We welcome his move,"" former Himachal Pradesh CM and LoP Jairam Thakur said.When the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments had made a similar diktat during the Kanwar yatra, Congress was at the forefront opposing the order. Priyanka Gandhi had called the police directive ""a crime against Contitution.""""Creating division in society on the basis of caste and religion is a crime against the Constitution. This order should be withdrawn immediately and strict action should be taken against the officials who issued it,"" Priyanka had then written on X.Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi had criticized the diktat and accused the BJP of resorting to communal politics. ""After the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP is not able to digest its moral defeat. So it has returned to the path of communal politics. An order has come that directs shopkeepers to display their names on their food stalls in Uttar Pradesh during the Kanwar yatra, in Assam politics is going on about the population of a certain community,"" Gogoi had then said.The Supreme Court had eventually stayed the enforcement of these directives and had said that eateries should not be compelled by the police to display the names or, for that matter, the caste or religious identity of their owners or employees.",Vikramaditya Singh announced that it will be mandatory for all shopkeepers and street vendors in Himachal Pradesh to display their identity cards. The move has raised a storm within the party.

A supplementary final report detailing these charges was submitted before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) on Thursday, an official confirmed.The initial report, which charged the teenager with 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder' under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), was filed in June.The fresh charges come in connection with the May 19 incident, when the teenager, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, crashed a Porsche into a motorbike, killing two young IT professionals, Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta, at Kalyani Nagar in the early hours of the morning.""The supplementary report has been filed, adding charges under IPC sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 213, 214 (screening offenders), and multiple sections related to forgery including 466, 467, 468, and 471,"" a crime branch official said.The Prevention of Corruption Act has also been invoked, with the police alleging that the juvenile, in collusion with his parents, doctors from Sassoon Hospital , and middlemen, attempted to swap blood samples to conceal his intoxication at the time of the crash.According to the police, there was an effort to replace the juvenile’s blood samples to obscure evidence that he had been driving under the influence. Additionally, technical data about the car’s speed at the time of the incident, along with witness statements, have been included to support the newly added charges. The supplementary report was submitted by Assistant Commissioner of Police Ganesh Ingale, with Special Public Prosecutor Shishir Hiray representing the case.Following a high court order, the teen's parents, two doctors from Sassoon General Hospital, and five others, including middlemen, remain in judicial custody.The juvenile had initially been granted bail with relatively lenient conditions, such as writing an essay on road safety and spending time with traffic police to understand traffic rules which caused an uproar.","Pune Police have filed additional charges of destruction of evidence, forgery, and offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

NEW DELHI: Vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday raised concerns about the “structured and planned” rise of religious conversions in India, describing it as a ""dangerous indication"" that could reshape the country’s political landscape.Speaking at an event in Jaipur, Dhankhar stressed upon the threat posed by organised religious conversions, particularly targeting vulnerable tribal communities , and urged immediate action to counter these efforts."" Sanatan Dharma never spreads poison,"" the vice president remarked, emphasising the need to preserve the nation's cultural and spiritual values. He expressed concern over ""sugar-coated philosophies"" being used to lure individuals, especially from marginalised sections of society, into religious conversion.""This issue affects our tribal people more. I firmly believe that we are witnessing very painfully religious conversions in a structured manner as a policy and this is antithetical to our values and constitutional premises. There is an urgent need to work at a fast pace to neutralise such sinister forces. We will have to be alert. You cannot guess the number of people who are active today to divide India,"" Dhankhar said.Dhankhar further warned that these efforts were being carried out systematically, ""in an institutional and planned manner,"" and posed a threat to national unity . ""There is an urgent need to work at a fast pace to neutralise such sinister forces. We must remain vigilant. The number of people active today to divide India is beyond estimation,"" he added.Without naming anyone specifically, Dhankhar appeared to criticise a former minister and senior lawyer for allegedly promotinganti-India narratives . Referring to this individual, he said, ""When something happens in a neighbouring country, a person who once held a constitutional position, served as a minister in the central government, and is a senior lawyer, propagates the narrative that it could happen in India too"" ("""").","Vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar raised concerns about the “structured and planned’ rise of religious conversions in India.

Bilkis Bano convicts' case: SC refuses to review its 'extreme observations' against Gujarat government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bilkis-bano-convicts-case-sc-refuses-to-review-its-extreme-observations-against-gujarat-government/articleshow/113703829.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the Gujarat government 's plea seeking a review of its January 8 verdict in Bilkis Bano convicts' case over certain observations made against the state.“We are satisfied that there is no error apparent on the face of the record or any merit in the review petitions, warranting reconsideration of the order impugned.The review petitions are, accordingly, dismissed,” the apex court said.The Gujarat government in February had filed a petition requesting a review of Supreme Court's January 8 judgment that overturned the remission granted to the 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano case. The government contended that certain remarks made in the judgment were not only ""highly inappropriate and contradictory to the case record"" but had also ""caused significant harm to the state"".The Gujarat government had objected to the Supreme Court's observation in its January 8 judgment, which stated that ""the state of Gujarat acted in tandem and was complicit with Respondent No3/accused"". The government argued that this remark was unwarranted, contrary to the case record, and had seriously prejudiced the petitioner-state of Gujarat.In its review petition, the Gujarat government cited nine grounds to assert that the apex court erred in making the remark by not appreciating the correct facts of the case. The government clarified that it had sought opinions from all relevant authorities, including the Mumbai court that conducted the trial and the SP, through the superintendent of Godhra sub jail where the convicts were lodged. The proposal was sent to the Maharashtra government in November 2011, but no response was received.The Supreme Court, in its January judgment, noted that had the Gujarat government brought it to the court's notice that it was not the ""appropriate government"" to decide on the remission of the 11 life convicts in the 2002 Bilkis Bano case, the ensuing litigation could have been avoided. The court stated that the Gujarat government usurped the power of the Maharashtra government in deciding on the release of the convicts, as the trial was conducted in a CBI court in Maharashtra.Ultimately, the Supreme Court overturned the Gujarat government's decision to grant early release to the 11 convicts in the 2002 gang-rape of Bilkis Bano and the murder of seven of her family members during the communal riots in the state.","The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the Gujarat government's plea seeking a review of its January 8 verdict in Bilkis Bano convicts' case.

(KMF)

How KMF functions today

NEW DELHI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam ( TTD ) has appointed ‘ Nandini ’ as the new ghee supplier, with the supply order already issued to the company. The Andhra Pradesh government took this action amid controversy over the alleged adulteration of laddus at the Tirupati temple, following claims of the use of animal fat and other substances.‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.It is Karnataka’s biggest milk brand and is also recognised in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Goa. The ‘Nandini’ brand is owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited ( KMF ), the second-largest dairy cooperative in India, after Gujarat’s Amul.The current managing director and CEO of KMF is Karnataka administrative service officer MK Jagdish.KMF’s history dates back to 1955, when the first dairy cooperative was established in the Kodagu district of Karnataka. At that time, there was no system of packaged milk, and farmers delivered milk directly to households. There was also a shortage of milk. It wasn't until the 1970s, during India’s ‘White Revolution,’ that efforts to increase milk production took hold, supported by World Bank projects.In 1974, the Karnataka government created the Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDCC) to implement these dairy projects. By 1984, KDCC was renamed the Karnataka Milk Federation, and it began selling packaged milk and other products under the brand name ‘Nandini.’ Over time, ‘Nandini’ grew into Karnataka’s most popular dairy brand and expanded to neighbouring states.KMF operates 15 dairy unions throughout Karnataka, including the Bengaluru, Kolar, and Mysore Cooperative Milk Unions. These unions buy milk from village-level Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) and deliver it to KMF for processing. According to the Karnataka Milk Federation’s website, KMF purchases over 86 lakh kilos of milk daily from 26 lakh farmers in 24,000 villages.One of KMF’s standout features is its daily payment system for milk suppliers, who are mainly small farmers and producers. The federation distributes more than Rs 28 crore in daily payments. KMF has 15 units that process and package milk, which is then sold through various channels.","‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.

In a significant move, the Congress-led Siddaramaiah government in Karnataka on Thursday withdrew its 'general/open consent' to the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) to conduct investigations in the state.According to Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946, the CBI must obtain consent from the respective state governments to conduct investigations.Karnataka law minister HK Patil said: ""We are withdrawing open consent for CBI investigation in the state. We are expressing our concerns about the misuse of the CBI. In all the cases we have referred to the CBI, they have not filed charge sheets, leaving many cases pending. They have also refused to investigate several cases we have sent. There are numerous such instances. They are biased. That’s why we are taking the decision. It's not because of the MUDA case.

However, the BJP is being allowed to protest, but we are being denied permission to cleanse Vikasa Soudha,"" Manohar said.Earlier, the Karnataka government ordered a probe by SIT against Munirathna.He was first taken into custody for allegedly threatening a contractor and violating the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.Subsequently, a woman social activist filed a rape complaint against Munirathna at the Kaggalipura Police Station in Ramanagara district on Thursday, leading to the registration of an FIR.According to the complaint, the victim was taken to a godown owned by Munirathna in Mutyalanagara, where she was allegedly raped. The complainant further stated that the act was recorded, and Munirathna threatened her, saying, ""if the matter came out, she would be dealt with severely"".The woman also alleged that she was coerced into setting up honey traps at various private resorts. In her complaint, she claimed, ""The BJP MLA forced me to carry out honey traps. He had threatened me with life to get this job done.""The woman also accused Naidu's six associates, including his gunman, of assisting him in blackmailing and threatening her with obscene videos that Naidu himself recorded.

NEW DELHI: With just days left for Haryana polls , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday sought to enthuse the BJP cadre saying that the party would get a third term in the state as people realise that its two previous ones marked a break from the corruption which had become the hallmark of the Congresss decade.""The youth of the state are getting employment without 'kharchi' or 'parchi', this has happened for the first time in Haryana.Therefore, the people of Haryana are with us, their blessings are with us, and victory is certain,"" the Prime Minister said in a virtual "" Mera Booth Sabse Majboot "" event. Suggesting that national interest should be paramount, the PM explained the attitude workers should have while working on the ground, as he said, ""I shall not let BJP's flag go down, I will work hard, I will motivate voters to vote, I will build a strong voters' base from my booth.""The pep talk is seen as significant from the point of view of the party brass's task to convince the cadre they should not succumb to the perception about Congress heading for a comfortable victory in the state.

In the event, it turned out to be a close finish and left the party regretting that it did not even try to put up a fight.PM Modi once again hit out at Congress, which, he said, spends most of its time infighting. ""Every child in Haryana is aware of it,"" said the Prime Minister as he asserted that people have decided to give one more chance to BJP to serve the state. He said, ""The entire basis of those fighting against us in the polls is lies. They repeatedly tell lies, their talks have no head or tail and they vitiate the atmosphere.""""Some are saying the Congress is becoming weak each day. During the past 10 years, the Congress has failed as an opposition too,"" he said.Citing Congress' ""misgovernance"" in Himachal Pradesh and delays in paying salaries and pensions, the PM said, ""Congress exists only for the welfare of their own families. Congress is not concerned about anyone else's children. To get votes, Congress in Himachal Pradesh made promises that they would make golden roofs for every house and then after forming the govt, they gave up. Today, the Congress govt in Himachal is unable to pay the govt employees, is unable to do any development work, is unable to make govt recruitments. Schools, roads, electricity, water, hospitals, everything is at a standstill.""He outlined key strategies to ensure success in upcoming polls focusing on voter outreach , digital engagement, and community-driven initiatives. He stressed the importance of engaging with youth and encouraged workers to tap into their enthusiasm.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the party would get a third term in the state.

NEW DELHI: A record number of Indians are all set to travel to the US this year. While CY 2023’s figure of 17.6 lakh desis in America had already overtaken the pre-Covid 2019 high of 14.7 lakh, this year in just eight months from Jan to Aug over 15.5 lakh Indians have been there. By the time student season Sept is over, last year’s figure could either have been matched or bested, setting a new high.While the strong Indian diaspora of 51 lakh in the US means large visiting friends and relatives travel from here, there is very strong business and student travel also.“India-US relations have never been better and people to people ties represent that. In Jan-Aug 2024, India has emerged as the second largest overseas source market of international visitors to the US,” Jonathan M Heimer, minister counsellor for commercial affairs in the US Embassy, Delhi, said Thursday. Canada and Mexico, which share a land border with the US, send the highest number of international visitors to the US. In 2023, India was the third largest overseas source country (not accounting Canada & Mexico) after the UK and Germany. This Jan-Aug, India has overtaken Germany. In 2019, India was the 10biggest source market overall for the US and eighth biggest overseas.While the US mission has been issuing record visas in India, the demand is so high that the wait period for an interview-required visitor visa (as on Thursday as per US State Dept website) was 477 days in Kolkata; 466 in Delhi; 433 in Chennai; 352 in Hyderabad and 312 in Mumbai. What is clearly paying off is the US policy of issuing 10-year, multiple entry visas to successful applicants, leading to a high number of repeat visits — something that can’t happen to nearer Europe due to Schengen States issuing mostly short term visas. So repeat visits mean going through the excruciating paperwork-heavy Schengen visa application process repeatedly for a majority of desi travellers.Canada and Mexico send the highest number of international visitors.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court 's top five judges, part of the collegium for transfer of HC judges and comprised the bench that had taken suo motu cognisance of Justice V Srishananda 's unwarranted gratuitous remarks, had mulled transferring him outside Karnataka HC.Between September 20, when the bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud , and Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy took cognisance of Justice Srishananda 's remarks, and Sept 25, when it admonished him prior to closing the case, the collegium comprising the same five judges had weighed the option of shifting the judge outside his parent HC.As the Karnataka HC Registrar General's Sept 23 report, prepared in consultation with the HC chief justice N V Anjaria, referred to many past gratuitous and unwarranted observations of Justice Srishananda, the five-member Collegium deliberated on the option of shifting the judge to another HC to register SC's strong objection to such remarks.Interestingly, a day after the SC took suo motu cognisance of Justice Srishananda's June 6 gender insensitive remark and Aug 28 illogical reference to a Bengaluru locality as 'part of Pakistan', the judge during the post-lunch session of court proceedings on Sept 21 said that his observations were unintentional and tendered apology in open court.The regret and promise to mend his ways crept into deliberations of the collegium, with some judges opposing transfer proposal on three grounds - Justice Srishananda has realised and regretted his mistake and this, along with the clarification that he did not wish to hurt any individual or community and apology tendered suo motu should be treated as mitigating factors.They also cautioned that a transfer would become a precedent warranting transfer of all the outspoken judges as well as an incentive for the vigilantes who would be encouraged to pluck a seemingly controversial remark and wrench it from the context to set up a campaign against judges they don't like.The reservations saw the Collegium failing to reach unanimity on whether to transfer Justice Srishananda leading them to settle suo motu judicial proceedings being taken to the logical conclusion on Sept 25.Taking a larger view even as they admonished the erring judge, the five-judge bench Wednesday laid down basic parameters for a judge's conduct in a courtroom saying they, as well as all stakeholders including lawyers, should be mindful of what they say in a courtroom as live telecast and video conferencing facilities reach the judicial proceedings to a vast audience beyond the courtrooms.The bench closed the proceedings saying, ""Courts therefore have to be careful not to make comments which may be construed as misogynistic or prejudicial to certain sections of our society... We emphasise this point, as it is necessary for every stakeholder in the institution to understand that the values which must not die are the values enshrined in the Constitution (Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity).""",Supreme Court's top five judges had mulled transferring Justice V Srishananda outside Karnataka HC.

Tough bail terms not tool to keep people in jail: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rigid-bail-provisions-cant-be-used-as-tool-for-long-captivity-sc/articleshow/113715631.cms,"The Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Observing that rigorous bail provisions in statutes like PMLA , anti-terror law UAPA and NDPS Act cannot become a 'tool' to keep an undertrial accused in jail for unreasonably long time, Supreme Court on Thursday held that the requirement of expeditious disposal of cases must be read into these statutes as inordinate delay in the conclusion of the trial and the higher threshold for the grant of bail cannot go together.The directive to the executive to take a fresh look at the laws where the onus is on the accused to prove his innocence came from a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih while hearing the bail petition of the former Tamil Nadu minister Senthil Balaji . Though the bench agreed that there was a prima facie case against Balaji in a money laundering case arising from cash-for-jobs scam dating to his 2011- 2016 tenure as transport minister in AIADMK government, it decided to give him bail on the ground that the TN politician had already spent 15 months in jail and there was no likelihood of the case being concluded in near future, considering that the case involves 2,000 accused and 500 witnesses.Examining the evidence against Balaji, the bench said there is no reason, at this stage, to doubt its authenticity of the soft files and there is also prima facie material to show a deposit of cash amount of Rs.1.34 crore in his bank account. ""At this stage, the contention of the appellant regarding the deposit of remuneration received as MLA and agriculture income cannot be accepted in the absence of any prima facie evidence to show the existence of the appellant's cash income as MLA and the appellant's agriculture income. Therefore, at this stage, it will be very difficult to hold that there is no prima facie case against the appellant..,"" it said.The ED could not be permitted to use stringent bail provision Section 45(1)(ii) as a instrument to keep an accused in custody for long period, held Justices Oka and Masih. The bench imposed stringent conditions on Balaji- he has to report to ED every Monday and Friday and has to be present in courts holding trial in corruption and money laundering cases.A prominent politician who was was the target of an intense campaign by DMK which accused him of corruption, Balaji switched sides. He was a minister when he was taken into custody. The apex court court noted in its verdict that a higher threshold has been provided in these statutes for the grant of bail as reflected in Section 45(1)(ii) of PMLA, proviso to Section 43D(5) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and Section 37 of the NDPS Act, overriding the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code.""Considering the gravity of the offences in such statutes, expeditious disposal of trials for the crimes under these statutes is contemplated. Moreover, such statutes contain provisions laying down higher threshold for the grant of bail. It is a well-settled principle of our criminal jurisprudence that bail is the rule, and jail is the exception. These stringent provisions regarding grant of bail, such as Section 45(1)(iii) of PMLA, cannot become a tool which can be used to incarcerate the accused without trial for an unreasonably long time,” SC said.SC held that prolonged incarceration without trial is violative of rights of an accused and the court should step in to protect him and no provision can take away the power of constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of fundamental rights.“When trial of the complaint under PMLA is likely to prolong beyond reasonable limits, Constitutional Courts will have to consider exercising their powers to grant bail. The reason is that Section 45 (1)(ii) does not confer power on State to detain an accused for an unreasonably long time, especially when there is no possibility of trial concluding within reasonable time.”",Supreme Court held that the requirement of expeditious disposal of cases must be read into these statutes. The bench agreed that there was a prima facie case against Balaji in a money laundering case arising from cash-for-jobs scam dating to his 2011- 2016 tenure as transport minister in AIADMK government.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113715691,imgsize-804301,width-400,resizemode-4/113715691.jpg"
"Vote for ‘dynastic’ NC-Congress, PDP to serve Pakistan’s intentions in J&K: Amit Shah",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vote-for-dynastic-nc-congress-pdp-to-serve-pakistans-intentions-in-jk-amit-shah/articleshow/113713608.cms,"Amit Shah (PTI photo)

JAMMU: Union home minister Amit Shah cautioned Thursday that electing candidates from the NC-Congress alliance and PDP in the ongoing J&K assembly elections would play into Pakistan’s hands. “If they get elected, Pakistan will celebrate,” he said, addressing a BJP campaign rally at Chenani in Udhampur district for the third and final phase of polling on Oct 1.Alleging that the three “dynastic” parties are responsible for 40 years of terrorism in J&K, during which he said 40,000 people were killed and 3,000 days were lost to bandhs and curfews.Shah said PM Narendra Modi’s government has brought down terrorism-related violence, but NC and PDP seek to revive it. “Whatever be your wish, terrorism will be eradicated forever from Kashmir. I want to tell (NC vice president) Omar Abdullah that despite his desire, we will bury terrorism deep down under the earth and it will never come back,” he said. “There is only one symbol to eradicate terrorism. That symbol is lotus.”These are the first assembly elections in a decade in J&K and since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 and the subsequent bifurcation of the region into two Union territories, including Ladakh. “In the first two phases, NC-Congress has been completely wiped out. On October 8, a strong BJP government will be formed under the leadership of Modiji,” Shah said.The Union minister said the Modi government had fulfilled the dream of BJP patriarch Syama Prasad Mookerjee by removing Article 370, in line with the latter’s famous slogan: “Ek desh mein do vidhan, do pradhan, aur do nishan nahi chalenge (There cannot be two constitutions, two PMs, and two flags in one nation)”.On reversing J&K’s status from UT to state, Shah reaffirmed: “I had said in Parliament that after the elections, we will restore J&K’s statehood. Modiji also said this. Only Parliament can give J&K statehood, and Modiji is the leader of Parliament.”Shah also responded to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s remarks on restoring Article 370. “I tell Rahul baba, even if his three generations fight for it, Article 370 will not come back. Rahul baba, it is because of Jawaharlal Nehru’s mistake that today PoK is with Pakistan,” he said.Referring to Gandhi’s recent jibe at lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, whom he described as “king”, Shah said: “Rahul baba is saying outsiders are governing J&K. Those guiding him might not be well-versed with history because the longest tenure of central rule in the region had happened during the tenure of his grandmother (Indira Gandhi) and father (Rajiv Gandhi).”Shah accused NC chief Farooq Abdullah of allowing terrorism to flourish during his tenure as CM. “They kept terrorism alive, cinemas were closed, and when Farooq Abdullah was CM, terrorism grew. Instead of fighting it, he left Srinagar for holidays in London,” he said.He criticised Farooq Abdullah’s remarks about the Army’s presence in J&K, asserting that the people would respond to the former CM, who had described soldiers as “accomplices of terrorists”.The Union minister referenced Omar Abdullah’s earlier comments about the hanging of 2001 Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, asking: “Phir kya, usko biryani khilani thi? (Then what, should we have served him biryani instead?).” He also took aim at NC’s promise to release youth from jails, accusing them of wanting to free “terrorists and stone-throwers” and assuring that strong laws would prevent this.Shah accused the three political “dynasties” of holding democracy hostage for 70 years. He lauded BJP for bringing grassroots democracy through panchayat, block development council (BDC), and district development council (DDC) elections in J&K. “These three families gave you 87 MLAs, we gave you 40,000 elected representatives through panchayat, BDC, and DDC elections,” he said.Shah also celebrated recent events in Kashmir, saying that while “it was once a struggle to hoist the Indian flag in Lal Chowk, every house in Srinagar has a Tricolour now”. He added that after 40 years, “Muharram and Janmasthami were celebrated in Srinagar”.Shah also addressed rallies in Udhampur, Bani, Jasrota, and Madh during the day. The final phase of elections will cover 40 assembly seats in seven districts — Jammu, Udhampur, Samba, and Kathua in the southern parts of the UT and Kupwara, Baramulla, and Bandipora in north Kashmir. Votes will be counted on October 8.","Union home minister Amit Shah cautioned that electing candidates from NC- Congress alliance and PDP in the ongoing J&K assembly elections would play into Pakistan’s hands. “If they get elected, Pakistan will celebrate,” he said, addressing a BJP campaign rally at Chenani in Udhampur district.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113713584,imgsize-930757,width-400,resizemode-4/113713584.jpg"
