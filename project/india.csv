Thermal Power Plant Projects: SC rejects lawyer’s challenge to IT assessment funds from USA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-rejects-lawyers-challenge-to-it-assessment-funds-from-usa/articleshow/112481658.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a setback to advocate Ritwick Dutta of ‘Lawyers Initiative for Environment’ (LIFE), the Supreme Court on Monday dismissed his challenge to income tax assessment of funds received by LIFE from US-based ‘ EarthJustice ’, which were camouflaged to be shown as legal fees but used for opposing thermal power plant projects in India.Appearing for Dutta, senior advocate C U Singh and advocate Sachit Jolly, endeavoured to show to a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that these were declared as income and made subject to income tax assessment and hence there was no suppression of information.They also said that it was an attempt to harass an environmentalist.For the IT department, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and advocate Zoheb Hossain gave details of the evidence collected by the IT department in the case. The department said LIFE received Rs 22 crore from EarthJustice in the last five years as professional fee.“Funds made available by EarthJustice are apparently being used for objects other than the approved objects of LIFE and for activities such as for litigation against coal power plants in India routed through Ritwick Dutta who is the managing trustee of LIFE in the garb of professional fees, for activities which cannot be considered to be professional services rendered by Dutta to EarthJustice,” it said.Even though EarthJustice was not part to any litigation handled by Dutta, he received nearly Rs 5 crore as professional fees. “Various emails recovered explained that Earth Justice was in fact transferring funds to Dutta, not for the purpose of receiving any professional legal services, but to carry out various ground level activities to halt and disrupt implementation of thermal power plant projects in India,” it said.The department said, “The email dated March 29, 2017 from Dutta to one Martin Wagner from EarthJustice showed discussion of strategies to ‘put pressure’ on central and state govts and/or ‘Indian project proponents’ at an international workshop… Email dated Dec 3, 2015 from Todd True of EarthJustice to Dutta talked about a funding plan for five years on coal plant/coal mine related work.”Dutta had challenged the income tax assessment notice before the Delhi HC, where a bench of Justices Yashwant Varma and Purushaindra K Kaurav had dismissed his petition on May 29.",Advocate Ritwick Dutta of ‘Lawyers Initiative for Environment’ (LIFE) had challenged the income tax assessment notice before the Delhi HC.

But on Monday it decided to entertain a petition by four ex-IAF women short service commission officers despite a delay of 219 days in filing of the appeal.

It trenches on national policy.”Five cases later, a woman advocate told the CJI-led bench that the PIL challenges the indefinite detention of Rohingya illegal migrants and complained of inadequate facilities provided to them in Delhi and Jammu, resulting in the death of two, including a minor.

Lakhs of people in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh braced for potential flooding after the 19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon. The dam, about 350km from Bengaluru, saw water gushing out after the gate gave way, putting downstream districts in north Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool and Nandyal on high alert.The Tungabhadra dam , inaugurated in 1953 with a maximum storage capacity of 133TMCFT (thousand million cubic feet), had 100TMCFT of water as of Saturday, with the remaining 33TMCFT being silt.Of the 33 crest gates at the dam, 22 were opened Saturday evening, releasing nearly 1 lakh cusecs of water into the river.However, the damaged gate has raised concerns, as engineers estimate that 60TMCFT of the stored water must be drained before they can replace the damaged gate. The process, along with constructing a new gate, could take up to four days or longer.Districts downstream of the dam, including those in AP, have been put on high alert. Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar visited the site to assess the situation. “On Saturday night, 40,000 cusecs of water was being released into the Tungabhadra river through 10 crest gates. At 12.50am, the 19th gate malfunctioned, causing a huge flow of water into the river. We’ve taken every possible precaution,” he said.Tungabhadra Board secretary ORK Reddy assured there was no immediate cause for concern, noting that the dam’s design allows for the release of up to 6.5 lakh cusecs of water at once, though the maximum release recorded so far was 3.6 lakh cusecs in Dec 1992.AP govt placed officials in Kurnool and Nandyal districts on alert. Kurnool city is on the banks of the Tungabhadra. CM N Chandrababu Naidu directed senior officials from the water resources department to assess the situation and dispatched a team of senior engineers to assist at the dam site.Union minister HD Kumaraswamy emphasised the need for safety upgrades to ageing structures like Krishna Raja Sagar reservoir, suggesting the installation of gates similar to those at the Narayanapura and Almatti dams.","19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon.

Instead, Usha believes that the responsibility falls on Phogat's coach and support staff.In a statement released on Sunday, the IOA stressed that the responsibility of weight management in sports like wrestling, weightlifting, boxing, and judo lies squarely with each athlete and their personal coaching team.The IOA made it clear that athletes and their coaches are accountable for ensuring that they meet the required weight categories in these sports, IANS reported.""The Indian Olympic Association president (IOA), PT Usha has clarified that the responsibility of weight management of athletes in sport like wrestling, weightlifting, boxing and judo is that of each athlete and his or her coach and not that of the IOA-appointed Chief Medical Officer Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala and his team.""Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala and his team were recruited by the IOA several months prior to the commencement of the Games, as explained by Usha.

Sheikh Hasina’s ‘prolonged’ stay in India won’t hurt our ties with Delhi: Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sheikh-hasinas-prolonged-stay-in-india-wont-hurt-our-ties-with-delhi-bangladesh/articleshow/112476543.cms,"Bangladesh Protesters Storm Top Court; Army Deployed In Dozens of New Areas | Chief Justice Quits

DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Bangladesh’s ties with India under the stewardship of the new interim govt in Dhaka won’t be affected even if deposed PM Sheikh Hasina remains New Delhi’s guest for an extended period of time, foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said Monday. His remarks can give the beleaguered Awami League chief some breathing space and be seen as reassuring for India.Hasina was initially understood to have sought refuge in India “only for the moment”.“Bilateral relations are a much larger issue. Friendship is based on mutual interest,” Hossain said. “We will… always strive to maintain our good relations (with India),” Hossain said after a meeting foreign diplomats in Dhaka to brief them about the situation and efforts to restore law and order.“This (Bangladesh objecting to Hasina staying longer in India) is a hypothetical question. There is no reason for that. Why should relations with a particular country be affected if someone stays there?"" Hossain said.His statement is seen as reassuring for India as the UK and other Western countries dither on offering Hasina asylum. BNP, a major political force in Bangladesh, has already cautioned India against hosting her indefinitely.How the interim government may finally want to deal with Hasina remains open to speculation as Bangladesh also hasn't ruled out efforts to seek her deportation. Hossain had said the previous day that the interim govt would follow the law ministry's advice on the issue.For India, the challenge will be to ensure that its ties with Hasina, as reflected in her decision to land here after fleeing Bangladesh, don't come in the way of likely efforts in the next few months to rebuild its relationship with ex-PM Khaleda Zia's BNP. India has had a rocky past with BNP because of the bitter rivalry between its ailing chairperson and Hasina.A senior BNP functionary said last week that the people of Bangladesh weren't going to take kindly to India offering her a temporary home.""Right now, she is the most wanted person in Bangladesh for numerous crimes – from murders and forced disappearances to massive corruption like siphoning out billions of dollars,"" said party spokesperson Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury.Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India's ministry of external affairs, told reporters in Delhi that the Centre had little to do with Hasina's plans. ""We don't have an update on her plans. It is for her to take things forward,"" he said.At his meeting with foreign diplomats, including Indian high commissioner Pranay Kumar Verma, Hossain reiterated that violence against any religious or ethnic group wouldn't be tolerated. The assurance comes amid India demanding that the interim govt ensure the safety of minority communities, particularly Hindus.Bangladesh's home adviser Sakhawat Hossain said that the interim govt headed by Nobel laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus was contemplating declaring a three-day Durga Puja holiday for Hindus in an apparent outreach towards the minority community.""Durga Puja is their biggest festival...Even if that (his proposal) doesn't happen, there should at least be a two-day holiday. With just a single day off, those who have jobs cannot participate in the festival,"" Sakhawat said.Among those who attended the meeting with the foreign adviser was Chinese ambassador Yao Wen. Talking to reporters later, Yao said political change was an internal matter of Bangladesh and it wasn't China's policy to interfere in any country's affairs.""We welcome the formation of an interim govt in Bangladesh. We want to continue working with the Bangladesh govt and expand the scope of our strategic relationship’,"" he said.","Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said ties with India won't be affected if deposed PM Sheikh Hasina remains New Delhi's guest.

BJP has never had a woman president and passing the baton to a woman is said to be an ideal call in view of the implementation of women’s quota in Parliament and state assemblies likely before Lok Sabha polls in 2029.","Senior BJP netas have held detailed consultations on the party's future course.

"Stir in govt hospitals across country against Kolkata doctor rape-murder, services hit as doctors ask for CBI inquiry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stir-in-govt-hospitals-across-country-against-kolkata-rape-murder-services-hit-as-doctor-ask-for-cbi-inquiry/articleshow/112476436.cms,"Top Picks For You 'A torn earphone and lost soul': How police arrested accused for brutal rape-murder of Kolkata doctor

NEW DELHI: Government hospitals across the country on Monday experienced significant disruptions in outpatient services and routine surgeries as resident doctors staged widespread protests against the rape and murder of a young doctor at R G Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. The protest highlighted the growing outrage within the medical community over the gruesome incident and the perceived inadequacies in probing it.Hospitals in Delhi and Kolkata were most affected as the two cities emerged as the epicentres of the protest.A spokesperson of the Federation of All India Medical Association (Faima) told TOI that more hospitals are likely to join the protests and suspend OPD and elective surgeries from Tuesday to demand a CBI inquiry into the incident and urgent implementation of a central law to prevent violence against healthcare workers. “Resident doctors from states like Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand and Gujarat, among others, will join the protest from Tuesday onwards,” said Faima founder Dr Manish Jangra.On Thursday night, the mutilated body of a 32-year-old doctor was found in the seminar hall of R G Kar Medical College & Hospital. The initial autopsy report stated that the victim was bleeding from her eyes, mouth and private parts.Dr Jangra said the incident is horrifying and as dastardly as the Nirbhaya incident of 2012. “We will continue our protests and even escalate it further if an independent inquiry, preferably by CBI, and law to make hospital campuses more secure isn’t ensured,” the Faima founder said.Meanwhile, hospitals said they are preparing plans to ensure patient services are minimally affected by the strike. The administration of AIIMS Delhi, which saw nearly 80% reduction in elective surgeries and 35% fall in admissions on Monday, said it has prepared a contingency plan to ensure critical and other patient care services do not get affected.Delhi’s RML Hospital, another central government-run facility, also issued an order asking all HODs to submit an action plan in view of the strike by its resident doctors’ association so that patient-care is minimally disrupted.In Kolkata, the strike by junior doctors continued to affect the functioning of government hospitals across the city, causing significant disruptions to patient care. There seems to be no immediate relief for patients in sight as the governing bodies of all state medical colleges, who met at the R G Kar campus on Monday evening, decided to carry on with the agitation.According to the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (Forda), during the indefinite strike, all outpatient departments and operation theatres will remain shut and ward duties will not be provided. Emergency services, however, will continue to operate as usual, it added.In Uttar Pradesh, protests were held at King George’s Medical University, Kalyan Singh Super Speciality Cancer Institute and Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences. Tying black ribbons on their hands and holding placards, the protesting doctors demanded a thorough probe and security for medical staff in hospitals.Protests were also held in Maharani Laxmibai Medical College, UP University of Medical Sciences (Saifai), SN Medical College (Agra) and a hospital in Kanpur.Maharashtra State Association of Resident Doctors announced a statewide strike starting Tuesday, halting all services except emergency care. In a statement, MARD said that authorities must speed up formation of an expert committee for implementation of the Central Healthcare Protection Act, improve security measures, including deployment of fully functional CCTVs and well-equipped guards for better safety of healthcare workers, apart from providing quality hostels and proper on-call rooms for resident doctors.In Chandigarh, over 100 elective surgeries were halted and OPD services were impacted as resident doctors at PGI went on an indefinite strike. GMCH doctors are set to join the strike from Tuesday.Resident doctors in Jammu staged a peaceful protest, suspending their regular work to demand justice.Doctors in several other states, including Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, also joined the strike.Meanwhile, Indian Medical Association has shot off a letter to Union health minister J P Nadda seeking urgent action to make hospital premises safe. IMA, in its letter, said hospitals across the country should be declared as safe zones, just like airports. All major government and private hospitals should have police camps and adequate security personnel, it added.“We can never fathom out why our airports are safe zones with three-layer security while hospitals are given a pause. Neither do we understand why violence on airline staff and their work disruptions deserve special legislation while doctors and hospitals are expected to fend for themselves,” IMA said.",Hospitals in Delhi and Kolkata were most affected as the two cities emerged as the epicentres of the protest. The Federation of All India Medical Association said more hospitals are likely to join the protests and suspend OPD and elective surgeries from Tuesday.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Amid outrage across the country over the Kolkata doctor rape and murder case, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday gave an ultimatum to police saying if it does not solve the case by Sunday, she would hand over the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).""If the police are unable to solve this by Sunday, we will hand over the case to the CBI,"" Mamata said after meeting the family of the deceased doctor.'The Bengal CM, who has many times hit out the CBI accusing it of working on the instructions of the BJP-led Centre, also added, ""However, the success rate of the central probe agency is very low.""The body of a 31-year-old doctor was found at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Friday morning.A day later, Kolkata Police arrested a civic volunteer, said to be the main accused in the case. The gruesome details of the rape-murder have sent chills across the nation prompting the doctors to go on a pan-India strike in protest.Meanwhile, three PILs were also filed in Calcutta High Court seeking a CBI investigation into the case.But when the accused is already in 14-day judicial custody, then why the opposition and others are asking for a CBI probe?The allegations of foul play started as the family of the deceased doctor alleged rape and murder. Her family, while speaking to Metro, alleged that the hospital initially tried to cover up the case by calling it suicide.""We want justice for our daughter. She did not deserve this. We want the truth to come out. I wonder why the hospital authorities had initially told us that she had committed suicide. What were they trying to hide?"" he said.Later, the police ruled out suicide after the initial autopsy report indicated that she was murdered after being sexually assaulted.The report stated, ""There was bleeding from both her eyes and mouth and injuries over the face. The victim was also bleeding from her private parts. She also has injuries in her belly, left leg... neck, in her right hand, ring finger and... lips.""Meanwhile, another police officer said that circumstantial evidence indicated a possibility that the woman doctor was first murdered and then raped by the arrested accused.""There is evidence that the doctor was sleeping alone in the seminar hall of the hospital when she was attacked by the accused. The woman tried to resist but was strangled to death. To make sure she was dead, he also smothered her. There is a possibility that the accused could have raped her after the murder,"" the officer told PTI.""It is a very shameful incident. The inquiry should be conducted properly. We demand a CBI inquiry because the police first said that it was a case of suicide and then said that it was a murder case. The accused they have arrested is also a part of the police administration,"" Union Minister Sukanta Majumdar said.The accused, who was reportedly an outsider frequenting the hospital premises, was arrested and charged under Sections 64 (rape) and 103 (murder) of BNS.According to reports, Sanjay Ray had access to every part of the hospital including rooms and wards. The lapse points to a nexus between security and the touts.His identity as a ""police guy"" also helped him in this case.The woman doctor was found dead in a seminar room in the hospital in the morning. The reports of how easily the accused was able to access the room she was sleeping in, have led to a huge outrage among doctors over security at a government-run hospital.Later, the hospital authorities expelled the two security persons contractually employed at the emergency ward for not discharging their duties properly which, in a way, led to the crime.The police investigation revealed that Ray was a civic volunteer of Kolkata Police, which he misused to commit the crime.Ray, a mere civic volunteer, enjoyed privileges and freedom of movement like the regular policemen. The initial investigation revealed he used to live at a police barrack in North Kolkata which is meant for regular cops in the permanent payroll, news agency IANS sources said.According to IANS, the investigating officials also found personal numbers of some lower-ranking police officers and staff from the accused's mobile phone.Roy, who is a trained boxer, got close to a few senior police officers over the years, following which he was moved to the Kolkata Police Welfare Board and posted to the police outpost at the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where the incident happened.""He had access to all departments owing to his proximity with some senior police officers and the hospital authorities. Nobody had the guts to stop his unhindered movements in and around the hospital,"" an officer told PTI.""There is ample evidence that the accused was throwing his weight around because of his proximity with senior police officers. This aspect is also under investigation,"" the officer said.The opposition raised questions as the West Bengal government formed a panel to probe the case. Demanding a CBI probe, the leader of the opposition in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly Suvendu Adhikari said, ""Instead of addressing the issue seriously, the State Government has formed an 11-member inquiry committee, which bizarrely includes some interns. It seems the government is either trying to cover up its negligence or is not taking this matter seriously.""""I urge the student community, especially medical students, to protest vigorously against the State Government's complacent attitude. I will provide all the support necessary to ensure justice for the deceased student,"" the BJP leader said.BJP MLA Agnimitra Paul also demanded a CBI investigation and a re-postmortem by a Central Government hospital.""The condition in which her body was found--completely naked with bruises--suggests she was raped and then murdered. We demand a CBI investigation. A postmortem should not be conducted after the evening, yet it was done here. If the postmortem is carried out under the state system, the truth will be buried,"" Paul said.The police reconstructed the crime scene without the presence of the arrested accused on Sunday. After committing the crime, the accused reportedly went to a police barrack and slept until Friday morning.""We are also talking to persons who were on duty on Thursday night till the next morning. CCTV footage is also being checked,"" Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal said.The police have seized the clothes and shoes worn by the accused during the crime. The officer stated that the accused had washed the clothes he was wearing during the crime, but his shoes, which had blood stains on them, were found during a search at the place he was staying.When asked if anyone else was involved in the crime along with the arrested accused, the officer said, ""As of now there is no evidence of that.""","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee gave an ultimatum to police saying if it does not solve the case by Sunday, she would hand over the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation.

His first wife was from Behala, his second from Park Circus, his third from Barrackpore, and his fourth from Alipore.""He got married for the third time to a girl from Barrackpore. But that also did not last long. Then he married a girl from the city's Alipore area,"" a neighbour said.The fourth wife, who worked at a petrol pump, had filed a complaint of domestic violence against Roy, which continued until their legal separation.As a trained boxer, Roy had developed close relationships with several senior police officers over the years, leading to his transfer to the Kolkata Police Welfare Board and his posting at the police outpost at the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where the incident took place. His proximity to senior officers and hospital authorities allowed him unhindered access to all departments, and no one dared to question his movements.The police have booked Roy under sections 64 (rape) and 103 (murder) of the BNS, and the investigation is ongoing. The accused's influence within the force was such that he had access to the Kolkata Police's 4th battalion's barracks, where he reportedly stayed and slept after committing the crime.","Sanjoy Roy was arrested in the rape and murder of a woman doctor in Kolkata.

It presents gender-disaggregated data across urban-rural divides and regions, highlighting disparities. Key indicators are derived from published data of various ministries, departments, and organisations.""Gender statistics play a crucial role in promoting and measuring gender equality. They provide benchmarks for progress, making visible similarities and differences between men and women,"" it said.The report said that from 2016 to 2020, age-specific fertility rate (ASFR) in the age group of 20-24 and 25-29 has reduced from 135.4 and 166.0 to 113.6 and 139.6, respectively. ASFR for 35-39 age group during this period has increased from 32.7 to 35.6 which shows that after settling in life, women are thinking of expansion of family.Adolescent fertility rate was 33.9 for illiterate population against 11.0 for the literate in 2020. This rate is considerably lower for even those who are literate but without any formal education (20.0) as compared to illiterate women, re-emphasising the importance of imparting education to women, said the report.","India's population in 2036 is expected to be more feminine compared to 2011.

Donations from deceased make South heart transplant topper,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/donations-from-deceased-make-south-heart-transplant-topper/articleshow/112476971.cms,"Times View Data shows that while the number of deceased donations in the South and the West show a substantial uptick, other regions are lagging behind. Laggard states must find out what makes these states more successful in their endeavours and adopt those practices. An inter-state meet on the subject would help.

NEW DELHI: Southern states lead in heart transplants, according to data shared by National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organisation (Notto).In 2023, 221 heart transplants were carried out across India. Of these, Notto data show that a maximum of 70 were carried out in Tamil Nadu, followed by Karnataka (35), Maharashtra (33), Gujarat (29) and Telangana (15).Delhi-NCR witnessed only 14 transplants, according to the govt report. Officials attribute the higher number of heart transplants in South India to an increase in harvesting from the deceased.India recorded a total of 1,099 deceased donations in 2023, with the highest number (252) reported in Telangana, followed by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka with 178 each, Maharashtra with 148, and Gujarat with 146, an official stated.A heart transplant is a surgery to remove a damaged or diseased heart and replace it with a healthy donor heart. While the liver and kidney can be donated by living donors, the heart must be donated by someone who is brain-dead and is on life support, also referred to as a 'deceased donor'.According to Dr Y K Misra, head of cardiac sciences and chief cardiovascular surgeon at Manipal Hospitals, southern states get considerably more deceased donations hence most patients requiring a heart transplant go there and get enrolled. ""Some of these states also provide free of cost medications to heart recipients,"" he added.The first successful heart transplant in India took place at AIIMS in 1994. Since then, number of such transplants have grown multi-fold but, doctors say, it remains a fraction of the actual requirement.Nearly 10 % of total number of heart patients suffer from end-stage heart failure which may necessitate a transplant. But due to scarcity of donors, doctors say, few can undergo a heart transplant. Private hospitals charge anywhere between Rs 20 to 25 lakh for a transplant. Govt hospitals perform the life-saving procedure for a fraction of the cost, but the wait list is too long.Dr Sudhir Gupta, assistant professor of forensic medicine at AIIMS, said, ""In India, certain amendments to Human Organ Transplant Act, 1994 are required to enhance cadaver-heart-retrieval. This may include making it mandatory for hospital ICUs to declare all brain deaths and register them with an online central organ registry for better coordination of cadaver heart donation, retrieval and transplantation.""","In 2023, 221 heart transplants were carried out across India. Telangana had the highest number (252) followed by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka with 178 each.

Hindenburg-Adani saga 2.0: Market impact wanes but politics peaks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindenburg-adani-saga-round-2-market-impact-wanes-but-politics-peaks/articleshow/112474312.cms,"NEW DELHI: Once bitten, twice shy. A cautious Indian stock market on Monday successfully negotiated the second Hindenburg salvo at the Adani Group with sensex and Nifty closing marginally lower despite a highly volatile trade through the day. And, while the markets did well to survive the potential Hindenburg disruptions, the politicians were once again at daggers drawn - going all out for another round of attacks and counterattacks.When US short seller Hindenburg Research had first targeted the Adani Group on January 24, 2023 accusing the conglomerate of orchestrating the ""largest con in corporate history"" by indulging in ""accounting fraud and stock price manipulation,"" the group companies faced a bloodbath on the bourses. Investors lost thousands of crores and within five weeks Adani Group companies market value plunged by around 65 per cent to Rs 6.7 lakh crore. In the process, Gautam Adani - group chairman as well as the second richest person in the world in late Jan 2023 - slid to below the 25th spot on the global rich list. Also his flagship Adani Enterprises had to axe its $2.5 billion follow-on public offering (FPO).In the 18 months since then, the Adani Group slowly but steadily made a strong comeback regaining bulk of its losses triggered by Hindenburg's allegations. In the first week of June this year, the combined market value of 10 Adani group companies stood at Rs 19.4 lakh crore. It took the group over 500 days to take its aggregate market capitalisation above the Rs 19.2 lakh crore-mark - the level it was on Jan 24, 2023.The Adani group got a big boost with the Supreme Court ruling out investigations by market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ). In a detailed order passed on January 3, the Supreme Court said that reports prepared by third-party organisations such as the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Hindenburg Research cannot be regarded as ""conclusive proof"". The Supreme Court later also dismissed a review petition filed against its January 3 verdict refusing to form any SIT or group of experts to conduct an investigation into the Adani-Hindenburg controversy.The stage for Round 2 of Hindenburg attack was set on August 10, when the US short seller posted on X saying, ""Something big soon India”. This time around the target was Sebi itself that probed allegations against Adani Group. They released a report which claimed that Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband had undisclosed investments in obscure offshore funds in Bermuda and Mauritius, the same entities allegedly used by Vinod Adani to round-trip funds and inflate stock prices. The report also alleged that Sebi chief's involvement showed a lack of transparency in the market regulator when it came to investigating the Adani group.These allegations were refuted by Buch and her husband, who issued a statement calling Hindenburg's latest tirade an attack on the credibility of Sebi and attempted ""character assassination"". Adani Group also rejected the report and termed the allegations malicious and manipulative of select public information. And finally, the Sebi also issued a statement and said Buch has made ""relevant disclosures"" from time to time, and also recused herself in matters involving potential conflicts of interest.Perhaps these denials and also the memories of January 23 impact ensured relative calm in the market on Monday amid apprehensions of another crash.Shares of eight Adani group firms ended lower on Monday after facing severe drubbing during the morning trade. At close of trade, the stock of Adani Wilmar slumped 4.14 per cent, Adani Total Gas went lower by 3.88 per cent, Adani Energy Solutions dropped 3.70 per cent, NDTV fell by 3.08 per cent, Adani Ports dipped 2.02 per cent, Adani Enterprises declined 1.09 per cent, ACC (0.97 per cent) and Adani Power (0.65 per cent) on the BSE.However, two of the group firms bounced back, with Ambuja Cements climbing 0.55 per cent and Adani Green Energy rising by 0.22 per cent.But while the markets reacted with caution, the politicians picked up from where they had left after the Round 1.The Congress was quick to cite the conflict of interest and question the veracity of Sebi probe against Adani Group. It urged the Supreme Court to transfer the Adani probe to the CBI or a Special Investigation Team given the ""likelihood of Sebi's compromise"". The grand old party also demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the allegations and threatened a nation-wide stir if the demand was not met. The other opposition parties also joined the Congress in demanding immediate resignation of Sebi chief and alleged a massive scam.However, the BJP came out strongly against Hindenburg Research and rejected the demand for a JPC probe. The BJP accused the grand old party of weakening the Indian economy and destroying investment in the country. BJP leader and former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad reiterated the party's line that the short-selling firm's allegations and the opposition's criticism of the market regulator are part of a wider conspiracy.While India is being globally seen as a safe, stable and promising market, the Congress party wants the stock market to crash and project that the Indian investment scenario is not safe, he alleged, suggesting that the opposition party was seizing on the ""chits"" provided by foreign entities to damage the economy.The BJP also linked Hindenburg Research to billionaire investor George Soros and his propaganda against the government led by Prime Minister Modi.Clearly, while the economic impact of Hindenburg revelations may now be limited as the investors and markets have become cautious, the political impact of this may be far from over.(With inputs from agencies)","US short seller Hindenburg Research had first targeted the Adani Group on January 24, 2023 accusing the conglomerate of orchestrating the ""largest con in corporate history"" The group companies faced a bloodbath on the bourses.

How medical tech can reach every Indian: Vinod Khosla

India has large youth unemployment and the fear is that AI could worsen it…

Doctors and tutors: Entrepreneur Vinod Khosla's vision for new digital India

AI can train an Uber driver to perform cardiac ultrasounds in a week: Vinod Khosla

Are you talking about guaranteed work or guaranteed income?

Should it be a universal basic income?

Do we want farm labourers to be earning (low) farm wages working in 45 degrees centigrade? No, that's not a job. It's servitude, but it’s a necessity today.. we can change the nature of those jobs. Vinod Khosla

How should AI be regulated? There are differing views on this.

What do you think about the future of entrepreneurship as an individual passion, and startup as a business in India?

Risk taking is very different from the financial venture ecosystem in India--it’s less risk taking and more focused on growth investments. I hope we start to get to more fundamental risk taking in India. Vinod Khosla

Should the government play a role in setting up a large fund itself?

You were one the earliest backers of Sam Altman. What prompted you to invest in Open AI?

We have to find somebody who has a vision and can make that happen. Mukesh Ambani did that with Jio. Sam Altman is doing it with Gen AI. He was a big part of my belief in AI. Vinod Khosla

Dependence on technology is also creating a lazy workforce at a time when India needs to reap benefits from the demographic dividend...

Technology can't override centuries-old human motivations: Vinod Khosla

You have worked closely with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus who is heading the transition government in Bangladesh. What are your hopes for him and the country?

What is your assessment of his ability to sort out the issues in Bangladesh?

On July 22 you had an exchange with Elon Musk on X which was one of the most mature exchanges of views that Musk has had on US politics...

Between the perils of tomorrow and promise of tomorrow,has always bet on the latter. That’s why billionaire founder of Khosla Ventures, who describes himself as a ‘techno-optimist with caring & empathy’, is busy convincing the world of an AI-powered future that can be good for all. Among the first investors in Open AI--and several Indian AI startups--Khosla spoke toofon a host of issues ranging from AI to startups to Mohammand Yunus and Elon Musk. Here’s an edited excerpt:Let’s look at a couple of different aspects of AI. From the national security point of view, governments want to be in control of their AI destiny, not be dependent on foreign algorithms. This is why we invested in Sarvam in India. Because India should have a national AI champion. We have invested in a company called Sakana in Japan.Japan has already announced doubling its national defence budget. They made it clear that AI be a Japanese AI, so they have control over it. Sovereignty and AI are important at a level people don’t quite understand.I would like to see a primary care physician for every Indian, available 24/7, for free as part of the set of digital services the government offers. Aadhaar was the first example of such a service. The hardest part of that service was identity, and that’s already done. With UPI payments are done too. There’s no reason not to add other digital services -- the two most important ones are a free tutor for every child and a free primary care doctor for every citizen of the country.I would like to send a clear message to the Indian government that AI educators, AI teachers for every child in India would cost far, far less than today’s schools and provide much more personalised instruction. Similarly, AI primary care doctors could scale primary care and health far better than any other way.None of these are hard technologies in today's context of AI, and we are working on both. If the Indian government wanted to take and offer it as their service, we would give them all the technology for free.There’s no agenda here. I’d give them all the technology for free, so it becomes a government service, and nobody has any questions about what the agenda is, other than these services should be available to every Indian and every Indian child and even adult education. It's very, very doable in the very short term, and I mean two to five years max.My wife is in India right now, talking about our free AI tutor (CK-12 tutor). One way is to just take it over. It's used in many countries already. It's being translated into 120 different languages. I'm fine if they develop it inside India and take it over and have a starting point that's useful today.Kids using this tutor do better. Turns out it's not only cheaper, but also substantially better. It can teach each kid at the level at which they are, in their language, in a way that the kid will understand best. For example, the same physics concept can be explained using the analogy of cricket or dance depending on which kid understands better with what analogy. You can generate AI explanations in real time, generate the content so it looks more interesting, though it's teaching the same concept.An AI tutor would change the level and method of teaching depending on each student’s level of understanding. If they're not keeping up with the class. Teach them in simpler steps, change the language…I really hope this becomes a national agenda in India. We would give the technology. The content is already there. I think fairly large chunks are translated into the Indian context. It's relatively lightweight to launch it as part of the digital public infrastructure.Digital public infrastructure should include payments, which are basic financial services everybody needs. It should include education. It should include primary healthcare. You can then expand it to others. This can be done, and it can be done philanthropically.In India we started ‘10 Bed ICU’ during Covid, because ICUs were not available in most parts of rural India. I donated the first couple of 100 to remote areas and we wanted to cover all 700 remote districts in India. It’s working really, really well.AI lets you take an unskilled person and teach them very quickly how to do skilled tasks, because the expertise sits in the AI. A 10-bed ICU is a very simple version of it, typically under the supervision of a regional hospital. A hospital in Manipur would cover the remote areas around it. It’s just the beginning of what is really possible.Yes, if you need an MRI, you are going to go to a city to get an MRI. But for simpler things like even an ultrasound can be done by an AI. You don’t need an ultrasound technician anymore. You can buy these devices for Rs 50,000 rupees. Of course, there’s expensive ones too, but small handheld, portable ones are becoming inexpensive and adapted to the Indian environment. All 6 lakh, however many villages there are, should have one. In fact, these diagnostics can be put in one van -- blood test, ultrasound, ECG...We have a company called Alivecor that sells ECG machines in the US for $99. They diagnose without a cardiologist 35 different cardiology conditions with AI. It’s FDA approved. Most of cardiology can be done with a simple device, and you don't need expertise, and expertise is what’s expensive. The cardiologist is what takes 20 years to train. And so this is the promise that I hope India pivots to rapidly.This is a real issue. Firstly, you can upgrade the skills of India’s youth very quickly with AI. We had a company (that General Electric bought) to teach an Uber driver to do a cardiac ultrasound in a week. It's FDA approved. This is an extension of the idea of an AI tutor, which is where we should start. You can impart skills, which very quickly, can be upgraded so they can participate at a higher level. The countries that do this well will be more competitive than others.Secondly, it’s hard to imagine the kind of abundance we can get (in an AI-driven economy). If GDP grows 10% in real terms for the next 25 years, you can imagine the standard living we can achieve and the kind of surplus we can have to provide income and other support to people for whom transition will be hard.The economy can grow much, much faster, and people can be upskilled much faster. We should think about the transition period. There’s very much Utopia at the other end, but, but there is a transition period, and people will get disrupted.India has schemes for guaranteed work. I think we will have to get guaranteed income.I think it will be absolutely required. I first wrote about it in 2016 that AI will cause great GDP growth, great productivity growth. I ended that piece by saying, we will need to think about universal basic income. It’s very clear to me, it's where it leads, but there will be enough abundance.If we are thinking of the world in 2050 do we want farm labourers to be earning farm wages working in 45 degrees centigrade heat in the fields? No, that's not a job. In my view it's servitude, but it’s a necessity today, and if we can change the nature of those jobs then it’s a good thing.The notion of GDP creation and GDP acceleration is separate from the notion of distribution in the west. It’s a controversial idea… everybody wants low taxes. India is in a much better position to tackle it, things like guaranteed work schemes were a bad idea from an economist point of view when they were enacted. They may not be a bad idea in the world of AI, because they are really ways for redistributing income.I believe there’s some right level of regulation. I was very involved in what President Biden did with what's called the ‘executive order on AI’, and that was the right level to focus it on.The technology is in very early stages. Remember, it was only December of 2022 that ChatGPT was released. It’s so new, most people haven't had time to adjust. And my bet is that in 6-12, months from now, the capability will be substantially better than it is today.Technology is making rapid progress, but, you know, human beings adjust at their pace, and jobs will take a decade or two to adjust.If you look at my robot prediction (over a billion robots that will do most of the low-value labour work done today), it’s like creating a business larger than the auto industry globally. How long does that take to put in place? A long time. So the physical world moves at a different pace, even with technology like robots. We just have to recognize that these things have to be managed and managed closely. Regulation may need to protect certain people.The venture business in the US is very different what’s what’s called the private equity business, which is the investing business, where you run spreadsheets and you calculate rates of return. We just bet on big ideas and we bet on technological risk. India’s startup system has been closer to private equity than real risk taking.If you need a physics invention or an AI algorithm invented, you don’t know you can do it when you start. So, risk taking is very different from the financial venture ecosystem in India. It is less risk taking and more focused on growth investments. I hope we start to get to more fundamental risk taking in India.I don’t think governments should be in this business. It’s too dynamic a business for governments.Look, there are so many good ideas. People don’t try them, and when they try them, you need certain types of special individuals to make them happen. These things don’t happen because some academic made a forecast. They happen because one person decides to change things.When Elon Musk said, I will build an electric car, every major automaker in the world had given up on it. In fact, the department of energy here did a forecast for the number of electric cars in 2035 which Elon Musk (Tesla) exceeded in 2016 itself.So, big companies and institutions don't do these things. We have to find somebody who has a vision and can make that happen. Mukesh Ambani did that with Jio. He said, I will lay fibre... I don’t care about the market. Everybody thought it was a stupid 10 billion investment. He just made it happen. So it takes individuals, and Sam was a big part of my belief in AI.The one problem technology will not solve is human motivation. If there’s an easier way, humans tend to take it. I am not sure we should say technology will solve every problem, because human motivations will not change. They haven’t changed for the last 500 years. In the new context, they're presented differently, but personal self interest has always been the case. Less work and more goods has always been something people strive for.I have been to Bangladesh and over the last three to six months, I have been in touch with him (Yunus) and all of his people and writing in support of him when he was being put in jail. I was very much advocating he not be sent to jail, which the then prime minister had wanted to do. I was very much part of the process of trying to give it enough visibility so he doesn’t get sent to jail.Most of it is through public relations influence. There was a full paid ad in the New York Times. Richard Branson and I and a few others funded that. It was much less with the government itself, much more general public pressure and visibility, which obviously autocrats don’t love.It's not my area of expertise. I have been there, I have talked to him a lot. I know he is a caring man, and we have gotten to know him over the years and his foundation. But as to the status of the country, it's very hard to say. As far as I can tell Yunus has said that he has no interest in being in politics, so it is very unlikely he will play a role other than the interim role. He is mostly interested in helping the transition and getting out of the way, and hopefully we will see democratic elections.My interaction with him on Twitter was the most rational discourse I have seen. It was not emotional. It was rational. It got close to 14 or 15 million views because it was rational.Elon is an emotional person, so his comments on the UK riots, I don’t know why he's wading into that. Obviously, he is not doing it because he has an agenda. He has nothing to gain from that.On the question of liberal views versus sort of super conservative views. I don’t think he is particularly religious, so it's not like he’s a religious conservative. I do think there’s a personal side of him that rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, because of the situation with one of his children. I think that's where it goes into the emotional domain as opposed to the logical domain of what’s good for progress, what's good for government. He is a very smart guy, obviously.",Vinod Khosla is one of the first investors in Open AI and several Indian AI startups.

India Commissions INS Arighat: Second Nuclear Submarine Armed with Nuclear Missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-fully-ready-to-add-to-fleet-2nd-sub-with-n-tipped-missiles/articleshow/112433199.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is now all set to commission its second nuclear-powered submarine armed with nuclear missiles for strategic deterrence, while the project to build two nuclear-powered attack submarines with conventional weapons is also headed for final approval amid China’s fast-expanding naval footprint in the Indian Ocean Region.The 6,000-tonne INS Arighat , constructed at the ship-building centre (SBC) at Vizag, is “fully ready” for formal commissioning after extensive trials that saw some technical issues being ironed out with upgrades over an extended period.“The SSBN (naval parlance for nuclear-propelled submarines with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles) will be commissioned within a month or two. She will then join her sister INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018,” a source told TOI.Parallelly, on the conventional (non-nuclear) warfare front, the around Rs 40,000 crore project to indigenously construct two nuclear-powered submarines, armed with torpedoes, anti-ship and land-attack missiles, is now before the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the final nod after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations, another source said.The initial case was for six such 6,000-tonne `hunter-killer’ submarines (called SSNs) under `Project-77’ at the SBC. But it was first whittled down to three and now stands at two vessels. It will take at least a decade to build the first two SSNs, which will be around 95% indigenous, while the next four will be approved at a later stage, the source said.As per long-standing approved plans, India requires at least 18 diesel-electric submarines, four SSBNs and six SSNs to tackle the twin-threat from China and Pakistan, which is also turning collusive in the maritime domain after the land borders.The country, however, currently has only one SSBN in INS Arihant, which is propelled by an 83 MW pressurized light-water reactor at its core, and 16 diesel-electric submarines. Moreover, the conventional underwater combat fleet consists of six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines, apart from six new French-origin Scorpenes.China, in contrast, already has 60 submarines, and is fast building more. Its fleet includes six Jin-class SSBNs, armed with JL-3 missiles that have a strike range of 10,000 km, and six SSNs.INS Arighat will to a certain extent strengthen India’s weakest leg of the nuclear triad, or the capability to fire nukes from land, air and sea. The land and air vectors, with the Agni ballistic missiles and fighters with nuclear gravity bombs, are relatively more robust.While INS Arighat will also be armed with 750-km range K-15 missiles like INS Arihant, she can carry a larger number of them. The real teeth will come when the third SSBN, the slightly larger 7,000-tonne INS Aridhaman with 3,500-km range K-4 missiles, is commissioned next year.The fourth SSBN, which will be able to carry more K-4 missiles, is also being constructed under the secretive Rs 90,000 crore advanced technology vessel (ATV) project launched decades ago. There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs with much more powerful 190 MW reactors.Bigger SSBNs with longer-range missiles will give India’s deterrence posture greater credibility because they are the most secure and survivable platforms for assured retaliatory strikes after a first-strike by an adversary.The SSNs, in turn, are critical because they can discreetly operate at high speeds for long distances while remaining submerged for extended periods to take out enemy targets unlike diesel-electric submarines that have to surface or “snorkel” every few days to get oxygen to recharge their batteries.Till the indigenous SSNs roll out, India is slated to get an advanced Akula-class SSN on lease from Russia in 2026 under the $3 billion deal inked in Mar 2019, as reported by TOI earlier.","The 6,000-tonne INS Arighat is ‘fully ready’ for formal commissioning after extensive trials.

Soros-backed opposition plot to destabilise India: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/soros-backed-opposition-plot-to-destabilise-india-bjp/articleshow/112477480.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP on Monday slammed Congress and other opposition parties for endorsing short-seller Hindenburg 's attack on Sebi and questioning the resilience of the Indian stock market and alleged that this was part of the plan to destabilise India backed by controversial currency speculator George Soros ""After being rebuffed by the people of India, Congress, its allies and the toolkit gang have conspired together to usher in economic anarchy and instability in India.Hindenburg report is released on Saturday, there is uproar on Sunday so the capital market is destabilised on Monday. India is globally seen as a safe, stable and promising market,"" former Union minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said at a presser.He said Congress and other opposition parties had developed ""pathological hatred"" for PM Narendra Modi and were trying to destabilise the country at the behest of Hindenburg, which has Soros as its main investor. Emphasising that the currency speculator, who has been funding protests in different parts of the world, Prasad said, ""Today we want to raise some issues. Whose investment is there in Hindenburg? Do you know this gentleman George Soros who regularly runs propaganda against India... He is the main investor there. In their pathological hatred for Narendra Modi, the Congress party has developed hatred for India itself.""The attack was amplified by Union ministers Jyotiraditya Scindia and Giriraj Singh and came amid a palpable sense of satisfaction in BJP circles over Sensex dodging the crash it suffered after Hindenburg fired its first attack on the Adani group last year.What further elevated the mood was Rahul Gandhi's post on X where he talked about ""significant risk in Indian market"" in view of Hindenburg's charge of nexus between the market regulator and Adani group. Party circles, which were surprised by Rahul's comment and interpreted it as part of the ""plot"" to create chaos, happily pointed out that Sensex's resilience on Monday showed that investors had rebuffed the ""opposition's scare tactic"".Interestingly, BJP social media head Amit Malviya drew attention to Rahul's assets as disclosed in his Lok Sabha poll nomination papers to say the leader of opposition was getting good returns on his investments in the market. He claimed that Rahul was raising a scare to drive investors out of the market.""If he is so convinced about the compromised nature of our markets, why is he personally invested? He holds 43% of his total declared assets in the Indian stock market. That is a lot of faith in the Indian markets. As on March 15, 2024, he owned shares worth Rs 4.3 crore, held mutual funds totalling up to Rs 3.8 crore and had invested Rs 15 lakh in gold bonds,"" Malviya said.""Rahul Gandhi's movable assets grew by 59% over 2019. This was made possible because the Indian economy, despite all odds, performed very well. But he is fear mongering and dissuading retail investors from participating in wealth creation,"" he added.","Hindenburg report is released on Saturday, there is uproar on Sunday so the capital market is destabilised on Monday. India is globally seen as a safe, stable and promising market,"" former Union minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

ED seeks clarity from SC on role of HCs in coal scam cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-seeks-clarity-from-sc-on-role-of-hcs-in-coal-scam-cases/articleshow/112476737.cms,"NEW DELHI: A decade after Supreme Court cancelled illegal allotment of coal blocks, mostly by the UPA govt, Enforcement Directorate on Monday sought clarity from the apex court on its decision barring high courts from entertaining accused ’s appeals against trial court decisions.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that two three-judge benches, in their rulings of July 2014 and July 2017, had barred accused from moving HCs against proceedings before the special CBI judge to expedite the trial.Bhati drew the court’s attention to two orders passed by a two-judge bench led by Justice A S Oka asking coal scam accused to move the jurisdictional HC for relief, while refusing to entertain their pleas.The three-judge benches of the SC in their judgments of 2014 and 2017 had said if any accused wanted to challenge an order of the trial court, then they would have to move the SC directly. In doing so, the SC had followed an earlier judgment that had cancelled illegal allocation of 2G spectrum to private parties on a first come-first served basis. The intent of the court was to prevent accused in both 2G scam and coal scam from impeding the trial process by moving the HC and had kept only the forum of SC open for them.Appearing for some accused, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the right of the accused, who are presumed innocent till pronounced guilty, could not be constricted by barring them from moving the jurisdictional HC under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code to appeal against orders of the trial court.Though the SC had taken care to stop accused from delaying trial by moving the top court, the stay it granted on April 1, 2015, to the summons issued by a trial court to former PM Manmohan Singh in the alleged irregular allocation of Talabira-II coal block in Odisha to Hindalco in 2005 has not come up for hearing even once in the last nearly one decade.On April 1, 2015, the SC had stayed the summons and admitted the appeals filed by Singh and five other accused. The SC had said, “Since certain important substantial questions of law as well as the constitutional validity of Section 13(1)(d)(iii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, are raised in the instant petitions, we are of the view that these matters require examination."" The SC had also stayed further proceedings in the case before the trial court.The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Aug 19 and said it would have to read the two judgments in the coal scam cases and the subsequent orders of Justice Oka’s bench and then hear the parties to decide whether any clarification is needed.",Two three-judge benches of the SC in their judgments of 2014 and 2017 had said if any accused wanted to challenge an order of the trial court then they would have to move the SC directly.
