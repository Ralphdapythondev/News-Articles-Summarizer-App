"'To avoid flare ups': In SC, UP govt justifies order to name shop owners during Kanwar Yatra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-avoid-flare-ups-in-sc-up-govt-justifies-order-to-name-owners-during-kanwar-yatra/articleshow/112029803.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Uttar Pradesh government defended its order in the Supreme Court on Friday, stating that the directive to name owners during the Kanwar Yatra was issued to ensure that the religious sentiments of Kanwariyas are not inadvertently hurt and to maintain peace and tranquility in the region.The UP government's response comes days after the Supreme Court halted UP, Uttarakhand and other state governments from implementing their directives to compel shop owners and hawkers along the routes of the kanwar yatra to display their names along with those of staff members and said that only the kind of food they serve should be mentioned.""Even small confusions regarding the kind of food Kanwariyas are served, has the potential to hurt their religious sentiments and cause flare ups, especially in a communally sensitive area like Muzaffarnagar,"" Live Law quoted the UP government as saying.""Past incidents have shown that misunderstandings regarding the type of food being sold have led to tensions and disturbances. The directives are a proactive measure to avoid such situations,"" it added.The court issued notice to Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi governments seeking their response by July 26.“We deem it appropriate to pass interim order prohibiting the enforcement of the impugned directives.

Bill introduced to strengthen US-India partnership and counter China's influence in Indo-Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bill-introduced-to-strengthen-us-india-partnership-and-counter-chinas-influence-in-indo-pacific/articleshow/112029241.cms,"NEW DELHI: US senator Marco Rubio introduced a bill in American Congress on Friday that aims to strengthen the US-India partnership and counter the growing influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region .""In order to strengthen our partnership with India, it’s essential we increase our strategic relationship with New Delhi.

It also seeks to bar Pakistan from receiving security assistance if it is found to have sponsored terrorism against India.""Communist China continues to aggressively expand its domain in the Indo-Pacific region, all while it seeks to impede the sovereignty and autonomy of our regional partners.

"BJD, AIADMK, YSRCP flag neglect of Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjd-aiadmk-ysrcp-flag-neglect-of-odisha-tamil-nadu-and-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/112028857.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJD, AIADMK and YSRCP , the three parties that so far have mostly bailed out the BJP-led govt in Rajya Sabha, flagged inadequate budget for Odisha , Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The charge from BJD was more intense as it alleged that it was complete “betrayal of Odisha” despite the state having elected 20 BJP MPs in the general elections, which has helped Narendra Modi to become Prime Minister for the third consecutive time.BJD’s Debashish Samantaray alleged the govt has neglected the regional aspiration despite 204 MPs in the Lok Sabha members are from regional parties. Raising the issue of inadequate budgetary allocation to Odisha, the MP said, “I don’t remember how many times they came running to Naveen Patnaik’s knees for their govt’s sake. We supported them, but they forgot. Just to win an election such wrong narratives and such unparliamentary aspersions about Naveen Patnaik’s health. What standards Indian politics has gone to?”The BJP MP alleged the govt for regional imbalance by neglecting West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. He charged the govt of appeasing only two states and no mention of Odisha in President’s speech and Budget despite the state taking lead in supplying oxygen during the Covid-19 crisis. The BJD legislator said the state has got nothing despite being the biggest producer of coal and iron ore. “Today in Rajya Sabha, the opposition is more (number) than the ruling party,” Samantaray said.In response to a stray remark, he said, “Let the President’s election come, then you will see.”Participating in the discussion, AIADMK member C Ve Shanmugam said that the allocation of funds in the Budget “does not sufficiently address the pressing needs of Tamil Nadu” in relation to infrastructure, social justice, healthcare and education. He added that govt has made no provision for new projects, no allocation for the industrial corridor and for phase-2 of Chennai Metro.In his speech, even YSRCP leader V Vijayasai Reddy charged the govt of doing figure jugglery to give an impression that majority of the fund has gone to Andhra Pradesh. He said the Budget only talks of arranging Rs 15,000 crore loan for development of the state capital. “Can it be treated as a grant? Even the interest and repayment has to be done by the state,” he said.","BJD, AIADMK and YSRCP flagged inadequate budget for Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.

As banker Vishal Batra stood at Point 5140 in Drass Thursday, scanned the horizon and yelled ""Yeh dil maange more"" thrice, he was harking back to a moment etched as much in the national consciousness as the deepest recesses of his heart.Kargil hero Capt Vikram Batra , his twin and posthumous Param Vir Chakra winner, had uttered those words 25 years ago in a famous victory message after capturing Tiger Hill.Vishal wanted to recreate the moment and feel his brother's spirit in the wind brushing against his face on that barren terrain where bravery remains the final milestone.The twins would have celebrated turning 50 together on Sept 9. Vishal, a spitting image of his brother, visited one of the posts Capt Batra had occupied a quarter of a century ago ""to be closer to him"" in their ""special year"".""After 45 days, I will be a 50-year-old with grey hair, but Vikram will remain young at 25. We shared a strong bond, being identical twins and more like friends,"" he told TOI.Vishal rounded off his tribute to the slogan immortalised by his brother with the J&K Rifles' war cry ""Durga Mata Ki Jai"".""I travelled to the remote post with permission from the Army Chief of Staff, Gen Upendra Dwivedi, who acceded to my special request. Some of the soldiers who had worked with my brother accompanied me,"" he said.""The atmosphere was charged with emotion as I walked through the area and spoke to those who had shared his journey. Each step at the post, which is at an altitude of around 17,000 feet, was a poignant reminder of the sacrifice and valour of Vikram and his men.""Capt Batra wrote four letters to his sibling between June 16 and July 5, 1999. The first spoke of his ""mission"". The second one, written on June 23, mentioned that he had been recommended for the Maha Vir Chakra, the country's second highest gallantry award.In his third letter, datelined July 2, was about him moving further for his next mission. ""We received the final letter after he died in battle,"" Vishal recalled.The twins' mother Kamal Kant Batra, who died this Feb, had named them ""Luv and Kush"" because she was a disciple of Ram.""When he was alive, I was called Kush, being the younger one. Now, I am proud to be known as the brother of Shershah (Capt Vikram's codename during the Kargil War),"" Vishal said.Vishal said he wanted to join the Army as much as his twin, and they together appeared for an SSB interview in Allahabad. ""He was selected in his first attempt, but I was rejected. I tried thrice but didn't make it. Perhaps, it was destiny. I am living a dream through my brother.""On the 20th anniversary of Kargil War in 2019, Vishal had visited Point 4875, later named ""Batra Top"". Capt Batra was among the 25 casualties the Army suffered while capturing that post.

Budget 2024: How TCS is set to become less TDS for salaried class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-how-tcs-is-set-to-become-less-tds-for-salaried-class/articleshow/111970089.cms,"Top Picks For You Budget 2024: Out with old, new makes news

Individuals miffed at tax collection at source ( TCS ) proposals have now been offered a small relief - provided they have salary income .At present, a salaried employee may declare income, such as bank interest and rent, to their employer, who factors this and, accordingly, deducts a higher tax against the monthly salary. The employee then does not have to worry about paying advance tax as adequate tax has already been withheld.A similar norm comes into effect from Oct 1.The salaried employee will be able to declare TCS and the employer will factor this in, resulting in a lower TDS against salary income. Thus, it will avoid cash-flow issues. Further, if a refund was due, owing to TCS, the individual taxpayer will no longer have to wait for it as it is adjusted against TDS on salary income.TCS applies to a wide range of remittances made under Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of Reserve Bank of India. It permits an individual to remit up to $2.5 lakh per year, without seeking prior approval.Thus far, purchase of an overseas tour package pinched the pocket - it meant a 5% TCS for a remittance of up to Rs 7 lakh; if the expenditure was higher, TCS was 20%. Or for that matter, sending a child overseas meant that TCS at 5% was deducted for any remittance above Rs 7 lakh (the rate was lower for remittances via education loans).In short, the Budget has added a sweetener to TCS provisions for salaried individuals.","The salaried employee will be able to declare TCS and the employer will factor this in, resulting in a lower TDS against salary income.

Olympics: Will India go past historic Tokyo medal haul in Paris?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/olympics-will-india-go-past-historic-tokyo-medal-haul-in-paris/articleshow/112007716.cms,"WILL NUMBER SEVEN BE BREACHED?

THE CHIEF MEDAL CONTENDERS

STRONG HOPES

DON'T RULE THEM OUT

(With PTI inputs)

As the Olympic Games commence in Paris on Friday, the 117 Indian athletes participating in the event find themselves in diverse situations. While a few carry the weight of immense expectations on their shoulders, others are determined to deliver unexpected triumphs. Meanwhile, some seasoned competitors are focused on concluding their illustrious careers on a high note.The nation anticipates an improved performance compared to the previous edition of the Games.India's haul of seven medals from Tokyo has raised hopes for a double-digit tally this time around.Apart from the wrestlers, who have endured a tumultuous lead-up to the event, athletes across all disciplines have expressed satisfaction with their preparations. The meticulous planning, which included overseas training stints and access to top-notch facilities, has been instrumental in honing their skills.However, the lingering question remains: will the dedication, well-crafted strategies, and unwavering support from the nation translate into a shower of medals for India? Only time will tell as the world's greatest sporting spectacle unfolds in the French capital.Matching the impressive tally of seven medals from the Tokyo Olympics will be an arduous challenge for India at the upcoming Games, considering that apart from the current Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra , few athletes are considered top contenders in their respective events.The majority of the 117-member Indian contingent comes from three sports: athletics (29), shooting (21), and hockey (19). Among these 69 athletes, 40 are making their Olympic debut.Debutants can also be found in other sports, such as tennis player N Sriram Balaji and wrestler Reetika Hooda. Although they are not entirely inexperienced, India's campaign will largely be driven by athletes who are competing on such a grand stage for the first time.Simultaneously, there are seasoned athletes who are expected to elevate their performance accordingly.For PV Sindhu, a two-time Olympic medallist in badminton; tennis icon Rohan Bopanna; legendary table tennis player Sharath Kamal and hockey goalkeeper PR Sreejesh, this will undoubtedly be their final Olympic appearance.The hockey team's form leading up to the Games has been inconsistent, while the boxers and wrestlers have had limited real competition experience. Similarly, the shooters have delivered mixed results in the lead-up to the Olympics.The recent performances of Indian track and field athletes, particularly Avinash Sable, have been impressive. However, when compared to their international counterparts, their achievements may not be sufficient to place them as strong contenders for medals.Sable, a steeplechaser, has consistently improved his own national record, with his best time currently standing at 8:09.94. Despite his remarkable progress, there are seven international athletes who have recorded faster times leading up to the Olympic Games.Considering the fierce competition, reaching the finals alone would be regarded as a significant accomplishment.India's aspirations for Olympic glory rest heavily on the shoulders of Neeraj, the javelin sensation, despite lingering concerns about his adductor niggle. Alongside him, the dynamic badminton pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, who have been in scintillating form, are also expected to make a significant impact.Although the elusive 90m mark has remained beyond Neeraj's grasp from Tokyo to Paris, the ace javelin thrower has consistently delivered performances that have been just enough to secure global titles. When it matters most, on the grandest stages of competition, Neeraj has outshone his highly regarded rivals.If he can maintain his fitness, the Panipat-born athlete has a genuine opportunity to etch his name in India's sporting annals by becoming only the third athlete to clinch back-to-back Olympic medals.Only Sindhu (2016 Rio and 2012 Tokyo) and wrestler Sushil Kumar (2008 Beijing, 2012 London) have managed to win two consecutive medals.Satwik and Chirag have blossomed into one of India's most formidable men's doubles teams in badminton, and they are widely regarded as strong contenders for a podium finish. Their exceptional skills and unwavering determination have positioned them as serious medal hopefuls.As for Sindhu, despite not being in peak form and facing a challenging draw, her wealth of experience could prove invaluable if she can navigate through the initial rounds. Her past successes and mental fortitude could propel her into the medal rounds once again.The Indian men's hockey team's recent performance has been erratic. During their tour of Australia, they suffered defeats in all five matches, following an inconsistent showing in the Pro League. This contrasts sharply with their triumphant campaign at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, where they secured the championship title.The team continues to grapple with issues related to converting penalty corners and sustaining their intensity throughout the duration of a match.To compound their challenges, India finds itself in a formidable group alongside powerhouses such as Australia and Belgium, besides Argentina, New Zealand and Ireland. In order to advance to the top four from this pool, the team cannot afford any missteps or lapses in performance.The Indian shooting team, consisting of 21 members, has quietly prepared for the upcoming event, marking their largest contingent ever. This contrasts with the previous Games in London and Tokyo, where rising stars like Manu Bhaker and Saurabh Chaudhary had generated significant medal expectations due to their outstanding performances leading up to the competitions. However, they failed to live up to the hype.Similarly, Divyansh Panwar and Elavenil Valarivan were once regarded as future superstars, but they too have not met expectations. Despite the lack of attention on the shooters this time around, Sift Kaur Samra (50m three position), Sandeep Singh (10m air rifle), and Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar (men's 50m rifle) possess the potential to break the 12-year medal drought for India in shooting.The last Indian shooter to secure a medal was Gagan Narang, who clinched the bronze in the 10m air rifle event at the 2012 London Games. Narang is serving as India's Chef de Mission for the Paris Games.The last four Olympic Games have seen India secure a medal in wrestling. Expectations were high for the Paris Games, with hopes of winning four to five medals, but a protest against the Wrestling Federation of India brought the sport to a halt.National camps and competitions were suspended for an extended period. The qualified wrestlers have been training independently at various centers within India and overseas.While the fitness levels of many wrestlers remain uncertain, Anshu Malik, Antim Panghal and Aman Sehrawat are regarded as India's top prospects heading into the Games. Reetika Hooda, the reigning U-23 world champion, could emerge as a surprise contender, while Vinesh Phogat cannot be overlooked.The table tennis players and archers have secured their spots in the upcoming Games based on their rankings. While the TT players' qualification is a significant accomplishment, the archers' performance leaves room for doubt.In the past, the archers have made grand promises but failed to live up to expectations. The recent incident involving their coach being refused accreditation for the Games has cast a shadow over their campaign from the very beginning.Mirabai Chanu, the weightlifter who won silver at the Tokyo Games, has been grappling with injuries and inconsistent form recently, which may have affected her mental preparedness. There are doubts about whether she can replicate her previous success.The experienced boxer Nikhat Zareen and her teammate Nishant Dev will be closely monitored, as their recent results have been promising.To date, India has secured 35 medals at the Olympics, with shooter Abhinav Bindra (2008) and Neeraj Chopra (2021) being the sole individual gold medalists.","India's haul of seven medals from Tokyo has raised hopes for a double-digit tally this time around.

PM Modi to launch construction of 'world's highest tunnel' today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-launch-construction-of-worlds-highest-tunnel-today/articleshow/112024982.cms,"NEW DELHI: The “first blast” to launch the construction of the strategically-crucial Shinkun La tunnel for alternate all-weather connectivity and swifter troop mobility to Ladakh will be conducted “virtually” by PM Narendra Modi on Friday.The project to construct the 4.1 km long twin-tube tunnel at an altitude of 15,800-feet, under the forbidding Shinkun Pass (La means pass) on the Nimmu-Padam-Darcha road by the Border Roads Organization ( BRO ) at a cost of Rs 1,681 crore, was approved by the PM-led cabinet committee on security in February last year.Construction of tunnels along the northern borders with China remains a top priority despite harsh weather and terrain conditions, amid the continuing military confrontation in eastern Ladakh, which is into its fifth year now.The Sela tunnel, built at an altitude of over 13,000-feet on the Balipara-Chariduar-Tawang road in Arunachal Pradesh for Rs 825 crore, for instance, was inaugurated in March. Tunnels, of course, can also be used for underground storage of ammunition, missiles, fuel and other supplies. “Several more tunnels are under-construction or in the planning stage,” an officer said.The Shinkun La tunnel, which will have cross-passages every 500 metres, will take at least two years to be completed. “It will then be the highest such tunnel in the world, bypassing the Mi La tunnel in China at 15,590-feet. It will not only ensure swift and efficient movement of troops and heavy weapon systems but also foster economic and social development in Ladakh,” he added.Modi, accompanied by defence minister Rajnath Singh and the military brass, will conduct the ground-breaking ceremony for the tunnel virtually during his visit to the Kargil war memorial at Drass on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the conflict with Pakistan. During the Kargil conflict, 527 Indian soldiers laid down their lives and 1,363 were injured while evicting well-entrenched Pakistani intruders from the heights against all odds.The construction of the Shinkun La tunnel comes after the BRO in March established “connectivity” on the 298-km Nimmu-Padam-Darcha road in Ladakh, which will be the third axis to the strategically important region.“The Nimmu-Padam-Darcha road derives its strategic importance from the fact that it’s not only shorter vis-a-vis the other two routes (Manali-Atal tunnel-Sarchu-Leh and Srinagar-Zojila-Kargil-Leh), but also crosses only one pass, the Shinkun La at 16,700-feet,” another officer said.“The Shinkun Pass remains snow-bound for around five months every year thus cutting off this route. The tunnel under it will ensure all-weather connectivity,” he added.India has to some extent reduced the huge “infrastructure differential” with China along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, in terms of roads, tunnels, bridges, troop habitats, permanent defences, helipads and airfields over the last four years.But a lot still remains to be done, with China setting a frenetic pace in building border infrastructure and dual-use `Xiaokang’ villages, strengthening military positions and deploying additional aircraft at its air-bases facing India, as reported by TOI earlier.","The project to construct the 4.1 km long twin-tube tunnel at an altitude of 15,800-feet was approved by the PM-led cabinet committee on security in February last year. The Shinkun La tunnel, which will have cross-passages every 500 metres, will take at least two years to be completed.

NEET-UG scam: Number of toppers set to drop from 61 to 17 in revised list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-ug-scam-toppers-number-set-to-drop-from-61-to-17-in-revised-list/articleshow/112024237.cms,"NEW DELHI: The number of toppers in the NEET-UG exam is set to come down to 17 from 61 when National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announces the revised merit list , most likely on Friday.Revision of the merit list was necessitated after IIT-Delhi , working at Supreme Court's instance, recommended that only one of the options in a question in the physics paper was correct.Several students had complained that two of the four options could be held to be correct going by different NCERT books. With only one answer being deemed correct, those who had chosen the other option lost five marks (four marks for wrong answer and one negative mark), in what was sure to have a cascading effect on the ranks of all those who took the exam.This decision will primarily impact the scores of 4.2 lakh candidates, including 44 who achieved perfect scores of 720, because they had opted for the answer deemed incorrect by IIT-Delhi and for which they had been awarded four marks earlier by NTA. “The number of toppers, which stands at 61, will come down to 17, post the deduction of marks,” an NTA official said.The change in ranking could prove to be crucial for many students considering that over 24 lakh aspirants took the NEET-UG for the 1.08 medical seats up for grabs in the country. Of these, 56,000 seats are in govt institutions, which are much sought after for their better infrastructure and lower fees.According to sources, the biggest impact will be on candidates ranked between 50,000 to 1 lakh as over 16,000 candidates, who were earlier likely to earn a seat in a medical college, are likely to go out of the cohort.Sources said the impact on the 44 students, who will no longer be toppers, will not be much as they would still feature in the rank cohort of 33,000 to 50,000 but change in their ranks will impact their chance of securing seats in govt medical colleges of their choice.",The number of toppers in the NEET-UG exam is set to come down to 17 from 61 when National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announces the revised merit list.Revision of the merit list was necessitated after IIT-Delhi recommended that only one of the options in a question was correct.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112024337,imgsize-98584,width-400,resizemode-4/112024337.jpg"
"LAC standoff: S Jaishankar, Wang Yi seek 'strong guidance' to end border impasse",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jaishankar-wang-seek-strong-guidance-to-end-border-impasse/articleshow/112024562.cms,"For the second time in 3 weeks, foreign ministers of India and China, S Jaishankar and Wang Yi respectively, met Thursday agreeing significantly on the need for a “strong guidance” to complete the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh, an issue blocking return of normalcy to bilateral ties.Jaishankar’s remark stating the same in a post on X seemed to improve upon the outcome of their previous meeting in Kazakhstan earlier this month where he called for redoubling efforts to achieve complete disengagement and both leaders agreed prolongation of the border situation was not in the interest of either side.The ministers met on this occasion on the margins of an ASEAN event in Vientiane.However, even as they agreed to work with urgency for full disengagement, Jaishankar reiterated India’s position - that peace and tranquillity on the borders and respect for LAC are essential for normalcy in bilateral relations - as he said the state of the border will necessarily be reflected on the state of our ties.“Agreed on the need to give strong guidance to complete the disengagement process. Must ensure full respect for the LAC and past agreements. It is in our mutual interest to stabilize our ties. We should approach the immediate issues with a sense of purpose and urgency,” said Jaishankar after the meeting.He also told Wang in his opening remarks at a time the world is faced with conflicts and disruption to the global economy, it is in the mutual interest of India and China to stabilise ties and focus on development. “Our ability to ensure that they are stable and forward looking is essential both for the prospects of Asia and that of the multipolar world,” he said, adding Sino-Indian ties today have an exceptional significance.Separately, the Indian government said in a statement that the talks focussed on finding an early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC to stabilize and rebuild bilateral relations and that both ministers agreed on the need to work with purpose and urgency to achieve complete disengagement at the earliest.“Both sides must fully abide by relevant bilateral agreements, protocols, and understandings reached between the two governments in the past,” said the Indian readout. Like in the last meeting, Jaishankar stressed the importance of the three mutuals - mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity - to ties. Ministers also again agreed to hold another round of diplomatic talks to address the issue.While the Chinese readout didn’t specifically mention the need to expedite disengagement in the remaining areas, it did say the 2 sides agreed to work together to maintain peace and promote “new progress” in border affairs consultation “It is hoped that the two sides will meet each other halfway, actively explore the correct way for the two neighbouring major countries to get along, and guide all sectors to establish a positive understanding of each other,” said the Chinese statement, adding Wang stressed normalcy in Sino-Indian ties is also a common expectation of the Global South.Interestingly, the strong guidance formulation is also a throwback to the India-China joint statement after the first informal summit in Wuhan in 2018 where PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping agreed to issue “strategic guidance” to their respective militaries to strengthen communication in order to build trust and mutual understanding.India and China have achieved disengagement at 4 points in the western sector, since the ongoing standoff erupted in May 2020, but the same has remained elusive in Depsang and Demchok areas even after 21 rounds of military and 15 rounds of diplomatic talks. China sees these as legacy issues that predate the current standoff.","India and China have achieved disengagement at 4 points in the western sector, since the ongoing standoff erupted in May 2020.

LAMOCHAN (DRASS): A quarter-century later, Namgyal has two wishes: compensation for the 18 yaks eaten by the intruders and official recognition in the form of a civilian honour . “Govt provides compensation for various losses, but I have not received anything for my yaks. I am ready to provide all details through the village nambardar to get compensated,” he said.Namgyal acknowledges the annual honours he receives from the Army during Kargil Vijay Diwas, but hopes for broader recognition.“I get Rs 18,000 a month as a ration allowance. The Army takes care of me whenever I need help. Although 25 years have passed, I still hope the Centre will give me some civilian honour for my contribution to the forces,” he said.Namgyal attended the 25th Kargil Vijay Diwas in Drass with his daughter Tsering Dolkar, a teacher. “My father is a hero for me and the entire country. He made a huge contribution to the victory in the Kargil War. He deserves the country’s civilian honour,” said Dolkar.In May 1999, as soon as he spotted the intruders, Namgyal reported the suspicious movement to local Army unit’s Havildar Balwinder Singh of Punjab Regiment and Havildar Nandu Ram of Military Intelligence. “Nandu Ram reassured me that if my information is correct, ‘you will become India’s hero, and my name will be written in golden letters’. All financial hardships would be over,” recalled the 58-year-old Namgyal, father of four from Aryan Valley in Kargil’s Garkon, which now falls in the Union territory of Ladakh.The ensuing Kargil War raged from May 3 to July 26, 1999. Thanks to Namgyal’s timely alert, Indian troops mobilised swiftly, thwarting the Pakistani military’s covert mission to sever the highway. India’s victory in Kargil was hard-won, and Namgyal emerged as a hero — the good shepherd whose vigilance turned the tide.Namgyal’s story is a reminder of the individual acts of courage that collectively shaped the nation’s victory in the war.

Supreme Court: States can take royalty on minerals & tax mineral land,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-states-can-take-royalty-on-minerals-tax-mineral-land/articleshow/112024240.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a landmark verdict which will spell a double bonanza for mineral-rich states featuring low on the prosperity index, a nine-judge bench of Supreme Court , in a majority 8:1 verdict, ruled on Thursday that states can collect royalty, which is not a tax, on minerals extracted from their territories, and also impose additional tax on mineral-bearing land.Justice B V Nagarathna dissented and said only the Centre had the power to levy tax on minerals.If the judgment becomes operational retrospectively, mineral-rich states like Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka would be richer by thousands of crores. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocates A M Singhvi and Arvind Datar pleaded with the court to make the judgment operate prospectively, but senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, who had argued for mineral-rich states, objected. SC said it would hear the parties on Wednesday on this issue.However, in an important clarification, SC said this ruling would not be applicable to oilfields, mineral oil resources, petroleum and petroleum products as the Union govt contended that these petitions did not question the Centre's exclusive jurisdiction, as defined by Entry 53 of List I of Seventh Schedule, over these assets. Dwivedi and other counsel for states also did not address arguments on the issue.In the eight to one ruling, CJI D Y Chandrachud wrote the main judgment with the consent and agreement of Justices Hrishikesh Roy, A S Oka, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, Satish C Sharma and A G Masih.This judgment settles a 25-year-old question raised by a bunch of petitions, which grew in numbers over the years and sought enforcement of states’ right to collect royalty on extracted minerals as also levy tax on mineral-bearing land. This was opposed by the Union govt, which cited the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act provision to argue that royalty was also a tax which could not be levied by the state on minerals which fall under central jurisdiction.The majority judgment settled the issue by ruling that “royalty is not a tax”. “Royalty is a contractual consideration paid by the mining lessee to the lessor for enjoyment of mineral rights. The liability to pay royalty arises out of the contractual conditions of the mining lease. The payments made to the govt cannot be deemed to be a tax merely because the statute provides for their recovery as arrears,” the CJI said in his 200-page judgment.Accepting Dwivedi’s arguments on behalf of states and after examining the interplay of entries in the Union and State Lists in the Seventh Schedule, SC said, “We hold that both royalty and dead rent do not fulfil the characteristics of tax or impost.”While overruling a large number of past constitution bench judgments of SC, the nine-judge bench gave another significant relief to states to tax mineral-bearing land, which, too, was opposed by the Centre: whether a state has the power to tax mineral-bearing tracts in its jurisdiction. “State legislatures have legislative competence under Article 246 read with Entry 49 of List II to tax lands which comprise of mines and quarries. Mineral-bearing land falls within the description of ‘lands’ under Entry 49 of List II,” the court said.“The yield of mineral-bearing land, in terms of the quantity of mineral produced or the royalty, can be used as a measure to tax the land under Entry 49 of List II (state subject). Entries 49 and 50 of List II deal with distinct subject matters and operate in different fields. Mineral value or mineral produce can be used as a measure to impose a tax on lands under Entry 49 of List II,” it said.SC said though Entry 50 of List II allows Parliament to impose by law any limitation, restriction which can even be prohibition, relating to mineral development, the MMDR Act as it stands has not imposed any limitation as envisaged in Entry 50 of List II.","If the judgment becomes operational retrospectively, mineral-rich states like Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka would be richer by thousands of crores.

He cautioned that loans from institutions like the World Bank would be disbursed in dollars, potentially increasing the debt burden due to fluctuations in the dollar-rupee exchange rate.To mitigate this risk, Sarma advised the state finance department officials to assess the potential increase in debt burden and negotiate with the central finance department officials to determine the appropriate grant and loan components within the Rs. 15000 crore allocation.Furthermore, Sarma pointed out that loans from institutions such as the World Bank are often linked to environmental considerations . He reminded the state government that the World Bank and other institutions had previously prepared a plan based on discussions with the AP government and had also gathered information from displaced persons who had lodged complaints.An inspection team appointed by these institutions had submitted a report, which Sarma believes the state government possesses. He advised CM Naidu to address the issues raised in the report and prepare a new project plan to be sent to the bank, which could facilitate easier permissions.Lastly, Sarma highlighted that the World Bank might question the implementation of the National Green Tribunal 's (NGT) orders issued in November 2017 regarding the Amaravati plan. The NGT had ordered the implementation of certain rules and the appointment of a committee to monitor the issue, with reports to be submitted to the NGT every six months.However, no such committee has been appointed to date, violating the order. Sarma urged CM Naidu to appoint the committee immediately to ensure compliance with the NGT's directives.","EAS Sarma is a former secretary to the central finance department and one of India's Board of Governors at the World Bank.

Pablo Escobar: Naidu compares Jagan Reddy to Pablo Escobar: 9 interesting facts about Colombian drug lord,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/naidu-compares-jagan-reddy-to-pablo-escobar-9-interesting-facts-about-colombian-drug-lord/articleshow/112020195.cms,"Magical realism is defined as what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe. There was a reason magical realism was born in Colombia .

Who was Pablo Escobar?

1) Enormous Wealth:

2) ""Robin Hood"" Image:

3) Innovative Smuggling Techniques:

4) Going to Congress:

Narcos - Main Trailer - Netflix [HD]

5) Extravagant Lifestyle:

6) Escaping Prison:

7) War with the Government:

8) Buying Power:

9) The End:

It’s fitting that the Netflix show Narcos – which focused on the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar – starts by describing a literary phenomenon most commonly associated with Colombia author Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Escobar’s story is certainly littered with its own sprinkling of magic, how a boy who grew up in abject poverty went on to become the most powerful drug lord in the, who continued to cock his snook at the mighty US government and its DEA agents.Strangely, not unlike magic realism, the Medellin Cartel’s boss' name came up in the Andhra assembly when the Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu compared his rival YSR Congress leader Jagan Mohan Reddy to the notorious narco-terrorist and accused him of fostering a drug crisis in the state during his five-year rule. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu declared that the state's situation during Jagan Mohan Reddy's governance was unprecedentedly dire. Naidu remarked in the assembly, ""Only one person can be compared to what happened in Andhra, and that is Pablo Escobar,"" highlighting the severity of the drug menace. He alleged that from 2019 to 2024, the state had become the ""ganja capital"" and pledged to address the issue.Naidu elaborated, ""Pablo Escobar was a Colombian drug lord and narco-terrorist who became a politician and started his drug cartel, amassing $30 billion at that time, now worth $90 billion. He was arrested in 1976 and by 1980 had become the world's richest drug lord. Some people aim to become richer by selling drugs.""Born on December 1, 1949, in Rionegro, Colombia, he rose to become one of the wealthiest and most powerful criminals in history through his extensive cocaine trafficking operations. Escobar's life has inspired numerous books, movies, and television series, highlighting his dramatic ascent and subsequent downfall in the criminal underworld.At the height of his power, Escobar was among the richest men globally, with his net worth estimated to be around $30 billion in the early 1990s. He was reportedly making approximately $420 million weekly from his drug empire.Pablo Escobar used his immense wealth to fund various community projects in Medellín, Colombia, earning a degree of local support. He built housing for the poor, constructed sports fields and facilities, and funded schools and hospitals. Escobar's investments in infrastructure included paving roads and installing streetlights in underdeveloped neighbourhoods. Additionally, he sponsored local soccer teams and provided substantial financial assistance to needy families, enhancing his Robin Hood-like reputation among the local populace.The Medellín Cartel employed numerous innovative methods to smuggle cocaine into the United States, including using submarines, airplanes, and even hollowed-out statues. Escobar owned a fleet of planes and helicopters specifically for this purpose. Escobar collaborated with Amado Carrillo Fuentes, known as ""The Lord of the Skies,"" to smuggle cocaine using a fleet of private jets and commercial aircraft.Pablo Escobar entered politics in Colombia in the early 1980s. In 1982, he was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia. Escobar's political career was short-lived, as his involvement in drug trafficking soon became widely known, leading to his eventual expulsion from Congress.Escobar's immense wealth enabled him to live an extraordinarily lavish lifestyle. He owned multiple properties, including the famous Hacienda Nápoles estate, which featured a zoo with exotic animals, a private airport, and a bullring. Pablo Escobar kept a variety of exotic animals at his Hacienda Nápoles estate, including hippos, elephants, giraffes, rhinoceroses, camels, exotic birds, and antelopes.In a controversial agreement with the Colombian government, Escobar was allowed to build his own luxurious prison, known as La Catedral, in 1991. This facility included amenities such as a nightclub, a jacuzzi, and a waterfall. He continued to manage his drug empire from within until he escaped in 1992 after authorities attempted to move him to a standard prison. It was also the host of many famous footballers including Diego Maradona who claims he had a great time there.Escobar's conflict with the Colombian government and rival cartels resulted in massive violence. He was responsible for numerous assassinations, bombings, and terror acts, leading to the deaths of thousands, including judges, police officers, journalists, and civilians. Escobar masterminded the infamous siege of Colombia’s Supreme Court in 1985. By the end of the operation, 12 Supreme Court Justices, 48 Colombian soldiers, and 35 members of the M-19 guerrilla group, including their leader, had been killed. In total, the conflict resulted in over 100 fatalities.Pablo Escobar used his immense wealth from drug trafficking to buy political influence in Colombia. He strategically bribed politicians, offering them large sums of money in exchange for their cooperation and protection. Among those implicated were President Alfonso López Michelsen, who allegedly received campaign funds from Escobar, and Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, who initially fought against Escobar's operations but was later assassinated by the cartel. Escobar's influence extended deeply into the political sphere, allowing him to evade law enforcement and expand his empire.Escobar was killed by Colombian National Police in a shootout on December 2, 1993, on a rooftop in Medellín. His death marked the end of the Medellín Cartel's dominance. Despite his criminal activities, he remains a controversial figure in Colombia, symbolizing both the extreme violence of the drug trade and the impact of his philanthropic efforts on local communities.","Magical realism is a literary phenomenon most commonly associated with Colombia author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

At the height of his power, Escobar was among the richest men globally, with his net worth estimated to be around $30 billion in the early 1990s.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112020828,imgsize-170224,width-400,resizemode-4/112020828.jpg"
Ukrainian city fears possible arrival of F-16 fighter jets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukrainian-city-fears-possible-arrival-of-f-16-fighter-jets/articleshow/111957061.cms,"'Prime target'

'I'm not moving'

STAROKOSTIANTYNIV: With its castle, medieval tower and river-side beach, the western Ukrainian tourist town of Starokostiantyniv doesn't seem an obvious target for Russian missile and drone strikes.But a major airbase across the Sluch river has put the town firmly in Russia 's sights -- and locals fear the imminent arrival of F-16 fighter jets in Ukraine will only intensify the bombardments .""We're super nervous about the arrival of the F-16s. If they park them here, the number of attacks will only go up,"" said Olena Shpachenko, a guide at the town's history museum, located inside the 17th-century castle.Kyiv says the advanced US-made fighters, some already being transferred to Ukraine, will help it better protect its skies and compete with Russia for air superiority.Russia has intensified its bombing of Ukrainian air bases -- including Starokostiantyniv, home to the seventh tactical aviation bridge -- and pledged to target F-16s.In a show of force earlier this month, Moscow hit three Ukrainian airfields in as many days.""From here we have a good view of the explosions,"" said Shpachenko, gesturing out of the castle window.""We hear them as if we were right there,"" she told AFP.For more than two years, she has watched the enemy's explosive drones and supersonic missiles pepper the sky at night.Pointing to a row of partially damaged ancient religions icons hanging over her desk, she said the air base was ""so close, the missiles can make it all the way over here.""Ukraine and its Western partners have not given any official indication of where the F-16s will be based.A Western defence industry source told AFP the Starokostiantyniv airfield -- equipped with Soviet-era partially underground shelters -- is an ideal candidate.Residents, used to the roar of jets even before the war , say tensions in the city are ratcheting up.""The authorities held a large-scale exercise in the event of a nuclear strike. They believe the base is a prime target for Moscow,"" said Shpachenko.""We pray that the F-16s don't wind up here,"" she added, looking anxiously outside once more.Even if Ukraine's air defences intercept Russian missiles targeting the base, ""debris will rain down on the city,"" she feared.She has forbidden her daughters from playing outside.Despite being hundreds of kilometres from the front lines, the war literally hangs over the town that locals call ""Starkon"".The smell of powder and kerosene punctuate the air and the sky is strewn with black contrails left behind by the jets.Large tanks of jet fuel are hidden in the surrounding woods, where groups of soldiers were playing cards in a moment of respite.The town's lights are turned off at night and the troops scour the sky, ready to shoot down drones with machine guns.Anatoliy, the commander of a mobile anti-aircraft unit, said Russia had stepped up attacks over the past month.""The Russians are now using cluster munitions with the aim of damaging the jets on the ground,"" he said, puffing on a cigarette.The explosives can target areas covering thousands of square metres with a single drop.Asked if he thought the escalation was due to the possible arrival of the F-16s, Anatoliy hesitated, before smiling: ""The Russians, those fools, will never guess where they are.""The war has also taken its toll on the town's previously vibrant tourism industry.""The soldiers, the attacks... it discourages people from coming. We've even had drone debris fall on the beach, Shpachenko said.One family of vacationers ""heard a plane flying close to the ground, dropped their stuff and ran to the castle,"" she said.Many of the Ukrainians who came to Starokostiantyniv after fleeing their homes in the east left as soon as they heard the first roar of a fighter plane.""The desire to survive is stronger than the need for rest,"" said Shpachenko.Despite the danger, some locals were outside, relaxing in the shade of the weeping willows or on the small beach.Valery, in his 70s, has been here so long he knows the engine noises of the different planes by heart.He still goes for a morning swim in the river at the foot of the castle every day.""I'm afraid of the arrival of the F-16s. I don't know what will happen to the city if they end up here,"" he said.""Whatever happens, I'm not moving.""",Ukrainian tourist town of Starokostiantyniv is a prime target for Russian missile and drone strikes.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has ignited a fresh controversy by claiming that he was misled into consenting to puberty blockers for his transgender child. In a recent interview with Jordan Peterson, Musk described the experience as a ""trick"" and blamed the ""woke mind virus"" for his son's transition.Musk's child, Xavier, who now identifies as Vivian Jenna Wilson, underwent a name and gender change in 2022.Musk asserts that he was pressured into approving puberty blockers for Xavier under false pretenses, claiming that he was told the child was at risk of suicide.""I lost my son, essentially. They call it deadnaming for a reason,"" Musk said. ""The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son is dead. My son Xavier is dead, killed by the woke mind virus.""After an extended pause, Musk added, ""I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that.""Musk's comments have sparked intense debate over parental rights, transgender healthcare, and the influence of cultural and political ideologies on personal decisions. Critics argue that Musk's statements are harmful and stigmatizing to transgender individuals, while supporters contend that he is raising legitimate concerns about the medical treatment of minors.The controversy comes amid broader cultural tensions over issues of gender identity and parental rights. Musk's decision to relocateSpaceX headquarters to Texas, citing a new California law limiting parental notification of a child's gender identity change, further underscores these divisions.Musk's pledge to take on the ""woke"" left likely inspired his latest decision to move the California headquarters for SpaceX to Texas, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law that will bar school districts from notifying parents if their child uses different pronouns or identifies as a gender that's different from what’s on school records.""This is the final straw,"" Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, in explaining his decision. ""Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,"" he said.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has ignited a fresh controversy by claiming he was misled into consenting to puberty blockers for his transgender child.

New NPS Budget 2024 Benefits Explained: In the Budget 2024, the government has announced significant changes to the National Pension System (NPS) contributions, allowing for greater tax savings. The contribution limit for employers in the private sector has been raised from 10% to 14% of the employee's basic salary. This new limit applies to both private and public sector employees, exclusively under the new tax regime.Shalini Jain, Tax Partner, People Advisory Services at EY India, emphasises that this increase will enable employees opting for the new tax regime to save more taxes and build a larger pension pool for social security.According to an ET report, the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, highlighted in her Budget 2024 speech that the deduction for employers' contributions towards NPS will be increased from 10% to 14% of the employee’s salary. This deduction applies to employees in the private sector, public sector banks, and undertakings who opt for the new tax regime.The tax benefits on investing in NPS depend on the tax regime chosen by the taxpayer in the relevant financial year.
