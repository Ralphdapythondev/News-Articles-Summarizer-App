BJP lodges complaint against Himachal CM for his remarks on opposition candidate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-lodges-complaint-against-himachal-cm-for-his-remarks-on-opposition-candidate/articleshow/109167674.cms,"SHIMLA: BJP in Himachal Pradesh has lodged a complaint with the Election Commission against the alleged provocative statement given by Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu against Congress rebel Devinder Kumar Bhutto who is now contesting on BJP ticket from Kutlehar assembly seat of Una district. BJP complaint said that Sukhu while addressing a public meeting in Kutlehar had said that “Bhutto ko Kutto” and this statement is highly derogatory and offensive in nature as it not only shows a complete disregard for basic human dignity but also has the potential to create an atmosphere of anarchy and unrest in the state.BJP’s state office secretary Pramod Thakur in his written complaint to the Chief Electoral Officer said that on April 6th, Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu had openly used the phrase 'Bhutto Ko Kuto' while addressing a public gathering.He said that the use of such language by the sitting chief minister vying for a position of power sends a wrong message to the people of Himachal Pradesh. It promotes a culture of hatred, division, and intolerance among the citizens, which is detrimental to the democratic values that our country stands for, he said.“We firmly believe that it is essential for the Election Commission to take immediate and strict action against Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu for his offensive statement. Such behaviour is not only an infringement of the Model Code of Conduct but also undermines the democratic process by inciting violence and animosity among citizens,” he added.BJP through the complaint has requested the Chief Electoral Officer to thoroughly investigate this matter and take appropriate action, ensuring that such incidents are not repeated and necessary steps are taken to prevent any further deterioration of the peaceful atmosphere in the state.Devinder Kumar Bhutto was among the six Congress MLAs who on February 27 had cross voted for BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan in the Rajya Sabha election due to which Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi had lost the election in the draw of lots. Later all these six rebel MLAs of Congress were disqualified by the Assembly Speaker Kuldeep Singh Pathania under the anti-defection law for defying the whip issued by the party during the budget session.After Sukhu made the remarks of “Bhutto ko Kutto”, the leader of opposition Jai Ram Thakur had said that being the chief minister, the kind of words used by Sukhu for the BJP candidate in Kutlehar are extremely unfortunate. He said that for a former MLA and BJP candidate, his words are going to spread anarchy and it is sad to see such a thing being said by the chief minister of Devbhoomi.","SHIMLA: BJP in Himachal Pradesh has lodged a complaint with the Election Commission against the alleged provocative statement given by Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu against Congress rebel Devinder Kumar Bhutto who is now contesting on BJP ticket from Kutlehar assembly seat of Una district.

According to two Indian intelligence officers, the shift to targeting dissidents abroad was influenced by global intelligence practices, drawing parallels with Mossad and the KGB.However, the ministry of external affairs has categorically denied these claims, reinforcing a previous statement by foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, that targeted killings abroad do not align with the government of India's policy, the Guardian report claimed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109153554,imgsize-653741,width-400,resizemode-4/109153554.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday rejected chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's plea against arrest in Delhi excise policy and said the material collected by Enforcement Directorate reveals that he conspired with others and was involved in his personal capacity as well as convenor of Aam Aadmi Party. The court maintained that ED was in possession of enough material which led to arrest of Arvind Kejriwal in money laundering case.The court also rejected Kejriwal's objections to ED using approver's statement against him and said ""granting pardon to approver is not under ED's domain as it is a judicial process. If you cast aspersions on the process of pardon, you're casting aspersions on the judge."" ""Statements of approvers will be judged during trial, Arvind Kejriwal will be free to cross-examine them at that stage, the court said.Kejriwal's contention that he could have been questioned through video conferencing was also rejected by the court. ""It is not for the accused to decide how the investigation is to be done. It cannot be as per the convenience of the accused. This court won't set two sets of laws - One for the commons and the other for the public servants,"" the court said.The court refused to entertain Kejriwal's argument against the timing of his arrest and said it has to examine his arrest and remand as per law irrespective of the timing of the elections. ""Challenge to the timing of arrest before general elections in the absence of any mala fide on the part of ED is not sustainable,"" the court said.Kejriwal was arrested by ED on March 21 after the high court denied him protection from action by Enforcement Directorate. He was initially kept in ED custory and on April 1 he was remanded to judicial custody .The ED has accused Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP ministers of taking bribes to formulate the Delhi excise policy for 2021-22, which was subsequently cancelled.The report from the Delhi chief secretary has unveiled findings regarding arbitrary and unilateral decisions made by Delhi's deputy chief minister and excise minister. These decisions have reportedly resulted in significant financial losses, amounting to over Rs 580 crore.According to allegations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the implementation of the new excise policy was orchestrated as part of a larger conspiracy to secure a 12% profit margin for specific private companies operating in the alcohol industry. It's claimed that a 6% kickback was involved in this scheme, indicating a form of bribery or corrupt payment.Furthermore, the ED contends that the policy was intentionally designed with loopholes to encourage the formation of cartels, ultimately benefiting leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Allegedly preferential treatment, including discounts, extensions in license fees, waiver of penalties, and relief due to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, were granted to alcohol business owners and operators in exchange for kickbacks.These kickbacks are purported to have been utilized to influence Assembly elections in Punjab and Goa in early 2022, raising concerns about the integrity of the electoral process.","Key allegation in Delhi excise policy caseNEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday rejected chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's plea against arrest in Delhi excise policy and said the material collected by Enforcement Directorate reveals that he conspired with others and was involved in his personal capacity as well as convenor of Aam Aadmi Party.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra holds great significance for all political parties due to being the state with the second-highest number of Lok Sabha seats , totaling 48, trailing only behind Uttar Pradesh with 80 seats. Known for its electoral unpredictability, Maharashtra presents a formidable challenge for parties vying for a sweeping victory. With its substantial Lok Sabha representation, the state plays a pivotal role in determining outcomes during critical junctures.While regional parties exert considerable influence, Maharashtra also serves as a stronghold for major national parties such as the BJP , NCP , and Congress .The upcoming general election in Maharashtra is set to unfold across five distinct phases from April 19 to May 20. Following the model code of conduct announcement for the Lok Sabha election 2024, political activities surged in Maharashtra.The rapid calculations of permutations and combinations between parties, along with their efforts to court allies, have left even seasoned observers bewildered. It's becoming increasingly challenging to discern which camp each party belongs to. Whether intentional or not, this chaos has guaranteed that the narratives surrounding the 2024 Lok Sabha election will endure for years to come.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP secured victory in 23 out of the 25 contested seats, while the united Shiv Sena clinched 18 out of 23 seats. The undivided NCP, which was part of the opposition alliance, contested 19 seats and managed to win four.This time, there isn't a clear trend favoring any side. It's a tough fight for every seat. Some people thought Maharashtra's 2024 election would be a simple battle between two groups, but it's not that simple. The 48 contests in Maharashtra are influenced by many different factors like local issues, community ties, family connections, and personal interests.The intense Lok Sabha battle in Maharashtra is evident with prominent figures from various parties contesting this time. The BJP has put forward two highly-discussed Union ministers, Nitin Gadkari from Nagpur, a stronghold of the RSS, and Piyush Goyal from Mumbai North. Meanwhile, Supriya Sule, daughter of former chief minister Sharad Pawar , is poised to uphold the family legacy by running for the Baramati Lok Sabha constituency.","Known for its electoral unpredictability, Maharashtra presents a formidable challenge for parties vying for a sweeping victory.

'Conspired & concealed': What Delhi HC said while dismissing Arvind Kejriwal's arrest plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/conspired-concealed-what-delhi-hc-said-while-dismissing-kejriwals-arrest-plea/articleshow/109162934.cms,"Here's what the court said while dismissing Kejriwal's plea:

On legality of arrest:

On approver's statement

On timing of Kejriwal's arrest

On electoral bonds:

There cannot be 'specific privilege'

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday dismissed chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's plea against the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) arrest and subsequent remand.Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma held ED's arrest of CM Arvind Kejriwal valid and observed that the AAP convenor ""conspired"" and was actively involved in the ""use and concealment of proceeds of crime "".Delhi high court observed that material collected by the ED reveals Arvind Kejriwal conspired and was actively involved in the use and concealment of proceeds of crime. The court said that the central agency case also reveals that Kejriwal was involved in his personal capacity as well as convenor of AAP.The bench observed that Kejriwal involved in the formulation of excise policy and used proceeds of crime. He is also allegedly involved in demanding kickbacks.The court said ED was able to place enough material. The beach noted that it had gone through the statement which completes the chain and shows that money was sent to Goa elections.The court said that in the current case, among several statements, the statements of Raghav Magunta and Sarath Reddy are approver statements which were recorded under PMLA as well as Section 164 CrPC. Therefore, to cast doubt on the manner of the approver's statement would amount to casting aspersions on the Court and judge.The bench observed that the law of approver is over 100 years old and cannot be suggested that it was enacted to implicate Arvind Kejriwal.Justice Sharma observed that ED was in possession of enough material which led to Kejriwla's arrest. Skipping probe by Kejriwal, the delay caused by him also impacted those in judicial custody.On the timing of Kejriwal's arrest, the court observed that Delhi CM was arrested in the money laundering case, and the court had to examine his arrest and remand as per law irrespective of the timing of the elections.Court said Kejriwal's challenge to the timing of arrest before the national polls, in the absence of any mala fide intent on the part of the ED, is not sustainable. The high court said that Kejriwal would have known that Lok Sabha elections would be declared.Kejriwal's lawyer Abhishek Manu Sighnvi had argued that the Delhi CM was arrested by ED to disrupt his political campaign ahead of the polls.On AAP's charges that an approver had donated to the BJP through electoral bonds and another joined the party which happens to be a BJP ally, the bench said it was not the court's concern on who gave a ticket for contesting election and who purchased the electoral bond.The court also said the investigating agency under criminal jurisprudence can't be directed to conduct a probe at the convenience of a person. However, the court said Kejriwal will have the right to cross-examine the witnesses.Justice Sharma observed that political considerations cannot be brought before the court ""as they are not relevant"".She said the present case is not a case between the central government and Kejriwal but between Kejriwal and the ED.On the contention that the Delhi CM could have been questioned through the video conferencing is to be rejected, the court said it is ""not for the accused to decide how the investigation is to be done"".It observed that it cannot be as per the convenience of the accused.""This court won't set two sets of laws- One for the commons and the other for the public servants. There cannot be any specific privilege for anyone including the chief minister"", said Delhi high courtThe court must remain vigilant that it is not influenced by any extraneous factors. We are concerned with constitutional morality, not political morality, she said.Kejriwal was sent to judicial custody in the case on April 1 after he was produced in Delhi's Rouse Avenue court on the expiry of ED's custody. The ED arrested Arvind Kejriwal on March 21 in the alleged money laundering case linked to the now-scrapped Delhi liquor policy.","The court said that the central agency case also reveals that Kejriwal was involved in his personal capacity as well as convenor of AAP.The bench observed that Kejriwal involved in the formulation of excise policy and used proceeds of crime.

These decisions have reportedly resulted in significant financial losses, amounting to over Rs 580 crore.According to allegations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the implementation of the new excise policy was orchestrated as part of a larger conspiracy to secure a 12% profit margin for specific private companies operating in the alcohol industry. It's claimed that a 6% kickback was involved in this scheme, indicating a form of bribery or corrupt payment.Furthermore, the ED contends that the policy was intentionally designed with loopholes to encourage the formation of cartels, ultimately benefiting leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Allegedly preferential treatment, including discounts, extensions in license fees, waiver of penalties, and relief due to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, were granted to alcohol business owners and operators in exchange for kickbacks.These kickbacks are purported to have been utilized to influence Assembly elections in Punjab and Goa in early 2022, raising concerns about the integrity of the electoral process.","Key allegation in Delhi excise policy caseNEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday rejected chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's plea against arrest in Delhi excise policy and said the material collected by Enforcement Directorate reveals that he conspired with others and was involved in his personal capacity as well as convenor of Aam Aadmi Party.

Cement price hikes to pose challenge to affordable housing: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cement-price-hikes-to-pose-challenge-to-affordable-housing-experts/articleshow/109161576.cms,"NEW DELHI: Post the hike in cement prices across India, builders have opined that the trend will weaken the already slow demand for affordable houses as well as impact retail consumers, large-scale construction projects and infrastructure projects .Last week, cement majors in India announced a hike in prices in the range of Rs 10-15 per bag in North India, Rs 30-40 per bag in Central and East India, and Rs 20 per bag in the Western region.The move comes after a prolonged period of decline in cement prices for five consecutive months due to weakened demand. Builders say hike in the prices of cement will further weaken the demand for affordable houses."" Affordable Housing has already seen a downturn. The increase in cement prices may make housing in this area unaffordable. Infrastructure contracts in future will also see a cost escalation,"" says Niranjan Hiranandani, Chairman, National Real Estate Development Council.Several others in the industry feel higher cement prices will impact consumer sentiments and also impact infrastructure projects.""The price hike will affect retail consumers, large-scale construction projects and infrastructure projects. The factors contributing to the recent price hike include the rising costs of raw materials , power, transportation, and the increased demand for cement"" says Jatin Shah, Chief Technical Officer of Project Management and MD, Technical Advisory Services, Colliers India.Shah further said that ""Builders may need to reassess their budgets since every 10 rupee increase in cement price has an impact of 4 to 5 rupees on the construction cost. As such, they need to build in this as a factor into their project estimates or sale price"".India is the second-largest producer of cement in the world and it accounts for more than 8 per cent of the global installed capacity.As per Crisil Ratings, the Indian cement industry has added nearly 80 million tonnes (MT) capacity in FY24, the highest in the last 10 years. Driven by increased spending on housing and infrastructure activities, cement consumption is expected to reach 450.78 million tonnes by the end of FY27.The ramifications of the price increase will be felt throughout the construction sector, impacting retail consumers, large-scale construction projects, and infrastructure initiatives alike.Experts say various factors have contributed to the recent escalation in cement prices. These include the rising costs of raw materials, power, and transportation, coupled with an increased demand for cement in the market.The abrupt price hike in cement, a fundamental component of construction activities, underscores the challenges faced by the industry amidst evolving market dynamics. Builders and stakeholders are now tasked with navigating these price fluctuations while ensuring the continuity and viability of ongoing and future projects.","Builders say hike in the prices of cement will further weaken the demand for affordable houses.""

"Excise policy case: Delhi high court dismisses Arvind Kejriwal's plea, says 'arrest by Enforcement Directorate is valid'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-high-court-dismisses-arvind-kejriwals-plea-says-arrest-by-enforcement-directorate-is-valid/articleshow/109159593.cms,"Key allegation in Delhi excise policy case

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday rejected chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's plea against arrest in Delhi excise policy and said the material collected by Enforcement Directorate reveals that he conspired with others and was involved in his personal capacity as well as convenor of Aam Aadmi Party. The court maintained that ED was in possession of enough material which led to arrest of Arvind Kejriwal in money laundering case.The court also rejected Kejriwal's objections to ED using approver's statement against him and said ""granting pardon to approver is not under ED's domain as it is a judicial process. If you cast aspersions on the process of pardon, you're casting aspersions on the judge."" ""Statements of approvers will be judged during trial, Arvind Kejriwal will be free to cross-examine them at that stage, the court said.Kejriwal's contention that he could have been questioned through video conferencing was also rejected by the court. ""It is not for the accused to decide how the investigation is to be done. It cannot be as per the convenience of the accused. This court won't set two sets of laws - One for the commons and the other for the public servants,"" the court said.The court refused to entertain Kejriwal's argument against the timing of his arrest and said it has to examine his arrest and remand as per law irrespective of the timing of the elections. ""Challenge to the timing of arrest before general elections in the absence of any mala fide on the part of ED is not sustainable,"" the court said.Kejriwal was arrested by ED on March 21 after the high court denied him protection from action by Enforcement Directorate. He was initially kept in ED custory and on April 1 he was remanded to judicial custody .The ED has accused Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP ministers of taking bribes to formulate the Delhi excise policy for 2021-22, which was subsequently cancelled.The report from the Delhi chief secretary has unveiled findings regarding arbitrary and unilateral decisions made by Delhi's deputy chief minister and excise minister. These decisions have reportedly resulted in significant financial losses, amounting to over Rs 580 crore.According to allegations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the implementation of the new excise policy was orchestrated as part of a larger conspiracy to secure a 12% profit margin for specific private companies operating in the alcohol industry. It's claimed that a 6% kickback was involved in this scheme, indicating a form of bribery or corrupt payment.Furthermore, the ED contends that the policy was intentionally designed with loopholes to encourage the formation of cartels, ultimately benefiting leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Allegedly preferential treatment, including discounts, extensions in license fees, waiver of penalties, and relief due to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, were granted to alcohol business owners and operators in exchange for kickbacks.These kickbacks are purported to have been utilized to influence Assembly elections in Punjab and Goa in early 2022, raising concerns about the integrity of the electoral process.","Key allegation in Delhi excise policy caseNEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday rejected chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's plea against arrest in Delhi excise policy and said the material collected by Enforcement Directorate reveals that he conspired with others and was involved in his personal capacity as well as convenor of Aam Aadmi Party.

"Tamil Nadu Lok Sabha polls: In Coimbatore, BJP has high hopes on Annamalai to lead the ‘change’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-lok-sabha-polls-in-coimbatore-bjp-has-high-hopes-on-annamalai-to-lead-the-change/articleshow/109107952.cms,"BJP vs DMK vs AIADMK

All is not well on the business front

NEW DELHI: In what will be a riveting battle for the prized Lok Sabha seat of the 'Manchester of south India’ - Coimbatore, the BJP , led by Prime Minister Modi , has placed all bets on its state president, K Annamalai's popularity and profile to lead the 'change from Coimbatore' in Tamil Nadu In the first media interview to a regional outlet ahead of the polls, the Prime Minister, expecting the 'tables to turn' in Tamil Nadu, argued that the BJP was the preferred party of choice for youngsters like Annamalai, who are not swayed by 'money and corruption.' The Prime Minister, also endorsing the ex-IPS officer’s candidature, took part in the culmination of his 'En Makal En Yatra' at Palladam, not very far from Coimbatore.Modi held the longest roadshow in the constituency with Annamalai and paid obeisance to the victims of the 1998 blast that happened during LK Advani’s visit - after which the constituency has featured importantly in BJP’s electoral thinking in the region.Speaking about the significance of the Prime Minister’s visit and roadshow in Coimbatore ahead of the , a BJP worker recalled that ‘Modi’s first visit after assuming office as Prime Minister in 2014 was to Coimbatore.’BJP’s Tamil Nadu chief Annamalai, who of late has made news more often than not, is pitted against IT wing head, Singai Ramachandran of the AIADMK; former Mayor of Coimbatore, Ganapathy P Raj Kumar, who had joined the DMK after leaving the AIADMK in 2020; and NTK’s Kalamani Jeganathan.Though widely considered an AIADMK stronghold, the BJP is betting that the odds are in its favor this time. BJP’s optimism is buoyed by the fact the constituency is communally sensitive and industrially rich with a fair north Indian workforce. Soon after the blasts during Advani’s visit in 1998, BJP’s C P Radhakrishnan won the seat in 1998 and 1999. In the state elections of 2021, BJP’s Vanathi Srinivasan defeated MNM’s Kamal Hassan in Coimbatore to be among the four lawmakers for the saffron party in the state assembly. The popular actor and politician is now leading a campaign for the DMK across the state after deciding to merge his party with the latter.Anticipating a tough fight, DMK this time around has decided to go against its decade-old seat-sharing agreement with the CPM. DMK’s Ganapathy Raj Kumar will contest in incumbent MP Natrajan’s place. The DMK candidate is also expected to get a high-profile endorsement by Chief minister Stalin and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who will head a INDIA bloc rally in Coimbatore on April 12, a week ahead of the polls.What makes the battle all the more interesting is the profile of the candidates. All three candidates share the distinction of being graduates of the same popular college body in the city. While Annamalai and G. Singai Ramachandran are also alumni of the IIM. The AIADMK candidate’s father was once elected a state legislator from Singanallur in Coimbatore.The business community constitutes an important part of the electorate. Known to be one of the fastest-growing tier-two cities, Coimbatore has around 25,000 micro , small, and medium enterprises (MSME).Recently, the MSMEs have raised concerns with the union govt’s decision to stop the subsidy given to them and have demanded a reduction of GST for the MSMEs. There has been a cry from the spinning mills , textile industries across the district urging the central and state govts to reduce raw material prices and power tariff.On the IT front however, the city looks all set for a boom especially after recent investments announced during the recently concluded Global Investors Meet (GIM).Annamalai addressing a business community accused the state govt of not securing enough investments as much as the state govts of UP and Gujarat could seal for their states.During his campaign, Singai G Ramachandran of the AIADMK promised to make the city a start-up & IT hub , and bring infrastructure development. DMK's Ganapathy P Raj Kumar is campaigning on the plank of expediting the Metro project, providing better connectivity in terms of air and rail. While Annamalai has promised more investment, better law & order, and said there are detailed plans that will come out along with 'separate manifestos’ prepared for each constituency.Meanwhile, the ruling DMK, confident of another landslide victory, has accused PM Modi of being ‘a part-time politician,’ and selectively visiting Tamil Nadu only to suit his electoral pursuits. Chief minister Stalin in a recent interview claimed that the Prime Minister’s visit, if anything, will ‘benefit the DMK.’The electorate on April 19 and ultimately the results on June 4 will tell how much of these claims for and against each other have really made an impact on the minds of the voters.Notwithstanding the chaos, the keenly watched contest promises to be an intense battle with AIADMK vying to defend its bastion, the DMK wanting to undo its 2014 poll nightmare of ending up third, and the BJP looking to embark on its grand mission Tamil Nadu beginning from Coimbatore.","BJP’s optimism is buoyed by the fact the constituency is communally sensitive and industrially rich with a fair north Indian workforce.

This year, the occurrence of a total solar eclipse during the holy month of Ramadan presents a unique convergence of astronomy and spirituality. The eclipse, which is set to take place on April 8, 2024, has prompted discussions and considerations regarding its impact on the observation of Ramadan, particularly in relation to the sighting of the moon, which plays a crucial role in Islamic traditions.Ramadan, occurring in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar , is universally observed by Muslims as a period of fasting, prayer, introspection, and communal bonding..The beginning and end of Ramadan are traditionally determined by the sighting of the crescent moon also known as the Shawwal moon. The sighting of the Shawwal moon is a significant event that marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of Eid al-Fitr . In 2024, the astronomical new moon (conjunction) is on April 8, at 18:21 Universal Time. On this day, the moon will not be visible anywhere in the world. However, on April 9, it is expected to be easily seen in Europe, Africa, and the Americas. By April 10, the moon should be visible worldwideHowever, the total solar eclipse this year coincides with the end of Ramadan, potentially affecting the visibility of the moon and the determination of Eid al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the fasting period.A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, completely blocking the sun’s light. This event is the only time when the new moon, which is typically obscured by the sun’s glare, becomes visible as a silhouette against the sun. The eclipse thus provides a rare opportunity to observe the new moon directly, albeit briefly and only within the path of totality.The timing of the eclipse could influence the traditional moon sighting practices. Since the new moon signifies the end of a lunar month, the eclipse could lead to an earlier confirmation of the new moon’s presence. However, experts suggest that it is unlikely to see the lunar crescent just hours after a new moon, which means that the sighting of the crescent moon necessary to mark the end of Ramadan and the beginning of Eid al-Fitr may not be possible immediately following the eclipse.The solar eclipse’s impact on Ramadan is not just astronomical but also cultural. In regions where the eclipse will be visible, local religious authorities may issue special guidelines for moon sighting. These guidelines will take into account the astronomical data and the traditional methods of moon sighting to determine the most appropriate time for declaring the end of Ramadan.The eclipse occurring on April 8 may affect the visibility of the crescent moon, but with the moon expected to be visible the following day, the impact on Ramadan and the timing of Eid al-Fitr is anticipated to be minimal.The total solar eclipse of 2024 is set to be a significant event for both astronomers and the Muslim community . While it may pose challenges to traditional moon sighting practices, it also offers an opportunity for increased understanding and dialogue between science and spirituality. As the Muslim world prepares for Ramadan this year, the eclipse will undoubtedly be a topic of interest and reflection.The total solar eclipse on April 8 will affect the Shawwal crescent moon's visibility, delaying the sighting until April 9, the 30th day of Ramadan. Initially, Eid al-Fitr was expected to commence on April 9, but the eclipse alters this prediction. As a result, the crescent moon is anticipated to appear after sunset on April 9, making April 10 likely to mark the start of Shawwal and Eid al-Fitr.","This year, the occurrence of a total solar eclipse during the holy month of Ramadan presents a unique convergence of astronomy and spirituality.

Truth behind brain teasers and optical illusions

Difference between optical illusions and brain teasers

Brain teasers can keep you challenged and increase cognitive function one improves good problem-solving skills and also plays brain games which help one to discover and hone these essential skills in life. A brain teaser or a puzzle challenges our brain to further discover new solutions to solving the issues by boosting critical thinking skills.Brain games include teasers, riddles, crossword puzzles, and quizzes at times are marketed as easy and effective ways to help our mind expand and increase our intelligence level, but many of us play these games in the hope that they will indeed sharpen our memory power and improve our brain function.However, beware as not all brain games make us smarter.However, you will enjoy the above brain teaser. In this image, you will be able to see a father working in his garage with his two kids, a son, and a daughter. The kids are joyfully helping their father, whereas their dog is cheerfully playing and wiggling his tail. However, you need to have a hawk eye to locate the hidden three animals in the image. Keep your tippy toes fast as the clock is ticking and you only have 10 seconds in hand.These types of brain teasers increase the happiness and satisfaction quotient of our minds. The moment you complete a challenge, you automatically feel a sense of accomplishment and happiness which boosts or motivates your brain to further go and try more such tasks. This cycle will not only improve your cognitive abilities and focus skills, but it will also improve your overall memory power.Returning to the brain teaser if you have already found the answer then congratulations as you have a high IQ with a hawk eye power. However, for those who have not been able to find the answer, do not be discouraged as we have several such engaging articles for you. Now, taking a moment to reveal the answer, you will be able to locate the three animals, camouflaging with the leaves, and one sitting behind the dog. Run your brains and eyes actively for the next task.The first glance sight is a complex process that mainly involves our eyes to send raw information for our brain to further interpret. This visual system therefore takes several short cuts and makes edits to images which we are not even aware of, and thus at times they fool our brains, but improve our cognitive abilities.Optical illusions tend to make us see something that is not even present there or conceal our minds with some object present in the picture. On the other hand, brain teasers challenge us to solve a particular problem or issue using our reasoning and creative abilities. But both mainly challenges us to think out of the box.","In this image, you will be able to see a father working in his garage with his two kids, a son, and a daughter.

Here's how they may help with losing weight faster, metabolism, appetite control , and blood sugar regulation .Chia seeds are naturally rich in essential nutrients. These tiny seeds are rich in both soluble and insoluble fiber, which helps in better digestion, promotes bowel regularity, helps in colon cleansing and helps regulate blood sugar levels. Chia seeds also contain all nine essential amino acids and are loaded with heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which supportscardiovascular health by reducing inflammation and lowering cholesterol levels.Apart from that, antioxidants such as polyphenols and flavonoids in chia seeds help in combating oxidative stress and inflammation, protecting cells from damage and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Chia seeds are also rich in minerals like calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and manganese, which are essential for bone health, muscle function, and overall well-being. Here are some common reasons to add chia seeds to cinnamon water. Despite being small in size, chia seeds are packed with nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, magnesium, and various vitamins. They can help meet your nutritional needs while keeping your calorie intake in check. Chia seeds are a good source of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, which are essential minerals for bone health. Consuming adequate amounts of these minerals can help maintain strong and healthy bones, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Due to their high fiber and protein content, chia seeds can help promote feelings of fullness and satiety, which may aid in weight management and reducing food cravings.Unlike some other seeds, such as flaxseeds, chia seeds do not need to be ground before consumption to unlock their nutritional benefits. The outer shell of chia seeds is easily digestible.Cinnamon has the ability to regulate blood sugar levels, leading to reduced cravings and appetite. Additionally, it boosts metabolism, aiding in the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Its antioxidant properties may also support overall health and weight management when combined with a balanced diet and exercise. Chia seeds can absorb water and expand in the stomach, creating a feeling of fullness and delaying the emptying of the stomach, which may help control hunger and calorie intake.Chia seeds are rich in soluble fiber, which absorbs water and forms a gel-like substance in the stomach. This can help increase feelings of fullness and reduce appetite, potentially leading to lower calorie intake.The fiber content in chia seeds slows down the digestion process, which can help stabilize blood sugar levels and prevent spikes in insulin. This may reduce cravings and overeating, promoting weight loss.Chia seeds are also a good source of plant-based protein and healthy fats, which can further contribute to satiety and help regulate appetite.Both chia and cinnamon contains compounds that may help boost metabolism and increase the body's ability to burn fat. This can potentially lead to greater calorie expenditure and weight loss.Both chia seeds and cinnamon has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce insulin resistance, which can help regulate blood sugar levels. Stable blood sugar levels may reduce cravings for sugary foods and prevent overeating.Drinking cinnamon water with chia seeds may help control appetite by delaying gastric emptying and promoting feelings of fullness. This can lead to reduced calorie intake and support weight loss efforts.When soaked in water or other liquids, chia seeds form a gel-like substance due to their high soluble fiber content. This gel helps retain moisture and may aid in hydration and electrolyte balance.Chia seeds are often considered beneficial for individuals with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) due to their high fiber content and potential to alleviate digestive issues. The soluble fiber in chia seeds can help regulate bowel movements and reduce symptoms of constipation, which is a common concern for IBS sufferers. In fact, the gel-like consistency formed when chia seeds are mixed with liquids can help soothe the digestive tract and ease discomfort associated with IBS. However, it's essential for individuals with IBS to start with small amounts of chia seeds and gradually increase intake to avoid potential exacerbation of symptoms such as bloating or gas.It's important to consume chia seeds in moderation and consider any potential allergies or sensitivities before incorporating them into your diet. Though it is known to help lower blood sugar levels, cinnamon water should be consumed with caution by individuals taking blood-thinning medications, as it may increase the risk of bleeding. Additionally, those allergic to cinnamon or with liver disease should avoid it. As always, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized advice on weight loss and nutrition.","Why add Chia seeds to soaked cinnamon water?

Hair Mehendi Side Effects: Side effects of using Mehendi on your hair,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/beauty/side-effects-of-using-mehendi-on-your-hair/articleshow/108951650.cms,"'Oo Antava' star Samantha Ruth Prabhu won't be doing item number in Allu Arjun starrer 'Pushpa: The Rule'

Mehendi, commonly known as henna , has been utilized for centuries as a traditional colourant, natural hair dye and conditioner. Its appeal lies in its ability to impart a rich reddish-brown natural hue to the hair while also providing conditioning benefits. However, like any hair treatment, the use of Mehendi can entail potential side effects, especially if not applied correctly or if certain sensitivities are present.It's crucial to comprehend these potential side effects to make informed decisions about incorporating Mehendi into one's hair care regimen.Allergic reactionsA usually prevalent side effect of applying Mehendi to hair is allergic reactions. While generally considered safe for most individuals, some may exhibit an allergic response to the plant dye. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include itching, redness, swelling, or a rash on the scalp or skin. In severe cases, an allergic reaction may result in contact dermatitis, causing discomfort and necessitating medical attention. To mitigate the risk of allergic reactions, it's advisable to conduct a patch test before applying Mehendi to the entire scalp and hair.Dryness and brittlenessMehendi possesses drying properties that can often lead to dryness and brittleness in the hair, particularly if used frequently or left on for an extended duration. The dye molecules in Mehendi adhere to the keratin in the hair shaft, potentially stripping away natural oils and moisture. This can result in hair that feels rough, straw-like, and prone to breakage. To counteract dryness and brittleness, it's essential to follow Mehendi treatments with deep conditioning or oil treatments to restore moisture and nourishment to the hair.Colour variabilityAnother possible side effect of Mehendi application on hair is colour variability. The final colour outcome achieved with Mehendi may vary depending on factors such as the quality of the Mehendi powder, the duration of application, and the natural colour of the hair. While Mehendi typically imparts a reddish-brown tint to the hair, the resulting color may appear differently on various hair types and textures. Additionally, repeated applications of Mehendi over time may lead to a buildup of colour, resulting in a darker shade than intended.Scalp irritationSome individuals may experience scalp irritation or discomfort following Mehendi application. This can manifest as itching, burning, or redness on the scalp, causing inconvenience and distress. Scalp irritation may occur due to an allergic reaction to Mehendi or as a result of leaving the dye on for too long. To minimize scalp irritation, it's crucial to adhere to the manufacturer's instructions, avoid prolonged exposure to Mehendi, and ensure thorough rinsing after application.Hair texture changesUsing Mehendi on hair may also result in changes to the hair's texture over time. While Mehendi is praised for its conditioning properties, some individuals may notice their hair becoming coarser or rougher with regular use. This change in texture may be attributed to Mehendi's drying effect on the hair or the accumulation of dye molecules within the hair shaft. To preserve hair texture, it's essential to balance Mehendi treatments with deep conditioning and moisturizing routines.While Mehendi is a popular natural hair dye and conditioner, it's crucial to be mindful of its potential side effects. Allergic reactions, dryness, brittleness, color variability, scalp irritation, and changes in hair texture are among the possible side effects associated with Mehendi application. By understanding these risks and taking appropriate precautions, individuals can enjoy the benefits of Mehendi while minimizing any potential adverse effects. As with any hair treatment, conducting a patch test and following manufacturer instructions diligently can help ensure a safe and satisfactory experience.","The dye molecules in Mehendi adhere to the keratin in the hair shaft, potentially stripping away natural oils and moisture.

Sukma’s Ram temple reopens 21 yrs after Maoists shut it down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/chhattisgarh-ram-temple-reopens-in-bastar-21-yrs-after-maoist-shut-it/articleshow/109141541.cms,"RAIPUR: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi was talking about the fulfilment of a 500-year-old dream at Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in a Bastar village on Monday, temple bells were ringing 180km away to celebrate the reopening of a Ram temple in one of the worst Maoist-hit areas of Sukma .Security forces have reopened the temple in Kerlapenda village that was shut 21 years ago on Maoist diktat.This off-the-road hamlet is in the middle of a Maoist stronghold — barely 10km from Tadmetla, the site of the massacre of 76 jawans in 2010, and close to Hidma's stronghold of Tekulguda, where 22 jawans were killed in April 2021.The fear of the Maoists was such that once the insurgents ordered villagers not to visit the temple, no one dared go anywhere near it. All but one. A lone villager would quietly light a lamp outside the closed door every day, keeping the glow alive.On Saturday, scores of locals thronged the temple, guarded by heavily armed CRPF and police personnel, as the doors were opened and sunlight streamed in for the first time in 21 years. The temple was cleaned up and the marble idols of Lord Ram, Mata Sita and Laxman were worshipped.Yet again, what has turned the tide here is a CRPF camp set up a few days ago in between Kerlapenda and Lakhapal villages, around 10km apart within a densely forested region.“In 2003, when Maoists were at their most active, they had ordered villagers to shut the temple and warned that no one should open it or visit for worship. The reason was that this region was the core zone of Maoists, where they would camp, hold meetings, and use it as a corridor for movement,” Sukma SP Kiran Chavan told TOI.After the CRPF camp was opened, tribals who otherwise never interacted with outsiders, came in touch with security personnel.Himanshu Pandey, CRPF commandant of 74 Battalion said, “The new camp was opened on March 11, and during area domination, jawans saw this temple. Locals told them that Maoists had tried to damage the temple in 2003 and forced it shut. Once, villagers would hold religious fairs at the temple. On request of tribals, we initiated the reopening of the temple and helped in cleaning it and organizing puja.”CRPF assistant commandant from Lakhapal security camp, Ravi Kumar Meena, said that the request to reopen the temple came during a medical camp organized by the forces. A medical camp was organized in front of the temple on Monday.Kerlapenda is around 90km from Sukma district headquarters, with the last few miles having to be covered on foot.The district administration is now trying to trace the history of the temple. No one knows how old it is but officials believe it could be a couple of centuries old because it is made of stone. The village of 800 now plans a ‘bhandara’ on Ram Navmi.","Locals told them that Maoists had tried to damage the temple in 2003 and forced it shut.

Cracks Down

NCERT Issues Stern Warning

Risks Associated with Fake Textbooks

Ensuring Access to Authentic Learning Materials

NEW DELHI: The National Capital Region (NCR) is currently grappling with a concerning trend as the demand for NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) books far exceeds the available supply. This shortage has led to a surge in the circulation of counterfeit NCERT textbooks across markets in Gurgaon, Faridabad, and Palwal, raising alarm bells among educators and parents alike.With the onset of the new academic session, schools and students in the NCR region have been eagerly awaiting the availability of NCERT textbooks. However, the empaneled publishers authorized by NCERT have struggled to meet the soaring demand, leaving many classrooms devoid of essential learning materials. This scarcity in the supply chain has created an opportunity for unscrupulous entities to exploit the situation by flooding the market with fake NCERT books .The recent crackdown by the CM’s Flying Squad has unearthed a significant haul of illicitly printed NCERT textbooks in various cities across the NCR. In a series of operations, the squad seized thousands of unauthorized copies, with raids conducted in Faridabad, Palwal, and Gurgaon’s bustling Sadar Bazar. The magnitude of the seizures underscores the severity of the issue and highlights the widespread proliferation of counterfeit educational materials.In response to the escalating crisis, NCERT has issued a stern warning to those involved in the production and distribution of pirated textbooks. Emphasizing the gravity of the situation, NCERT officials have cautioned against the dissemination of factually incorrect content present in these unauthorized publications. The proliferation of counterfeit textbooks not only compromises the quality of education but also undermines the foundational principles of the National Curriculum Framework.The influx of counterfeit NCERT books poses multifaceted risks to students and the education ecosystem at large. Beyond the obvious concerns regarding the accuracy and reliability of the content, there are also legal and ethical implications associated with the unauthorized reproduction and sale of copyrighted educational materials. NCERT has underscored the importance of adhering to copyright laws and has urged the public to refrain from engaging with pirated textbooks.Amidst the crackdown on counterfeit textbooks, efforts are underway to ensure that students have access to authentic and reliable learning materials. NCERT has announced plans to expedite the release of pending textbooks for Class 3 and Class 6, aiming to alleviate the strain on students and educators grappling with the shortage of NCERT books. Additionally, measures are being implemented to streamline the distribution process and enhance accessibility to genuine NCERT textbooks across the NCR.","This shortage has led to a surge in the circulation of counterfeit NCERT textbooks across markets in Gurgaon, Faridabad, and Palwal, raising alarm bells among educators and parents alike.With the onset of the new academic session, schools and students in the NCR region have been eagerly awaiting the availability of NCERT textbooks.

Enhanced Knowledge Base:

Google is set to take on Microsoft Microsoft GitHub ’s Copilot. The company today (April 9) introduced Gemini Code Assist at its Cloud Next conference. This enterprise-focused tool leverages AI to provide code completion and assistance to developers. This might sound familiar because Google offered a similar service called Duet AI, which became generally available in late 2023.However, Google hinted at transitioning the service to its Gemini platform. Code Assist builds upon Duet AI and offers significant upgrades.Improved Functionality: Code Assist will be available as plugins for popular editors like VS Code and JetBrains. It directly competes with GitHub's Copilot Enterprise, offering several advantages.Code Assist boasts a massive 1 million-token context window, the largest in the industry. This allows it to analyze a broader codebase, resulting in more accurate suggestions and the ability to modify larger code sections.Similar to GitHub Enterprise, Code Assist can be fine-tuned based on a company's internal codebase. Early results from companies like Turing indicate a significant improvement in code completion and generation quality. (This feature is currently in preview.)Unlike competitors, Code Assist functions with various code repositories, including on-premises solutions, GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket. It can also handle codebases split across different services.Google is partnering with companies like Stack Overflow, Datadog, and others to integrate their knowledge bases into Gemini, providing developers with a richer information pool.Beyond Code AssistIn addition to Code Assist, Google also announced CodeGemma, a new open model within the Gemma family specifically fine-tuned for code generation and assistance. CodeGemma is now available through Vertex AI.","Key Features of Gemini Code AssistUnmatched Context:Customization:Broader Codebase Support:Enhanced Knowledge Base:Google is set to take on Microsoft Microsoft GitHub ’s Copilot.
