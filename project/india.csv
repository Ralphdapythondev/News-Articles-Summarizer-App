If you are poor, you will face injustice: Rahul Gandhi in Agra

BJP releases ambitious manifesto; Cong dubs it an 'apology'

PM Modi ridicules INDIA alliance , says 'leaders fighting within for projection of prime ministerial candidate'

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday taunted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his remarks on eradicating poverty ""with a single stroke,"" calling him a """" (royal magician) for his statement.During a rally in Pipariya town, Madhya Pradesh, PM Modi questioned where this ""royal magician"" had been all these years and reminded the people that Gandhi's grandmother, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi , had given the slogan ""Garibi Hatao"" 50 years ago.He stated that the country does not take Rahul Gandhi seriously and that the Congress's statements have become a laughing stock and a joke on the poor.""The prince of Congress has just announced something that will make you laugh. He announced that he would eliminate poverty from the country in one stroke. After all, where was this royal magician hiding for so many years? It has been 50 years since his grandmother announced to remove poverty from the country,"" PM Modi said while addressing the rally.""Before 2014, they ran the government through remote for 10 years and are saying that they have got 'jhatke vala' mantra, where did they get this 'jhatke vala' mantra from? Tell me, is this not a mockery of the poor?,"" he added.The Prime Minister also criticized the opposition INDIA bloc, pointing out that one of its constituents favors nuclear disarmament, which he believes would leave the country vulnerable. He emphasized the importance of possessing nuclear weapons for India's protection and questioned the ability of a party that cannot strengthen itself to strengthen the nation.""In the manifestoes of INDI alliance partners, a number of dangerous promises were made. One of its partner's manifesto has promised nuclear disarmament of the country,"" he said.""We should have nuclear weapons to protect our country; those saying otherwise can't protect India,"" he said.The Prime Minister further accused the Congress of spreading rumors about the Constitution and democracy being in danger as soon as a poor family's son became Prime Minister.He asserted that he reached his position due to the Constitution written by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, whose birth anniversary was being celebrated on the day of the rally. PM Modi claimed that while the Congress always insulted Dr. Ambedkar, the BJP government has honored him and recognized the contributions of tribal communities.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi taunted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his remarks on eradicating poverty ""with a single stroke"" PM Modi questioned where this ""royal magician"" had been all these years and reminded the people that Gandhi's grandmother, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had given the slogan ""Garibi Hatao"" 50 years ago.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109289317,imgsize-1531564,width-400,resizemode-4/109289317.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Union defence minister and former BJP president Rajnath Singh on Sunday made an indirect reference to former Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav , asking why some people made a show of what they ate at a time when others were observing austerities.Earlier this week, a video of RJD leader Yadav eating fish fry during Navratri sparked controversy, with BJP leaders expressing disapproval.Addressing an election rally in Bihar's Jamui district, Rajnath said without taking Tejashwi's name, ""You may eat fish, a pig or an elephant. But what is the point you are trying to prove by making a show of your act at a time when people are observing austerities.""Yadav had defended himself on X, stating that the video was recorded on April 8, a day before Navratri began. He dismissed the outrage as a distraction tactic and mocked the reaction of BJP supporters and the media, asserting that Sahni's use of the phrase ""mirchi lagegi"" had been proven correct.Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also targetted Rahul Gandhi and Lalu Yadav during an election rally for allegedly consuming mutton during the month ofSawan last year.

Stone hurled at Jagan Mohan Reddy ignites war of words among Andhra Pradesh parties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stone-hurled-at-jagan-mohan-reddy-ignites-war-of-words-among-andhra-pradesh-parties/articleshow/109288484.cms,"AMARAVATI: The YSRCP and the TDP in Andhra Pradesh engaged in a war of words on Sunday after a stone was hurled at ruling party chief and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy when he was canvassing for votes, which left a small injury on his left temple. The chief minister was hit by a stone on the left side of his head in Vijayawada on Saturday night while canvassing.The stone was allegedly hurled by some unknown persons at high speed, leading to a small cut.YSRCP General Secretary S Ramakrishna Reddy claimed that the attack was a pre-meditated cold-blooded attack on the CM. ""Who would have planned such an attempt? It stems from the insecurity that the TDP is experiencing as they are witnessing the response our leader is getting through the poll campaign, through the roadshows and 'siddham sabhas' (meetings),"" he said, addressing a press conference.Ramakrishna Reddy alleged that TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu had recently instigated the crowd in his 'prajagalam' (canvassing) meetings to attack Jagan Reddy, and claimed that Naidu and his party would benefit if the YSRCP chief could not mingle with the masses. ""This leads us to presume that the TDP and their leader (Naidu) are responsible for the attack,"" he said, adding that the injury is a fact and its location sensitive. Further, he claimed that the opposition party is trying to downplay the incident due to the ""fear of exposure"" and also resorting to making inhumane comments.Meanwhile, YSRCP Nellore Lok Sabha candidate V Vijayasai Reddy alleged that Naidu ""never engaged in politics believing in development"". ""It has been proven again that he (Naidu) engages in cowardly politics, believing in violence and conspiracies,"" Vijayasai Reddy in a post on social media platform X.Ruling party leaders, ministers and others castigated Naidu and the TDP, claiming that the opposition party was involved in the attack on the CM. Chandrababu Naidu condemned the attack on Reddy.""I strongly condemn the attack on Jagan. I request the Election Commission of India (ECI) to initiate an impartial and unbiased inquiry into the incident and punish the responsible officials,"" he said in a post on X. However, the TDP alleged that the attack on Jagan Reddy was stage-managed.Backing Naidu's appeal to the Election Commission to undertake an impartial and unbiased probe into the attack, TDP Spokesperson Pattabhiram Kommareddy questioned the timing and circumstances of the attack. ""It only tends to raise a question about the validity of an act like this when it is so coincidental, yet in sync. It wouldn't be the first time that the YSRCP has staged such an act, much like the infamous 'kodi kathi' drama, not only for sympathy but to also create confusion and unrest, right when the elections are around the corner,"" Kommareddy alleged.Condemning the alleged attack on the CM, Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) President Y S Sharmila said she believes it was accidental. However, if it was not so, she said, everybody should condemn it. Sharmila said she is praying to god for the quick recovery of her older brother Jagan Reddy.Ramakrishna Reddy said the ruling party would submit a representation to the EC to expedite the inquiry into the incident and unearth the facts. Jagan Reddy is unperturbed by the attack he said, but he is taking rest today, pausing his 'Memantha Siddham' (We Are All Ready) election canvassing bus tour, to resume on Monday.","YSRCP General Secretary S Ramakrishna Reddy claimed that the attack was a pre- meditated cold-blooded attack on the CM.

Politicians' vocal cords suffer silently as poll campaign picks up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/politicians-vocal-chords-suffer-silently-as-poll-campaign-picks-up/articleshow/109278110.cms,"As we brace for the impending political showdown with candidates giving it their vocal all, spare a thought for the unsung hero — the voice box — that often bears the brunt of their campaign rhetoric. With World Voice Day approaching on April 16 — a day dedicated to spotlighting the role vocal cord health plays in our personal and professional lives — it might be timely to explore how politicians, notorious for pushing their voices to the limit, struggle to keep their pipes in shape.Voice surgeon Dr Nupur Nerurkar says she often encounters politicians with “phonotraumatic lesions” or benign growths on the vocal cords due to overuse or non-stop speeches . “I see politicians all year round. That’s because unfortunately, most seek help only after three to six months of symptoms,” says Nerurkar whose yearly tally sees close to 15 politicians lining up for assistance with raspy, fatigued voices.The vocal folds, Dr Nerurkar explains, is in the shape of a ‘V’ roughly in the middle of the larynx and when one speaks, the folds vibrate 100 times in a second in men and 200 in women.While people whose jobs require them to talk a lot are more prone to voice disorders — think singers, teachers, RJs, actors, builders, housewives, and call centre workers — “What distinguishes politicians is that they not only speak loudly and continuously but their speeches are often emotionally charged. Also, they frequently address small gatherings or party meetings without a microphone, which further increases vocal strain,” says Nerurkar, adding that this relentless strain on the mid membrane of the vocal cord, also called the ‘striking zone’, takes its toll resulting in swollen tissues and the arrival of pesky bumps — nodules, polyps, or cysts.Based on a study that Nerurkar had conducted in 2016, politicians tend to fit into a personality type, with an increased chance of developing these vocal disorders. “We discovered a strong correlation between personality type and vocal health, and that the incidence of vocal abuse and subsequent vocal pathologies are heavily governed by the person’s personality traits,” explained Nerurkar.Researchers examined 100 individuals, half with vocal issues and half with healthy vocal cords, analysing personality traits, speech speed, and volume to identify factors causing polyps, nodules, and cysts. Interestingly, it wasn’t speech speed or volume that mattered most, but personality type. “Type A individuals, known for speaking loudly and quickly, were more prone to vocal problems compared to Type B who spoke more softly and slowly. Politicians typically fall into the Type A,” she said.It’s become a familiar sight over the years for audiologist and speech therapist Dr Piyush Gujarathi, to see politicians flocking to him with voice woes. “When their voice takes a hit, politicians tend to get jittery because speech holds immense importance for them. They feel under confident if they’re unable to project their voice.”However, unlike stage performers who are more cautious and aware of their limits, politicians tend to shrug it off as a sore throat, hoping warm water gargles will do the trick. “And typically end up in the doctor’s chamber at an acute stage when severity has peaked.”According to ENT specialist Dr Milind Navalakhe, the development of vocal lesions among politicians is often a gradual process, when an unyielding hoarse voice or sudden bleeding prompts them to seek medical attention.““I’ve seen politicians with polyps and also cases with subepithelial haemorrhage — the bursting of blood vessels beneath the vocal folds,” says Dr Nerurkar who has performed micro laryngeal surgeries on several of them. “I’ve also had politicians come with spasmodic dysphonia where muscles in the voice box go into spasm while talking. We inject botox into the vocal folds for these patients.”Symptoms of vocal cord edema — hoarseness, pain, change of pitch, inability to speak — had crept up slowly, prompting three politicians — Samajwadi’s Rais Shaikh, Bala Nandgaonkar of MNS and Congress’s Neelam Dolas —to finally seek medical help after a month of enduring the discomfort while campaigning for the 2014 assembly elections. The trio were advised 20-day ‘voice rest’ by doctors after they damaged their vocal cords while giving loud speeches and addressing non-stop public meetings.Former Indian cricketer turned Congress leader Navjot Singh Sindhu had a similar experience during the Lok Sabha election in 2019 when he damaged his vocal cords after speaking at 80 political rallies in 28 days. Instead of opting for a soothing balm coating that would force him into four days of silence, he chose anti-inflammatory injections and steroids.“The issue is that they keep at it without much regard for vocal hygiene — forgetting to slow down, sip water in between speeches and resist the urge to shout into the microphone,” says Navalakhe. “In the initial stages, conservative medical management and speech therapy can resolve the issues. Surgery becomes necessary when nodules fail to respond to therapy,” says Navalakhe, who notes that approximately 10 percent of his patients are politicians, many of whom have undergone surgical procedures under his care.But post-op, is where the real challenge is. Patients require at least seven days of voice rest. “And getting them to follow that up with voice therapy is another uphill battle,” says Dr Nerurkar of breaking ingrained vocal habits with proper volume control, speech speed, microphone usage, and relaxation techniques to prevent nodules from reappearing. “Occasionally, I have to be quite firm with them, it’s like guiding someone through a weight loss journey,” says Dr Gujarathi.“I have to often remind them that healing takes time and commitment. The body doesn’t recognise one’s profession or prominence,” says Dr Nerurkar, recounting a case involving a senior politician who came to her with a voice change, and was ultimately diagnosed with a vocal fold polyp.“After undergoing laser excision surgery, I presented him with a ‘voice rest’ badge — a yellow smiley with a crossed-out mouth — that I give all my patients. He was so good at following instructions that he upgraded to a poster on his desk at Mantralaya and pointed at it every time someone tried to make conversation during his recovery. Since then, he’s done well and referred other politicians to me,” says Nerurkar.Because a clear, strong voice could be worth its weight in votes.",World Voice Day on April 16 is dedicated to spotlighting the role vocal cord health plays in our personal and professional lives. Voice surgeon Dr Nupur Nerurkar says she often encounters politicians with “phonotraumatic lesions” or benign growths on the vocal cords due to overuse.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109278191,imgsize-115522,width-400,resizemode-4/109278191.jpg"

'BJP manifesto is gold standard'

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections starting on April 19, the BJP has unveiled its eagerly anticipated manifesto titled 'Modi Ki Guarantee' Sankalp Patra . The manifesto outlines a vision for achieving 'Viksit Bharat' (developed country status) by 2047, along with commitments to introduce 'one nation, one election' and a unified electoral roll system.The document also includes various initiatives aimed at empowering youth, women, farmers, and the underprivileged.During the manifesto launch event at the BJP headquarters in the capital, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the aspirations of India's 1.4 billion people are his priority. He pledged to kickstart the implementation of the manifesto immediately after the election results are announced on June 4, with a focus on enhancing the social, physical, and digital infrastructure of the nation.“The entire country waits for the BJP’s ‘Sankalp Patra’. There is a big reason behind it as in the last 10 years, the BJP has implemented every point of its manifesto as a guarantee on the ground. This ‘Sankalp Patra’ empowers all the four strong pillars of developed India- Youth, women, poor and farmers”.In terms of healthcare, Modi announced the extension of the Ayushman Bharat scheme to cover transgenders and senior citizens above 70 years. The manifesto also includes initiatives to provide piped gas to every household, construct three crore houses, and eliminate electricity bills. Furthermore, the BJP aims to uplift three crore women to become 'Lakhpati Didis' and enhance the overall quality of life in the country.“Manifesto focuses on quantity of opportunity and also quality of opportunities”, PM Modi said.PM Modi said India will become a global hub for various sectors including green energy, pharma, electronics, automobile, and innovation. The BJP's previous terms in office saw the fulfillment of key promises such as the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.The BJP's manifesto also includes initiatives like the PM Suraj Portal for accessible credit facilities, establishment of an Anusandhan Fund to promote scientific research, and an increase in the Mudra scheme's loan cap. BJP has also promised free ration for the next five years. It will also encourage small traders and MSMEs to adopt ONDC and expand their business using technology.The party received over 1.5 million suggestions for the manifesto, reflecting the diverse inputs from various sources.The BJP manifesto include plans to introduce bullet train projects in different regions of the country, with ongoing projects such as the Mumbai-Ahmedabad route. Additionally, India aims to bid for hosting the Olympics in 2036 and expand the Vande Bharat train network nationwide, offering various models like Vande Bharat Sleeper, Chaircar, and Metro trains.“Today the work of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train is going on in full swing and is almost reaching completion. In the same way, one bullet train will run in North India, one bullet train in South India and one bullet train in Eastern India. Survey work for this will also be started soon,” PM Modi said.The BJP also proposes the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), which would provide a common set of laws governing personal matters for all citizens regardless of religion, gender, or caste. This move would involve repealing existing laws like the Hindu Marriage Act and the Christian Marriage Act to establish a uniform legal framework.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who chaired the Manifesto Committee, highlighted the party's track record of fulfilling past promises and the extensive feedback received from different channels. “I don’t hesitate to say that the BJP manifesto is the gold standard for the political parties in not only India but across the world”, Rajnath Singh said.","The BJP has unveiled its eagerly anticipated manifesto titled 'Modi Ki Guarantee' Sankalp Patra.

""Gadkari is part of the RSS ecosystem and is very close to the organisation. He is widely seen as an alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the BJP. These two aspects make Nagpur a very important seat,"" senior journalist and political analyst Vivek Deshpande told PTI.Gadkari won in 2014 due to the Modi wave and in 2019 for his reputation as a taskmaster who set several infrastructure projects rolling in Nagpur as well as the country, he said. His ability to talk straight has given him a reputation as the only challenger to Modi, Deshpande claimed.""Factors like Pulwama which helped BJP in 2019 are missing. Its induction of allegedly tainted leaders has seen BJP getting attacked with washing machine jibes. The opposition, unlike last time, is united. The reputation of Rahul Gandhi as a serious politician has improved after his Bharat Jodo and Nyay Yatras,"" Deshpande said.Moreover, unemployment and inflation are talking points, he said, adding the deciding factor in Nagpur will be Gadkari's work and his larger-than-life image among voters. Some 12 lakh voters in Nagpur belong to the Dalit, Kunbi, Halba and Muslim communities and these could upset caste equations in Gadkari's pursuit for a third straight win, he claimed. Patole got 4.5 lakh votes in 2019 despite being from outside Nagpur, whereas the Congress' 2024 candidate Vikas Thakre is a local leader, which too will play a role, Deshpande said.Former MP and senior Congress leader Vilas Muttemwar punched holes in the BJP's claims that it had brought about all round development in Nagpur. The BJP's development works are not those that bring relief to people, he said, adding that it had not brought down prices of gas and fuel even when international rates of these items were low. He said Comptroller and Auditor General reports cited cost overruns in Dwarka Expressway project, which is being helmed by Gadkari's ministry of road transport and highways.Muttemwar also said Gadkari's reported statement that he will not come to seek votes but would still win by a margin of over five lakh would also be factors in the Lok Sabha polls in the city. ""Nagpur is a Congress bastion. The Bharatiya Janata Party won in 2014 and 2019 due to false promises and fake allegations against the UPA government under Dr Manmohan Singh. People are fully aware now. The wave is against the BJP as people are distressed,"" he claimed.Vikas Thakre will win against Gadkari by more than one lakh votes, he asserted. He was countered by MLC Pravin Datke, former BJP city chief and cluster in charge of four Lok Sabha seats, who said Gadkari's victory margin would increase.The voting percentage will increase by 5 per cent, Gadkari will get 62-64 per cent of votes polled, up from 59 per cent in 2019, and he will win with a margin of 5 lakh votes, Datke claimed. ""Nagpur is among the most developed cities under the leadership of Gadkari and (Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and local MLA) Devendra Fadnavis.Everyone, irrespective of caste and religion, loves Gadkari. He has made Nagpur famous with his development works,"" Datke said. Moreover, Gadkari has immense ground connect since he meets some 5000 people in his constituency every 15 days, all of which will ensure a handsome victory, he added.Meanwhile, CPI Nagpur district joint secretary Dr Yugal Rayalu said inflation, unemployment and use of probe agencies to attack the opposition, resulting in the arrests of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and former Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren, will harm the BJP. The CPI is supporting Congress' Vikas Thakre, he added.","Gadkari is widely seen as an alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the BJP.

We have ensured that the polling station is located within a two-kilometre radius of every voter.""Also in urban areas, we have undertaken a new initiative of setting up polling stations within gated communities and multi-storeyed housing societies where there has been a low voter turnout in the past,"" Rinwa told PTI.The senior official said 200-plus polling booths have been set up across the state, with Noida taking the lead.""Uttar Pradesh has the maximum number of such polling stations and Noida has taken the lead in this regard. Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Kanpur, Bareilly and even Mathura will have such polling stations,"" Rinwa said.Asked if the polling percentage in Uttar Pradesh will exceed 60 per cent this time, the CEO said, ""I am confident that UP voters will score the first division and pass with flying colours.""Rinwa highlighted that SVEEP (Systematic Voter's Education and Electoral Participation) activities are also ongoing in the state.SVEEP is a flagship programme of the Election Commission for voter education, spreading voter awareness and promoting voter literacy.On the tepid voter turnout in 2019, Rinwa said, ""To find out the reasons, we have taken a bottoms-up approach for each assembly constituency.""We have asked the EROs (electoral registration officers) and DMs (district magistrates) to prepare a Turnout Implementation Plan (TIP) -- an initiative of the ECI -- to identify the reasons for the low turnout in each assembly constituency and polling station. This is happening for the first time in the country,"" Rinwa said.Rinwa said, this time, more than 15.30 crore people across Uttar Pradesh would be exercising their franchise and the voting will be held from 7 am to 6 pm -- except in two assembly constituencies of Sonbhadra district, as it was earlier affected by Left Wing Extremism.Sonbhadra shares its boundaries with Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.""Keeping this in mind, the polling timing of 7 am to 4 pm has been proposed to the ECI. The ECI is yet to approve the timing, as it is done phase-wise,"" he said.Robertsganj (SC) Lok Sabha seat in Sonbhadra will go to polls in the seventh phase on June 1.Asked about the challenges in implementing 'One Nation, One Election' in a state like Uttar Pradesh, Rinwa said, ""There will be no problems if we have the necessary infrastructure, mainly, sufficient number of EVMs.""""We have over 1.62 lakh polling stations... if 'One Nation, One Election' is implemented, a minimum of 3.24 lakh EVMs will be needed, one for LS polls, and one for assembly polls,"" he added.The official further said the weather in April and May will be hot, and it might discourage the voters from coming out.""Keeping this in mind, we have asked our DEOs (district election officers) to ensure clean drinking water at polling stations and shade for the voters standing in queues.""We have also asked for some furniture for senior citizens, pregnant women and physically challenged voters,"" Rinwa said.Rinwa said the people have been advised to use the early morning hours to cast their vote to avoid the afternoon sun.On steps taken by the ECI to ensure that the polling staff also remains physically and medically fit during the election period, the UP CEO said, ""We will provide medical kits to all the polling teams, along with a list of do's and don'ts.""On the challenges faced by the poll body, the official said, ""In UP and Bihar, there are a number of voters in the voters' list, who do not exist. This happens as people do not file Form 7 to get their names deleted.""""In the recent special summary revision, we have taken a number of steps to ensure that our voter list is clean,"" he added.Form 7 has to be filed in case of the death of a voter, shifting to a different constituency, and duplication of a voter's identity among other reasons.

Two tiny polling stations to be set up in Telangana for 10 voters each,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-tiny-polling-stations-to-be-set-up-in-telangana-for-10-voters-each/articleshow/109281449.cms,"HYDERABAD: In a bid to demonstrate the importance given to every single vote and accessibility, the Election Commission is setting up two smallest auxiliary polling stations in Telangana 's remote tribal areas which will likely witness only 10 voters each exercising their franchise in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections . In order to ensure that the voters who earlier were forced to trek rugged terrains close to 20 km to cast their votes are spared of the difficulty, officials said the two polling stations will be set up in as many different Lok Sabha segments in the state.Each station will be manned by six election officials, including a volunteer and security personnel.Under Achampet assembly constituency of Nagarkurnool Parliamentary segment, an auxiliary polling station will be set up in a private building in Mallapur 'penta' for 10 voters, which would help them save a 20-km trek for casting vote.Similarly, another auxiliary polling station will be at an Anganwadi centre in Budidgattu in Devarakonda assembly segment under Nalgonda Parliamentary constituency, which too has 10 voters. They earlier had to travel eight km to vote, EC and district administration officials said.Overall, 10 smallest polling stations will be set up in Telangana under Nagarkurnool, Nalgonda and Mahabubabad Parliamentary segments which have electors numbering between 10 to 26, belonging to STs--Chenchu, Lambadi and Koya tribes, who earlier had to travel a distance ranging from 3 km to 20 km.Seven of the smallest 10 polling stations in the state have been set up in Nagarkurnool District, they said, adding, a polling booth has been created at forest base camp in Sangadigundala for 22 voters, who earlier used to trek 16 km to excercise their franchise. Another polling booth has been set up in a hut in Geesgandi for 23 voters, who earlier travelled 12 km to vote. The voters comprise different families.In Achampet assembly constituency of Nagarkurnool district, there are certain Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) --'Chenchu' families living in deep forest in small groups, Nagarkurnool Collector and District Electoral officer P Udaykumar said.These habitations (penta) consist of anywhere between 2-40 huts far away from mainstream villages and do not have civic amenities like roads.They stay 20-40 km deep inside the forest and due to various limitations earlier, only one polling station used to be established inside the forest for all these habitations forcing them to travel upto 20-30 km for casting vote, he said.""Each habitation is somewhere between 10-15 km away from each other deep inside the forest. At some places the voters had to start in the morning to reach the polling station and after voting in the afternoon they will come back to their own place probably by late evening/night. That was the scenario earlier.""""They had to travel long distances to cast their vote. They had to travel a lot either by walking or if they hired any vehicle like auto-rickshaw it would cost them dearly. We ensured that polling stations are prepared in all the habitats. Now we have established the polling stations within habitation,"" the Collector told PTI.Asked on the arrangements and challenges, the Collector said in few places, the teams carrying poll material have to reach the polling station on foot due to inaccessible locations of the habitations and in some cases, they had to setup polling stations in huts due to lack of permanent structures deep inside the forest, due to forest regulations.On the number of personnel deployed on poll day, officials said each auxiliary polling station has four polling personnel besides police and volunteers.""We have ensured solar power in all the polling stations, drinking water and other facilities. However, it is a challenging thing. In more than 60 per cent of the places there is no communication channels. So we established our own wireless network (VHF radio sets) and we get information about the status of the polling,"" he said.""These auxiliary polling stations are being set up for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group done for the first time. This is an effort for inclusion of marginalised sections--Chenchu groups. These initiatives have been done for enhancing voter turnout also,"" the Collector added.Polling would be held on May 13 for 17 Lok Sabha seats in the state.","The Election Commission is setting up two smallest auxiliary polling stations in Telangana's remote tribal areas.

NEW DELHI: Income Tax officials raided Trinamool Congress general secretary Abhishek Banerjee 's helicopter at Behala Flying Club in Kolkata, the party claimed on Sunday.The TMC alleged that the raid was part of the BJP 's deliberate ploy to harass and intimidate opposition candidates whom it could not defeat politically.The party claimed that I-T officials arrived at Behala Flying Club and extensively searched the chopper, which was undergoing a trial run before Abhishek Banerjee's visit to Haldia in Purba Medinipur.Banerjee said BJP deployed ""minions from I-T"" to raid his copper but did not find anything.""Instead of removing the @NIA_India DG and SP, @ECISVEEP and @BJP4India chose to deploy minions from IT to search and raid my chopper and security personnel today, resulting in no findings,"" Abhishek Banerjee wrote on X.""When the Income Tax officials couldn't find anything, a frustrated team of Mr Modi's men didn't let the chopper fly. When Banerjee's security personnel asked the reason, they (IT officials) engaged in a verbal spat and threatened to detain the chopper illegally. They opened each and every bag, searched every nook and corner of the chopper,"" said the TMC.Abhishek Banerjee lambasted the BJP over the raids, accusing it of attempting to ""wipe out the opposition in a bid to come to power again"".""BJP is trembling when it comes to Bengal... they want to wipe out the opposition in a bid to come to power again. But TMC will take the Bangla-Birodhi BJP head-on and we won't budge an inch because of these intimidating tactics carried out by central agencies on the instructions of their Delhi bosses,"" said the Diamond Harbour MP.The TMC leader claimed that I-T officials forcefully deleted the raid video that his security personnel made.Taking a veiled dig at the BJP, TMC Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien asked, ""Did the desperados find some fruits and fish sandwiches on board?""Reacting to the raid conducted by the I-T officials, West Bengal Leader of the Opposition, Suvendu Adhikari, told reporters that the I-T raid was part of the drive to eliminate black money from election campaigns.Adhikari said the TMC's outcry over the raid indicates that the party's leaders are apprehensive about their ill-gotten wealth.""Instead of creating a fuss over the I-T raid, which was aimed at ensuring a clean poll campaign, Banerjee should have quietly cooperated with the officials. Is he above the law of the country?""

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22.

All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

Interim Budget 2024: National Pension System Update and Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-2024-national-pension-system-update-and-details/articleshow/106926120.cms,"Budget 2024 : The February 1 interim budget is likely to give an update on the National Pension System ( NPS ). The team, led by finance secretary TV Somanathan, reviewing the scheme, is expected to submit its report by the end of this month.According to an ET report, the committee has explored certain adjustments and assurances during its discussions.However, the members are reluctant to increase the financial burden or revert to the old pension scheme , as per the mentioned sources. The government may opt for public consultations before making any decisions.""The fine print is being worked out,"" one of the officials told the financial daily. The report will center on improving the NPS while addressing concerns from some pensioners compared to the old pension scheme (OPS).""The report will not be prescriptive and any changes, if at all required, will be weighed against the fiscal impact and it will be then put for the public consultation,"" the official further added.In April of the previous year, the government established a committee to examine the matter of pensions within the NPS for government employees. The committee's mandate was to propose solutions for enhancing NPS pension benefits while taking fiscal considerations into account.The National Pension System has been applied to all central government employees who joined on or after January 1, 2004, excluding those in the armed forces. As per the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), with the exception of Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, all state governments have notified and implemented the NPS for their employees.The controversy surrounding the NPS intensified last year when states governed by the Congress party, including Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Himachal Pradesh, opted to return to the previous defined benefit system. Under this system, government employees were entitled to receive 50% of their last-drawn salary as a monthly pension. In contrast, the NPS operates as a defined contribution scheme, where employees build a retirement corpus. It is noteworthy that Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have since transitioned to BJP-led governments.The opposition argues that state government employees shouldn't depend on the unpredictable stock market where NPS funds are invested. States that returned to the old pension system also requested a refund of the accumulated NPS corpus, but the government rejected it, stating it's not possible under current laws.The government has said that the old pension scheme is not financially viable because it continually increases the burden on the treasury, which is why it was discontinued.The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) and numerous economists have voiced opposition to reinstating the old pension scheme. They argue that such a decision would disrupt the fiscal equilibrium of the states.Last month, the government informed the Rajya Sabha that there is currently no proposal being considered for the reinstatement of the old pension scheme (OPS) for central government employees.","The February 1 interim budget is likely to give an update on the National Pension System ( NPS) The team, led by finance secretary TV Somanathan, reviewing the scheme is expected to submit its report by the end of this month.
