Congress pins hope on statehood & local connect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-pins-hope-on-statehood-local-connect/articleshow/110189669.cms,"JHANSI : On a sweltering May evening, Congress ’s lone candidate in Bundelkhand , Pradeep Jain Aditya, embarks on a mass contact programme in Jhansi’s crowded Sadar market.Though sweating profusely and visibly tired, Jain, accompanied by the workers of SP and AAP, makes sure that he enters every single shop in the market and interacts with every trader and businessman.Despite a strong pro-Modi sentiment in the constituency, Jain commands respect for the works he has done in the past while serving as an MP.To woo voters, Jain is selling the idea of a separate state of Bundelkhand. “Congress has always believed that smaller states should exist and that is why we passed the proposal in Vidhan Sabha. However, in a federal structure, one cannot force a state govt. BJP has govts in Madhya Pradesh as well as UP but they are no longer talking about this issue which their own veterans like Rajnath Singh and Uma Bharti had flagged off a few years ago. We will try our best to ensure formation of Bundelkhand state if we form govt,” he says.Aditya Bhanu, who runs a shop in Sadar, says: “Jain still commands a lot of respect. Even in this heat, he is making sure that he meets everyone. Some traders were not in their shops when Jain visited. He made sure that he returns to meet them.”Jain’s political career started with student politics, and he went on to become Union minister for rural development in UPA govt. Before entering Lok Sabha, Jain served as MLA from Jhansi Sadar seat on two occasions. Jain’s friends from as far as Chandigarh have joined him in the campaign. For their party office, a marriage hall has been taken on rent where boards and hoardings are being put up. “Jhansi’s people are fighting this election. They want a candidate who would be there for them. I am fortunate that I never had to ask for a ticket. The alliance is working very well here. They are covering areas where I am not able to go personally,” Jain says. “The biggest issue driving the election this time is the Constitution. Ration is not as attractive a scheme as last time because people are worried that if BJP gets 400 seats, they will change the Constitution. People believe that by giving them ration, BJP wants to make them useless. Its candidates have said that the Constitution has shortcomings and that they need a majority to change it,” he claims.“Lack of jobs, for which govt is trying to compensate through schemes like free ration, is evident in cases like police constable recruitment for which 65 lakh candidates, many of them graduates and postgraduates, appeared for 51,000 seats,” Jain remarks. “There is no industry here. Nothing has come up in the recent past. The setting up of BIDA has angered many as people are not getting adequate compensation for land acquisition. BHEL is not getting work. In the coach factory inaugurated by the PM, 1,700 people had to be recruited but only 20 have been appointed,” he claims.","Pradeep Jain Aditya is Congress’s lone candidate in Bundelkhand.

"PM on his side, BJP nominee claims edge in poll",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-on-his-side-bjp-nominee-claims-edge-in-poll/articleshow/110189302.cms,"JHANSI: BJP’s Anurag Sharma , the MP from Jhansi, is facing a challenge from INDIA bloc candidate Pradeep Jain Aditya .With popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his side, and the micromanagement of elections being carried out by the party, Sharma, however, insists he has an edge over his rival.“The INDI alliance is not working in UP. This is because, of the two parties (SP & Congress), one is entirely dependent on getting votes from its very limited constituency which is caste based while the other partner has no feet on the ground.In the 2022 elections, many of their candidates lost deposits. This time just one Gandhi is contesting and he also changed his constituency, which shows that they have no faith in their own work,” said the Baidyanath scion who won the Jhansi-Lalitpur constituency seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. While Sharma has roped in his entire family to campaign, from his wife to his sister and daughters, the well-oiled party machinery is ensuring that every single village in the constituency is covered through music videos, pamphlets and social media outreach.Sharma is also deriving his confidence from the development of Bundelkhand, which he says has happened at breakneck speed under the Narendra Modi government.For the family, each day seems never ending, where often his wife takes over the social responsibilities when Sharma is busy elsewhere.Sharma says that this time, people are much more aware and have observed the development that has taken place. In the past five years, he said, BJP had effectively reached out to the poorest of the poor. The free ration scheme would prove to be a game changer as it had changed the lives of people, giving them more independence to go out and work.“The expectations of people have risen after they have seen things change on ground. There are a lot of aspirations in Bundelkhand which were not economically so good. A project like the Bundelkhand Industrial Development Authority will not just bring industry to the ground but also services. It was launched just 6-8 months back and we are in the process of acquiring 36,000 acres for it,” he said, adding that investors were feeling far safer in UP and many foreign companies were keen to invest here.The Har Ghar Nal scheme, a major project launched in Bundelkhand to provide tap water to every house, is a little behind schedule, says Sharma. The scheme was expected to be a major boost for the BJP govt this election, had people actually started receiving water. However, despite claims of the state govt that Bundelkhand has been covered, Sharma says that only 40% households are getting water while another 30% would start getting water in the next three months. The reason for the delay, he said, were companies going bankrupt, Bundelkhand’s terrain and that two intake wells were located in MP. “Around 90% of the pipes have been laid so we should be able to complete this very soon,” he said.","BJP’s Anurag Sharma is facing a challenge from INDIA bloc candidate Pradeep Jain Aditya.

in Barabanki? What dominates more – caste or

Caste is a dominant factor in Indian elections. What is your formula?

How much leverage are you getting from alliance partner Samajwadi Party compared to the experience in 2017?

Why did you come up with a constituency-centric manifesto in addition to the Nyay Patra?

You are a few kilometers away from Ayodhya. How big a factor is Ram temple in Barabanki?

INDIA bloc candidate from Barabanki Lok Sabha constituency ,, feels that Ram Temple is important for people, but survival comes first. In an interview with, he discussed the problems faced by the people and the poll prospects of INDIA bloc. Excerpts:You have been a chemical engineer and worked in the corporate sector before joining politics.How different are the two worlds? Don’t your friends pull you back?Everything is diametrically opposite. In the corporate sector, when you start working, there is always accountability, and you get paid for what you do. In politics, you might never get paid for your work. The level of accountability lies with everybody and still some people may remain unhappy. My friends keep calling but our chats make me realise that my life is way more happening and socially impactful than many of them.All these elections, I have been able to garner a few thousand votes which shows that there are people who have faith in me. Undeterred by the outcome, they have been with me. I may step back if I have stakes as an individual, but when you are the hope of others, you must keep going. In my constituency, 50,000-odd people have pinned their hopes on me.Issues are dominating this time because people are tired of tall claims and false promises. Youth and farmers are particularly affected. About 85% of the voters in Barabanki are directly affected by inflation in agriculture. Even those in the city are affected in one way or the other. Most farmers are engaged in growing peppermint so its cultivation and processing into oil is not getting support. After the BJP formed govt, the price of peppermint oil has never crossed Rs 1,000. It was about Rs 2,000 under previous govts. Education and employment are other key issues as many people head to Lucknow for it. Paper leaks have also made the life of youths difficult. The issue is resonating among jobseekers, especially SC and OBC candidates, who have smaller land holdings.I did take some time to accept the reality of caste, but the fact is that Congress believes in taking people from all walks of life along. Estimates show that there are 27% SCs and an equal proportion of OBCs. A connection with Dalit sub caste Pasi and OBC offshoot Kurmis is believed to be crucial for candidates here. Muslims also form a good chunk on the seat. We have been able to connect with all groups well due to combined efforts.The alliance is stronger and well taken this time. That’s mainly because we got enough time to make it work. Cooperation has trickled down from the top to the booth level. The other day, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav convened a rally which gave the final push to momentum built by SP leaders in the district, including Arvind Singh Gope and Rakesh Verma.India is extremely diverse, and each constituency has specific needs. As an aspiring public representative, it is important for me to understand the local needs and make promises that affect people’s lives. This seat needs several postgraduate colleges, better rail connectivity, peppermint oil extraction units, and link roads. That is what I have promised.The importance of Ram temple in the life of people here is high, both in social and economic context. However, people here say that ‘Ram’. This shows that survival comes before religion.","Tanuj Punia is a candidate from Barabanki Lok Sabha constituency, Uttar Pradesh.

Added to that are the continuing demand for separate statehood and controversies around the long-pending Ken-Betwa riverlinking project (KBLP).But neither Congress leader Rahul Gandhi nor SP supremo Akhilesh Yadav talked about the statehood demand at their joint rally in Jhansi and Hamirpur on Tuesday.“We’ve been hearing about the river-linking project, but it has not materialised yet. Groundwater level has also fallen over the years, making it difficult for us to even find water to drink,” says Sanjay Vishwakarma of Atrauli village in Mahoba district, 160km from Jhansi.Villagers in Banda, Lalitpur and Jhansi districts share similar woes. Though it got a concrete push during the Modi govt’s first term, its implementation was approved only in 2021. The delay was due to objections raised by environmentalists concerned about the region’s natural ecosystem.The river-linking project will benefit the Bundelkhand region of both MP and UP. Once implemented, the project will provide annual irrigation to 10.6 lakh hectares of land across Chhattarpur, Tikamgarh, Panna, Sagar, Damoh and Datia districts of MP and Banda, Mahoba, Jhansi and Lalitpur districts of UP. “But when will it be completed?

Land acquisition valid only if it passes constitutional test: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/land-acquisition-valid-only-if-it-passes-constitutional-test-sc/articleshow/110187549.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a landmark verdict to protect the interests of landowners against acquisition of their property by govt, Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that all acquisitions would have to pass the test of Article 300A which grants people constitutional right to property and said acquisition can be done only for public purpose, under authority of law and after following a due procedure.Observing that under the current constitutional scheme, the right to property is protected as a constitutional right and has even been interpreted to be a human right, a bench of Justices Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Aravind Kumar propounded seven basic procedural rights of landowners which must be followed and fulfilled for any valid acquisition.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Narasimha said Article 300A confers seven rights to landowners and commensurate duties to state, which are: i) Duty of State to inform the owners that it intends to acquire his property - right to notice; ii) Duty of State to hear objections - right to be heard; iii) Duty of State to inform its decision on acquisition - right to a reasoned decision; iv) Duty of State to demonstrate that acquisition is for public cause - acquisition only for public purpose; v) Duty of State to restitute and rehabilitate - right to fair compensation; vi) Duty of State to conduct the process of acquisition efficiently and within prescribed timelines - right to an efficient conduct; and vii) Final conclusion of the proceedings leading to vesting - the right of conclusion.""In various decisions interpreting Article 300A, this court has also held that a person can be deprived of his right to property only through the procedure established by law. The State must mandatorily comply with the procedure which has been provided under the statute for an acquisition to be valid under Article 300A. Therefore, a valid acquisition of property is premised on the law providing a procedure for such acquisition and the State complying with this statutory procedure. Procedural justice is therefore a significant mandate of Article 300A. The existence of and adherence to procedural safeguards is crucial for the protection of the right to property as they ensure fairness, transparency, natural justice, and non-arbitrary exercise of power in the process of acquisition,"" he said.The court said a reasonable and just procedure enables the person affected by the decision to transcend his personal interest and accept the larger public purpose that the acquisition seeks to subserve. ""The seven steps may be procedures, but they do constitute the real content of the right to property under Article 300A, non-compliance of these procedures will amount to violation of the right. An action of acquiring property without following due procedure would be outside the authority of law,"" the court said.SC quashed the decision of Kolkata Municipal Corporation to acquire private land at Narkeldanga North Road to build a public park. It said the law does not authorise the body to acquire the land and the acquisition was illegal.",Supreme Court rules that all acquisitions would have to pass the test of Article 300A which grants people constitutional right to property.

NEW DELHI: A day after announcing that Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) will extend ""outside support"" to the INDIA alliance to form government at the Centre if it wins the Lok Sabha elections, now Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has taken a U-turn and said she is ""very much part of INDIA alliance "" at the national level.Addressing a rally in Bengal's Tamluk, the TMC chief said, ""At all India level, some people have misunderstood my statement yesterday.I am very much part of the INDIA alliance. The INDIA alliance was my brainchild. We are together at the national level and will continue to be together.""The clarification comes a day after her ""outside support"" remark led to speculations of her exiting the united opposition alliance against the BJP.At the same time, Mamata made it clear that though her party is part of the INDIA bloc at the national level, in West Bengal Trinamool is fighting against the partners CPM and Congress. She also alleged that the two parties have joined hands with BJP in the state. ""Do not count on the CPM and the Congress in Bengal. They are not with us, they are with the BJP here. I am talking about that (INDIA bloc) in Delhi,"" she said.Talking about the statement TMC leader Kunal Ghosh also asserted that the party is still very much part of the INDIA alliance. ""She has clarified herself and there is no misunderstanding at all ... She was there during the formation of the INDIA alliance. She was in INDIA, TMC is in INDIA and will be with the alliance...""Hitting out at Mamata Banerjee for her ""outside support"" remark, Congress's Adhir Ranjan Choudhary earlier on Thursday said he does not trust the TMC chief alleged that she can even go with the BJP. ""I don't trust her (Mamata). She left the alliance and ran away. She can also go towards the BJP if the results are favourable to them ... Everyone saw that she was the one who broke the alliance [in Bengal],"" Congress Bengal chief Chowdhary said.He also claimed that TMC supremo is now endorsing the opposition INDIA bloc recognising its growing momentum and aiming to maintain her relevance in national politics.""... INDIA alliance has been striding ahead and it is on the verge of forming a government, and this is why as an opportunist political leader she thought of extending support in advance so that her support to INDIA bloc will help her in fighting elections in West Bengal. She now understands the crude reality on the ground that voters are gearing toward the INDIA bloc,"" he said.Mamata Banerjee's TMC decided to go solo in Bengal for Lok Sabha elections despite being part of INDIA alliance. The decision was taken after the alliance parties failed to come up with a seat-sharing plan in the state even after rounds of meetings.

We repeatedly told them that this land, neither Pakistan nor China claims it as theirs. If there's any sovereign claimant, it's India. You're occupying, you're building there, but the legal title is mine.""Referring to the 1963 agreement between Pakistan and China, Jaishankar pointed out that Pakistan had transferred a significant portion of the Pakistan-occupied territory to China as a gesture of friendship.However, the agreement stipulates that China will ultimately respect the territorial claims of either Pakistan or India.Jaishankar explained, ""In 1963, Pakistan and China agreed to take their friendship forward, and to keep China close, Pakistan handed over about 5,000km of the Pakistan-occupied territory to China. It's written in that agreement that eventually, China will respect whether this territory belongs to Pakistan or India. Sometimes people just grab territory, and then it's about how to resolve it.""Jaishankar stressed the importance of India maintaining a strong position regarding PoJK, given the changing dynamics in the region. He said, ""I think we need to keep our position very strong, we need to have confidence in ourselves. Ten years ago, none of you would talk like this, it's a change... even the Indian public has confidence in this.""BJP leaders have been consistently criticizing previous Congress governments under Pandit Nehru and Indira Gandhi for ceding the island of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka and for the situation in PoJK.","S Jaishankar took a veiled jibe at former prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress party.

I always stand with women - irrespective of which party they belong to.Secondly, AAP will discuss amid themselves and make a decision. It is up to them,"" Priyanka said when asked about the alleged assault which has put not just the AAP but also other parties of opposition's INDIA bloc on the backfoot.The opposition leaders have avoided a direct remark on the alleged assault case even as the BJP has stepped up the ante demanding action against Bibhav Kumar, who was PA to Arvind Kejriwal . Swati Maliwal, who has fought against injustice and violence against women for years, has chosen to remain silent on the issue, adding to the intrigue.The AAP has accepted that Bibhav misbehaved with Maliwal at Kejriwal's residence and has maintained that action will be taken against the former PA.Earlier today, Kejriwal did not respond to queries on the case during his joint press conference with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow. When asked a pointed question during the press conference, Kejriwal was shielded by Akhilesh who said ""there are other issues that are more important than this.""The BJP has slammed Kejriwal for his silence on the issue and sought his resignation.""She is certainly the leader of the opposition party but BJP is fighting to ensure that she gets justice.

It's not important which party she belongs but she should get justice,"" said BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia.""Arvind Kejriwal should answer and if you are a coward CM and cannot speak even a single word then you should resign because the women of the country are angry and feeling insulted and only Arvind Kejriwal is responsible for this,"" he added.AAP on its part has accused the BJP of playing politics over the issue. AAP leader Sanjay Singh reminded the BJP of its actions against Maliwal when she was protesting in support of the women wrestlers in Brij Bhushan sexual harassment case.""The BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi should answer for atrocities against women during the party rule.

I am investing everything, I am taking all the risk but Centre is taking away entire profit of mine.

NEW DELHI: In a timely rescue operation , Anant Ambani ’s Vantara mobilised from Gujarat a large convoy of vehicles, including ambulances, feed vehicles, and a team of personnel, to rehabilitate an ailing elephant and her calf in Tripura 's Unakoti district.An online video showing the rescue and rehabilitation effort has gone viral.In the video, a woman -- later identified as 'Go Green and Help Stray Animals' organisation general secretary Kuntala Sinha -- can be heard thanking Anant Ambani and Vantara's team of doctors for their prompt action and saving the elephants.She said the Vantara team reached Unakoti within a day of her approaching them for help in treating the elephant.The convoy made the remarkable 3,500-km journey from Jamnagar to Tripura in a mere 24 hours to provide essential care for Pratima and her calf Maniklal.After the initial treatment, the elephants were kept in Tripura's Kailashahar for several weeks before being transported to Vantara in Gujarat for further care.A veterinary surgeon from Vantara found several wounds and lacerations on Pratima, as well as severe stiffness in the limbs, and blindness in one eye. Pratima was emaciated while her calf was also suffering from lack of nutrition.According to a release by PETA, Pratima and her calf were being unlawfully held without an ownership certificate, violating wildlife protection laws.Meaning 'Star of The Forest', Vantara is a wildlife preservation initiative founded by Anant Ambani and backed by Reliance Industries and Reliance Foundation.Situated within the expansive Jamnagar Refinery Complex, spanning a vast 3,000 acres, Vantara serves as a sanctuary for animals enduring abuse, injury, or facing extinction.Vantara was started with a mission to extend compassionate care and cutting-edge medical support to animals in distress. With a holistic approach to rehabilitation, it provides a natural and nurturing environment for its residents, fostering their physical and emotional well-being. Vantara is poised to spearhead global efforts in wildlife rehabilitation.","Anant Ambani's Vantara mobilised from Gujarat a large convoy of vehicles, including ambulances, feed vehicles, and a team of personnel.

"No exception made for CM Arvind Kejriwal: SC on interim bail, arrest plea",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-exception-made-for-cm-arvind-kejriwal-sc-on-interim-bail-arrest-plea/articleshow/110187484.cms,"NEW DELHI: As Enforcement Directorate contended that Arvind Kejriwal should not be given special treatment by entertaining his plea challenging his arrest, Supreme Court on Thursday said no exception was made for the Delhi chief minister in hearing his petition and granting him interim bail and added that it had refused to hear him when he first approached immediately after his arrest.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta said the court normally maintains judicial restraint until the case is very grave and there have been cases when the top court entertained pleas under Article 32. ""He filed the case here but we did not open the gate. We refused to entertain his plea,"" the bench said after solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that allowing accused to challenge their arrest directly in high courts and the SC would be ""disastrous"" as everyone would rush to higher courts.Coming a day after home minister Amit Shah's statement that many people believed the bench of Justices Khanna and Datta favoured Kejriwal by giving him interim bail, the hearing saw interesting exchanges between Mehta and Kejriwal's counsel, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.Alleging that the Delhi CM was misusing the liberty granted by the court, Mehta said Kejriwal's campaign pitch was that he would not have to go back to jail on June 2 if people voted for AAP. The SG said his statement was ""a slap on the face of the system"", leading the bench to say that it was his (Kejriwal's) ""mere presumption"" and he had to surrender on the date fixed by the court.Singhvi took exception to Mehta's contention and told the court that he would file an affidavit regarding a statement made by ""a highest minister of the country"" about the SC's order granting interim bail, a not-so-subtle reference to Shah's comment.Asking the lawyers to focus on legal issues, the bench said, ""As far as critical analysis or even criticism of the judgment is concerned, it is welcome. There is no difficulty.

"Don't do pressers as media not neutral, says PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-do-pressers-as-media-not-neutral-says-pm-modi/articleshow/110187422.cms,"Brought new work culture, media’s call to endorse it or not: PM Modi

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Thursday justified his decision not to hold press conferences by saying that the nature of media had changed and it was not the neutral entity that it used to be, with journalists promoting their views and ideologies.""I am answerable to Parliament.Today, journalists are identified with their own preferences. Media is no longer a non-partisan entity.People are now aware of your beliefs as well. Earlier, media used to be faceless... who is writing in the media, what is its ideology... nobody was bothered about it earlier. However, the situation is not the same any more,"" Modi said in an interview to Aaj Tak Hindi.The PM said a new culture had developed in politics which was centered on managing the media and not being concerned about performance. “However, I don’t believe in treading that path. I have to work hard and reach out to each household of the poor. I can also get clicked cutting ribbons in Vigyan Bhavan. However, I go to a small district in Jharkhand for a minor project. I have brought a new work culture and it is for the media to take a call whether they endorse it or not,” he said.Asked about allegations that Election Commission ’s independence had been compromised on his watch, Modi shot back by recalling instances of CECs taking to politics and holding ministerial positions after their retirement under Congress regimes and by pointing out that EC was a single-member entity for 56 years.“The funny thing is that people who came out of Election Commission sometimes became governors. Sometimes they became MPs. Sometimes they went to contest parliamentary elections against Advani ji, they are examples of people who served as chief election commissioner under previous govts. Election commissioners from that era, now retired, still tweet promoting the same political philosophy. They give their opinion and write articles. This only shows that it is only now that EC has become completely independent,” the PM said, a reference to former CEC T N Seshan contesting polls against L K Advani and M S Gill being nominated to Rajya Sabha and later becoming a Union minister under UPA regimes.In response to the opposition’s allegations that 400+ seats were meant to change the Constitution, Modi said, “Who was the first person to tamper with the Constitution in this country? It was Pandit Nehru. The amendments he brought were meant to restrict freedom of speech, which was against democracy and against the Constitution.”“After that, his daughter (Indira Gandhi) overturned a court judgment and imposed an Emergency. Rajiv Gandhi overturned Supreme Court judgment in the Shah Bano case and imposed restrictions on the media. The crown prince of Congress (Rahul Gandhi) once tore down the decision of the Union cabinet,” he said.The PM further said four different members of the same family have insulted the Constitution at different times.","PM Modi: Media is no longer a non-partisan entity.

PATNA: Home minister Amit Shah promised at a rally in Bihar Thursday that if voted to a third consecutive term in office, NDA would ban cow slaughter and ""straighten"" offenders, including those involved in cow smuggling, ""by hanging them upside down"".""Na gai ki taskari hone denge, na hatya (Won't allow smuggling of cows, nor slaughter),"" Shah declared at rallies in Madhubani and Sitamarhi.Accusing Congress and RJD chief Lalu Prasad of not doing anything for Sitamarhi's Punaura Dham, revered as birthplace of Sita, he said BJP would build a grand temple there. He said Congress and RJD were too busy protecting banned outfits like PFI, which ""wanted to make Bharat an Islamic state"", to be bothered about what the state wants.Amit Shah said Congress and Lalu’s party were too busy protecting banned organisations like PFI for them to be bothered about what the country and the state want.He asked the gathering at both rallies whether they wanted ‘viksit raj’ or ‘jungle raj’. Shah said safeguarding India-Nepal border would be among priorities of NDA govt in its third term.Echoing Modi’s remarks at a rally this week, Shah said INDIA bloc functionaries such as Farooq Abdullah of N C and Mani Shankar Aiyar of Congress reflected “meekness” of the alliance when they expressed fears about Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities if India tried to take back POK. “POK was and is ours, and we will take it back,” Shah said, adding that the country was strong enough to handle any challenge under Modi’s governance.He likened the current election to the battle of Mahabharata between Pandavas and Kauravas. He alleged that Congress-led UPA was guilty of corruption amounting to Rs 12 lakh crore, contrasting it with Modi’s stint. “Nobody can allege misappropriation of even 25 paise by Narendra Modi as both PM and previously CM of Gujarat, which is a combined period of 23 years.” He proceeded to question how Lalu and his family lived in “palatial bungalows”.“Lalu is chanting ED, ED, but Rs 350 crore in cash was seized from a Congress functionary and Rs 51 crore from a TMC minister. Cash totalling Rs 31 crore was confiscated from the residence of a Jharkhand minister. Modi govt will work to send all the corrupt behind bars and ensure that the money is returned to the poor people of the country,” he said.Highlighting BJP’s role in development of Bihar in general and Mithilanchal in particular, Shah said it was Atal Bihar Vajpayee’s govt that included Maithili in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution. “Modi govt introduced Maithili in UPSC exam (as an optional subject),” he said. “Kya Italy wale (alluding to Sonia and Rahul Gandhi) Maithili ka samman kar sakte hain (Can those from Italy give respect to Maithili)?” he said.(With inputs from CS Jha ‘Azad’ in Madhubani)","Home minister Amit Shah promised at a rally in Bihar that if voted to a third consecutive term in office, NDA would ban cow slaughter and ""straighten"" offenders.

Accepting arguments of senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, who appeared for accused persons not arrested by ED in a PMLA case and whose anticipatory bail pleas were rejected by high court, the bench said if an accused was not arrested till the filing of the complaint by ED, then the special court would only issue summons to him and not an arrest warrant at the first instance.If ED wants custody of the accused who appears following summons, the agency will have to apply to the special court, which would pass appropriate orders with reasons after hearing the accused, SC said.Luthra pointed out that certain special courts took the accused into custody after they appeared pursuant to summons issued, forcing them to apply for anticipatory bail.The bench said, ""Such a practice, if followed by some special courts, is completely illegal as it may offend the right to liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.""Significantly, SC said, ""If the accused appears before the special court pursuant to summons, he shall not be treated as if he is in custody.

In spite of the surge, unavailability of visa interview slots tripped many Indians' travel plans.Russia and China have had a story of fluctuating fortunes. While China, which started opening its borders for international travel only last year and had huge pent-up demand, leapt to the top of table from rank 22 in 2022. It saw the highest increase at 1,104% - over 10 times - in 2023 over the 2022 application numbers.

Russians' Schengen visa applications fell 25% in this two-year span.For India, travel veterans believe the actual demand is even higher than official figures.

""Appointments are simply not available with a majority of Schengen countries. If you want to travel to Europe this summer, the earliest appointment date for Germany and Italy is in July.

For seven decades, Congress kept playing the Hindu-Muslim card for tushtikaran and kept Dalits and OBCs in kutcha houses without LPG, power, and tap water, and defecate in the open apart from making them struggle to get health facilities,"" Modi said.Criticising INDIA bloc's anti-CAA stand, Modi said: ""Most refugees, who became compelled to leave their homes to save their daughters and religion by reaching India to seek shelter, are Dalits and OBCs. Congress harassed them by compelling them to live like orphans. Congress kept enjoying power by exploiting Mahatma Gandhi's name, but it never fulfilled his promise to welcome minorities seeking refuge in India.""""But it is the guarantee of Modi that you can't end CAA,"" he said, emphasising that ""SP and Congress both spread lies about CAA and tried to push the country towards riots but it's Modi who unmasked them. Desh-videsh kahin se bhi, jo bhi taakat ikatthi karni hai kar lo (gather all strength and your well-wishers from the country and abroad) but keep it in mind that you can't end CAA. First set of citizenship to 14 people had already been given under CAA yesterday.""PM Modi also dismissed any claims about restoring Article 370, saying today J&K celebrates the festival of democracy.He accused SP-Congress alliance of planning to replicate Mamata Banerjee’s TMC-style politics in UP, calling it a “zehrila teer” (poisonous arrow) of tushtikaran.","PM Narendra Modi accused Congress of using secularism as a smokescreen to practice communal politics until he exposed the party's divisive agenda.

"Kid in hospital for finger surgery, operated on tongue instead",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kid-in-hospital-for-finger-surgery-operated-on-tongue-instead/articleshow/110186723.cms,"KOZHIKODE: In yet another case of shocking medical negligence at govt medical college in Kerala 's Kozhikode, a four-year-old girl scheduled to undergo surgery for removal of an additional finger in her hand ( polydactyly ) was instead operated on her tongue without her parents' consent on Thursday.Associate professor Dr Bejohn Johnson, who performed the botched surgery , has been suspended on the basis of a preliminary report submitted by the director of medical education (DME) to health minister Veena George.She has asked DME to conduct a detailed probe. Police have also registered a case on the parents' complaint under IPC sections 336 and 337, pertaining to endangering human life or personal safety of others by a rash and negligent act.The negligence happened at Institute of Maternal and Child Health (IMCH), attached to the medical college. The girl, hailing from Cheruvannur near Kozhikode, was brought outside the operation theatre with cotton rolls placed in her mouth, when relatives noticed that the additional finger was still intact. After this was pointed out, she was again taken to the OT and the extra finger removed.The surgeon, however, came up with a strange explanation that the child had a minor tongue tie (a condition of a tight band of tissue connecting the underside of tongue to floor of the mouth hampering its free movement) and the surgery was done to correct that - without the parents' consent.""There won't be any complications. The child had a minor tongue tie, which was corrected without your consent,"" Johnson gave in writing to parents after they lodged a complaint with IMCH superintendent.The girl's father pointed out that did not have any problem with her tongue and they had not raised the issue with the doctor.According to the girl's uncle, some hospital staff claimed it was a case of mistaken identity as there was another girl whose surgery was scheduled. The hospital authorities, however, said the surgeon informed them about the girl's tongue and it was not an instance of mistaken identity. IMCH superintendent Dr Arun Preeth said in his preliminary report there was a lapse on the part of the surgeon in not taking consent.","A four-year-old girl scheduled to undergo surgery for removal of an additional finger in her hand was instead operated on her tongue without her parents' consent.

He also had relationships with other women, and there was a marital issue between Arun and Aastha over a particular person whom he wanted to marry.""

The court also imposed a Rs 1 lakh fine on each of the convicts.
