Victims were being recruited, transported and transferred from India to Golden Triangle SEZ in Lao PDR via Thailand. Upon arrival, they were trained in use of Facebook, Telegram, basics of cryptocurrency, and handling of apps created by the scam company.The powerful syndicates also used victim control tactics in case any of the trafficked youth refused to continue with the online fraud work. These tactics included isolation and restriction of movement, confiscation of personal travel documents and physical abuse, arbitrary fines, threat to kill, threat to rape in case of women and threat to arraign in false case of drugs in local police station, etc.The human trafficking and cyber fraud racket, an NIA spokesperson said, was being operated with audacity, with the accused even deleting data of victims' mobile phones to destroy evidence. Victims faced threats if they approached the embassy concerned or any local authority. In some cases, victims were held in scam compounds, confined without food for three to seven days, and tortured if they refused to work.

NEW DELHI: Cracking the whip on latecomers , the Centre's department of personnel and training (DoPT) has decided to condone a maximum delay of 15 minutes, and instructed employees across the country to be in office latest by 9.15am and mark their attendance. All employees, including senior officers, have been told to use the biometric attendance system, something several of them have not been using ever since the Covid outbreak four years ago.Staff members have been cautioned that half-day casual leave will be deducted in case they do not turn up by 9.15 in the morning. ""For any reason, if the employee is not able to attend office on a particular day, it should be informed in advance and casual leave should be applied for,"" the circular said, adding that officers will monitor the attendance and punctuality of employees in their sections.Central govt offices are open from 9am to 5.30pm but it is normal for junior-level employees to turn up late and leave early, including those in public-facing jobs, inconveniencing people.Senior officers complain that they do not have any fixed office hours as they usually leave after 7pm. Besides, they argue that post-Covid, with access to electronic files, they often end up working from home, including on holidays or over the weekend. Soon after coming to office in 2014, Modi govt had sought to enforce office timings , which was resisted by employees, many of whom argued that they travel long distances.Aadhaar-enabled biometric attendance system was monitored to ensure that people were on time, until Covid led to suspension of the mechanism. Several senior officers had installed biometric devices on their table to avoid standing in queues to mark their attendance.The latest directive refers to instructions issued last year which had asked central govt employees to revert to biometric attendance, which was resumed in Feb 2022. ""Habitual late coming and early leaving of office should be viewed seriously and discouraged. Action against the same may be initiated,"" it had said.In departments, where IT-enabled faceless mechanism of dealing with public has been put in place, several employees routinely skip office or come in for a short while. The move is expected to enforce greater discipline but will also annoy employees who routinely walk in at 10am or even after that.","Central govt offices are open from 9am to 5.30pm but it is normal for junior- level employees to turn up late and leave early, including those in public- facing jobs.

Delhi HC blocks Kejriwal's release on ED plea against bail order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hc-blocks-kejriwals-release-on-ed-plea-against-bail-order/articleshow/111176602.cms,"Bail order perverse, didn't get time to plead case: ED

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday granted interim stay on a trial court order giving bail to CM Arvind Kejriwal in an alleged scam in the now-scrapped Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22. ED had filed an appeal on Friday morning, calling the trial court order ""perverse"" and claiming that it did not get a fair hearing.The court also issued notice to Kejriwal on ED's petition challenging the trial court's order and listed the matter for July 10.A vacation bench of Justice Sudhir Kumar Jain reserved its order, saying the bail order would remain stayed till the bench pronounced its verdict. Meanwhile, counsel from both sides can file written submissions by June 24.Additional solicitor general (ASG) S V Raju appeared for ED while Kejriwal was represented by senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Vikram Chaudhri.The ASG told the bench that he was not given adequate opportunity by the trial court to oppose the bail plea. ""The court does not hear us, does not look at the documents given by us, saying it's voluminous. The court says bulky documents have been filed. There can't be any more perverse order than this... Without going through documents filed by both sides, without giving us an opportunity, the matter is decided. It is the duty of a court to pass order in accordance with law. Without going through documents, how can you say it's relevant or not relevant?"" said the ASG.In its petition, ED said the trial court judge did not grant ""full and complete opportunity"" to the agency to muster up all its arguments and told the ASG to cut short his arguments and only indicate the page numbers that ED wished to rely upon. The judge also asked the ASG to restrict his arguments to the points argued by the bail applicant, ED claimed. ""The learned ASG on more than one occasion submitted that the bail applicant's counsel has not argued the case on merits and, therefore, it was incumbent on ED to demonstrate the prosecution case,"" said ED's petition, but the court stuck to its stance that the arguments should be cut short.The petition claimed that ED's request for submitting a detailed note within the next 2-3 days was also turned down by the trial court with a direction to file any such note the same day or next day.The judge insisted that she was hearing a ""high-profile case"" and, therefore, ""did not want to reserve the order,"" the petition said.The petition said ED was being deprived of an opportunity to seek an effective legal remedy by filing an appropriate petition before HC since the order granting bail had not been made available till the time of filing the appeal. ""Rather when the counsel for ED tried to enquire from the court after pronouncement of the order, the court staff was unavailable and the courtroom was empty with the lights switched off,"" said the petition.It claimed that the court staff had told ED's counsels that the judge had given instructions not to email or upload the order granting bail, saying it would be available at 10am on Friday ""effectively depriving ED of any opportunity of challenging the order prior to release of the bail applicant/accused"".The ASG claimed before the court that the trial court judge had admitted that she did not examine the documents. He said he had not come across a judge who admits not to have read the papers and granted bail. ""There can't be a more perverse order than this. On this ground alone, the order needs to go,"" he said.Questioning the trial court's findings, the ASG claimed ED has shown evidence for use of proceeds of crime by AAP in the Goa assembly elections and has traced an amount of Rs 45 crore.The ED also submitted that the high court had earlier taken into account statements made by approvers while rejecting a plea filed by Kejriwal challenging his arrest.The agency also pointed out that as per Section 45 of PMLA, a trial court while considering bail in money laundering cases has to give a prima facie finding that the concerned accused is not guilty. ""It has no discretion in this case where Section 45 of PMLA is involved. The court has to give a prima facie finding that he is not guilty of the offence,"" the ASG submitted.On the trial court's observation that ED had not provided direct evidence, the ASG pointed out that Magunta Reddy had met Kejriwal and the latter demanded Rs 100 crore as bribe. ""We have shown all this to prove that he had a role in the demand of Rs 100 crore. Yet the judge says no direct evidence. Direct evidence is in the form of a statement. There is corroboration also,"" said the ASG.Arguing for Kejriwal, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi told the court that the hearing in the trial court lasted for five hours out of which ED took 3.45 hours. Therefore, there is no question of ED being denied an opportunity to present its case, he said.""Just because there is political antagonism and if all the commas etc are not dealt with by the judge, it gives Mr Raju the right to malign the judge. This is deplorable and sad. It should never have come from a govt authority,"" said Singhvi.Opposing ED's submission that the trial court order granting bail to Kejriwal was perverse, the senior advocate said, ""Like Alice in Wonderland, ED has its own meaning of perversity... unless every argument of ED is repeated verbatim, it is perversity.""Singhvi pointed out that statements given in 2022 by four witnesses - Raghav Magunta, Buchi Babu, Abhishek Boinpally and Sarath Reddy - had not implicated Kejriwal. But later, Magunta Sreenivasa Reddy gave a statement against Kejriwal, and the next day, his son, Raghav Magunta, got bail. Buchi Babu also immediately got bail after he implicated Kejriwal, Singhvi submitted.Talking about proceeds of crime, Singhvi said that not ""one paisa"" has been traced to Kejriwal.","Delhi high court grants interim stay on a trial court order giving bail to Arvind Kejriwal.

52C at Mecca: 13 Keralite haj pilgrims among 922 dead

Minister Abdurahiman reports 13 Keralites died in scorching temperatures during Mecca pilgrimage, demanding Centre's intervention to solve problems faced by pilgrims. He addresses Union ministers and Consulate General about pilgrims' difficulties in Saudi Arabia, including complaints about negligence in activities of mutawwifs and poor accommodation in Assisi.

HYDERABAD: With limited buses to ferry them, many Haj pilgrims said that they had to walk for over 40km, even as temperatures touched 52 degree Celsius.Speaking over phone from Saudi Arabia, Hyderabad resident Md Fareed told TOI that many pilgrims had developed blisters on their feet, were running high temperature , suffered sunstroke, and fainted mid-way owing to the scorching heat .“The lack of buses only compounded the problem. We walked for over 7.5 km to reach Arafat from Mina,” said Fareed, adding, “I got blisters on my feet and my wife fainted as we walked for over 40km during the pilgrimage .”The Musheerabad resident is among the 300 who have completed their Haj and are waiting to board flights back to their home country this weekend.Many pilgrims from Telangana said that they had to wait for 8 to 10 hours for buses to arrive. “The main problem was with transportation. Hundreds of pilgrims from the city had to wait for hours to get a bus. Many even fainted during the wait,” said one of the 41 khadims, who travelled from Hyderabad to assist Hajis.He also claimed that they had to walk for long hours without food and water. “As a result, many pilgrims, especially those who are diabetic and have blood pressure issues, suffered during their pilgrimage,” he added.While Telangana State Haj Committee officials agreed to lack of amenities on day 1, they said that they were resolved subsequently. “There was an issue with food and accommodation initially as most of the buildings are used only during Haj. It took us about 18 hours to get them resolved. Moreover, many had to wait for over eight hours to board a bus to perform Haj,” said Shaik Liyakat Hussain, CEO, Haj Committee.Officials said the problem with transportation arose as the contract this time was given to two agencies instead of one like every year. “Also, the buses were getting stuck in traffic as lakhs of pilgrims were at Haj,” the official added.","Saudi health official Jameel Abualenain reported no abnormal deaths during Haj.

"Mumbai doctor lured with Mukesh Ambani deepfake, cheated of Rs 7 lakh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-doctor-lured-with-ambani-deepfake-cheated-of-rs-7-lakh/articleshow/111147984.cms,"MUMBAI: A 54-year-old Ayurveda doctor from Andheri has lost over Rs 7 lakh after falling victim to a share trading scam that lured her with an Instagram reel featuring a deepfake video of industrialist Mukesh Ambani speaking highly of a company called 'Rajiv Sharma Trade Group' and encouraging people to join its BCF Investment Academy for high returns.

It is the second such deepfake video of Reliance Industries boss endorsing a stock trading mentorship programme doing the rounds - in the earlier one in March, he was seen urging viewers to follow his ""student Veenit"" on social media for free-of-cost investment advice.

Dr K K H Patil was duped between May 28 and June 10 when she transferred a total of Rs 7.1 lakh to 16 different bank accounts after being attracted by the promise of high returns and Ambani's ""endorsement"". She realised the fraud when she tried to withdraw the Rs 30 lakh that reflected on the trading website as profit she had earned on her initial investment.

Oshiwara police on Wednesday filed an FIR against an unidentified person under IPC sections for impersonation and cheating and under the IT Act section for identity theft. Police said the scamsters had used deepfake technology to create the video. Police are in touch with nodal officers of banks to block the money that she was made to transfer, an officer said.

Patil said she came across the video on Instagram and was convinced by seemingly legitimate endorsement. She invested her money after researching online, which showed the company had offices in BKC and London.

BENGALURU: In a midnight operation , police probing the Renukaswamy murder case retrieved Sandalwood actor Darshan's loafers, allegedly used in the crime, from his wife Vijayalakshmi 's flat at Hoskerehalli in south Bengaluru.Renukaswamy was beaten to death, allegedly by Darshan, his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , and his aides, on June 8. On Saturday, police had sought extension of the accused's custody, saying they had to seize Darshan's clothes and shoes as they were crucial evidence.Police initially thought that Darshan's clothes and footwear could be found either in his house in Rajarajeshwari Nagar or at Pavithra's residence in Kenchenahalli. They had not factored in the possibility of any of this material ending up in the house of the actor's wife, with whom his ties are said to be anything but cordial.According to sources, Darshan told his interrogators that he had kept the clothes and footwear he was wearing on the day of the crime in his RR Nagar residence. Police were hoping to find Renukaswamy's bloodstains on it.A team of police and FSL officials took Darshan and his aide Pavan K to his residence at Ideal Township in RR Nagar at 11.15pm Saturday. Darshan's employee Babul Khan opened the door. As informed by Darshan, police rummaged through a plastic bin on the first floor, but in vain. Darshan and Khan told them that there are possibilities that the domestic help might have taken the clothes for washing to the terrace. The blue jeans trousers of True Religion brand and a black round-neck T-shirt of Opium Valley brand, which the actor was wearing on the day of the crime, were found on the terrace.When asked about his footwear, Darshan took them to the ground floor and showed them a cupboard near the sitting room. But the loafers weren't there.Sources said Pavan told police that the footwear may have been taken to Mysuru by Darshan's costume assistant Raju when he went for shooting.

Fast bowler Pat Cummins led the bowling unit with a hat-trick and David Warner 's unbeaten half-century ensured no hiccups with the bat as Australia cruised to a win over Bangladesh in their 'Super 8s' match in Group 1 of the T20 World Cup , even as rain threatened to play spoilsport in Antigua on Friday (IST).Australia secured a 28-run victory over Bangladesh via the DLS method, thanks to the exceptional performances of Cummins and leg-spinner Adam Zampa before Warner & Co took charge of the run-chase.Cummins claimed the tournament's first hat-trick in the final overs, while Zampa showcased his precision in the middle overs, as Bangladesh were restricted to 140 for 8 after being asked to bat first by Mitchell Marsh.Australia's chase was led by the experienced Warner, who smashed an unbeaten 53 off just 35 balls, including five fours and three sixes. Along with Travis Head (31), Warner got the Aussies off to a flying start, racing to 60/0 before rain interrupted play.Despite losing some momentum after the break, with young leg-spinner Rishad Hossain (2/23 in 3 overs) dismissing Head and Mitchell Marsh (1) in quick succession, Australia remained in control. Warner, playing in his last T20 World Cup, brought up his half-century with a majestic six, showcasing his dominance.When rain stopped play for the second time, Australia were comfortably ahead of the DLS par score, with 100 for 2 in 11.2 overs, 28 runs ahead of the required target of 72. The victory showcased the depth and quality of the Australian team, as they continue their march ahead in the tournament strongly.In the opening over of the match, Mitchell Starc, the left-arm pacer, provided Australia with the anticipated early breakthrough by dismissing Tanzid Hasan. With this wicket, Starc surpassed Sri Lankan legend Lasith Malinga to become the leading wicket-taker in World Cups with 95 scalps.The innings was stabilized by Litton Das (16) and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (41), who put together a 58-run partnership. In the fourth over, Shanto hit a six off Josh Hazlewood over long-on. He then targeted Starc, hitting a couple of fours in the fifth over.However, Zampa immediately ended the partnership, trapping Das leg before wicket in the ninth over. Australian spinners Zampa and Glenn Maxwell applied pressure on Bangladesh, restricting them to only 26 runs from the ninth to the 13th over while also dismissing Rishad Hossain (2) besides taking the crucial wicket of Shanto, who fell to Zampa.Hridoy (40 off 28) helped Bangladesh surpass the 100-run mark and attempted to boost his team's total. He hit consecutive sixes off Marcus Stoinis. However, Cummins made a significant impact in the latter stages of the innings, dashing any hopes of a strong finish by Bangladesh.At the end of the 18th over, Cummins took wickets off successive deliveries. Mahmudullah tried to play a pull shot but ended up playing the ball back onto his stumps. Cummins then had Mahedi Hasan caught by Zampa. He returned to bowl the final over and dismissed Hridoy with his first ball, completing the hat-trick -- the first of this T20 World Cup.",Australia beat Bangladesh by 28 runs in Group 1 of T20 World Cup in Antigua. Fast bowler Pat Cummins took a hat-trick and David Warner hit an unbeaten 53. The Aussies reached 100-2 in 11.2 overs before rain stopped play for the second time.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111156855,imgsize-52336,width-400,resizemode-4/111156855.jpg"

Once in place, the plan is to ship goods from the Indian ports to Haifa in 48 hours. But that will also require construction of missing rail links in parts of Saudi Arabia and Jordan, for which initial assessment is being undertaken. An Indian public sector company is involved with the exercise, sources said.“Although we have ships operating between India and UAE, the first phase of the project will syncronise the procedures for cargo and vessel clearances at ports on both sides through digitally enabled platforms streamlining operation. This will be the beginning of the IMEE-EC and will ensure ease of business,” said a source. Mainly containerised items will be transported through the multi-national transport corridor .This system will be operational between ports such as Mundra, Nhava Sheva and Kandla in India and Jabel Ali in the UAE.Officials said the govt nod to develop a mega port at Vadhavan in Maharashtra will also become a part of the IMEE-EC.","Digital platform to exchange information between ports of the two countries likely to be operational within first 100 days of Modi govt.

NEW DELHI: Just five months after inauguration, cracks have appeared on the Atal Setu in Mumbai leading to an exchange of allegations between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress.Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole, who inspected the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri-Nhava Seva Atal Setu in Navi Mumbai on Friday alleged corruption in the construction. He also raised concerns over people's safety.Patole claimed that the construction quality of the bridge was poor and that a portion of the road has caved in by one foot.Talking to reporters, Patole alleged that the state government has crossed all limits of corruption and put people's lives at risk. ""A portion of the Atal Setu bridge has developed cracks within three months of the inauguration and a half-a-kilometre-long stretch of the road near Navi Mumbai has caved in by a foot.The state has spent Rs 18,000 crore for the MTHL,"" he said. ""The bridge has been named after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and yet the government indulged in corruption. This is very unfortunate,"" he said. Patole also claimed that all environmental norms have been set aside for the Navi Mumbai International Airport as mangroves have been destroyed.The Maharashtra unit of Congress also took a dig at the BJP and said, ""Rs 17,843 crores of public money sunk by Modi in the first rain.""However, the ruling BJP as well as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is the nodal agency for the project, said that the cracks were not on the bridge itself but on the approach road from Ulwe in Navi Mumbai.""Stop defaming Atal Setu,"" the BJP Maharashtra said in a post on X.""It is clear that the cracks in the road seen in the photo are not on the Atal Setu. Because these cracks were on the ground road leading to Atal Setu. The repair work has been started immediately and that work has also been completed,"" the post originally in Marathi read.Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also hit out at Congress saying, ""There is no crack on Atal Setu, Nor is there any danger to Atal Setu. This picture is of the approach road. But one thing is clear that the Congress party has made a long term plan to create ""crack"" with the help of lies. Talk of changing the constitution during elections, unlocking EVMs through phone after elections and now such false talks... Only the people of the country will defeat this 'Daar' plan and the corrupt behavior of Congress...Meanwhile, the MMRDA issued a statement saying, ""There have been rumours circulating about cracks on the MTHL bridge. We want to clarify that these cracks are not on the bridge itself but on the approach road connecting the MTHL from Ulwe towards Mumbai."" During an inspection by the Operation and Maintenance team on June 20, 2024, minor cracks were found on the road surface near the edges at three locations on Ramp 5 (the ramp towards Mumbai), it said.""These cracks are minor and are located along the edge of the road. It is important to note that these cracks are not due to any structural defects. They are minor longitudinal cracks in the asphalt pavement, which can be effectively repaired without impacting the life or performance of the pavement,"" it said. The contractor has already commenced the repair work, which will be completed within 24 hours. This work is being carried out without causing any disruption to traffic, the agency added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January inaugurated the Rs 17,840 crore Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri-Nhava Sheva Atal Setu , the longest bridge as well as the longest sea bridge in the country connecting south Mumbai with Nhava-Sheva in Navi Mumbai.The toll for passenger vehicles for the entire 21.8km sea bridge is set at Rs 250.The bridge also incorporates open road tolling system which uses electronic toll collection technology to automatically collect tolls from vehicles without the need for them to stop — essentially helping in reducing traffic congestion at toll booths.The bridge also has base isolation bearings that act as shock absorbers, allowing the bridge to move slightly during an earthquake without collapsing. This design is said to withstand tremors up to 6.5 on the Richter scale.","Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole inspected the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri- Nhava Seva Atal Setu in Navi Mumbai on Friday.

There was trauma but the child ( juvenile in conflict with law) was also in trauma, give him some time,"" said Justices Bharti Dangre and Manjusha Deshpande of Bombay high court while hearing a plea against his ""illegal detention"" following ""public pressure"".The teen was allegedly speeding with the high-end luxury set of wheels in Pune in an intoxicated state on May 19, when the car crashed into a bike, killing two software engineers, Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta.HC on Friday closed for orders a habeas corpus petition filed by a Delhi-based paternal aunt of the minor. She sought his release from an alleged illegal detention, three days after being released on bail. Last Friday, HC had declined urgent relief on the plea.Senior counsel Aabad Ponda for the family said the actions of the state acting under alleged public pressure raised significant questions . He said the court has to consider whether a child who is released on bail and continues to be on bail could be remanded to an observation home , contending there was an express prohibition in the Juvenile Justice Act to do so.HC on Friday asked the police under which legal provision had the teen been sent back to the observation home after his release on bail.State public prosecutor H S Venegaonkar opposed the plea, saying it was not maintainable as the minor is detained under a court order and is in an observation home, not jail.""Can this be done without re-arrest or having bail cancelled?"" asked Ponda. He added, ""Does Section 104 of JJ Act permit review or only amendment? Is Section 39 (2) of JJ Act not an express bar to sending a person on bail to an observation home?"" He went on to question, ""If there are errors in bail order, is it not to be appealed in a higher forum and not reviewed by the same court is 104 without any power under that section of review?""On May 19, a Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) granted the boy bail.

HC added, questioning why the police did not apply for bail cancellation.Ponda said a citizen's liberty has been ""trampled upon"".

Delhi HC hits pause on Kejriwal's bail: The heated courtroom debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hc-hits-pause-on-kejriwals-bail-the-heated-courtroom-debate/articleshow/111173245.cms,"'Trial court order perverse': ED

What team Kejriwal told high court

NEW DELHI: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was set to be out on bail for the second time after being arrested in the alleged liquor policy case. But before the order was even uploaded, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) hastily moved to the Delhi High Court against the trial court order and sought an urgent hearing.Throughout the day, a vacation bench of Justice Sudhir Kumar Jain heard the heated arguments between the councils of the probe agency and the Aam Aadmi Party chief and reserved its order. For now, the high court has put an interim stay on Rouse Avenue court's bail decision and Kejriwal will have to stay in jail. The high court said it was reserving the order for 2-3 days as it wanted to go through the entire records.Meanwhile, it has also issued notice to Kejriwal seeking his response on ED's plea challenging the trial court's June 20 order by which he was granted bail. It listed the plea for hearing on July 10.The Enforcement Directorate, which moved for urgent hearing in high court challenging bail order which was passed late Thursday evening, contended that the trial court's order was ""perverse"", ""one-sided"" and ""wrong-sided"".Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju, representing the ED, claimed that the findings were based on irrelevant facts. The relevant facts, he claimed, were not considered by the special judge.""Material facts were not considered by the trial court. There cannot be a better case for cancellation of bail than this one. There cannot be greater perversity than this,"" he argued.He also contended that the probe agency was not given adequate opportunity to argue its case.During the arguments, Raju also told the high court that when the ED lawyers urged the trial court to keep its order in abeyance for 48 hours to enable them to approach superior courts, the prayer was not considered.""I was not allowed to argue fully. I was not given proper time of 2-3 days to file written submissions. This is not done. On merits, I have an excellent case. The trial court said finish off in half an hour as it wanted to deliver the judgment. It did not give us full opportunity to argue the case,"" Raju contended, adding, ""I am making the allegations with full seriousness.""Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) says an opportunity must be granted to the public prosecutor to present his case but that opportunity was not granted to me, he contended.He said the trial court did not even look at his reply on the ground that it was bulky and claimed that the trial court came to a conclusion that there was malafide on ED's part after considering wrong facts and wrong dates.He further contended that the trial court's findings contradicted those of the high court, which had upheld Kejriwal's arrest. Raju asserted that if irrelevant facts are considered, it constitutes a reason for the cancellation of bail. He pointed out that evidence of Kejriwal demanding Rs 100 crore was not taken into account by the trial court.""If irrelevant facts are considered, that itself is a reason for cancellation of bail. There is evidence that Kejriwal demanded Rs 100 crore but it was not considered by trial court,"" he argued.""End to end money trail was given by us,"" he asserted, adding that proceeds of crime were utilised in the Goa assembly poll campaign by the AAP.""End to end money trail was given by us,"" Raju stated, emphasizing that the proceeds of crime were used by the AAP during their campaign for the Goa assembly elections. He explained that the ED had named AAP as an accused in the money laundering case, and the offences fall under section 70 of the PMLA, which pertains to companies. The ED had compared AAP to a company and Kejriwal to its director, Raju argued.The probe agency's plea for stay on Kejriwal's bail was vehemently opposed by senior advocates Abhishek Singhvi and Vikram Chaudhari, representing the AAP leader. They said Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution does not exist for the ED for which the liberty of a person figured low in priority.Singhvi said the ED argued for 3 hours and 45 minutes before the trial judge.""This matter lasted for five hours (before the trial court). Nearly 3 hours 45 minutes were taken by Mr. Raju and then trial judge is faulted because she does not repeat every comma and full stop,"" he said.Singhvi urged the court not to stay Kejriwal's bail order and said it may send him back to jail later if it finds overwhelming and cogent circumstances.Singhvi criticised the ED's attempt to tarnish the reputation of the trial court judge presiding over the bail hearing. He argued that the agency's claim that the judge did not allocate sufficient time for their arguments and failed to consider relevant evidence was misguided and unfortunate.Singhvi emphasised that the ED's approach was deplorable and should never have originated from a government authority, especially in a case involving political antagonism. He clarified that a bail hearing should not be misconstrued, and the judge's handling of the case should not be questioned simply because every detail was not addressed.Advocate Chaudhari pointed out that Kejriwal's surrender to the jail authorities upon the expiration of his interim bail demonstrated his good faith and compliance with the legal process. He argued that granting bail to Kejriwal with court-imposed conditions would not cause any prejudice or harm to society, as he is not a terrorist or a threat to public safety.Chaudhari further questioned the potential consequences of allowing the chief minister of the state to be released on bail, suggesting that it would not have any detrimental impact on the proceedings or the society at large.""If he is out with conditions imposed by the court, what is the prejudice. He is not a terrorist that he will harm the society if he is let out.

"Malihabad mangoes beat heat, pests with butter paper shield",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/malihabad-mangoes-beat-heat-pests-with-butter-paper-shield/articleshow/111175852.cms,"LUCKNOW: In this torrid summer of paper peaks and dummies, few will mind that mango growers in Lucknow's Malihabad have found a way to ""cheat"" the elements --- butter paper covers.This unique method saves the fruits from extreme weather conditions and climate change in the GI-protected mango belt famous for Malihabadi Dussehris, Gulab khaas, Husnara and more, nipping potential losses in the bud. Rolled out with the help of Lucknow's Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH), the covers bags have helped save the crop not only from extreme heat and winds but also from pests.The innovation is striking in a country like India, the largest mango-producing nation in the world accounting for 46% of the output. UP accounts for 35% of India's mango produce but exports from the state and the country less than 10%, mainly due to poor preservation methods.In Malihabad, after a successful pilot phase last year, the farmers embraced the butter paper bags in a big way. ""The results were astounding. The fruit was not just bigger in size, its appearance was perfect. It held the original yellowish green colour that had almost slipped into history. Besides, the pulp was uniform and perfect contrary to the usually available jelly-like mush towards the seed,"" described Ram Sajeevan, a small orchard owner of Malihabad. in Malihabad.Before the use of bags, the growers were grappling with smaller and sunburnt fruits with dark patches. Unwanted gusty winds, unseasonal rains and unprecedented heat had hit their produce in the last two seasons.Taking lessons from the past, the mango growers reached out to Lucknow's CISH, whose scientists offered them this unique solution.Maneesh Mishra, principal scientist at CISH-Lucknow who worked with the farmers along with his team, pointed out that such bags were commonly used by vegetable and fruit producers in China, Vietnam and other nations.Primarily developed by Israeli scientists, such bags were tried out once earlier in Malihabad in 2016. But despite its benefits, it found no takers because of high costs. ""But the Covid lull and weather challenges left the farmers with two options -- innovate or perish. So, we started again last season, distributing about 4 lakh such bags to farmers for about a quarter of their trees. The difference was remarkable enough to make them embrace the change,"" said Mishra.Ujjwal Gupta, who leads a group of 2000 small orchard owners, listed other benefits. ""The bag came handy in several ways, besides saving the fruit from extreme weather. If kept well, one bag may be used for two seasons. Several southern states are giving a subsidy to mango growers to promote the use of such bags and get export-quality crop . If we get similar relief here, more farmers will adapt,"" Gupta said.The intervention brought juicy returns. ""Good quality crop fetched Malihabad farmers a handsome price of up to Rs 100 per kilogram of fruit,"" CISH-Lucknow director T Damodaran said.Listing other benefits, Damodaran said: ""The bags helped in saving the crop from unnecessary exposure to pesticides. On an average, growers in this region resorted to seven rounds of pesticide spraying. This number has come down to about three with the help of bags.""Moving off pesticides will take Lucknow's mangoes to many destinations overseas where import rules restrict the use of such chemicals in food. ""If we can meet the quality criteria with certification, many in US, Europe, Japan, Middle East and Southeast Asia are ready to spend anything for the mangoes from India,"" said Manoj Kumar Singh, agricultural production commissioner, UP.Less than 2% of UP's mangoes are exported; the figure is 6% for India. Gujarat, Maharashtra and the southern states hold the lion's share in exports, said officials.","Mango growers in Lucknow's Malihabad have found a way to ""cheat"" the elements --- butter paper covers.

The teenage driver was returning home after partying with friends — first at Cosie pub and later at Blak Marriott pub , both in Mundhwa.The teenager’s father, a city-based builder, was booked for giving the car to the minor despite knowing that the latter had no driving licence and was not trained to drive it. The owner and a manager of Cosie and two staffers and a consultant with Blak Marriot were booked for serving liquor to minors, including the teenage driver. “The court has granted bail to all the six applicants. We are yet to get a full text of the court’s order,” special public prosecutor Vidya Vibhute told TOI.The builder’s lawyer, Prashant Patil, and lawyers S Jain, Amol Dange, Sudhir Shah and Shreyas Kulkarni, representing the other applicants, also confirmed the development and said their clients had been directed to furnish personal bonds of Rs50,000 each with a surety of the like amount to secure their release.However, the teenager’s father is unlikely to walk out of Yerawada jail soon as the JJ Act case is different from the main accident case in which the teenager is the prime accused while his parents, two doctors and a then mortuary staffer at Sassoon hospital , and two middlemen are co-accused. They have been charged with manipulating the 17-year-old’s blood alcohol test by swapping his sample with that of his mother’s.The minor’s father and grandfather are booked in another case of abducting their family driver in a bid to force him to take the blame for the car crash. On Friday, the Kondhwa police formally arrested the builder in another criminal case registered this year in connection with a cheating and threatening incident in 2019 and produced him before a court for remand after securing his custody from Yerawada jail. The court, however, said there was no need for his questioning and sent the father to magisterial custody.Lawyer Patil said, “Our client’s bail plea in the abduction case is pending before a magisterial court. We will soon file bail pleas in the May 19 car crash and the recently registered cheating case. Our client and his father have already secured an interim anticipatory bail till June 24 in yet another case of abetment to a businessman’s suicide registered with the Chandanagar police .”",A special court on Friday granted bail to the father of the 17-year-old involved in the Porsche Taycan crash at Kalyaninagar.

Apart from them, two doctors were arrested for switching the boy’s blood samples with those of his mother and disposing of the original samples. All those arrested are presently in judicial custody.Initially, the Juvenile Justice Board had released the minor, imposing a sentence that ordered him to assist the traffic police for 15 days and to write a 300-word essay. This decision led to public outcry for stricter measures against the accused.While hearing the case, the High Court remarked that the victims' families are undoubtedly in a state of shock. However, it also noted that the juvenile who caused the accident, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, is likely to be in a state of shock as well, which would have naturally had a profound impact on his mental state.","A Pune district court on Friday granted bail to the father of a minor accused in a case where he was booked under sections 75 and 77 of the Juvenile Justice Act.

Nikhil Gupta's extradition: Will it affect Indo-US ties?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nikhil-guptas-extradition-in-pannun-case-will-it-affect-indo-us-ties/articleshow/111176318.cms,"Nikhil Gupta , the Indian national at the heart of a India-US diplomatic firestorm over an alleged foiled plot to kill a Khalistan separatist, was extradited by Czech Republic to US last week, pushing the case back into limelight after the lull that preceded Indian elections.Gupta allegedly hired a hitman - at the instance of an Indian govt official -- to murder Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on US soil. Pannun is a Sikh separatist of dual US-Canadian nationality. According to US justice department, Pannun is an American national and political activist who was targeted for exercising a ""quintessential American right: his freedom of speech"". Gupta has pleaded not guilty.The Czech justice ministry announcement about Gupta having been extradited coincided with the arrival in India of US NSA Jake Sullivan, the White House point person leading the efforts to bring to justice the Indian official who allegedly masterminded the plot. The main purpose of Sullivan's visit was to undertake a review, along with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval, of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET). However, his arrival was preceded by an interesting chain of events.Gupta's extradition was approved by Czech authorities on June 3, a day before results of Lok Sabha elections were declared in India. It was only 11 days later, and just three days before Sullivan's visit, that Gupta was flown to US from Prague on a special flight.These disclosures were made by Czech justice minister Pavel Blazek on the day Sullivan landed here. The same day, a group of Democrat senators in US wrote to secretary of state Antony Blinken seeking a stronger response over the alleged Indian involvement in the plot.These developments saw the murder-for-hire cast a shadow over Sullivan's engagements here, even though both sides took the Fifth on whether the issue was raised in the talks. The media coverage focused more on the Pannun case than the iCET talks that had the two sides pledging action to dismantle regulatory barriers against strategic technology cooperation. Sullivan had no media interaction during his visit, a rarity for a top US official. Even without that, the sequence of events leading up to the visit, by design or plain coincidence, foregrounded the Pannun plot, as Washington seeks action against the India-based conspirators.There'll likely be more pressure on New Delhi in the coming months to act against the Indian official who has already been identified in a Washington Post report. US justice department sees Gupta's extradition as a vital step towards justice and has said it won't tolerate attempts to silence or harm US citizens. Indian govt formed a committee in Nov to probe the US allegations but it has so far not made any of its findings public. This may become untenable as Joe Biden administration itself comes under renewed pressure to seek accountability from India.A group of Democrat senators led by Jeff Merkley, who is also a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Blinken calling for a strong diplomatic response in light of ""credible allegations"" about the involvement of an Indian official in the plot. They want a clear message sent to India that there will be consequences for such behaviour. With US elections still some distance away, it may be too early for India to think in terms of waiting out the storm. The Pannun case is also not just a one-off. India is facing similar allegations by Canada for the murder of another Khalistan separatist while an Australian media outlet recently claimed to have uncovered how Indian spies targeted Sikh separatists in Australia, a report that India Friday said was full of blatant untruths.While it may look like the relationship is in for a bumpy ride, it's unlikely the two countries will allow their partnership for ""global good"" to be stymied by the Pannun issue. A mature and nuanced India-US relationship, marked by what foreign minister S Jaishankar calls structural soundness, should be able to sail through a few blips, if handled carefully.This is reflected in how - unlike the situation between India and Canada - both sides have quietly worked together in the Pannun case without descending into a public slanging match. Jaishankar has said US, unlike Canada, doesn't defend extremism in the name of freedom of speech. It's also significant Sullivan didn't speak about the case in public, which he was widely expected to, during his visit. There will, of course, be apprehensions here about US using the case as a bargaining chip to extract concessions on contentious issues, especially those in the economic sector.Both sides also need each other - US, for a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China in the Indo-Pacific, and India, for access to cutting-edge technology crucial for its own growth and security. Sullivan's visit saw both sides reaffirming their commitment to iCET, the next big thing that might act as a guiding framework for further development of ties.That said, India will have to find a way to address US' quest for justice in the case. The issue has been raised at the highest level and, going by the tone and tenor of the voices emerging from US, not least the justice department, the Biden administration will have no option but to pursue the matter with India to its logical conclusion, which is the criminal prosecution of those who allegedly orchestrated the plot from India. As the senators warned in their letter to Blinken, any attempt at scapegoating - like only blaming a rogue operative - may not work.","Nikhil Gupta, the Indian national at the heart of a India-US diplomatic firestorm over an alleged foiled plot to kill a Khalistan separatist, was extradited by Czech Republic to US last week.

MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, in what was the first Indian reaction to the documentary, said it appears to serve a particular agenda to malign India. ""We obviously oppose any such attempts to condone, justify and even glorify terrorism,"" he said. The documentary claimed four Indian spies posing as diplomats were also expelled by Australia.

According to the documentary, apart from targeting Sikh separatists, Indian intelligence officers were trying to gain access to sensitive defence technology and airport security protocols. They were targeting former and current politicians as well as a state police service, it said.

The report further ""confirmed"" at least four intelligence officers were asked to leave Australia, adding some had been posing as diplomats in India's high commission. The documentary also quoted an Australian govt spokesperson as saying the govt was deeply concerned about the allegations. ""Australia values diversity and inclusion, where people should be safe and free to express who they are, including their faith and heritage. We do not tolerate violence or threats of violence,"" said an official statement.

According to Farcis though, the home ministry imposed a work ban on him by not renewing his journalist permit in March this year, preventing him from doing his work and denying him his source of income.

No reason was apparently given for this work ban. Farcis had said that the ban came as a shock to him.

",French journalist Sebastien Farcis alleged that he was forced out of India by Union home ministry. The foreign ministry said his application for renewal of work permit is under consideration. He is an OCI card holder and under Indian regulations requires approval to carry out journalistic assignments.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111176139,imgsize-24068,width-400,resizemode-4/111176139.jpg"

Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has written to PM Narendra Modi asking for deferment of the three ""unilaterally"" passed criminal laws set to be rolled out from July 1. Mamata's letter says the laws were passed ""ignoring"" dissent notes and, more importantly, by ""unethically"" expelling 146 members from Parliament. Mamata's letter was sent Thursday, four days before the new Parliament 's session begins Monday. The letter also follows her meeting with Congress stalwart P Chidambaram in Kolkata Thursday. INDIA allies Trinamool , Congress and DMK have consistently objected to the new laws. In her letter, Mamata urged the PM to ""halt and review the whole subject anew"" and to consider ""at least a deferment of the implementation date"", citing ""ethical and practical"" reasons. The letter said it would ""ethically"" be proper to debate and scrutinise the ""significant legislative changes"" afresh in Parliament.

Besides, to keep prices of key food items under check, the Centre has imposed stock limits on tur and chana dals till Sept, while continuing to sell subsidised chana, atta and rice under the 'Bharat' brand.Keeping a close tab on retail price management , while ensuring that farmers are not adversely impacted, is a key focus for govt, especially after the recent election verdict where inflation emerged as a major concern.Chairing a review meeting on onion prices on Friday, food and consumer affairs minister Pralhad Joshi urged agriculture ministry officials to take steps to increase acreage of kharif onion. Average retail prices of onion increased by 55% in the past one year - from Rs 23.3 a kg to Rs 36.3 a kg. Officials said the fall in rabi production, which has almost 60% share of the country's annual production of the key kitchen item, has triggered the rise in prices.The overall procurement of onions this year is around 80,000 tonnes, a little higher than the corresponding period of 2023. Officials said the consumer affairs department may start releasing onion from its buffer stock in Aug-Sept to keep a check on prices.Separately, the consumer affairs department said the stock limit on tur and chana dals would be applicable to wholesalers, retailers, big chain retailers, millers and importers. The move is aimed to ""prevent hoarding and unscrupulous speculation"" and also improve affordability.

"States hike health spend, India set to meet '2.5% of GDP' target",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/states-hike-health-spend-india-set-to-meet-2-5-of-gdp-target/articleshow/111175669.cms,"India's govt spending on health, including on clean water and sanitation, looks set to achieve the target of 2.5% of GDP by 2024-25 despite Centre's allocation failing to reach 0.8% of GDP as planned. With states managing to push expenditure on health to 1.58% of GDP last year, the combined spending of states and Centre touched 2.13% of GDP.In govt's calculation, public health expenditure includes allocation for health and family welfare, health research, Ayush and for water supply and sanitation. Centre's allocation for health by this count was just 0.55% of GDP in 2023-24, with about 48% of that being funds for water supply and sanitation. The share of allocation for health and family welfare in Centre's budget has shrunk to 0.26% of GDP, lower than what it was in 2018-19 (0.28%).This is worrying, as it is the allocation for the department of health and family welfare that is used for funding national programmes and for maintaining and strengthening the public health system. While clean water and sanitation do contribute to people staying healthy, allocation for this cannot be a substitute for spending on the public healthcare system, say experts. If the spending on water and sanitation is not counted, the expenditure on public health has been steadily shrinking whether we look at it as a percentage of central govt's total expenditure or as a percentage of the GDP.After National Health Policy 2017 recommended spending 2.5% of the GDP on public health by 2025, a National Health Mission presentation in 2018 gave a roadmap for gradually increasing public spending on health by Centre and states over seven years from 1.4% to 2.5% of GDP.Going by the planned increase to touch 2.5% of GDP by 2025, central allocation for health from 2018-19 to 2023-24 fell short by over Rs 1.5 lakh crore while the combined spending on states was Rs 3.6 lakh crores more than planned (see graphic).States have been pushing up their spending on health (medical and public health, family welfare and water supply and sanitation). From 1.25% of GDP, the allocation of states went up to 1.58% by 2023-24. As a share of total expenditure of states, health spend has gone up from 7.5% in 2018-19 to 8.8% in 2023-24, more than the target of 8% recommended for states in the National Health Policy 2017. It is this increased allocation which might enable the overall target of 2.5% of GDP being achieved.However, states too have reduced their expenditure on the health system from a high of 75.3% of total health expenditure in 2019-20 to just below 70% in the budget allocation for 2023-24. The overall spending is high due to the increase in expenditure on water supply and sanitation.There are significant variations within states too, with some like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Haryana and Odisha spending well over the target of 8% of total govt expenditure on health and others like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka spending less than this.","National Health Policy 2017 recommended spending 2.5% of the GDP on public health by 2025.
