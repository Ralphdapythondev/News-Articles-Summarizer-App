(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Delhi minister and Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) leader Raaj Kumar Anand on Wednesday resigned from his cabinet and party post, stating that he does not want to be associated with a party ""involved in corruption"".Reacting to the sudden resignation, AAP said this was yet more evidence of how the BJP was using central probe agencies to break up the party.""Anand was earlier called corrupt by the BJP but now he will join the same party ... BJP is using ED, CBI to break our ministers and MLAs, it's a test of AAP ministers and MLAs,"" AAP MP Sanjay Singh said at a press conference.""I want to tell you that this is Raaj Kuman Anand, on whom ED conducted a raid for 23 hours in November last year. The BJP was alleging him of being corrupt. Whether it is JP Nadda, Anurag Thakur or Piyush Goyal, everyone was accusing him of being corrupt. Now, we just have to wait and watch, whether the BJP, that had accused him (Raaj Kuman Anand) of being corrupt, will welcome him in their party or not?"" he added.AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said the resignation further proved that the Centre was trying to break up the party as well as the AAP governments in Delhi and Punjab.""Time and again we said that the intention behind arresting Arvind Kejriwal was to break the party and governments of Delhi and Punjab. This was said time and again by Kejriwal,"" he said.""Many of our colleagues will feel that we hate Raaj Kumar (Anand) and will call him dishonest and cheater. We will not say any such thing. I believe that he is a family man who is afraid of the threats of ED and Tihar Jail, not everyone is Sanjay Singh. I believe that he was scared, many times he told his party colleagues that 'as soon as I become a little active, I get a phone call,"" said Bharadwaj.""Everyone knows that there was an ED raid at his residence. He was under pressure and got scared. We have no complaints from him ... He was given a script and he had no other option but to read it,"" he added.On his part, Anand, who is an MLA from the Patel Nagar constituency, said he quit the party over concerns of corruption in AAP. ""Aam Aadmi Party was born to fight corruption but today the party is stuck in a swamp of corruption. It has become difficult for me to work on the minister's post. I resigned from the post of minister and from the party as I can't connect name with this corruption,"" he said.""From Jantar Mantar, Arvind Kejriwal had said that the country will change once the politics changes. The politics hasn't changed but the politician has changed,"" said Anand, who was holding various portfolios including social welfare.In response to a query on the timing of his resignation, Anand said: ""It is not about the timing. Till yesterday, we were under the impression that we are being framed, but after the high court verdict, it seems that there is something wrong at our end.""He also alleged that Dalit MLAs, minister or councillors of the AAP were not given due respect in the party.""I became a minister to pay back the society. I don't want to be part of a party that takes a backseat when Dalit representation is talked about,"" he said.""We have 13 Rajya Sabha MPs, but none of them are Dalit, women or from backward classes. There is no respect for Dalit MLAs, councillors and ministers in this party. In such a situation, all Dalits feel cheated. Due to all this, it is difficult for me to remain in this party,"" he said, adding that he is not joining any other party.","Raaj Kumar Anand says he does not want to be associated with a party ""involved

Why US doesn't want Ukraine to attack Russian oil facilities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-us-doesnt-want-ukraine-to-attack-russian-oil-facilities/articleshow/109191305.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin voiced concerns during a Senate panel hearing on Tuesday, cautioning Ukraine against targeting Russian oil refineries. He suggested that such attacks could inadvertently escalate global oil prices amid an already tense global energy situation. Austin emphasized the strategic importance of Ukraine focusing its military efforts on tactical and operational targets directly influencing the current conflict.This stance sparked disagreement from Senator Tom Cotton , who argued that the Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil infrastructure have been effective.He insinuated that the Biden administration's concerns might be more about preventing a rise in gas prices during an election year than about global energy stability.The controversy arises as global oil prices hit a six-month high, a situation the US attributes to conflicts in the Middle East and asserts that its sanctions and price cap on Russian oil have been effective. However, Russia reports an increase in oil exports in 2023 compared to pre-conflict levels, challenging the narrative of sanctions' impact.Reports have surfaced suggesting the US had previously urged Ukraine to halt its refinery attacks, with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy indicating that the US reaction to the strikes was ""not positive."" Despite this, Ukraine's military intelligence (GUR) has declared plans to expand operations against Russian oil refineries, a Russia Today report said.The drone attacks, initiated by Ukraine over the past two months, aim to disrupt Russian military fuel supplies and ""deliver a symbolic blow by bringing the war closer to Moscow,"" according to Kiev. Zelenskyy has also framed these strikes as a form of deterrence, citing a shortage of missiles for Western-provided air defenses.Both Zelenskyy and Austin are lobbying the US Congress for over $60 billion in military aid to Ukraine. Zelensky warns that without this support, Ukraine's defeat is certain, while Austin views the aid as a boon for American workers in the military industry. The proposed ""national security supplemental"" funding would benefit at least 30 federal states, supporting industries ranging from ammunition to submarine manufacturing.","US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin voiced concerns during a Senate panel

WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to the White House Tuesday, kicking off a state visit featuring a major upgrade in defense ties against a resurgent China.A gala dinner and Rose Garden press conference are on the menu for the formal part of the visit on Wednesday, in a sign of the value Washington places on an increasingly self-confident Japan .The two leaders are expected to unveil plans to restructure the US military command in Japan -- the biggest upgrade to defense cooperation since the 1960s -- to make them more responsive against threats in the Asia-Pacific region.Kishida, 66, the first Japanese leader to receive full honors from a US president since Shinzo Abe in 2015, arrived on Tuesday night at the White House with his wife Yuko.Biden, 81, and First Lady Jill Biden then took the Japanese couple to a swanky restaurant in Washington's upscale Georgetown area.Jill Biden said the visit would ""celebrate the flourishing friendship between the United States and Japan.""""Our nations are partners in a world where we choose creation over destruction, peace over bloodshed, and democracy over autocracy,"" she told reporters during a preview of Wednesday's state dinner.The Japanese visit underscores the importance Joe Biden places on building alliances against countries such as China, Russia and Iran in an increasingly uncertain world.White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the two leaders would ""announce measures to enhance security cooperation, to enable greater coordination and integration of our forces.""On Thursday Biden will host the first ever trilateral summit between Japan, the Philippines and the United States to further expand alliances against China in a critical region.But hanging over the US and Japanese leaders will be the thorny topic of a Japanese takeover of US Steel, a deal opposed by Biden as he faces a tough reelection battle against protectionist former president Donald Trump.The formal summit kicks off Wednesday with a grand welcome including military bands, followed by an Oval Office meeting and a joint news conference between Biden and Kishida in the Rose Garden.The Bidens will then host a gala dinner which will see the grand East Room of the White House transformed into what Jill Biden called a ""vibrant spring garden.""On Thursday, Kishida will address both houses of Congress before he and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos convene with Biden.They are the latest Asia-Pacific allies to be hosted by Biden, who was joined by Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol at Camp David last August.Biden has also moved to manage tensions with China, holding a two-hour phone call with President Xi Jinping last week and a face-to-face meeting in San Francisco in November.According to media reports, Biden and Kishida could agree to the biggest upgrade in US-Japan command and control structures in decades.This would make their two militaries more nimble in a crisis, for example a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, experts said.The US has 54,000 military personnel in Japan who must report back to Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii, around 6,500 kilometers (4,000 miles) away and 19 hours behind, for joint operation matters.The two countries may also agree to allow large US warships to undergo repairs at private shipyards in Japan, and to joint production of defense equipment, according to media reports.Staunchly pacifist for decades, Japan has in recent years made ""some of the most significant, momentous changes"" since World War II, US ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said ahead of the visit.","US President Joe Biden welcomes Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to the

US lawmakers urge release of Russia critic Kara-Murza on the anniversary of his imprisonment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-lawmakers-urge-release-of-russia-critic-kara-murza-on-the-anniversary-of-his-imprisonment/articleshow/109171844.cms,"WASHINGTON: Members of Congress on Tuesday called for the immediate release of Russian opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. as lawmakers marked the second anniversary of his imprisonment , part of the Kremlin's sweeping crackdown on critics of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""The bottom line is that Vladimir Kara-Murza will not be forgotten,"" Democratic Sen.Ben Cardin, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said at an event on Capitol Hill. ""We are going to work to set him free and to set Russia free.""Kara-Murza, a journalist and opposition activist, was jailed in April 2022 and convicted of treason last year for denouncing the war in Ukraine. He is serving 25 years, the stiffest sentence handed down to a Kremlin critic in modern Russia. He is among a growing number of dissidents held in increasingly severe conditions under President Vladimir Putin's political crackdown.Cardin was joined by a bipartisan group of members from both the House and Senate, seeking to increase the pressure not only on Russian authorities to force the release of Kara-Murza, but to ensure that the Biden administration continues working to force his release as the U.S. has done in previous cases of Russian political prisoners.Sen. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the committee, renewed his call Tuesday for Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate Kara-Murza as a ""wrongfully detained person,"" an appointment that would help elevate his case and provide resources to his family in America as they fight for his release.The charges against the dual Russian-British citizen stem from a March 2022 speech to the Arizona House of Representatives in which he was critical of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Kara-Murza, who twice survived poisonings that he blamed on Russian authorities, has rejected the charges against him as punishment for standing up to Putin and likened the proceedings to the show trials under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.Vladimir Kara-Murza's wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, who lives in the U.S. with their three children, joined lawmakers at the event in pleading for her husband's release.""I want to thank each and every one of you here for joining with me in my fight, not just for Vladimir's freedom, but truly for his life,"" she told the crowd.Evgenia Kara-Murza has said that her husband has spent months in solitary confinement, a punishment that has become common for Kremlin critics and is widely viewed as designed to put additional pressure on them.Most recently, Kara-Murza had been held in a penal colony in the Omsk region, though his supporters said in late January that he apparently was no longer there.","Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. was jailed in April 2022 and convicted of treason.

Canada's spy agency reveals Chinese interference in 2 elections won by Justin Trudeau,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadas-spy-agency-reveals-chinese-interference-in-2-elections-won-by-justin-trudeau/articleshow/109158363.cms,"'No India role'

China involvement

China interference

in Lok Sabha polls

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Canada's domestic spy agency has determined that China interfered in the nation's last two elections, according to testimony in an official probe, providing the strongest evidence to date of suspected Chinese involvement in Canadian politics.A document prepared by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), titled Briefing to the Prime Minister’s Office on Foreign Interference Threats to Canada’s Democratic Institutions, stated: ""We know that the PRC clandestinely and deceptively interfered both in the 2019 and 2021 general elections."" PRC refers to the People’s Republic of China.Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party emerged victorious in both the 2019 and 2021 elections.It also added that a panel of senior Canadian officials monitoring the 2021 elections in the country were not informed of any attempt by India at influencing those national polls.The absence of such a foreign interference (FI) alert was cited by the Canadian news outlet Globe and Mail’s senior parliamentary reporter Steven Chase, as he posted on X: ""Panel of bureaucrats that monitored 2021 election tells foreign interference inquiry they were not informed of any potential FI activity from India during the 2021 campaign.""India has repeatedly denied involvement in such activities in Canada.Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had stated: ""We strongly reject baseless allegations of Indian interference in Canadian elections . It is not our policy to meddle in other countries' democratic processes ... In fact, Canada has been interfering in our internal affairs.""India was mentioned during the hearings and by CSIS for alleged foreign interference in Canada, along with Russia, Iran, and Pakistan. China is considered the primary player in such activities by Canadian authorities.Under pressure from opposition legislators concerned about media reports regarding China's potential involvement, Trudeau established a commission to investigate foreign interference.The commission was presented on Monday with a slide containing an excerpt from a February 2023 briefing from the Canadian Security Intelligence Services (CSIS).The briefing said, ""We know that the PRC (People's Republic of China) clandestinely and deceptively interfered in both the 2019 and 2021 elections.""""In both cases, these foreign interference (FI) activities were pragmatic in nature, primarily aimed at supporting individuals perceived as either 'pro-PRC' or 'neutral' on matters of interest to the PRC government .""The existence of the assessment had previously been reported by Global News. China denies interfering in Canadian politics.Erin O'Toole, who led the Conservatives during the 2021 campaign, estimated that Chinese interference may have cost his party up to nine seats. However, he added that it had not altered the outcome of the election.""State actors can carry out foreign interference successfully in Canada due to minimal legal or political consequences. As a result, foreign interference poses a low-risk, high-reward scenario,"" the assessment stated.Intelligence analysts and the Conservatives argue that Trudeau's government has not taken sufficient measures to address Chinese interference.Trudeau is scheduled to testify before the commission on Wednesday.The Conservatives, known for adopting a tougher stance on China compared to the Liberals, campaigned in 2021 on a platform that denounced Beijing's treatment of the Uyghur minority and pledged to prohibit Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from involvement in the 5G network.A legislator from the left-leaning minority New Democrats informed the inquiry that after she began criticizing Beijing's policies regarding Hong Kong, invitations to events organized by the politically influential ethnic Chinese community dwindled.According to the official 2021 census, Canada has approximately 1.7 million people of Chinese descent, constituting just under 5% of the total population.The Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the CSIS statement.Canada announced last year that a Conservative legislator with family ties to Hong Kong had been subjected to an online disinformation campaign, leading to the expulsion of a senior Chinese diplomat.A Microsoft analysis has revealed that Chinese cyber and influence operatives, along with North Korean cyber agents to a certain degree, are likely to focus their efforts on interfering with India's Lok Sabha polls.In a detailed analysis by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, it has been revealed that Chinese cyber and influence actors have been actively engaging in espionage and influence operations across various regions.","Canada's domestic spy agency has determined that China interfered in the

Hollywood producers and US Congress are planning to combat digital piracy by shutting these websites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/hollywood-producers-and-us-congress-are-planning-to-combat-digital-piracy-by-shutting-these-websites/articleshow/109199514.cms,"The Motion Picture Association (MPA), a trade association representing Hollywood studios, including Paramount, Sony, Universal, and Disney, has announced a new initiative to tackle the pervasive issue of digital piracy during CinemaCon in Las Vegas. Charles Rivkin , the MPA's Chairman and CEO, revealed the organisation's plan to work with Congress to introduce site-blocking legislation in the United States.""Site-blocking is a targeted, legal tactic to disrupt the connection between digital pirates and their intended audience,"" Rivkin explained. ""It allows all types of creative industries – film and television, music and book publishers, sports leagues and broadcasters – to request, in court, that internet service providers block access to websites dedicated to sharing illegal, stolen content.""Rivkin emphasised the significant economic impact of digital piracy on the film industry, stating, ""In the U.S. alone, it steals hundreds of thousands of jobs from workers and tens of billions of dollars from our economy, including more than one billion in theatrical ticket sales.""The MPA's decision to pursue site-blocking legislation comes as a response to the growing sophistication of piracy operations. ""These enterprises are engaged in insidious forms of theft, breaking laws each time they steal and share protected content,"" Rivkin said. ""These activities are nefarious by any definition, detrimental to our industry by any standard, and dangerous for the rights of creators and consumers by any measure.""The MPA's decision to pursue site-blocking legislation comes as a response to the significant economic impact of digital piracy on the film industry. Rivkin stated that piracy costs the US economy billions of dollars annually, including more than one billion dollars in lost theatrical ticket sales, and results in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.To illustrate the potential impact of site blocking in the US, Rivkin cited the example ofFMovies , one of the world's largest illegal streaming sites. ""One of the largest illegal streaming sites in the world, FMovies, sees over 160 million visits per month and because other nations already passed site blocking legislation, a third of that traffic still comes from the United States,"" he noted. ""Imagine if those viewers couldn't find pirated versions of films through a basic internet search. Imagine if they could only watch the latest great movies when they're released in their intended destinations: your theatres.""Rivkin called for the support of theatre owners in this endeavour, stating, ""The MPA is leading this charge in Washington. And we need the voices of theatre owners – your voices – right by our side. Because this action will be good for all of us: Content creators . Theatres. Our workforce. Our country.""During his speech, Rivkin addressed concerns raised in previous debates about site blocking, such as the potential impact on free speech and the internet's functionality. He pointed to the experiences of countries that have already implemented site-blocking measures, noting that the internet has continued to thrive and that instances of free speech violations have been practically non-existent.","The Motion Picture Association (MPA), a trade association representing Hollywood

"Sensex hits 75,000, was at 25,000 when PM Modi won 10 years ago",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-hits-75000-was-at-25000-when-pm-modi-won-10-years-ago/articleshow/109176567.cms,"‘75k to act as springboard for growth’

MUMBAI: A little over 38 years after it was launched with a base of just 100 points, BSE sensex, the most watched stock market bellwether in India, crossed the 75,000-point mark on Tuesday, signifying past successes of Indian economy and the market, and raising hopes for more wealth creation in the years ahead.On Tuesday, sensex opened the session above the 75k mark - at 75,124 points - also its new all-time peak, but some profit-taking at those levels pulled it down to close at 74,684, down 59 points on the day.On NSE, Nifty, too, scaled a new life-time peak at 22,768 points during early trades but closed at 22,643, down 24 points.The slide was partially owing to investors' nervousness about expected US inflation data due Wednesday, more so after recent high-employment data released last week, said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services. An uptick in US inflation reading could delay rate cuts by its central bank and put global investors on the backfoot.For sensex, the 75k milestone came a day after BSE went past a major landmark - scaling the Rs 400-lakh-crore market capitalisation. In the last 10 years, since Modi-led NDA govt came to office, investors' wealth, measured by BSE's market cap, has gone up by five times.According to Sarvjeet Singh Virk, co-founder & MD, Finvasia, a tech-driven financial services firm, sensex at 75k not only reflects past successes of Indian markets but also “acts as a springboard for future growth, instilling confidence in investors who are now poised to embrace the promising journey ahead”.Among successes of the past decade were India’s move from being a $1.7 trillion market cap economy to a $4.8-trillion one now, setting up one of the world’s fastest settlement systems (T+1), one of the fastest IPO processes that involves retail as well as institutional investors and the most vibrant derivatives trading system in terms of number of contracts.All these, along with a market system that is increasingly opening up access to even small and medium enterprises to list on the bourses at a reasonable cost, and the rise of the retail investors as a major investing group (through the mutual fund route) give every investor confidence to put their money in the Indian market, industry veterans say.Looking forward, June 4 results of Lok Sabha elections will be the prime determinant of the market’s trajectory for the following few months. Additionally, the interest rate scenario in the US and other major economies, progress of monsoon in India (private forecaster SkyMet has predicted good rains for 2024), corporate results, foreign fund flows and economic fundamentals will also have a major impact on investor sentiment, market players said.In short term, investors’ focus will shift to earnings delivery as stock prices are factoring in reasonable growth during the earnings season that’s starting this week, said Naveen Kulkarni, chief investment officer, Axis Securities PMS. “If the earnings season turns out to be disappointing, then the market will correct. However, if there are more upgrades than downgrades, the market will continue to move upwards.”","BSE sensex, the most watched stock market bellwether in India, crossed the
