She alleged that the man deserted her in Sep 2015 when she was in an advanced stage of pregnancy and ""repulsively"" eloped with her brother's wife. She said along with her parents and brother, she had caught her then husband and sister-in-law in a hotel in 2016.The man and her brother's wife started living together with the latter's four-year-old daughter. Singh said the man did not even visit her once after their son was born in Oct 2015. After filing of cross cases by both sides against each other, a family court granted them divorce by mutual consent in Sep 2016. In 2018, the man and Singh's sister-in-law got married and had a child who is now four years old.Shukla said Singh remarried in 2020 and her husband and family agreed to accept her child. ""The decision to remarry, in spite of undergoing unspeakable stress, pain and agony, was because she wanted to provide the child with a normal and healthy upbringing,"" she said.While referring to repeated and continuous harassment from her former husband, Singh sought the court's permission to adopt her own son along with the stepfather without having to comply with Section 9(2) of HAMA that makes consent of the biological father mandatory for giving up a child on adoption.The CJI-led bench said, ""When HAMA mandates consent of the biological father, how do we compel him to give up custody even when the mother has been entrusted with guardianship of the child. However difficult the case may be, we will issue notice (to the erstwhile husband)."" Asking the jurisdictional station house officer of Delhi Police to serve the notice on the former husband, it asked the man to respond in two weeks.","Divya Jyoti Singh sought to adopt her son, born from her earlier marriage, along with his stepfather without the biological father's consent.

SC expands scrutiny radar to governors’ powers on bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-expands-scrutiny-radar-to-governors-powers-on-bills/articleshow/112055967.cms,"NEW DELHI: A week after agreeing to test the validity of blanket constitutional immunity from criminal prosecution to governors, the Supreme Court on Friday said it would consider framing guidelines for governors in withholding assent to Bills passed by legislature or referring them to the President .Opposition-ruled states Kerala and West Bengal on Friday joined Telangana and Tamil Nadu in accusing governors of whimsically exercising powers regarding Bills.Senior advocates K K Venugopal, A M Singhvi and Jaideep Gupta, appearing for Kerala and WB, argued in unison that it has become a trend with the governors to whimsically delay assent to Bills passed by legislative assembly and reserve them for the President’s consideration.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud, and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra issued notices to the Union ministry of home affairs and the secretaries the governors for a comprehensive exercise in interpretation of the relevant constitutional provisions relating to the powers of the governors regarding Bills.A week ago, the SC had entertained a petition by a woman, allegedly sexually harassed by WB governor C V Ananda Bose, to examine the constitutional validity of the immunity from criminal cases given to governors under Article 361 of the Constitution. The woman had alleged that the WB police was not investigating the case because of immunity enjoyed by the governor.Venugopal said, “There is a confusion in the minds of the governors as to what are their powers regarding assenting to bills. In Kerala, out of 8 bills, two have been kept pending for 23 months, one for 15 months, another for 13 months and three others for 10 months. This is a very sad state of affairs. The Constitution itself is being rendered otiose. We have also challenged his decision to refer some bills to the President.”For WB, Gupta said after the state gave notice of mentioning its petition before SC, the governor’s office has intimated that some of the Bills are reserved for President’s consideration. Singhvi, who had earlier appeared for TN and now argued on behalf of WB, said in Tamil Nadu too the same trend was witnessed. “The moment petitions are filed before the SC, the governor clears some bills and sends some to the President. The next date some more Bills are cleared. Why should the governor’s office act only when the petitions are listed for hearing in SC?Venugopal said, “Referring to the President seems to be an easy way out for the governor when they do not want to cooperate with the legislative assembly. It is an unfortunate state of affairs.”In the tussle between AAP government and Punjab governor over Bills, CJI Chandrachud-led bench had in its Nov 10, 2023 judgment said if unbridled power to sit over a Bill is given to “unelected head of State” in the governor, he would “virtually veto the functioning of the legislative domain by a duly elected legislature by simply declaring that assent is withheld without any further recourse”.“Such a course of action would be contrary to fundamental principles of a constitutional democracy based on a Parliamentary pattern of governance,” said Justice Chandrachud, who had authored the judgment. “The governor cannot be at liberty to keep the Bill pending indefinitely without any action whatsoever… The governor, as an unelected Head of the State, is entrusted with certain constitutional powers. However, this power cannot be used to thwart the normal course of lawmaking by the State Legislatures,” the SC had ruled.","Opposition-ruled states Kerala and West Bengal on Friday joined Telangana and Tamil Nadu in accusing governors of whimsically exercising powers regarding Bills. A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud, and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra issued notices to the Union ministry of home affairs and the secretaries the governors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112056099,imgsize-62874,width-400,resizemode-4/112056099.jpg"

When you create a situation where soldiers can be trained for 6 months and serve for 3-4 years, you are diluting the quality of training and professional opportunities available to the Indian Army,"" Tharoor said.""I believe it is deeply damaging, the only rationale for it is indeed to save money on the pension and therefore I think that the Congress stands justified in its insistence that we will scrap the scheme when we come to power,"" he added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday addressed in Ladakh's Kargil on the occasion of 25th Kargil Vijay Diwas , in which he stressed on Agniveer scheme, saying, that the scheme aims to rejuvenate the Army and ensure its continuous readiness for war. PM Modi noted that such major reforms have been a long-standing demand.""The country has felt the need for major reforms in the defence sector for decades. The army has been demanding this for years, but unfortunately, it was not given enough importance earlier. The Agnipath scheme is also an example of the necessary reforms done in the Army. For decades, discussions have been going on in Parliament and many committees on making the army young,"" Prime Minister said during his address.Several BJP-ruled state chief ministers have announced reservations for Agniveers in their respective states.Rajasthan chief minister Bhajanlal Sharma said that the government will provide reservations for Agniveers in the police department, as well as for prison guards and forest guards, once they complete their service in the Indian Army.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma also announced that his government will recruit most Agniveers into the state police.Odisha chief minister Mohan Charan Majhi announced a 10 percent quota and a five-year age relaxation for Agniveers in uniformed services.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav announced that Agniveer Jawans will receive reservations in the recruitment of police and armed forces in the state.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also announced that Agniveers, after their service, will be given priority in recruitment for the UP Police and Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) forces.

Back then, BJP was in power, and opposition parties like Congress and Left showed their true colours by calling for a special Rajya Sabha session during the middle of the Kargil war only to criticise the armed forces,"" Modi said. The post claimed Congress back then refused to criticise ""an adversary nation"".Modi also questioned Sonia Gandhi's silence on Pakistan. He recalled how Atal Bihari Vajpayee, despite being in the opposition, fully supported Indira Gandhi during the 1971 war, ""displaying a spirit of true national unity"". ""In stark contrast, Sonia Gandhi's silence during the Kargil conflict was concerning and raised doubts, a silence which continues even now, 25 years later,"" he said.Tasked with overseeing work in Himachal Pradesh 25 years ago, Modi boarded an Mi-17 helicopter laden with essential supplies for soldiers while the war was raging. Modi and his team landed in Srinagar amid continuous shelling by the Pakistani army.Modi had many chances to speak with the soldiers. During their conversations, he thanked them for their courage, but they insisted that the credit should go to then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Modi said he was surprised that the soldiers attributed the victory to the nation's leader. A soldier explained that despite several attempts to capture Tiger Hill, the Indian Army was unable to achieve success. But while listening to the radio in their bunker one evening, they heard that then US president Bill Clinton had invited Vajpayee to the US but the latter declined, saying his soldiers were on the battlefield and he had no time for a visit.This refusal inspired the soldiers, Modi said. Motivated by their PM's commitment, they fought with renewed vigour that very night, and achieved victory. ""For Narendra Modi, it showed how strong political will and leadership can inspire soldiers to be brave and make great sacrifices,"" the post said.","Modi Archives account on X shared a thread reminiscing about him, then BJP general secretary and in-charge of Himachal, visiting soldiers during the war 25 years ago.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not have anything specifically for Tamil Nadu , but the state is likely to benefit from some of the measures announced in the Budget. Here are five of them.Farmers in Tamil Nadu too can reap the benefits of the Budget’s push to enhance productivity and resilience in the agriculture sector. For example, the launch of 109 new high-yielding and climate-resilient varieties of 32 field and horticulture crops, missions for pulses and oilseeds, and promotion of natural farming.Setting up digital public infrastructure f o r agriculture helps too. S Chandramohan, director and group president, finance & investment, TAFE said, “The digitisation of agri records will help farmers; proper land records will also help them get loans.”The range of measures for MSMEs will help Tamil Nadu, which is home for the second largest number of such units in the country. The employment-linked incentive schemefor hiring freshers will encourage MSMEs to recruit young graduates, said T T Keshav, co-convenor, CII Tamil Nadu CEO forum. “In Tamil Nadu, MSMEs offer the first job for most freshers hailing from smaller towns. With MSMEs facing shortage of employees and financial constraints, this announcement will be a booster to absorb more new graduates,” he added.Financial support for setting up a network of nucleus breeding centres for shrimp broodstock and reduction in basic customs duty on certain broodstock, polychaete worms, shrimp and fish feed to 5% will help coastal states such as Tamil Nadu. Seafood Exporters Association of India president Pawan Kumar G said, “We welcome the announcement because the govt has started focusing and recognised it is an important sector. Implementation must be expedited.” In 2023-24, Tamil Nadu exported marine products worth $484 million.The budget has slashed basic custom duty (BCD) for mobile phones, chargers and printed circuit board assembly of mobile phones. It also removed BCD for specified goods used for manufacturing connectors and resistors and duty on critical minerals including copper, lithium and silicon. This is expected to increase localisation of the electronics supply chain.Tamil Nadu has a major share in the country’s $14 billion Apple iPhones manufacturing. Dr Veerapan, chairman of Indian electronics and semiconductor association (IESA), said, “Funding for product development and creation of the electronics ecosystem will play a crucial role in building the component ecosystem.”BCD for spandex yarn raw material has been cut from 7.5% to 5%. Tanned leather, wet white leather, crust leather and finished leather included under the duty-free scheme for leather product exporters. Export duty on wet blue and crust leather also cut.“This step will help increase leather and footwear exports to $13.7 billion by 2030 from $4.70 billion at present,” said Rajendra Kumar Jalan, chairman of council for leather exports (CLE). Textile exporters say reduction of customs duty and credit guarantee for purchase of machinery for MSMEs will help the textile industry.K Venkatachalam, chief advisor of Tamil Nadu Spinning Mills Association, said one has to wait and see whether some of these benefits will be passed on to the customers. “Some long-pending demands for removal of import duty on cotton, withdrawal of quality control orders on viscose and polyester fibres were not met.”",Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not have anything specifically for Tamil Nadu.

With only one answer being deemed correct, those who had chosen the other option lost five marks (four marks for wrong answer and one negative mark), in what was sure to have a cascading effect on the ranks of all those who took the exam.This decision will primarily impact the scores of 4.2 lakh candidates, including 44 who achieved perfect scores of 720, because they had opted for the answer deemed incorrect by IIT-Delhi and for which they had been awarded four marks earlier by NTA. “The number of toppers, which stands at 61, will come down to 17, post the deduction of marks,” an NTA official said.The change in ranking could prove to be crucial for many students considering that over 24 lakh aspirants took the NEET-UG for the 1.08 medical seats up for grabs in the country. Of these, 56,000 seats are in govt institutions, which are much sought after for their better infrastructure and lower fees.According to sources, the biggest impact will be on candidates ranked between 50,000 to 1 lakh as over 16,000 candidates, who were earlier likely to earn a seat in a medical college, are likely to go out of the cohort.Sources said the impact on the 44 students, who will no longer be toppers, will not be much as they would still feature in the rank cohort of 33,000 to 50,000 but change in their ranks will impact their chance of securing seats in govt medical colleges of their choice.",The number of toppers in the NEET-UG exam is set to come down to 17 from 61 when National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announces the revised merit list.Revision of the merit list was necessitated after IIT-Delhi recommended that only one of the options in a question was correct.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112024337,imgsize-98584,width-400,resizemode-4/112024337.jpg"

Quivering helplessly in horror, she collapsed against the wall -- showed a chilling clip of a Bihar woman after she was stabbed inside her PG in Bengaluru.A new CCTV footage of the Bengaluru PG murder in which a 24-year-old woman was brutally murdered will send a chill down your spine.In a narrow corridor, the killer swiftly rushed towards Kriti Kumari , dragged her, and stabbed her multiple times in anger as she continued to scream for help.The woman was seen struggling to relieve herself from the grip of the man, who eventually slit her throat.No one came forward to help her and the man easily walked off from the spot, leaving the woman on the floor before she finally passed out.The woman, a private firm employee was killed by her roommate's boyfriend, who also happens to be her colleague.The incident occurred between 11.10 pm and 11.30 pm on Tuesday when the man stabbed her multiple times and slit her throat before escaping.Kumari was staying in the PG since March, where the suspect used to visit to meet his girlfriend.According to sources, Abhishek, who recently quit his job at a private firm in Bengaluru, was facing relationship issues, which led his girlfriend to move into the PG on Kumari's advice.Investigators suspect Abhishek may have targeted Kumari, believing she influenced his girlfriend to distance herself from him.However, police said the exact motive will only be determined once the suspect is in custody. The case has been complicated by the suspect turning off his mobile phone, hindering several attempts to track his movements.As the investigation continues, law enforcement officials are urging anyone with information about the murder accused to come forward.Police have intensified their search for Abhishek. Authorities have formed three special teams and dispatched them to Madhya Pradesh to apprehend him.","24-year-old Kriti Kumari was stabbed multiple times and slit her throat in Bengaluru.

The Bengal chief minister, who is New Delhi for NITI Aayog meeting, said the “ministry of external affairs should learn a few lessons” from the system.Clarifying that she had only offered help to those who were caught in the situation, like students across borders and those who come into Bengal for medical treatment or on other work, Banerjee said, “My words were distorted by BJP and a certain section of people in Bangladesh.But we wanted to avoid any trouble, as there were riots at the Assam border, but out police rescued 2000 students from the Bengal borders.”Banerjee said, ""I know the federal structure very well. I was an MP seven times, I was Union minister twice. I know the external affairs policy better than anyone else. They shouldn’t teach me a lesson; they should learn from the system instead.""Hitting out at the ministry of external affairs (MEA), Banerjee said, “the MEA should learn some lessons since they forgot about it when they were working out the Teesta and Ganga water accords unilaterally with Bangladesh, without involving the main stakeholder (Bengal),” bringing up the state’s contentious international water sharing issues with the Centre.Earlier, CM Mamata Banerjee had said that her government would provide shelter to people from violence-hit Bangladesh and would not turn anyone away ""if they come knocking on our doors"".""I cannot make any comments on the situation in Bangladesh as it is another country and only the Indian govt has the right to speak about it.

'Behave, It's Her Maiden Speech': Kangana's Big Claim In Lok Sabha Triggers Uproar

NEW DELHI: Politics in Andhra Pradesh is on the boil with chief minister Chandrababu Naidu continuing with his attacks on his predecessor Jagan Mohan Reddy . A day after comparing former state chief minister Reddy to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar over alleged drug menace in the state, Naidu on Friday alleged that the five-year rule by the YSRCP had destroyed the state's economy which had led to a loss of up to Rs 7 lakh crore revenue.Naidu alleged that state's debt rose from Rs 3.75 lakh crore on March 31, 2019 to Rs 9.74 lakh crore by June 12, 2024.Naidu, who is on a spree of releasing white papers on different aspects of governance under Jagan Mohan Reddy in the last 5 years, released details of state's finances in the assembly and alleged that Andhra's economy was destroyed between 2019 and 2024. On Thursday, Naidu had released white paper on law and order and the ganja (marijuana) prevalence and had claimed that Andhra had emerged as ganja capital between 2019 and 2024.Naidu has also released white paper on the excise policy of the previous government and has said the state government would soon order a probe by the CID into the large-scale irregularities in the Excise Department during the YSR Congress Party rule. The chief minister alleged that the state suffered a loss of Rs 18,860.51 crore with the change in liquor policy after the YSRCP came to power in 2019.The chief minister has alleged that misrule in the state started after Reddy took over the reins of the government. This led to looting of natural resources, anti-industrial policies, change of policy on capital city and destruction of the Polavaram project , Naidu alleged.The new government has published seven white papers for every citizen to understand the real extent of the previous government's mismanagement.Meanwhile, Jagan Mohan Reddy hit back at Chandrababu Naidu and said the chief minister is backing off from presenting a regular budget as he would be compelled to incorporate poll promises in it. The former chief minister alleged that Naidu does not have the boldness to table a regular budget, which generally is for 12 months. Recently, Naidu had announced in assembly that the state budget will be presented after two months due to 'financial constraints'.""If he presents a regular budget then he has to show the fake promises he had made during polls in the regular budget. If those super six promises do not reflect, he (Naidu) thought people will open their mouths,"" said Reddy.What are the Super Six promises made by Chandrababu Naidu to people of Andhra PradeshJagan, who staged protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar against alleged political violence in Andhra Pradesh, got support from several INDIA bloc members and AIADMK leaders. Ironically, the YSRCP is not a member of the opposition INDIA bloc, and had previously maintained issue-based support to the Modi government. Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Akhilesh Yadav, Shiv Sena (UBT) leaders Sanjay Raut and Priyanka Chaturvedi, the TMC's Nadimul Haq, and the AIADMK's M Thambidurai were among those who condemned the alleged attacks on YSRCP workers in Andhra Pradesh.Questioning if the state is moving forward or going back 52 days after the declaration of the election results, Reddy alleged atrocities such as murders, rapes and destruction of assets were rampant. He alleged victims were being booked while the police department was playing the role of a spectator under the allegedly oppressive rule of the TDP-led government, which also includes the BJP and the Janasena.(With inputs from agencies)",Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu continues his attacks on his predecessor Jagan Mohan Reddy.

PM Modi defends Agnipath: Will keep forces combat-ready,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-defends-agnipath-will-keep-forces-combat-ready/articleshow/112050792.cms,"(Referring to Pak) Today, I am speaking from a place where the patrons of terrorism can hear me... their nefarious intentions will never succeed. Our brave soldiers will crush terrorism with full force. PM Modi

DRASS (KARGIL): Strongly defending the Agnipath scheme that has faced criticism from several quarters, PM Narendra Modi on Friday said short-term recruitment of soldiers was necessary for keeping the armed forces young and combat-ready at all times, and accused the opposition of trying to mislead the youth and playing politics over national security issues.Addressing the 25th Kargil Vijay Diwas celebrations at Drass, Modi said his govt had made defence reforms a top priority unlike previous regimes, rubbishing claims that the Agnipath scheme rolled out in June 2022 was meant to save pension money.“The fact that the average age of Indian soldiers was higher than the global average was a major concern discussed in Parliament and various committees for decades, but there was no will power to address it. The aim of Agnipath is to make the armed forces younger and keep them continuously fit for war,” Modi said, in his first public response to attacks on Agnipath scheme by opposition which made the short-tern recruitment scheme one of the key themes of the Lok Sabha election campaign.It is “necessary reform” undertaken by the military, PM stressed.“Unfortunately, such a sensitive issue related to national security has been made a subject of politics by some people. They are the same people who weakened our armed forces by committing scams worth thousands of crores. They are the ones who did not want IAF to get modern fighter jets (Rafales). They had also made preparations to lock the (indigenous) Tejas fighter in a box,” he said, taking a swipe at the previous UPA govt by recalling that the Army lacked bulletproof jackets before he took over and the UPA govt allocated Rs 500 crore for one rank-one pension scheme.The very same people are spreading the canard that the govt came with the Agnipath scheme to save pension money, said Modi, stressing that the question of pension for those being recruited today would arise after 30 years. “By then, I would be 105. Why would the govt take a decision for it today and face abuse? We could have left that for the govts in the future. But we respected this decision taken by the forces because for us, the security of the country is paramount, not party or politics,” he said. “The truth is that the Agnipath scheme will increase the country’s strength and the country will also get capable youth. Announcements have earlier been made about giving priority (in jobs) to Agniveers in the private sector and paramilitary forces.”The PM said those “misleading” the youth today had no regard for the armed forces in the past. In this context, he cited his govt’s implementation of the “one rank, one pension (OROP)” scheme, under which ex-servicemen have been given more than Rs 1.25 lakh crore till now, and the construction of the national war memorial.Stressing the importance of upgrading military technologies amid the ongoing geopolitical flux, the PM said the armed forces not only need the latest weapons and equipment, but also “a modern working style and arrangements”. “In the last 10 years, defence reforms have been prioritised, making our forces more capable and self-reliant,” he said.A major stake in defence procurements is now being given to the Indian defence industry, while 25% of the defence R&D has also been reserved for the private sector. “As a result of these efforts, India’s annual defence production has crossed the Rs 1.25 lakh crore-mark,” the PM said.“In the past, India was counted only as an arms importer, but now the country is also making its mark as an arms exporter,” he added, expressing happiness that the armed forces have decided to stop importing more than 5,000 defence products and items.",PM Narendra Modi said short-term recruitment of soldiers was necessary for keeping the armed forces young and combat-ready at all times. Modi said his govt had made defence reforms a top priority unlike previous regimes. He rubbished claims that the Agnipath scheme rolled out in June 2022 was meant to save pension money.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112050867,imgsize-990504,width-400,resizemode-4/112050867.jpg"

What does Article 200 say

What Supreme Court has said in the past

'Playing with fire'

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress-ruled West Bengal and CPM-led LDF government in Kerala, who have had prolonged faceoff with their respective governors, would finally hope of some resolution with the Supreme Court taking note of their pleas alleging denial of assent to bills passed by the respective legislative assemblies. The top court, in the past, has taken very strict view of governors sitting over bills passed by state assemblies, giving hope to the two states.The CPM-led Left Democratic Front government of Kerala had moved the top court in March alleging that certain bills cleared by legislative assembly were referred to President by the governor and these were still pending assent.West Bengal, in its plea, has alleged that the state governor was withholding assent on eight bills. The state also claimed that West Bengal governor had referred some of the pending bills to President when he got to know that the matter was coming up for hearing in the top court.The top court issued notices to Union ministry of home affairs and the secretaries of Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan and his West Bengal counterpart CV Ananda Bose and sought their replies within three weeks.The bench of Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice JB Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra also directed the Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government to make the home ministry a party to the petition.Senior advocate KK Venugopal, appearing for the Kerala government, challenged the reference of bills to the President. Kerala said its plea pertained to the acts of the governor in reserving seven bills, which he was required to deal with himself, to the president. Not one of the seven bills had anything to do with Centre-state relations, it said.Kerala's counsel added these bills were pending with the governor for as long as about two years and his action ""subverted"" the functioning of the state legislature, rendering its very existence ""ineffective and otiose"".Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for West Bengal, said he would make the Centre a party and file a written note to assist the court in deciding the plea.He referred to instances of other states, including Tamil Nadu, and said the moment the top court fixed the cases for hearing, certain bills were either cleared or referred to the President.Venugopal said there was a need for the top court to lay down guidelines on when the governors could return or refer the bills.The Constitution is silent on how much time President can take in granting assent to a bill passed by a state legislature and referred to the Rashtrapati Bhavan for presidential consideration or for denying consent.Article 361 of the Constitution says the President, or the governor of a state, shall not be answerable to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of those powers and duties.West Bengal, in its plea, said the denial of assent without assigning any reason to the bills passed by the assembly was contrary to Article 200 of the Constitution.The article provides for the process for a bill passed by the assembly of a state to be presented to the governor for assent. The governor may either assent or withhold assent or reserve the bill for consideration by the president.When a bill has been passed by the legislative assembly of a state or, in the case of a state having a legislative council, has been passed by both Houses of the legislature of the state, it shall be presented to the governor and the governor shall declare either that he assents to the bill or that he withholds assent therefrom or that he reserves the bill for the consideration of the President.This is not the first time that faceoff between state government and governor has reached the doors of Supreme Court. The apex court has dealt with similar petitions from Tamil Nadu and Punjab governments and has made some very strong observations on the issue. ""Our country has been running on established traditions and conventions and they need to be followed,"" the top court has said in its earlier judgments on the issue.When Tamil Nadu governor R N Ravi had refused assent to bills, the Supreme Court, referring to Article 200 of the Constitution, said the governor cannot send the bills to the President after they were readopted by the legislative assembly upon getting them back from the office of the governor earlier.The top court had also questioned the delay on the part of Ravi in granting assent to several Bills passed by the state assembly, asking why should governors wait for parties to move the top court with their grievances.In the case of Punjab, the Supreme Court had told the then governor Banwarilal Purohit ""you are playing with fire."" The top court expressed serious concern over the deadlock in Punjab and took a stern view of state governor not giving assent to bills passed by the state assembly.(With inputs from agencies)","West Bengal and Kerala have had prolonged faceoff with their respective governors.

PM targets opposition over Agniveer scheme





Opposition accuses PM Modi of 'petty politics'





NEW DELHI: On the Kargil Vijay Diwas, as opposition cornered PM Modi-led NDA government over the Agniveer scheme , the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states moved to provide job reservations to the ex-servicemen. In back-to-back statements, the chief ministers of Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha announced the decision to provide job reservations to Agniveers in the state jobs while backing the scheme.Underscoring the importance of national security, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath criticised the opposition on Friday for allegedly misleading the public regarding the Agniveer scheme.He also stated that his government will provide Agniveers jobs in police service and Pradeshik Armed Constabulary (PAC) on ""priority basis"".In a post on X, CM Yogi said, ""When Agniveers return after their service, Uttar Pradesh government will provide these youth the facility of adjustment in Police Service, PAC on priority basis. A certain reservation facility will be provided for them in Uttar Pradesh Police.""The announcement comes just days after the BJP-led Haryana government said the state would provide 10% reservation to Agniveers in direct recruitment to posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden and SPO.Besides UP, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh also announced job quotas for Agniveers on Friday.Madhya Praadesh chief minister Mohan Yadav on Friday announced that his government will provide reservations to Agniveers in the recruitment of police and armed forces after the end of their services.Sharing the information on social media platform X, Yadav said the decision is as per ""the wishes of our illustrious Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji.""The Madhya Pradesh CM earlier in the morning paid tribute to the heroes of the Kargil war at Shaurya Smarak in Bhopal on the occasion of 25th anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas.With this, Madhya Pradesh became the third BJP-led state to announce reservation in jobs for Agniveers.On the occasion of Kargil Diwas, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami also announced a similar decision.""We will make provisions and bring an Act to give reservation to them in government services. We are working on this plan. We will make use of their skills and discipline in various government departments,"" Dhami said.The chief minister also announced that the aid extended to the kin of martyrs will be increased from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.""No sacrifice can be bigger than the act of laying down one's life to secure the country's borders. No grant or honour can be enough for this supreme sacrifice,"" he added.Chhattisgarh CM Vishnu Deo Sai also made the announcement saying, ""I am glad to announce that ex-Agniveers will be given priority in appointment of police constable, forest guard and jail guard in Chhattisgarh. The state government will soon release guidelines for it.""Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi announced similar move and said 10 per cent quota and five-year age relaxation will be given to the Agniveers in uniform services.Nayab Saini-led Haryana government had announced the similar move on July 17.Chief minister Nayab Saini said the state government will provide 10 percent reservation to Agniveers in Haryana in direct recruitment to the posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden and SPO.He also announced age waiver of three years for Agniveers in Group B, C employment in the state.Earlier today, in his address at the Kargil Vijay Diwas Shradhanjali Samaroh in Drass, PM Modi called Agnipath scheme an example of necessary reforms done by the army.He said some people were playing politics over a sensitive issue related to national security and rubbished claims that the Agnipath scheme was launched to save pension money. ""The aim of Agnipath is to make the forces young ... The aim of Agnipath is to keep the armies continuously fit for war,"" he said.""For decades, there have been discussions on making the armed forces young, from Parliament to various committees. The average age of Indian soldiers being higher than the global average has been raising concerns. Therefore, this topic was raised in many committees for years. But the will to solve this challenge related to the country's security was not shown earlier,"" PM Modi said.""Unfortunately, such a sensitive issue related to national security has been made a subject of politics by some people. Some people are playing politics of lies for their personal interests even on this reform of the army,"" the PM added.Modi government's Agniveer scheme has attracted constant criticism by the opposition making it one of the major flashpoint during Lok Sabha election campaign and subsequent Parliament sessions.As PM Modi on Friday blamed the opposition for ""playing politics of lies for their personal interests even on this reform of the army"" over the scheme, the INDIA bloc leaders launched a counter-attack, accusing PM Modi of being involved in ""petty politics"".Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and other party leaders accused the prime minister of indulging in ""petty politics"" over the Agnipath issue and said the prime minister's remarks that his government implemented the scheme at the behest of the Army was a ""blatant lie"".""It is very unfortunate and deplorable that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji is doing petty politics even on occasions like paying tribute to martyrs on Kargil Vijay Diwas. No Prime Minister has ever done this before,"" Kharge said.""Modi ji is saying that his government implemented the Agnipath scheme at the behest of the Army. This is a blatant lie and an unforgivable insult to our valiant armed forces. Modi ji, it is you who is spreading lies!"" he said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh accused Modi of ""lying"" even on Kargil Vijay Diwas.""He (Modi) says the Agnipath/Agniveer scheme was introduced by the Army. General MM Naravane, who was Army chief at that time, has written that the scheme came as a complete surprise to the Army and as a 'bolt from the blue' to the Navy and Air Force. Modi is now trying to evade responsibility for this disastrous scheme,"" he said in a post on X.Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) MP Mahua Maji said the scheme needs to be reviewed as it does not provide any social security to the Agniveers.""I salute the martyrs of Kargil.

We should think about the soldiers on whom the whole nation of 140 crore people relies.

"Two of 17 NEET toppers from Delhi, 4 from Rajasthan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-of-17-neet-toppers-from-delhi-4-from-rajsthan/articleshow/112050801.cms,"NEW DELHI: A change of mere five marks has brought cheer for many and caused heartbreak for others as there are candidates who have moved up or down by 8,000 ranks in NEET-UG for medical school admissions.As exclusively reported by TOI on Friday, 17 candidates with perfect 720 marks were declared toppers, against 61 when NTA released the merit list following SC’s order.Leading the pack of 17 toppers with a perfect score of 720 is Delhi’s Mridul Manya Anand, followed by UP’s Ayush Naugraiya from EWS category. With multiple candidates getting perfect scores, NTA uses a tiebreaker system to rank them.While there was another Delhi candidate who scored 720, Rajasthan had four toppers, the highest.There was also a huge sigh of relief from other examinees for whom there was a marginal difference in ranks. Along with the decrease in the number of toppers, in the revised results, the qualifying cutoffs and number of qualified candidates have also come down. The revised results were declared Friday following a directive from Supreme Court after considering marks of a physics question, as there were two correct answers to a question.Apart from 17 with the perfect 720, there were six who scored 716, and 77 with 715 marks, which forms the cohort of top 100 candidates.The revision of results also brought down the qualifying cutoffs — for the unreserved and economically weaker section the new cutoff range is 720-162, down from 164, while for OBC/SC/ST it is 161-127.With four girls scoring 720, the share of female toppers went up from 16% to 23%, and there were 22 among the top 100.The list of toppers comprises four candidates from Rajasthan, three from Maharashtra, two each from Delhi and UP, and one each from Kerala, Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Bihar and West Bengal.Forty-four of the 67 candidates who were earlier declared toppers had scored full marks because of the marks awarded for that particular physics question.

However, the special court judge rejected the Central Bureau of Investigation's application on Friday, saying the court cannot review his own order of rejection of custody of the accused. Granting permission to arrest the accused would be reviewing the earlier order, the court said.The CBI, in its plea, had said it needs to interrogate Varma to unearth his role with Mehul Choksi in availment of 142 buyers' credit amounting to Rs 3,011 crore disbursed against 165 unauthorised Letters of Undertaking (LOUs). However, the accused, through his lawyer, contended that he was made as accused in the supplementary chargesheet in 2021. When he left India in May 2017, there was no chargesheet against him. Therefore he cannot be said to have evaded criminal proceedings, his lawyer submitted.Choksi has been living in Antigua since 2018, after escaping from India, weeks before the scam was reported. The diamantaire and his nephew, Nirav Modi , allegedly siphoned off over Rs 13,000 crore of public money from the PNB using LoUs and foreign letters of credit (FLCs) by bribing officials of the bank's Brady House branch in Mumbai.","Varma, a former international business head of Mehul Choksi's Gitanjali Group, appeared before the court last week.

That is why most states decided to boycott the meeting.”Admitting that she was in two minds on attending the meeting, Banerjee said, “even I had thought of skipping it, so I cancelled my trip yesterday, but Abhishek (Banerjee, TMC MP and party general secretary) convinced me this morning to attend the meeting and raise our issues on the joint platform, since I had earlier decided to come for it and had prepared what to say… so I decided to speak for my state and also on behalf of all our INDIA bloc states who won’t be there.”""They (BJP) have formed government but they don't have people's mandate. This is the first time after BJP came in, since 2014, they have not formed the government as a single party,” she said, adding, that because of their ""compulsions"" the BJP-ruled NDA has brought a ""politically biased budget"" which ""deprives"" all opposition states.""I thought it is my duty to raise this voice at least on a common platform though I know the NITI Aayog has no financial powers. Since the NITI Aayog has been planned, I have not seen any work being done because they don't have any power. At the Planning Commission, I found there was a system, when I attended meeting with officials, as a chief minister,"" she said.""I will raise my voice to scrap NITI Aayog, which has no powers and bring back the Planning Commission,"" Banerjee said, adding that “it was a plan of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, and since Independence, the Planning Commission has contributed a lot for the country,"" she said.","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will attend the Niti Ayog governing council meeting on Saturday.

In a rare instance, the introduction of the bill was defeated with treasury benches voting against it.Introducing the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, Brittas said the legislation sought to ensure the “constitutional responsibility of Governors towards the Council of Ministers in carrying out their functions by confining their roles strictly within the bounds of the constitutional provisions”.The bill proposed preventing governors from assuming chancellorship or any other extra-constitutional roles.When Deputy Chairman Harivansh put the proposal to introduce the bill to voice vote, the treasury bench members objected to it. At this point he allowed Brittas to make a brief remark on the bill. The CPM MP alleged while the Centre has been “harping on cooperative federalism” what is “denting” the federal structure is the role of governors. “What is happening now is that the governors are unleashed against elected govts,” he alleged.Opposing this, BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said Indian Constitution is quasi-federal and the governor is considered to be the representative of the President. He asked if the governor is asked to abide by the advice of the council of ministers then where is the right of the President.After rounds of verbal duels between treasury and opposition benches the proposal was put to vote and was defeated with 56 votes against and 21 votes in favour.Later, there was another face off between the two sides when minister Piyush Goyal flagged a post on X by AAP MP Sanjay Singh, which alleged that BJP lawmakers created ruckus and forced adjournment and this showed how the party is against Dalits, backwards and tribal. Goyal demanded Singh delete the post and seek apology.Amid the allegations and counter allegations, Singh raised the issue of how some treasury members were “threatening” to send him to jail. Taking note of claims of Goyal and Singh, Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar said he will hold discussion with them and give his views.","Kerala MP John Brittas moved to introduce a bill seeking to make governors constitutionally bound by the advice of the council of ministers of states.

For 600 years, from the 13th to the 19th century CE, the Tai-Ahom constructed Moidams, or ""home-for-spirit,"" using natural elements like hills, forests and water to create a sacred geography.",Assam’s Moidams - the mound-burial system of the Ahom dynasty - was inscribed in the Unesco World Heritage List on Friday.
