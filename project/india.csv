Russian Rama to Lankan Sita: All the world's a stage for Ramlila,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russian-rama-to-lankan-sita-all-the-worlds-a-stage-for-ramlila/articleshow/113996287.cms,"Russian Retellings:

Caribbean Chronicles:

Southeast Asian Saga:

Lanka Legends:

In Myanmar, it's ' Thiri Rama ,' in Thailand, ' Ramakien ,' and in Indonesia, ' Kakawin Ramayana .' From Russia to America, the Ramayana has taken on new names and faces, proving that this ancient Indian epic is more than just an exported tradition - it's a cultural remix. And it can just as easily don new costumes on stages worldwide.Baryshnikov Evengii, a 25-year-old theatre artist in Moscow who has been part of Russian Ramlila productions, says the characters of the Ramayana feel very familiar to him.""In the image of Rama, I see echoes of our Russian heroes such as Ilya Muromets, a brave, selfless warrior devoted to his people. Indian mythology and Russian folklore contain similar themes, such as the struggle between good and evil and love for the homeland,"" he says.Few know the Soviet Union held its first stage performance of Ramayana way back in 1960 at Moscow's Children Theatre. Gennady Mikhailovich Pechnikov, a renowned Russian actor, co-directed the Russian adaptation and portrayed Ram, holding this role for 40 years and earning international acclaim. It is said he became a life-long vegetarian to play Ram. After Pechnikov died in 2018, a Russian-Indian friendship society known as Disha has worked to revive cultural ties through performances of the 'Ramayana'. The 'Disha Ramlila' was shown in Ayodhya last year. ""Our productions are not more than 25 minutes long, depicting all episodes from the swayamvar to Ram's return from exile,"" says Rameshwar Singh, founder of Disha, who went from JNU to the Soviet Union in the 1980s to pursue his PhD in Russian but chose to stay, marrying a Russian artist and becoming a citizen.In Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname, the Ramlila remains a culturally and religiously significant event. The tradition was brought to the Caribbean by Indian indentured labour between 1838 and 1917. Indrani Rampersad, a fourth-generation Indian from Trinidad and a scholar of Hindu culture and Ramayana traditions in the indentured diaspora, differentiates between two styles of Ramlila - 'lokadharmi' and 'Natya'. The version performed in Trinidad and other Caribbean countries is primarily in the 'Lila' or lokadharmi style, which is a community-based, open-air form of storytelling rooted in Bhakti traditions incorporating elements of katha, kirtan, and bhajan.""Blacks and Muslims are also characters in some of these Ramlilas. But it is not approached as a drama. It is a sacred space within a sanctified space marked by bamboo fences, almost like a mandir. The audience stands outside the fence. The ritual element is very strong. It is not rich people staging a show for money. There are no tickets,"" explains Rampersad, who contrasts this with the Natya style prevalent in India's urban centres, where Ramlila is performed on proscenium stages. This theatrical style is influenced by British traditions. ""But for the diasporic community in the Caribbean, it is a way to preserve Indian cultural identity, where much like Ram in exile, it helps them to restore dharma (order) in their new lands,"" adds RampersadIn countries like Indonesia and Thailand, performances aren't restricted to Navratri. ""In places like Uluwatu Temple in Bali, the Ramayana is performed every day, drawing tourists from around the world. You won't find this anywhere in India,"" says Cokorda Putra, a lecturer at the Hindu University of Indonesia in Denpasar. Beyond his academic role, Putra is also a trained dancer, known for bringing to life characters such as Kumbhkaran and Ravana. ""I cherish this role of Ravana because it exudes authority and power - qualities that, as ordinary humans, we all aspire to,"" Putra says.The kingdom of Thailand's 'national book' is the Ramakien, a local adaptation of the Ramayana. The country's rulers, from the Chakri dynasty, are traditionally named 'Rama', showing strong cultural links to the ancient tale. The Thai version is a royal court tradition rather than a public festival. ""While the Indian Ramlila emphasises devotion to Rama, in Thailand, the Ramayana story has evolved into a classical form of entertainment, reserved for royal and public ceremonies,"" says Nareerat Phinitthanasarn, a lecturer at Thammasat University and a seasoned performer of Ramakien productions. Thai adaptations of the Ramayana, such as Khon and Lakhon, have long been seen as high art, enjoyed not only for their storytelling but also for their intricately choreographed movements. While Ramlila in India is often male-dominated, with men playing even female characters, Thailand has embraced gender equality in these performances. Female actors, including Phinitthanasarn, take on significant roles, including that of Rama himself.Although Ramlila is rare in Sri Lanka, where the majority of the population is Buddhist, govt-sponsored groups have performed in India. For them, Ravana is a revered figure rather than villain. Performances of the Ramayana often begin by portraying Ravana and his prosperous reign before his sister Surpanakha enters the scene with her bleeding nose. ""More than Sita, I'd much rather play Mandodari, Ravana's queen. Even though she's on stage for just 15 minutes, she's powerful, poised, and artistic. When Sita arrives, Mandodari doesn't lose her cool,"" says Kalpi Jayaratne from Colombo, who often plays 'Seetha'. Sri Lankan performances showcase Kandyan folk styles alongside South Indian dance forms like Bharatanatyam.Across cultures and continents, the performance of the ancient epic proves that it can be a vehicle for building new bridges. Bala Sankuratri, who has helped bring several international Ramlila troupes to India, sums it up: ""It is not just a retelling of a story. It is a cultural force that unites us all.""","In Myanmar, it's'Thiri Rama,' in Thailand,'Ramakien,' and in Indonesia,'Kakawin Ramayana.'

What is a Classical Language and how is it chosen?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-a-classical-language-and-how-is-it-chosen/articleshow/113994193.cms,"How is a language selected for ‘classical’ status?

High antiquity of (its) early texts/recorded history over a period of 1,500-2,000 years.



A body of ancient literature/texts which is considered a heritage by generations of speakers.



Knowledge texts, especially prose texts in addition to poetry, epigraphical and inscriptional evidence.



The 'Classical Language' and literature could be distinct from its current form or could be discontinuous with later forms of its offshoots.



The lder criterion that a language's ""literary tradition be original and not borrowed from another speech community"" has been dropped.

What changes for language after gaining ‘Classical’ status?

Two major annual international awards for scholars of eminence in classical Indian languages.



A Centre of Excellence for Studies in 'Classical Languages' has been established to support advanced research.



University Grants Commission (UGC) is requested to create professional Chairs in central universities to support the study of 'Classical Languages'.

How Marathi, Bengali, Assamese got this status

Is conferring this status also a political tool?

Was Marathi included with eye on Maharashtra polls?

Do such titles create language hierarchies?

The Union Cabinet on Thursday expanded the list of India's 'Classical Languages' to 11 by including Marathi , Pali, Prakrit, Assamese and Bengali in it. Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia were already members of this league. Tamil was the first to get 'classical' status in 2004, while Odia, the sixth, got it in 2014.""Classical Languages serve as a custodian of Bharat's profound and ancient cultural heritage, embodying the essence of each community's historical and cultural milestones,"" Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.The category of 'Classical Languages' was created on Oct 12, 2004, with Tamil being the only entry. In November that year, the ministry of culture created a Linguistic Experts Committee (LEC) under the Sahitya Akademi to examine the eligibility of other possible contenders. Sanskrit was declared a ' Classical Language ' in 2005, Telugu and Kannada in 2008, and Malayalam and Odia in 2013 and 2014, respectively.A govt press release says selection criteria for a 'Classical Language' have been revised twice since 2004, the last time in July this year. These are:The govt promotes the study and preservation of 'Classical Languages'.For example, in 2020, three central universities - Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, New Delhi; Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati; and Sri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth, New Delhi - were established to promote Sanskrit. Likewise, the Central Institute of Classical Tamil was set up to facilitate the translation of ancient Tamil texts, promote research and offer courses for university students and language scholars of Tamil. Centres of excellence for studies in classical Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, and Odia were established under the Central Institute of Indian Languages in Mysuru.States with 'Classical Languages', such as Odisha and Tamil Nadu, are entitled to annual grants for the study, research and promotion of their languages.In July 2013, a committee headed by Prof Rangnath Pathare submitted a report to the Centre. Professor Hari Narke, coordinator of the 10-member committee that gathered evidence to show that Marathi is at least 2,300 years old, said, ""It is a wrong perception that Marathi is an offshoot of Sanskrit or that it is merely 800-1,000 years old."" Narke said the committee submitted 80 pieces of documentary evidence to show that Marathi is an original language.In 2023, the state higher education department of the West Bengal govt established the Institute of Language Studies and Research (ILSR) to advance knowledge in language studies, translation and cultural research. The institute gathered evidence for two years and prepared a draft that was submitted to the Centre. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee wrote to PM Modi in 2024, urging the acceptance of Bengali as a classical language.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma on October 1 said his govt is in ""regular contact"" with Modi and the Centre to recognise Assamese as a 'Classical Language'. On his X handle, Sarma stressed why it should be granted 'Classical Language' status.Conferring 'classical' status on a language has political implications, particularly during the election season. Recognising the cultural heritage of a specific linguistic group allows parties to garner support in regions where language defines identity.Language has long been a significant tool in identity politics. For example, the UPA-led Centre accorded 'Classical Language' status to Tamil after the DMK-led alliance swept the 2004 state elections. DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi offered support to Manmohan Singh's UPA govt on condition that Tamil be granted the status of a 'Classical Language'.Five of the first six 'Classical Languages' - barring Sanskrit - were spoken in South India. This time, the states whose languages have been chosen form a belt from west to east: Maharashtra (Marathi), Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (Pali and Prakrit), West Bengal (Bengali), and Assam (Assamese).The first proposal to include Marathi in the list came from a Congress-led Maharashtra govt in 2013. The decision has come a decade later when BJP and its allies run both the Centre and the state. It's also timed very close to the state elections. Political observers say this decision can be used to seek votes in the name of Marathi asmita (Marathi pride).Rating languages can give rise to the perception that some languages are more prestigious or culturally significant than others, especially in a multilingual country like India. The Marathi versus non-Marathi political narrative in Maharashtra that has fuelled several elections is a classic case of language hierarchy in the state. Sentiments against Hindi and Gujarati are reinforced during the elections. Even down south, leaders of political parties in Tamil Nadu, including the late M Karunanidhi, criticised the Union govt's attempts to promote Sanskrit in schools by mandating the three-language formula.","The Union Cabinet on Thursday expanded the list of India's 'Classical Languages' to 11. Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia were already members of this league. Tamil was the first to get 'classical' status in 2004, while Odia got it in 2014.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113994229,imgsize-1257286,width-400,resizemode-4/113994229.jpg"

The special college council has now pronounced stringent punishment against 59 perpetrators on finding substantial proof of some of the charges.The students, barring six, have been barred from the campus for six months to one year depending on the nature of their misconduct.Six were let go with a warning. The council has categorised the 59 - 36 junior doctors and 23 students - against whom the probe was conducted, into three groups depending on the severity of misconduct.Students and junior doctors said reign of terror by the group began after Sandip Ghosh took charge as principal in 2021. While the name of house staff Asish Pandey appeared several times as far as threat culture is concerned, sources alleged that Sourav Paul, a senior resident at the radiotherapy department, was the one who would pull the strings.While Pandey is in CBI custody, Paul is also under scanner. Both are among the 10 who have been handed over the most stringent actions by the council. Expelled from the college and hostel, their names will also be forwarded to West Bengal Medical Council for re-evaluation of their registration. ""They not only decided who will get good marks and who will fail but also took bribes from juniors against seats for internships or house staff,"" an intern said.Ten of the 59 interns, house staff and senior residents of the hospital, who were charged on multiple counts, were expelled from the institute till further notice by the special college council, which held a meeting on Saturday.They were charged with threatening students, physical and mental torture, verbal abuse, sexual harassment, buying drugs and alcohol and performing obscene acts at the boys' hostel, among other offences.Names of those expelled have also been sent to West Bengal Medical Council for evaluation of their medical registration certificates.","Students and junior doctors said reign of terror by the group began after Sandip Ghosh took charge as principal in 2021.

About 15 lakh spectators turned up for the event, according to estimates, marking a record for an airshow.After the airshow ended, a large crowd attempted to leave all at once, creating a stampede-like situation.Exit points became congested, with people stuck for more than 40 minutes under the scorching sun. Desperate to escape, some attendees broke through barricades, and children suffered minor injuries in the chaos.Ambulances were trapped in the crowd for over 30 minutes, delaying the transport of the affected people to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) and Omandurar Government Hospital. Although around 50 ambulances were deployed, with 20 stationed along the beach road, navigating through the dense crowd proved challenging.Among the deceased was D John, 56, from Korukkupet, who attended the event with his wife, Elisamma, and brother-in-law, Shamkumar. After watching the show near Parthasarathy Temple Arch on Kamarajar Road, he collapsed around 3pm. An ambulance struggled to reach him through the crowd, but he was declared dead on arrival at Omandurar Hospital.Karthikeyan, 34, from Thiruvottiyur, experienced chest pain while riding his bike after leaving the event.

NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur 's experience helped secure a six-wicket victory for India against Pakistan in the Women's T20 World Cup, keeping their semi-final hopes alive on Sunday. Chasing a modest target of 106 runs, India struggled but managed to clinch the win thanks to Harmanpreet's 24-ball 29-run innings. She retired hurt with two runs needed to win, and Sajana Sajeevan, on her debut, sealed the victory with a boundary.Opener Shafali Verma (32 off 35 balls) and No.3 Jemimah Rodrigues (23 off 28 balls) adopted a cautious approach, affecting India's Net Run Rate (NRR) negatively.India's current NRR stands at -1.217, below Pakistan's -0.555. To keep semi-final hopes alive, India must win against Australia and Sri Lanka by significant margins.The Indian innings included only five boundaries, and the top three batters struggled to accelerate. With Smriti Mandhana out early, Shafali and Jemimah focused on singles.The heat impacted the running between the wickets, with easy doubles and triples left unattempted. Shafali's fitness issues and Jemimah's reliance on timing over power added pressure on the batting unit.Harmanpreet took charge after the dismissal of Jemimah and Richa Ghosh off consecutive deliveries by Fatima.Earlier, Indian bowlers contained Pakistan to 105 for 8. Renuka Singh Thakur (1/23) and Arundhati Reddy (3/19) maintained discipline in their line and length. Off-spinners Deepti Sharma (1/24) and Shreyanka Patil (2/12) focused on varying their pace.Leg-spinner Asha Sobhana (1/24) took the wicket of Pakistan skipper Fatima, thanks to a sharp catch by Richa Ghosh.India restricted Pakistan to 29 for 2 in the powerplay. Nida Dar's 28 runs provided some resistance but were insufficient to post a challenging total. Indian bowlers delivered 58 dot balls, reflecting their control over the game.India now needs to capitalize on this win and maintain momentum in their upcoming matches to advance to the semi-finals.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets to keep semi-final hopes alive.

exclusive interview

Excerpts:

This is your first official bilateral visit to India since you assumed office last year in November. After being on a roller coaster for the past 10 months, the relationship seems to have stabilised and things are looking up. What would you attribute this turnaround to?

What are the big takeaways you are looking at from this visit? Apart from the continued developmental support, is there any specific assistance you are expecting from India to tide over the current financial situation?

With the expulsion of Indian military personnel, you managed to have your way on a sensitive issue, fulfilling also one of your campaign promises. Are you looking to set limits on defence cooperation with India, given that some other agreements signed during your predecessor’s term are also said to be under review? What sort of role do you see India playing in boosting your defence capabilities and in ensuring peace, security and stability in this part of the Indo-Pacific?

During EAM Jaishankar’s visit, several new projects and initiatives were announced which, as you said, will boost local economy and contribute to the Maldives’ prosperity. You have acknowledged the restructuring of line of credit arrangement too. Are you satisfied with the progress in executing some of the big-ticket projects like the Greater Male Connectivity Project?

China continues to be the elephant in the room as far as India’s ties with Maldives are concerned. You are looking to expand your defence cooperation with China, while also boosting trade and investment ties. As you work with the Chinese, can India be sure that the Maldives won’t do anything that might undermine India’s security interests?

The Maldives will soon be implementing the FTA signed with China in 2017. What do you make of concerns that it might undermine Maldives’ economic sovereignty, given the considerable trade imbalance?

Not long ago, many people saw you also as one of the architects of the India Out campaign. Going by recent developments in the relationship, and the prevailing air of positivity, would you say we are seeing the return of what used to be known as Maldives’ India First policy? Or you think it’s important for the Maldives to reduce its dependence on India, despite the geographical proximity?

As the dramatic improvement in India-Maldives ties in recent months culminated in President Mohamed Muizzu’s first state visit to India that started Sunday, the president toldin anthat the Maldives would never do anything that undermines the security of India.Before his meeting with PM Narendra Modi on Monday, and amid concerns here over the strategically located neighbour’s growing ties with China, Muizzu said that while Male continues to enhance cooperation with other countries in various sectors, it remains committed to ensuring that its actions do not compromise the security and stability of the region.Muizzu said India is a valued partner and friend of the Maldives, and the relationship is built on mutual respect and shared interests. He also said the Maldives will continue to pursue strong and strategic ties with India and work jointly to ensure regional stability.While following a Maldives First policy , the president added, his country will continue to prioritise its longstanding and trusted relationship with India. “We are confident that our engagements with other nations will not undermine India’s security interests,” said the president, adding Maldives will continue to pursue strong and strategic relations with India.Maldives and India now have a better understanding of each other’s concerns and defence cooperation between them will always be a priority, said the president. He justified the expulsion of Indian troops though saying it reflected the will of the local people.Muizzu said recent developments reflect a positive trajectory in bilateral relations and it will be clear by the end of his maiden state visit that Male is committed to fostering a cooperative and mutually beneficial partnership.This is my first State Visit to India, and I am very happy to be making it, in my first year in office. I thank President of India, Her Excellency Droupadi Murmu and the Government for the kind invitation. As you know, I have already undertaken a visit to India, for the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister His Excellency Narendra Modi in June this year. I have also had the pleasure, soon after my inauguration in November, to meet the Prime Minister on the sidelines of COP28. You can agree, that’s far from being a roller coaster ride. This historic relationship is intertwined like the roots of a tree, built on centuries of exchanges and values shared. We have been working on preparing for this visit for a while and have come to mutual understanding and a convenient time. The relations between the Maldives and India have always been strong, and I am confident this visit will further strengthen it.As this is my first State Visit to India, I hope this demonstrates the commitment that both Governments have towards enhancing the relationship, and work towards a shared vision for development. India continues to be one of our largest trade and development partners. And I am confident that this will be a very successful trip. I am sure you will find those out soon enough, as the visit is just around the corner.As I said just now, India is one of our biggest development partners, and defence cooperation will always be a priority. In these globally challenging times, with regional wars threatening the security of all countries, it is vital to foster these collaborations, especially the security of Indian Ocean Region. And I can confidently say, Maldives and India now have a better understanding of each other’s priorities and concerns. What I did is what the people of Maldives asked from me. The recent changes reflect our efforts to address domestic priorities. Our review of past agreements is aimed at ensuring they align with our national interests and contribute positively to regional stability. As the world’s largest democracy, I believe that the people and Government of India, understand it.We are very happy with our relations with India, and it will only grow from strength to strength, especially following this visit. Greater Male’ connectivity project is one major project between our countries. We are pleased with the progress made on several key projects and initiatives announced during External Affairs Minister Jaishankar’s visit. These projects are vital for boosting our local economy and contributing to the Maldives’ prosperity. The line of credit arrangement has been a positive step, facilitating smoother execution of these projects. While there is always room for improvement, we are confident that with continued collaboration and support, significant advancements will be achieved, particularly with major projects like the Greater Male Connectivity Project.Maldives would never do anything that undermines the security of India. India is a valued partner and friend of the Maldives, and our relationship is built on mutual respect and shared interests. While we enhance our cooperation with other countries in various sectors, we remain committed to ensuring that our actions do not compromise the security and stability of our region. The Maldives will continue to prioritize its longstanding and trusted relationship with India, and we are confident that our engagements with other nations will not undermine India’s security interests.The Maldives values its economic partnerships and is committed to fostering growth and development through diverse international collaborations. We are mindful of maintaining our economic sovereignty and ensuring that our trade policies benefit the Maldivian people. We will continue to engage in transparent and balanced trade practices to address any concerns and uphold the economic interests of our nation.The Maldives values its relationship with India and acknowledges the importance of our geographical proximity and historical ties. Recent developments reflect a positive trajectory in our bilateral relations, and we are committed to fostering a cooperative and mutually beneficial partnership. I believe at the end of this trip it will be clear to all. While it is essential for the Maldives to diversify its international relations and reduce over-dependence on any single country, we remain dedicated to maintaining a strong and strategic partnership with India, ensuring that our policies serve the best interests of our nation and contribute to regional stability. In my inaugural speech in November 2017, I made it very clear. My policy is ‘Maldives First’ policy. For me, Maldives will always come first. But respect for our neighbors and friends is embedded in our DNA. Indians have always been welcome in the Maldives, Indians continue to prosper in the Maldives, and be safe and happy. Indians’ make a positive contribution to the Maldivian society. Indian tourists are welcome in the Maldives. And we look forward to enhancing this important characteristic of our partnership – people to people connections.",Maldives and India now have a better understanding of each other’s concerns and defence cooperation between them will always be a priority. Muizzu said the Maldives will continue to pursue strong and strategic ties with India. He justified the expulsion of Indian troops though saying it reflected the will of the local people.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113989337,imgsize-141212,width-400,resizemode-4/113989337.jpg"

Kamptee Road Flyover: Asia's Longest Double-Decker Flyover Inaugurated in Nagpur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/asias-longest-double-decker-flyover-inaugurated-in-nagpur/articleshow/113972502.cms,"Union minister Nitin Gadkari inaugurated Asia's longest double-decker flyover on Saturday, which also features the continent's first four-tier structure.

NAGPUR: In a groundbreaking moment for infrastructure, Union minister Nitin Gadkari inaugurated Asia's longest double-decker flyover on Saturday, which also features the continent's first four-tier structure. The engineering marvel near Gaddigodam Gurudwara on National Highway, integrates four different levels of transit, with a Metro line at the top, followed by a flyover, a railway track beneath it, and finally, a road at the base at a single location.The 5.6km double-decker Kamptee Road flyover from LIC Square to Automotive Square, constructed by MahaMetro and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) at a cost of Rs573 crore, now surpasses the earlier record held by Nagpur's 3.14km Wardha Road flyover.Both projects set benchmarks for double-decker flyover construction, but this latest achievement breaks new ground with its innovative four-tier configuration.Initiated in 2019, the project faced multiple challenges, including acquisition of private properties in the bustling Sadar area. Despite these obstacles, the flyover was completed, marking a significant milestone in urban transportation.Speaking at the inauguration, Gadkari highlighted the potential of adopting ultra-reinforced concrete technology, which is widely used in Singapore and Malaysia, for upcoming infrastructure projects. ""I have proposed this technology to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has given me the responsibility of using it in Parliament's Vista as well as in future Metro projects, which could reduce construction costs by 20%,"" he said.The flyover promises to drastically cut travel time, allowing motorists to cover 20km (Kamptee to Nagpur airport) in just 20 minutes. Gadkari also mentioned the demand from Sadar residents for a dedicated entry to the flyover, with MahaMetro already working on a design. Additionally, the road beneath the flyover leading to Kamptee is slated for concrete reconstruction, funded by the Central Road Fund (CRF).Gadkari praised MahaMetro, NHAI, and local officials, including collector Vipin Itankar and municipal commissioner Abhijeet Chaudhari, for their efforts in completing this ambitious project. He emphasized that NHAI has invested between Rs1,300 crore and Rs1,400 crore in Nagpur's three major flyovers – Kamptee Road, Wardha Road, and Pardi.The minister also lauded Nagpur Metro for setting a new benchmark in Metro construction, achieving costs of Rs350cr/kilometre, which is significantly lower than those in other Indian cities. Gadkari further announced plans for redeveloping Gaddigodam Market to facilitate smoother traffic flow in the area.This flyover stands as a testament to modern engineering, blending innovation and functionality to address the growing needs of urban transit.","The 5.6km double-decker Kamptee Road flyover from LIC Square to Automotive Square, constructed by MahaMetro and National Highway Authority of India at a cost of Rs573 crore.

However, he claimed that under BJP rule, this harmony is being threatened.Gandhi alleged that the BJP is deliberately stoking communal tensions, with a former RSS leader provoking Christians and Sangh organisations to call for an economic boycott of Muslims.He further said that similar actions by the Sangh Parivar continue across India with impunity, backed by support from the highest levels.The response from the Congress leader comes after a controversy erupted over ex-RSS chief Velingkar allegedly called for a “DNA test” of the relics of St. Francis Xavier. Subsequently, his comments have fueled widespread anger within the Christian community in the state, prompting numerous complaints and protests.""Unfortunately, under BJP rule, this harmony is under attack. The BJP is deliberately stoking communal tensions, with a former RSS leader provoking Christians and Sangh organisations calling for an economic boycott of Muslims,"" Gandhi said in a post on X.""In Goa, the BJP's strategy is clear: divide the people while exploiting ecologically sensitive areas by illegally converting green land and bypassing environmental regulations - an assault on Goa's natural and social heritage,"" he added.He asserted that the BJP's attempts will not go unchallenged, as the people of Goa and the whole of India see through this divisive agenda and are standing united.""BJP’s attempts will not go unchallenged.

What's on the agenda

Improving ties



NEW DELHI: Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.As per media reports in the Maldives , Muizzu, his wife Sajidha Mohamed, and a high-level delegation of Maldivian government officials traveled on a special flight arranged by the Indian government, a gesture reserved for such visits by Maldivian presidents.Muizzu will receive an official welcome on Monday.During his visit from October 6-10, Muizzu will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi , external affairs minister S Jaishankar and other top ministers to discuss various bilateral, regional, and international issues.The president's upcoming discussions are expected to lead to several agreements that could enhance bilateral cooperation.Muizzu has been criticised for pivoting his island nation sharply towards China, and eyebrows were raised in New Delhi after he decided to break tradition by not making India his first foreign visit after taking office in November last year. Instead, he initially visited Turkey and China - a significant diplomatic shift, particularly given that his administration has been perceived as pro-China and has previously campaigned on an ""India Out"" platform.This change in approach had raised concerns about the future of India-Maldives relations, which had become strained following Muizzu's election.However, ties between the two countries have been warming up with Muizzu publicly acknowledging India's importance, referring to it as ""one of the closest allies and invaluable partners"" of the Maldives. The Maldivian president's acknowledgment of India's role in providing aid during times of need also indicates a willingness to move past contentious rhetoric towards constructive engagement.This shift could pave the way for a more balanced approach that respects Maldivian sovereignty while recognising India's strategic interests in the region.Geopolitically, the Maldives is crucial for India's 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) initiative and its 'Neighbourhood First Policy'. The Maldives serves as a key maritime neighbor in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), making it strategically significant for India's national security interests.The president met EAM Jaishankar on Sunday evening shortly after landing in New Delhi.""Pleased to call on President Muizzu today at the start of his State Visit to India. Appreciate his commitment to enhance 🇮🇳 🇲🇻 relationship. Confident that his talks with PM Modi on Monday will give a new impetus to our friendly ties,"" the external affairs minister posted on X.Official talks and signing of agreements with Indian leadership are scheduled for Monday.President Muizzu will also meet with the Maldivian community living in India, on Sunday.He will also engage in business events in Mumbai and Bengaluru, highlighting the importance of economic ties between the two nations.The delegation accompanying president Muizzu includes foreign minister Dr Abdullah Khaleel, defense minister Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon, minister of homeland security and technology Ali Ihusaan, finance minister Moosa Zameer, health minister Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim, and economic development minister Mohamed Saeed.Other key officials joining the visit are attorney general Ahmed Usham, tourism minister Ibrahim Faisal, transport & civil aviation minister Mohamed Ameen, construction & infrastructure minister Dr Abdulla Muththalib, and chief of staff at the President's Office Abdulla Fayaz, alongside several senior officials.Muizzu last visited India in June to attend the swearing in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During the visit, the two leaders met and discussed strengthening bilateral relations between Maldives and India.The two leaders also met on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai in December last year.Relations between the two countries had deteriorated after two Maldivian deputy ministers made defamatory comments about PM Modi and India on social media, amid ongoing discussions about the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the Maldives.The two officials, Malsha Shareef and Mariyam Shiuna were suspended from their roles in the Ministry of Youth and later resigned on September 10 this year.Withdrawal of Indian military personnel was a key pledge of President Muizzu, and the transition was carried out peacefully, with civilians replacing Indian troops as per the agreement between the two governments.Muizzu's administration has since appeared committed to mending relations with India.","Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.

On Saturday, villagers of Mahismari in South 24 Parganas' Joynagar had clashed with cops and gone on a rampage after the girl's battered body was found in a ditch near her home. Cops arrested Mostakin Sardar, 19, of the village, on charges of murdering the Class 4 student. The girl had been missing since Friday when she left home for tuition.Justice Ghosh questioned the police's contention that it could not add sections of Pocso Act before postmortem report was ready, saying inquest findings were enough for it.He directed the cops to add Pocso sections and produce the accused before a Pocso court, not regular courts. The cops had moved HC for an urgent hearing to remove legal roadblocks to the postmortem.Acceding to demands of the victim's kin, police had moved a lower court, seeking presence of a magistrate during postmortem, but the plea was turned down. The parents also wanted the postmortem in a central facility. The state told the HC that it had no problem.He then ordered the postmortem at AIIMS Kalyani and asked police to hand over the body by 11.45am Monday.The judge said if AIIMS had the infrastructure, it could conduct the postmortem within its premises; otherwise, it could do so at the nearby state-run JNM Hospital Kalyani. If the procedure is carried out at the latter hospital, only AIIMs doctors would perform it, the judge directed. HC also asked ACJM of Baruipur, South 24 Parganas, to ""monitor"" the autopsy.(With inputs from Tamaghna Banerjee in Kolkata)","Justice Tirthankar Ghosh made the observations during an emergency Sunday hearing.

This, officials said, is ""almost taking a U-turn"" on what govt had approved in Dec 2019 as part of its efforts to end departmentalism within the railway bureaucracy.The latest move comes after the railways struggled to get enough fresh technical manpower through Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS) over the last two years.Railways has now sought to recruit 225 engineers through Civil Services Examination ( CSE ) 2025 for which applications will be invited.On Saturday, Centre's department of personnel and trainning (DoPT) approved ""in-principle"" the proposal to hire via CSE and Engineering Services Examination (ESE) ""considering the unique requirement of both technical and non-technical manpower"" in the ministry. DoPT decided on the issue within two days of railways sending the proposal on Thursday.Under IRMS, there was one exam and the eligibility criteria was the same for all applicants from both technical and non-technical backgrounds.Within hours of the go ahead, railways wrote to UPSC and department of telecom (DoT), mentioning that the latter being the nodal agency for ESE has notified the rules and has sought applications by Tuesday. It requested DoT and UPSC to include indent for 225 railway engineers by adding to existing notification and to extend the deadline for submission of applications.The new recruits will be called IRMS (Civil), IRMS (Mechanical), IRMS (Electrical), IRMS (S&T) and IRMS (Stores). Earlier the prefix for these services was Indian Railway.""The fresh move is nothing but going back to the old days. IRMS in railways is not working considering the functional requirement of manpower. Can a student with a history background be tasked to deal with laying of tracks? Govt has realised that the highly technical organisation can't function with generalists. This is good for railways,"" said a senior official.While giving a green light to the proposal, DoPT said, ""The proposed scheme of recruitment shall not in any way, be in contravention to the decisions of cabinet Dec 24, 2019 (read merger of services to IRMS).""Sources said considering this, the railways has not abandoned IRMS and has instead created different disciplines under it, such as civil, mechanical, and electrical.","Railways has now sought to recruit 225 engineers through Civil Services Examination ( CSE ) 2025 for which applications will be invited.

The commission is the apex body that decides on space missions.Unlike missions Chandrayaan 1 to 4, this will be jointly implemented by India and Japan but is part of India's lunar series that eventually aims to send an Indian to the Moon and bring her/him back.The Union cabinet cleared Chandrayaan-4 on Sept 18, and Lupex will be put up for cabinet clearance soon.""We wanted some more approvals (from cabinet) to happen. Possibly, in the coming days, they will also get approved... We must have a series of Chandrayaan missions which will build up the capability from the current level to the one which will actually send humans to land on the Moon and bring them back,"" Isro chairman S Somanath told TOI in an exclusive interview.The Lupex mission is aimed at exploring the Moon for water and other resources and gaining expertise in exploring its surface.Although Isro and Japanese space agency Jaxa signed an agreement in 2017, one of the challenges that prevented work on Lupex after India's Chandrayaan-2 mission was the inability to demonstrate soft-landing of the lander on the lunar surface.",Lunar Polar Exploration Mission or Lupex will be jointly implemented by India and Japan.

But when they are not, countries, as companies do, start doing things on their own. So, what you have today is a UN, at the end of the day, however suboptimal it is in its functioning, it is the only multilateral game in town. When it doesn't step up on key issues, countries figure out their own ways of doing it,"" he said at the Kautilya Economic Conclave.He cited the example of Covid, arguing that the UN did not fully lead the international response to the pandemic, and also conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia to make his point.""Where is UN on them? Essentially a bystander. What is happening.""He pointed to the emergence of Quad to deal with challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, the India-Middle East Europe Economic Corridor for connectivity, and bodies like the International Solar Alliance as organisations that had come up outside the UN system to tackle specific problems.""UN will continue, but increasingly there is the non-UN space which is the active space and it's telling on the UN,"" the external affairs minister said.For several years, India has been seeking reforms of multilateral bodies, including the UN, to reflect the new global order, with the external affairs minister earlier this year suggesting that the five permanent members of the UN Security Council were ""short-sighted"" in their approach and were holding up the revamp.At the event, the minister also said several of the trends seen in the US will intensify irrespective of the outcome of next month's US presidential elections, as America had made a shift in its economic outlook and geopolitically.""Look back over the last five years, how many of the policies which in 2020 people thought were the Trump administration's policies actually not just carried over by Biden but they doubled down on those policies... there are very deep shifts happening... America which actually has made a shift, geopolitically and in its economic outlook, and has come to the conclusion that the order which it devised many years ago no longer works to its benefit to that degree,"" he said.Asked about his upcoming visit to Pakistan to attend a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, Jaishankar once again ruled out the possibility of any bilateral dialogue with Pakistan.""I am going there for a certain job, a certain responsibility. And, I take my responsibilities seriously. So, I am going there to represent India at the SCO meeting, and that is what I am going to do,"" he said.","S Jaishankar: UN is like an old company, not keeping up with the market, but occupying the space.

IAF quietly shooting down 'Chinese spy balloons' at high altitudes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-quietly-shooting-down-chinese-spy-balloons-at-high-altitudes/articleshow/113993660.cms,"NEW DELHI: The IAF has quietly been practising shooting targets mimicking Chinese spy balloons at very high-altitudes, with the latest instance being of an omni-role Rafale fighter jet using an air-to-air missile to bring down such a target in the eastern sector a few months ago.The IAF began drawing up contingency plans for such an eventuality after a 200-foot-tall intelligence-gathering Chinese balloon flew over continental US for several days in Jan-Feb 2023 before it was finally shot down by an American F-22 Raptor using an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile.The US had shared information with India and other countries about the incident.""The IAF formulated TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures) to handle such contingencies. It has been practising the capability to interject in such situations at different flight envelopes,"" a source told TOI.""Rafale's demonstration was at an altitude of over 55,000 feet, way over what had been practised earlier. The target balloon, with a payload, was relatively smaller than the Chinese one that violated US airspace,"" he added.The fifth-generation F-22 flying at an altitude of 58,000 feet, had launched the missile to hit the balloon at an altitude of well over 60,000 feet on Feb 4 last year.The IAF's 4.5-generation Rafale, which are armed with the 120-150-km range 'Meteor' and 70-km MICA air-to-air missiles among other weapons, in turn, went after the target that was flying at an altitude of over 55,000 feet.Chinese spy balloons, which are akin to huge unmanned airships and capable of sending ""burst transmissions"", are difficult to detect and intercept since they have low radar cross-sections and fly at very high altitudes.In early-2022, a high-altitude balloon-like object was spotted over the strategically located Andaman and Nicobar islands but nothing much could be done because India as yet does not deploy fighters on the archipelago on a permanent basis, though IAF fighters do operate from the islands on short-term detachments for exercises.China, of course, also regularly deploys its 'spy' vessels in the Bay of Bengal and southern India Ocean to track India's ballistic missile launches as well as map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.The IAF has based its 36 Rafales at the Hasimara and Ambala airbases. Hasimara is close to the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction and the strategically-vulnerable Siliguri Corridor on the eastern front with China.",The IAF began drawing up contingency plans for such an eventuality after a 200-foot-tall intelligence-gathering Chinese balloon flew over continental US for several days in Jan-Feb 2023.

Why Yamuna is stinking like never before?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-yamuna-is-stinking-like-never-before/articleshow/113993459.cms,"NEW DELHI: Fecal levels, indicating untreated sewage and high levels of pollution in Yamuna, reached an all-time high in Sept. This occurred even as dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand, slightly improved, thanks to the surplus rain in Aug.However, even the Aug rain couldn't boost fecal coliform level, which, at its peak, was a staggering 4,900,000 MPN (most probable number)/100 ml.This is 1,959 times higher than the standard of 2,500 units and 9,800 times the desired limit of 500 units. This was the worst pollution in the river, in terms of fecal coliform, since Feb 2022, when the fecal level at Agra Canal (one of the stations at the river stretch in the city) had reached 6,300,000 units.The fecal level in the river was assessed by Delhi Pollution Control Committee for Sept, a report of which was released on Oct 4, with samples collected on Sept 4. The report comes at a time when certain stretches of the river are already showing heavy frothing, a visible proof of pollution when mixed pollutants like surfactants and phosphates are churned out to reveal their presence. DPCC doesn't test these parameters.Due to the surplus monsoon, which retreated on Oct 2 this year, Yamuna managed to have a good flow as additional water was released from upstream. This, however, improved the status of dissolved oxygen, which depicts the presence of life in the river, or potential, throughout its stretch. As per standards, BOD must not exceed 5 mg/l, and DO must not go below 5 mg/l, which is the standard for outdoor bathing. While BOD depicts the capacity of water to clean itself, as it is the amount of oxygen required for water to treat organic matter in it, fecal coliform represents the presence of untreated sewage in the water.According to the report, at its entry at Palla, the DO level was 8 mg/l, while the BOD was 3 mg/l, and the fecal level was 1,600 units-all within the standards. However, as the river traversed further, the pollution load increased. By the time the river reached Wazirabad, DO and FC were within standards; however, BOD had already breached the mark. As the river reached Nizamuddin, FC reached 1,100,000 units, worsening further to 3,500,000 units at Okhla, 1,100,000 units at Agra Canal, and 4,900,000 units at the city's exit after the confluence of Shahdara and Tughlakabad drains.","Fecal coliform level at its peak was 4,900,000 MPN (most probable number)/100 ml.
