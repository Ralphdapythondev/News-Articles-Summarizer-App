Three Indians accused of killing Khalistan separatist Nijjar appear before Canadian court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-indians-accused-of-killing-khalistan-separatist-nijjar-appear-before-canadian-court/articleshow/109932481.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Three Indian nationals , Karan Brar, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karanpreet Singh, appeared before a Canadian court via video on Tuesday to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year. The suspects, believed to be part of an alleged hit squad, were arrested in Edmonton on Friday.The court proceedings took place at the Surrey Provincial Court in British Columbia, with hundreds of local Khalistan supporters gathering both inside and outside the courthouse.The accused agreed to have the proceedings conducted in English and acknowledged their understanding of the charges against them.The indictments allege that the conspiracy to murder Nijjar unfolded in Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the date of his killing on June 18, 2023. The alleged hitmen had entered Canada over the past five years and were suspected of involvement in drug trafficking and violence.India has rejected recent comments by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar, saying that they illustrate the political space given to separatism, extremism, and violence in Canada. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long been a source of frustration for India, which had designated Nijjar a ""terrorist.""External affairs minister S Jaishankar attributed the current situation in Canada to their internal politics and vote bank considerations, with some parties relying on pro-Khalistan leaders for support.“Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As elections are coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics,” the minister said.He emphasized that India has repeatedly urged Canada not to provide visas, legitimacy, or political space to such individuals, as it causes problems for both countries and their relationship.","Three Indian nationals appeared before a Canadian court via video on Tuesday.

Now that three rounds are over, what are the prospects in UP? Will the tally increase?

Was there not a strategic failure on the part of BJP that led to the protest over candidate selection? Thakurs and several other castes are said to be unhappy.

There has been an earlier strategy of BJP to replace candidates to neutralise their anti-incumbency. This was not seen this time.

Congress is using BJP’s ‘400 paar’ slogan to build up this narrative that the overwhelming

majority would be used to change the Constitution.

Rahul Gandhi has gone to Rae Bareli from Amethi. What is your take?

It’s said that govt isn’t thinking about the middle class.

Opposition parties allege that after a poor show in two rounds of voting, BJP leaders are making the poll discourse communal.

Has the low turnout affected BJP, as people say mostly BJP voters do not come out?

What are the prospects of BJP in the southern states, especially Tamil Nadu and Kerala?

Should the country expect one nation, one election by 2029?

They are happy that the country’s stature has risen and its respect has increased internationally. Social welfare schemes have reached the people at the grassroots level with full honesty. The leakage and pilferages in the beneficiary schemes which was common earlier has completely ended. People are happy with all this.■ Pakka badhenge (Will rise for sure). Koi duvidha nahin hai (There is no ambiguity).■ This is all cooked up narrative. Sometimes it’s said Thakurs are unhappy, sometimes it’s Brahimns. There is nothing like this. Ek do logon ke naraz hone se qaum khilaf nahin hoti hai (Anger of a couple of people doesn’t reflect the sentiment of the entire community).■ Tickets are given only after assessing things on the ground. There might be some anger over some selections, but people have this common goal that the country should move forward.■ It’s not just a slogan. They (Congress) are not able to digest our firm march towards a 400-plus goal. Since Cong doesn’t have any issue, it’s making issues out of nothing.■ He should not have left the battleground. What do you call a person who flees the battleground?■ The govt is thinking about the welfare of the entire country. No section of the society will remain un touched. Development of every section will be done irrespective of caste, creed, or religion. Unless and until all are not developed, our dream of ‘Viksit Bharat’ will not be realised.■ We will definitely increase our tally in the first two rounds and there is no question of BJP turning the discourse communal. The beneficiary schemes which have reached to the grassroots level have not been done based on caste, creed, or religion.■ Hot weather is one reason. If there is lack of excitement it is mostly in the voters of the opposition. Supporters of opposition parties are hopeless. It’s because they have not been able to make a strong alliance as they had expected.■ I have travelled both in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The party is sure to get seats in both the states. We are getting more seats even in Andhra and Telangana.This remains our commitment.■ These allegations are baseless. Opposition parties should desist from making such comments on the issues of border security and Army martyrs.■ Yes. I made similar statements around two years ago as well.■ Let him react.

Why everyone is talking about Pandian in Odisha,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-everyone-is-talking-about-pandian-in-odisha/articleshow/109931583.cms,"BHUBANESWAR: All of a sudden, the elections in Odisha seem to be revolving around VK Pandian , a Tamil Nadu-born former IAS officer of the Odisha cadre, who quit the service to join BJD and is now the party’s key campaigner and strategist. He is also being seen as CM Naveen Patnaik ’s political successor.Pandian has become the prime target of opposition leaders, right from PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda to Congress’s Rahul Gandhi.Questions are being raised on how a non-Odia may take over the state’s reins if BJD returns to office. How Odia “asmita” (self-respect)” is in danger in a state formed on the basis of its language.In BJD, Pandian is among 40-star campaigners whose names figure in the list after Naveen. Flanked by party candidates, he occupies centre stage everywhere, even in meetings attended by Naveen.After joining the CM’s office as Naveen’s private secretary in 2011, Pandian’s efficiency caught the attention of Naveen. Soon enough, he was picked to be a ‘backroom boy’ to devise Naveen’s poll strategy for the 2014 and 2019 elections.Local BJP and Congress leaders had been raising the issue of extra-constitutional powers Pandian appeared to enjoy when he was the CM’s secretary till October last year. But as the 50-year-old took voluntary retirement and joined BJD, the “outsider” tag became the key talking point.But Pandian is unflappable. “I am an Indian by birth and Odia by breath. The mother tongue of my children is Odia and Odisha is my karmabhoomi (land where one works),” he said.On the issue of succeeding Naveen, Pandian said he considers himself a successor to Naveen’s values of impeccable integrity, absolute commitment to the people of Odisha and his hard work. He added that Naveen has always said the people of Odisha will decide his successor.Pandian, a 2000-batch IAS officer, was initially allotted the Punjab cadre. But barely a few months into his training, he got it changed to Odisha after marrying Sujata Rout, now Sujata R Karthikeyan, another IAS officer of the 2000-batch Odisha cadre. Sujata is from a village in Odisha’s Kendrapada district. On an Election Commission directive, she was recently transferred to a non-election related, non-public dealing post in the state finance department for alleged violation of poll code.Like his “guru” Naveen, who wears loose-fitting white kurta-pyjama and slippers when in public, Pandian is invariably seen in an untucked full-sleeve white shirt, and predominantly grey trousers at all his meetings.When alliance talks between BJP and BJD were going on in March, Pandian was the main negotiator for BJD, making several trips to Delhi.On Pandian’s rise, BJP’s Odisha face and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said it is not about a specific individual, but rather the subversion of established processes under Naveen’s leadership. “Democratic principles have been undermined and Odisha’s dignity disregarded. Mandate given to Naveen and BJD has been sidelined by the transfer of power to an unelected official,” he said.Cashing in on “Odia asmita,” BJP is hoping to have its first govt in Odisha and increase its 2019 Lok Sabha tally of 8 seats. In the last election, BJD had won 12 LS seats and Congress one. In the assembly polls, BJD had got 113 seats, BJP 23, Congress 9 and others 2.Leaving it to the people of Odisha to judge if he is an outsider, Pandian said BJP has no right to talk about Odia ‘asmita’, pointing out how a deserving Biju Patnaik – in fact, none from Odisha – was found suitable for a Bharat Ratna, while Odisha’s Paika revolt of 1817 was not given due recognition by BJP govt.Speculation is rife that Naveen, who has been contesting from two assembly seats — Hinjili and Kantabanji — may vacate one for Pandian.Political analysts feel Naveen (77), who is seeking a sixth term, has taken a calculated risk by elevating Pandian from the role of a backroom boy to a star campaigner. “If BJD does well, Pandian will get legitimacy and grow in stature. If it falters, the blame will fall on him because Naveen has never lost elections since he became CM for first time in 2000,” said Surya Nayaran Mishra, a retired professor of political science from Utkal University.“It’s a test case for electoral politics in Odisha as nothing similar has happened in the past,” said RK Satapathy, another retired professor of political science at North-Eastern Hill University. “If BJD does well, Naveen will make history by becoming the longest-serving CM within a few months. Pandian’s acceptability will also increase. For a large section of voters, content with freebies, who is at the helm doesn’t matter much. But I doubt if politically conscious people will accept him,” he said.", VK Pandian is a Tamil Nadu-born former IAS officer of the Odisha cadre. He quit the service to join BJD and is now the party’s key campaigner and strategist. He is also being seen as CM Naveen Patnaik ’s political successor.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109931601,imgsize-1830697,width-400,resizemode-4/109931601.jpg"

I cannot do anything now to stop corruption. I just made the start by filing my nomination. My fight will continue,” said Ghadai, a resident of Karimpur village.Ghadai, who has studied up to Class IX, came down heavily on the elected representatives for doing very little for the development of Brahmagiri in all these years. Ghadai said people should open their eyes and vote for the right candidate.Given a chance, Ghadai said his priorities would be to safeguard Hindutva, curb cow smuggling and raise the socio-economic standards of the poor.Debutant Ghadai faces BJD’s Umakanta Samantaray, BJP’s Upasna Mohapatra and Congress nominee Mitrabhanu Mohapatra in the poll battle.Brahmagiri assembly constituency comes under Puri Lok Sabha seat where polling is scheduled to be held on May 25. Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra was elected from Brahmagiri on a Congress ticket in 1995, 2000 and 2004. BJD’s Sanjay Das Burma wrested the seat from Congress in 2009 and 2014.

Lucky Bhopal voters take home diamond rings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/lucky-bhopal-voters-take-home-diamond-rings/articleshow/109927498.cms,"BHOPAL: Polling booth in Char Imli locality, where senior bureaucrats and ministers reside, has traditionally been a VIP polling booth in Bhopal. This time it was no different and the distinction where the crème de la crème vote was evident from the gifts offered to voters in lucky draw to boost voter turnout by the district administration . Balloons were put at different points outside the Char Imli booth to make the voting day look like a festival of democracy, a tent was also put up outside the booth to allow voters wait for their turn.Besides, drinking water and cooler were also arranged to ensure that voters at this VIP booth remain comfortable while voting.No wonder that at this booth, the gifts offered to winners in the lottery held for voters by the district administration was very different from that offered at the ordinary booths elsewhere in the city. While winners in the first lottery held at 10 am in other booths were offered a T-shirt or a water bottle, the first winner at Char Imli booth got a diamond ring and the second winner, a mixer and grinder. Water coolers and other gifts wrapped in shiny papers were stacked on a small platform outside the booth for the prospective winners in the subsequent draws.In fact, Bhopal district administration had offered gifts to three voters selected through the lottery drawn three times during the day — at 10 am, 2 pm and 6 pm to boost the turnout.A staff member on duty at a booth in Trilanga told TOI that the gifts on offer are a cap, T-shirt and water bottle. But, at Char Imli booth, Yaggoj Sahu was seen posing for photographs for the media with a diamond ring that he had won in the first lottery draw at 10 am. Another person who had won a mixer grinder was also there but as soon as Yaggoj Sahu’s name as winner of the diamond ring was announced, he was left in the oblivion.A visibly happy Sahu said that he didn’t want to participate in the draw, but his wife insisted that they should put their slips in the box. He said that it was an innovative scheme of the district administration and would definitely help in boosting voting in Bhopal constituency.When nodal officer, SVEEP, Rajesh Sharma, was asked how unlike in other booths, at Char Imli booth, winners in the draw are being given diamond ring and mixer, gifts supposed to be given in the bumper draw taking place next day after the polling, said that it was decided to have a bumper draw at some polling booths on the day of polling itself, then there will be a bumper draw comprising voters from all the polling booths from across the Bhopal constituency on May 9.Bhopal collector Kaushlendra Vikram Singh, when asked on the issue, said there were 5 diamond rings, 4 given at 1 booth each in all the 4 assembly segments of Bhopal today and the remaining one will be given in the bumper draw on Wednesday, when 200 gifts would be given to the winners.","Bhopal district administration had offered gifts to three voters selected through the lottery drawn three times during the day.

Basit Dar , a top commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba front organisation The Resistance Front (TRF) allegedly involved in a spate of civilian killings in J&K, and an accomplice were gunned down Tuesday by security forces in south Kashmir’s Kulgam in an operation that lasted almost 24 hours.The operation marked a key breakthrough for the forces given that Dar (34) was one of J&K’s most wanted insurgents and carried a bounty of Rs 10 lakh on his head declared by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Dar hailed from Kulgam’s Redwani -- the site of the encounter -- sources said, adding he had left home three years ago and joined TRF.Kashmir IGP VK Birdi described Dar’s elimination as “a big achievement” for the forces as he was behind many terror attacks, especially in Srinagar, in recent years. “His killing is a blow to insurgent activities in the area, underscoring the unwavering commitment of security forces to combat terrorism,” another officer said.Details surrounding the encounter indicate the troopers from J&K Police and the Army executed a meticulously planned operation, culminating in the elimination of the high-profile terrorist.The pocket in Kulgam was cordoned off early Monday evening after specific inputs about the presence of terrorists, followed by a search, a senior police officer said. As the forces approached the suspected spot in Redwani, the militants in hiding opened fire, triggering the gunfight.The operation was halted late on Monday night as part of precautionary measures and darkness, which impaired visibility. It resumed early Tuesday with additional forces moved to the site to ensure the terrorists do not escape, the officer said. All routes to the area were sealed, and traffic and public movement restricted.The bodies of Dar and the other terrorist, who was yet to be identified, were found after the gunfight ended late Tuesday afternoon, the officer said.","Basit Dar, a top commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba front organisation The Resistance Front (TRF), and an accomplice were gunned down Tuesday by security forces.

'Fabric of society being torn apart'

NEW DELHI: The political slugfest over reservations took centrestage once again on Tuesday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi citing RJD chief Lalu Prasad 's pitch for Muslim quota to allege that a ""dangerous conspiracy of Congress and INDI alliance"" has been exposed. The opposition counter came from Sonia Gandhi who accused PM Modi and the BJP of promoting hatred for political gains.Prime Minister Narendra Modi latched on to Lalu's remarks that ""Muslims should get complete reservations"" to renew his attack that the opposition bloc wants to give complete reservation to Muslims by snatching it from the SCs, STs and OBCs.""Today, a senior leader of the INDI alliance who has eaten animal fodder, has been convicted by court in a corruption case and is out on bail due to health reasons is saying Muslims should not just get reservation but all the reservation should be given to Muslims. This means they want all the reservation to Muslims by snatching it from the SCs, STs and OBCs,"" PM Modi said at an election rally attacking the opposition alliance over Lalu's remarks.""Modi is asking for 400 seats so that the Congress does not hand over the country's vacant land and islands to other countries, it does not take away reservation given to SC/ST/OBCs and give it to its vote bank, and does not declare all castes of its vote bank as OBC overnight,"" he said.PM Modi had earlier also accused the Congress of distributing people’s property, land and gold among Muslims if the party was voted to power. He had then cited Congress’s promise to address the inequality of wealth and income in its manifesto and had linked it to an old statement of Manmohan Singh of minorities, especially Muslims, having the first right on nation's resources.The BJP also targeted the opposition over Lalu's remarks. ""This word, 'pura ka pura' (full), used by him in his statement, is very serious. This makes it clear that they (INDIA bloc) want to provide reservation to Muslims from the share of SCs, STs and OBCs,"" BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said.With PM Modi and the BJP unleashing a fresh offensive on Muslim reservations , Lalu was quick to issue a clarification. Lalu Prasad said he was in favour of extending reservation benefits to Muslims but emphasised that it should be based on social backwardness and ""not on the basis of religion"". The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo further claimed that it was he who had implemented the Mandal Commission.""I am senior to Narendra Modi (in politics). He does not know many things that I know. It was during my reign Mandal Commission recommendations were implemented (in Bihar). There are hundreds of social groups which got reservations as per the Mandal Commission report. But it was done not on the basis of religion. In the Constitution, there is no provision for reservations on religious basis"", Lalu Prasad said.However, it was former UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi who countered PM Modi's all-round offensive against the Congress and the opposition INDIA bloc. In a video message, the former UPA chairperson accused PM Modi and BJP of promoting hatred for political gains. Sonia alleged that fabric of society was being torn apart and expressed anguish at Constitution and democracy being under threat.Sonia claimed that youth unemployment, crimes against women and discrimination against Dalits, Adivasis, and minorities had reached unprecedented levels under the BJP government. These challenges, she claimed, stem from the ""niyat"" (intention) and ""niti"" (policy) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP which aim for power, rejecting inclusivity and dialogue.The senior Congress leader appealed to the people to reject the proponents of lies and hatred and vote for her party for a ""brighter and more equal future"" for all. She said the Congress and the INDIA bloc members were committed to defending the Constitution and democracy.(With inputs from agencies)","Prime Minister Narendra Modi latched on to Lalu's remarks that ""Muslims should get complete reservations"" to renew his attack that the opposition bloc wants to give complete reservation to Muslims by snatching it from the SCs, STs and OBCs.

Nirav Modi has bail refused for 7th time despite having spent 5 years in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nirav-modi-has-bail-refused-for-7th-time-despite-having-spent-5-years-in-jail/articleshow/109927697.cms,": Indian fugitive

Nirav Modi

had

bail refused

for the seventh time at

Westminster magistrates’ court

on Tuesday despite claiming he would never want to abscond Britain as, if he did, he could be tracked down by Indian secret service agents who, he claimed, had targeted people in the US and Canada.

Nirav has been in

jail

since his arrest in London in March 2019 on an extradition warrant to face trial in India for defrauding Punjab National Bank (PNB) of over $1 billion (a little over Rs 8,344 crore now) as well as interfering with witnesses and evidence.

Nirav’s barrister, Edward Fitzgerald, said “the Canadian govt have complained about the killing on their own soil by Indian agents”. He then went onto mention SFJ’s Gurpatwant Pannun “being targeted by R&AW in the US” and the “kidnapping of Princess Latifa” and “unlawful rendition” of Christian Michel.

“The relevance of that is that in the UK he is entitled to Osman warnings and protection from the police. That is a massive disincentive from going anywhere,” Fitzgerald said.

“The Indian secret service have tracked down and murdered people in Canada and the US. The idea they could not track down Nirav in Vanuatu is fanciful,” he said, rubbishing claims put forward by the prosecution that he might get citizenship in a no-extradition country like that if granted bail.

To demonstrate Nirav had community ties to the UK, Fitzgerald said his daughter (16), was to start school in the UK next year, Nirav was employed at Diamond Holdings in London, and some of those who stood up his $500,000 (approximately Rs 4.2 crore) bail surety were based in UK. His daughter and two sons, aged 21 and 23, were in court, having flown over from New York. His extradition proceedings concluded in Dec 2022, but “there are confidential proceedings still going on and reasons why he cannot be sent back”, he said.

Fitzgerald said Nirav did not have the means to flee “as there were no funds left” and he was acting pro bono. Nirav had not been accused of interfering with witnesses since 2018, he added.

Nicholas Hearn, prosecuting, said there was no evidence the “home secretary may “never be able to order extradition” because of Nirav’s “confidential application”. He also said there was no evidence Nirav was short of money as he was funding other legal cases in other jurisdictions relating to bankruptcy proceedings.

“He still could have access to different resources in different jurisdictions,” he said.

“It is clear to me that Nirav Modi is most unwilling to return to India to face trial. Had he wished to do so, he could have chosen not to launch another legal process,” district judge John Zani said, rejecting bail saying there were still substantial grounds to believe that if granted he would fail to surrender and interfere with witnesses.

He pointed out an eye-watering $600 million (about Rs 5,006 crore) of the amount he defrauded PNB of remains untraced. Although his co-defendants had got bail in India, Nirav was at “the centre” of the alleged criminal activity, and Zani said Nirav still had limited ties to the UK.","Nirav Modi refused bail for the seventh time at Westminster magistrates’ court.

A Dantewada family court had turned down his plea in Dec 2023, after which he moved HC.Siddiqui claimed they lived together for three years before “marrying” in 2021. He claimed he had an interfaith marriage, “in accordance with Muslim customs”, with the woman who followed Hindu law. He argued that according to Muslim law, he had the “right to enter into multiple marriages, thereby validating the second marriage”. He also claimed to be able to care for the child.The woman appeared with her parents and said she chose to reside with her parents and opposed his custody claim.The court found inconsistencies in the petitioner’s statements, concerning the legality of the marriage under the Special Marriage Act as he was already married, lived with his wife, and had three kids. The woman’s counsel argued the petition lacks evidence to prove the validity of the marriage.","Abdul Hameed Siddiqui sought custody of a child born from his live-in relationship with a woman from a different faith.

NEW DELHI: In a relief to over 25,000 teachers and non-teaching staff recruited in West Bengal in 2019, Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed a Calcutta high court order annulling their appointments but warned that those recruited illegally would have to refund salaries to the state.A bench, after daylong proceedings, agreed to examine modalities by which tainted candidates could be segregated from non-tainted ones so as to enable the court to save the jobs of those who made it to the merit list honestly.Dictating the order in open court much after the end of business hours at 4pm, the bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said, ""The court cannot be unmindful of the impact of setting aside of a large complement of assistant teachers recruited for teaching Class 9-10 and 11-12 students, which would be the consequence if the impugned judgment of HC stands.""However, it permitted CBI to carry on with its investigation subject to the condition that it would not arrest the tainted recruits or take any coercive action against them. It posted the matter for final hearing on July 16. Also, SC continued its April 29 interim order barring CBI from interrogating ministers or state govt employees allegedly responsible for creation of supernumerary posts to appoint waitlisted candidates.It said the court's scrutiny would focus on the appointment of those who did not figure in the list of those selected, those appointed after expiry of the validity of the selection panel, those appointed through manipulation of OMR answer sheets.The bench said, ""The submissions raised on behalf of petitioners would merit further consideration. The certificate under Section 65(b) of Evidence Act was issued, as CBI report notes, by Pankaj Bansal, a former employee of Nysa Communication Pvt Ltd (which was tasked with scanning and evaluating the OMR sheets but outsourced it to Datascan). The legitimacy of the certificate would prima facie plough the route of the data, which formed the basis of the judgment of the HC.""It added, ""A further issue which would emerge is whether the appointments which suffer from taint can be specifically segregated. If such an exercise is possible, it would be unfair to set aside the entirety of selection which extends to as many as 25,000 appointments.""Senior advocate Dushyant Dave repeatedly asked for scrutiny of conduct of Justice Avijit Gangopadhyay. But the bench said, ""We are not here to scrutinise his conduct. Levelling allegations against a judge is not going to carry the penny forward.""

This means all the reservation that SC , ST and OBC get will be snatched and given away entirely to Muslims. Why are they doing this? Because this is the only votebank keeping them alive. Everything else has finished for them,” Modi said.Claiming vindication, he said he could read the intent of Congress and its partners because of their dependence on the politics of votebanks and appeasement. “I have X-rayed their (opposition’s) mind. They want to X-ray you, so I thought let me X-ray them and see what’s on their mind. They only think of votebank, nothing else. They ( opposition ) cannot see beyond appeasement. If it comes to them, they’d even take your breathing rights away,” he said.“Modi was saying all along that they will take away part of reservation and give it away on the basis of religion. But the conspiracy is even deeper. They are brazenly saying that the full reservation of SC, ST and OBC will be given away to Muslims. I ask you (the crowd), will you let this happen?” the PM said. He also emphasised that Congress was for faith-based quotas. “In Karnataka, the Congress govt declared all Muslims as OBCs overnight and they looted a portion of the 27% reservation of people in this category. Congress wants to implement the same model across the country,” he said, adding that he would not allow Congress and INDI Alliance parties to “erase the identity of India” this way.“Today it is 14 days since I challenged them to categorically state that they will not implement reservations based on religion, that they will not declare Muslims as a whole ‘backwards’ and give them reservations at the cost of OBCs and that they will not cut into the quotas for OBCs, SCs and STs for the sake of their favourite vote bank. But they are yet to respond,” Modi said.He justified his opposition to Muslim quota by citing the stand of B R Ambedkar. “The architect of the Constitution, Babasaheb Ambedkar, was against this. They are betraying him,” the PM said, urging people to “vote them out to oblivion”. “That will be your true shradhanjali to Babasaheb,” he added.PM refrained from mentioning Lalu's name but savaged him, recalling his multiple convictions in fodder scam-related cases. “This leader was jailed for gobbling up fodder and was punished by the court. Even Supreme Court said he was guilty of corruption. But look at the shamelessness. He is on bail due to health reasons. He was in jail. He was a convict.

Ram, who is presently in judicial custody, had told the agency that the rural development minister's secretary Sanjeev Lal was directly involved in collections of commission.""The said commission is collected by Lal through certain persons and in one of the instances V K Ram said that crores of the commission were handed over to Lal in Sept2022,"" ED said.This is the second instance in less than six months where a senior Congress leader has been linked to huge cash hauls. Earlier, in Dec last year, Income Tax officials had seized more than Rs 350 crore in Odisha from a distillery company associated with Congress Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Sahu.","Sanjeev Lal, personal secretary to Jharkhand's rural development minister Alamgir Alam, was arrested on Tuesday.
