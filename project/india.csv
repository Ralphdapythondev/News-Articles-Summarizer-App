Shame,” Kangana said in her story.Earlier in this year, Kangana also faced the same kind of mysoginist comments during the Lok Sabha election when Congress leader Supriya Shrinate said purported objectionable remarks about the actor.Social media has been abuzz about Harris as netizens are still sharing the memes especially a coconut one.The meme stems from a random moment in a speech Harris gave in May last year as she was swearing in commissioners for the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics.The old clips resurfaced and were remixed of Harris telling a story in 2023, about her mother saying to her as a child: “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?”, with Harris adding: “You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.” It became an instant meme at the time.Clips from that part of the speech have since frequently been shared online, particularly earlier this year on X . Harris, overall, has earned a somewhat goofy reputation online, with many sharing videos of her dancing, her love of venn diagrams, her laughter and her ""coconut tree"" anecdotes.","After Joe Biden withdrew his name from the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris, there have been numerous sexist memes against her.

NEW DELHI: India faces an uphill task to save Bhoj wetland in Bhopal from being delisted from a global list of ‘wetlands of international importance’.The country will have to take a plea of “urgent national interests” in its response to the Ramsar Convention secretariat that sought clarification from it on the matter. India’s claim will then be scrutinised with a reality check on the ground by the Secretariat that designated the Bhoj wetland as a Ramsar site in August, 2002.last week reported that Bhoj wetland faces the risk of being delisted from the prestigious global list due to possible damage to its ecological character . Concerned citizens reported the matter to the Ramsar Convention secretariat, flagging how the proposed road project cutting through the catchment area will threaten not only the wetland but also the wildlife and other water bodies.The Switzerland-based secretariat in response to a question toldthis week that it’s still waiting for a response from the Indian govt on this matter.“Based on a third party report, the secretariat has informed the National Focal Point a concern for possible change in the ecological character of Bhoj wetland and we are waiting for a response from the Govt of India on this matter in accordance with Article 2.5 and Article 3.2 of the Convention,” said Beom-Sik Yoo, senior advisor (Asia/Oceania), secretariat of the Convention on Wetlands, in his email response.Bhoj Wetland, consists of two man-made reservoirs (Upper and Lower Lakes), is one of the 82 such sites in India designated as Ramsar sites for conservation and management of wetlands under globally accepted framework. The Union environment ministry is the national focal point on the issue in India.Under provisions of the Ramsar Convention, the country will have to convince the secretariat as to why its proposed project is needed in “urgent national interests” (Article 2.5) and how it won’t change the ecological character of the Bhoj wetland (Article 3.2).Experts at the secretariat will examine India’s clarification and send its report to a standing committee. Delisting will happen only if India fails to convince the Committee based on the ground report. It is learnt that the issue may also impact Bhopal’s proposed nomination for ‘Wetland City Accreditation’ under the Ramsar Convention.","Bhoj wetland faces the risk of being delisted from the prestigious global list due to possible damage to its ecological character.

The crew told flyers the aircraft had suffered a technical snag.Comments have been sought from IndiGo and are awaited.The flight, 6E 1406, was to take off from the UAE at 12.20 am. A passenger who was on this flight said: “We took off with a delay of 40 minutes with 129 passengers and six crew members. Even at take off time, the aircraft was vibrating a lot. Some passengers seated in the emergency exit row heard noise as if a door was getting open and shut. For the next one hour, the seat belt sign was not switched off and everyone remained seated. Subsequently, the pilot announced there’s some technical problem and that we were diverting to Muscat .”Once the aircraft landed safely in Muscat, passengers say they remained on board for an hour with technical teams trying to rectify the snag. “Some passengers now started asking for refreshments. The air hostess (the lead one) pointed out there were limited food items on the aircraft as IndiGo is not a full service airline (that has meals & beverages for all). She requested to save the limited meals for the old and very young passengers apart from those with medical conditions just in case the waiting inside the aircraft was going to be a long one. Some food items were given to other passengers,” said some on board the aircraft, while praising the lead cabin attendant for the way she handled the situation.Later passengers were asked to alight from the plane. “We did not have an Oman visa and were waiting inside the terminal when the crew of our flight came. They told us the aircraft had suffered a hydraulic snag and that’s why they decided to divert to Oman,” some passengers, who did not wish to be named, said.In about 2.5 hours, IndiGo managed to take the non-Oman visa holders to a transit hotel at the airport. “Now we are waiting to be flown to Delhi,” said a passenger at 3.30 pm Monday (India time).","The flight, 6E 1406, was to take off from the UAE at 12.20 am.

The ban was imposed in November 1966 during the rule of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.Soon after Malviya's tweet, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh launched a scathing attack on the government saying the ban was in place even during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure as Prime Minister.""After the assassination of Gandhiji in February 1948, Sardar Patel banned the RSS. After this, the ban was lifted on the assurance of good conduct. Even after this, RSS never hoisted the tricolor in Nagpur.

This is the official order issued in 1966 to impose the ban,"" he wrote in Hindi on X.""After June 4, 2024, the relationship between the self-proclaimed non-biological Prime Minister and the RSS has soured. On July 9, 2024, the 58-year ban was lifted which was in place even during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure as Prime Minister,"" he said.Referring to the RSS uniform of khaki shorts which was replaced by brown trousers in 2016, the Congress leader added, ""I believe bureaucracy can now even come in knickers.""All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi also hit out at the Centre calling it ""totally wrong"".""The BJP government is permitting the government servants to participate in RSS activities. It is totally wrong. The oath of RSS states that they don't believe in pluralism, they talk Hindu nationalism.

'Confident that Bihar would get a special package'

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday stated that Bihar's demand for ""special category status"" is not made out as it has been considered and rejected in the past. This comes a day after all parties of the state, including two allies of the BJP - Nitish Kumar 's Janata Dal (United) and Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party, renewed their demand for special category status to the state in the all-party meeting ahead of Monsoon Session of Parliament.""The request of Bihar for Special Category Status was considered by an inter-ministerial group (IMG) which submitted its Report on March 30, 2012. The IMG came to the finding that based on existing NDC criteria, the case for Special Category Status for Bihar is not made out,"" minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said in a written reply to a question from Ramprit Mandal , JD(U) MP from Bihar's Jhanjharpur.""Special category status for plan assistance was granted in the past by the National Development Council (NDC) to states based on some features necessitating special consideration. These features included (i) hilly and difficult terrain, (ii) low population density and/or sizeable share of tribal population, (iii) strategic location along borders with neighboring countries, (iv) economic and infrastructural backwardness and (v) non-viable nature of state finances,"" the minister highlighted in his reply.""The decision against special category status to Bihar was taken based on an integrated consideration of all the factors listed above and the peculiar situation of the state,"" the reply further states.The Centre's reply in Lok Sabha comes as a setback to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who, with 16 MPs, plays a key role in the survival of BJP-led NDA government. It was hoped that Nitish Kumar's old demand would be met by the BJP-led government. With the special status demand central to state's politics, the Centre's reply will put the chief minister on the defensive vis-a-vis the opposition in the state.RJD chief Lalu Prasad was quick to attack Nitish Kumar and demanded the chief minister's resignation. RJD called it blatant dishonesty with people of Bihar and said it will fight for special status for the state. ""When this government was formed with the support of 2 AB (Andhra Pradesh and Bihar), we thought that Bihar's demand would be fulfilled. But sorry to say Nitish ji, you have failed,"" RJD leader Manoj Jha said. ""They cite NDC report. Who are you trying to fool?

Disabled candidate not given any service despite clearing UPSC 4 times,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/disabled-candidate-not-given-any-service-despite-clearing-upsc-4-times/articleshow/111895006.cms,"NEW DELHI:

'Cerebral palsy allowed for IAS, why not muscular dystrophy?

In the midst of the row over trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar allegedly misusing the disability quota, a case has surfaced of a candidate with muscular dystrophy being denied any service despite having cleared the civil services four times.Kartik Kansal, who studied mechanical engineering in IIT Roorkee, is currently a scientist in Isro, a post for which he was selected through all-India central recruitment.Kartik, who has been using a wheelchair since the age of 14, was selected for the civil services four times - in 2019 (rank 813), 2021 (271), 2022 (784) and 2023 (829).In 2021, when he was ranked 271, even without a disability quota he ought to have got the IAS, since that year those ranked 272 and 273 got IAS. However, in 2021, muscular dystrophy was not included in the list of conditions in functional classification eligible for IAS.Muscular dystrophy was included in the list for Indian Revenue Service (income Tax) Group A and Indian Revenue Service (Customs and Excise), which were his second and third choices.In 2019, when Kartik Kansal got 813 rank, he could easily have been allotted a service as there were 15 vacancies for locomotor disability and only 14 were filled. In 2021, there were seven vacancies in the locomotor disability category and only four were filled. He ranked number one in the category.The medical board in AIIMS certified that he had muscular weakness and both his arms and legs were affected by muscular dystrophy. Inexplicably, for IAS, persons with both arms and legs affected are eligible but persons with muscular dystrophy are not. The board noted that he ""can do manipulation with fingers with difficulty and can do mobility with motorised wheelchair"". It also certified that he could see, hear speak, communicate, read and write though he could not stand, walk, pull, push, lift, crouch, bend, kneel, jump or climb. Though his original disability certificate put his level of disability at 60%, the AIIMS medical board deemed it 90%.A retired IAS officer, Sanjeev Gupta, took up Kartik's cause and tweeted in his support pointing out that it was a travesty of justice that Kartik who wrote the civil services without even using a scribe except for help in going to the toilet, and who met all the physical requirements for the job of IAS and IRS was not given any service.When he sought the reason for rejection through the central portal for grievance redressal, he got a reply stating: ""PWBD candidates are allocated service as per the functional classification and physical requirements prescribed by different cadre controlling authorities. There were no matching services at your turn as per your rank.""""Why should functional classifications and physical requirements for similar nature of work vary across services? If cerebral palsy is allowed for IAS, why not muscular dystrophy? Thankfully, since 2024 everything has been merged into one. There will be no such errors now. As per the new merged criteria too, Kartik is eligible to get IAS and true justice will be done by giving him IAS if there is a carry forward vacancy from previous years. This will partly undo the injustice meted out to him till now,"" said Gupta.""By joining the civil services, I wanted to prove that even people like me can do it. But I cannot comment further on the issue since it is sub judice,"" said Kartik, whose case pertaining to this issue is pending in Central Administrative Tribunal.","Kartik Kansal has been using a wheelchair since the age of 14. He was selected for the civil services four times - in 2019 (rank 813), 2021 (271), 2022 (784) and 2023 (829) In 2021, when he was ranked 271, even without a disability quota he ought to have got the IAS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111895386,imgsize-1111128,width-400,resizemode-4/111895386.jpg"

Thus compared to 50.7 crore persons in 2022, the country would need to care for 64.7 crore persons in 2050,"" the survey said.The report asserted that the additional requirements for care would be further upscaled as more women participate in paid work with prevalence of nuclear families increasing.In a section on social and economic empowerment of women, the survey calls for measures to enhance asset ownership among women and normalising female property rights. ""For development to be led by women, it will also have to be 'owned' by them,"" the report said.On financial inclusion, it has pointed out that the PM Jan Dhan Yojana has facilitated the opening of 52.3 crore bank accounts, of which around 56% of account holders are women, as of May 2024.
