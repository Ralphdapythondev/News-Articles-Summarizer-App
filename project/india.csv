Cruel to squash snouts of breeds like pugs: PETA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cruel-to-squash-snouts-of-breeds-like-pugs-peta/articleshow/111671209.cms,"MUMBAI: Ahead of World Plastic Surgery Day (15 July), PETA India said it was launching an appeal to remind everyone that while humans may have a choice when it comes to the shape of their nose, pet dog breeds like Pugs and other flat-faced dogs don't. PETA said they are intentionally and cruelly bred to have a snout so squashed it's difficult for them to even breathe, so compassionate people should never buy them.The awareness drive, PETA said, will be simultaneously held in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata, among other cities.In Mumbai, a giant billboard will be displayed at Marine Lines.Pugs and other breathing-impaired breeds (BIB), including French and English bulldogs, Pekingese, Boston terriers, boxers, Cavalier King Charles spaniels, and shih tzus, suffer from an agonising and sometimes fatal condition called brachycephalic syndrome , which causes them to pant, snort, wheeze, and struggle just to breathe. It can make chasing a ball, running, playing, and even going for a walk difficult. The situation is so serious that a number of countries, including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway, have banned or are currently working on amendments which either ban or restrict the breeding of some or all BIBs, PETA has said.","Pugs and other breathing-impaired breeds (BIB) suffer from an agonising and sometimes fatal condition called brachycephalic syndrome.

Lung cancer hits non-smoking Indians earlier than Westerners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lung-cancer-hits-non-smoking-indians-earlier-than-westerners/articleshow/111670935.cms,"MUMBAI: A lung cancer patient in India is likely to be 10 years younger than a patient in the West and possibly someone who avoids smoking , a lifestyle factor associated with it.This typical, though unique, profile of an Indian patient has emerged in a special review of lung cancer cases in Asia in The Lancet, one of the most widely read medical journals in the world.Studies have shown that lung cancer presents approximately a decade earlier in India as compared to Western countries, with a mean age at diagnosis of 54-70 years.Written by a team of doctors, mainly from Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai, the article, titled 'Uniqueness of lung cancer in Southeast Asia', said lung cancer was the third most commonly diagnosed cancer (18.5 lakh new cases or 7.8%) in this region in 2020, but it is the commonest cause of cancer mortality, causing 16.6 lakh or 10.9% deaths. The corresponding global figures are 22 lakh new cases (11.6%), causing 17 lakh deaths (18%). In India, lung cancer accounts for an annual incidence of 72,510 cases (5.8%) and 66,279 deaths (7.8%).Highlighting the ""uniqueness"" of Indian patients, one of the authors, Dr Kumar Prabash from Tata Medical Centre's medical oncology department, on Tuesday told TOI that ""over 50% of our lung cancer patients are non-smokers "".The study said the important risk factors for lung cancer in non-smokers included air pollution (especially particulate matter PM2.5), occupational exposure to asbestos, chromium, cadmium, arsenic and coal as well as second-hand smoke at home. Factors like genetic susceptibility, hormonal status, and pre-existing lung disease could also play a role in the rising lung cancer incidence in never-smokers.Dr Prabash further said the proportion of cases here is lower than in the West. ""The incidence rate of lung cancer in the US is 30 per 1,000, but it's 6 per 1,000 in India. Given our huge population, however, even the 6% works out to a huge number of patients.""Another uniqueness about India's lung cancer problem, he said, is the high incidence of TB. ""Diagnosis often gets delayed because of TB as both conditions mimic each other."" In this regard, the authors said it's not easy to get access to newer treatment modalities and molecules. ""Most treatments are developed abroad, and importing them adds to the cost."" The biggest challenge is early identification and start of treatment. ""Barely 5% of lung cancer patients seek help in time for surgical help. We need to increase this number to at least 20% like in the West,"" Dr Prabash said.","A lung cancer patient in India is likely to be 10 years younger than a patient in the West.

There must be some material against the person before proceedings under the law can be initiated, it stressed.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah held that ""in the absence of the basic/primary material, it cannot be left to the untrammelled or arbitrary discretion of the authorities to initiate proceedings"", which have life-altering and very serious consequences for the person.It said, Section 9 could not be invoked on the basis of hearsay or bald and vague allegation(s).""...the question is that does Section 9 of the Act empower the executive to pick a person at random, knock at his/her/their door, tell him/her/they/them 'We suspect you of being a foreigner'?...

Ipso facto just an allegation/accusation cannot lead to shifting of the burden to the accused, unless he/she is confronted with the allegation as also the material backing such allegation,"" the court said.The court said that there was no material in possession of authority which could raise suspicion on his nationality. After fighting a legal battle for two decades, SC came to his rescue and declared him Indian as all his relatives were also declared Indian citizens. The court also said that minor spelling mistakes in names on official documents could not be the sole reason to deny authenticity as happened in the case.""However, mere allegation, that too, being as vague as to mechanically reproduce simply the words which mirror the text of provisions in the Act cannot be permitted under law.

liberty aspect

: SC on bail case

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday said courts should not stay bail order in a ""casual"" manner as it affects liberty of a person and took exception to the Delhi HC keeping a bail order stayed for over a year during which the accused remained in jail.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih expressed shock that the HC stayed the trial court order granting bail to an accused in a money laundering case and kept the case pending for a year which forced the accused to approach the SC.""What is happening? This is shocking. Please answer our question. Can bail be stayed as a matter of course? Unless he is a terrorist, where is the reason to stay? Can you defend? We will set it aside... how HC casually stayed the bail. Could HC have stayed without a reasoned order? Answer us, what signals are we sending? We are blaming us also,"" it told ED counsel Zoheb Hossain. The bench said such a practice could not be allowed as it was about liberty. ""The HC passed the order in a very casual manner. It stayed the bail order and the case was thereafter heard after one year. The court did not bother to look into the case during the period and he kept languishing in jail,"" it said. The bench reserved its order but Hossain urged the court to grant him at least 10 minutes on Friday to argue the case on behalf of ED as any order passed by the apex court would have ramifications in other cases too. He said the prosecution was not at fault for the delay.We are worried about the liberty aspect. A person has to languish for one year in jail after bail was granted, the bench said, allowing Hossain to place case laws before the bench on the issue.The court was hearing a plea filed by one Parvinder Khurana who was granted bail by the trial court in a PMLA case on June 17 last year but the HC stayed the order.

The chargesheet deals with Rs 100 crore of the Rs 1,100 crore alleged to be involved overall.The chargesheet claims that that Kejriwal demanded Rs 100 crore kickbacks from the members of the South Group for the liquor sale contract, of which Rs 45 crore was spent on the Goa elections .ED insisted that Kejriwal claimed Vijay Nair, former AAP communications-in-charge and co-accused in the excise policy case, worked under minister Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj, not him. It also claimed that CM said Durgesh Pathak was the state prabhari (in-charge) for Goa and managed the funds and he himself had no role in fund-related decisions and hadn't received kickbacks from K Kavita, Bharat Rashtra Samithi functionary and accused.The agency has included screenshots of chats between Kejriwal and Vinod Chauhan to show the two had a close relationship. ED said the screenshot of hawala note numbers retrieved from Chauhan's phone matched those in the data seized by income tax officers. The agency said this proved Chauhan was involved in transferring Rs 25 crore through hawala for Goa elections.The chargesheet also claims that Chauhan's proximity to CM is apparent from the way he managed postings of the Delhi Jal Board officials.The chargesheet alleges that Kejriwal ""personally utilised"" a part of proceeds of crime because Chanpreet Singh, who managed the funds sent by Chauhan to Goa, booked a stay for him in a five-star hotel in Goa in Nov 2021. ED claimed that Singh had been unable to explain the reason for this payment. ""This is a complete and direct money trail of the proceeds of crime transferred from the South Group to the AAP elections,"" reads the chargesheet.Pointing out that Kejriwal ""wilfully disobeyed"" nine summons sent to him by ED for questioning in the case, the chargesheet claimed that in his evasive replies to queries, the CM said he was unaware about more than 10 meetings Nair had with the other co-accused in the liquor business including liquor manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and middlemen like Dinesh Arora and Abhishek Boinpally.Even when confronted with evidence about the hawala transfer of approximately Rs 45 crore corroborated by phone call detail record, records, data seized by income tax department from a Goa firm and WhatsApp messages showing arrangements for part of the payments being made in cash and partly as bills, Arvind Kejriwal claimed no knowledge of these, the chargesheet says.","The Enforcement Directorate has described chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as the ""kingpin and key conspirator"" in its seventh supplementary chargesheet in the case.

NEW DELHI: The chiefs of several central forces announced on Thursday that they have made all preparations to set aside 10% of posts for ex-Agniveers. The reservation for ex-Agniveers in the central security forces was announced by the Union home ministry last year.CISF director general Nina Singh and BSF director general Nitin Agrawal on Thursday detailed the recruitment plans for ex-Agniveers.According to Singh, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) will reserve 10% of jobs for ex-Agniveers in all future constable appointments.""The Union home ministry had taken the important decision regarding the recruitment of ex-Agniveers. Accordingly, the CISF is also preparing the process of the recruitment of ex-Agniveer,"" Singh said.She further explained the specifics, noting that physical tests will include exemptions for former Agniveers and there will be age relaxations.During the first year, the age relaxation will be five years, while in subsequent years, it will be three years.""Ex-Agniveer will be able to take advantage of this and the CISF will ensure that. This will be beneficial for the CISF too as the force will get trained and disciplined personnel,"" Singh told DD News.""They got four years of experience. They are fully disciplined and trained personnel. This is very good for the BSF as we are getting trained soldiers. After short training, they will be deployed along the border,"" said BSF director General Agrawal.Agrawal emphasized that all security forces would benefit from recruiting ex-Agniveers.""We are waiting for them to be deployed after giving conversion training, they will be deployed. 10 per cent of the total vacancies will be reserved for them,"" he said.He also confirmed that age relaxations would be provided, with the first batch receiving five years of relaxation and subsequent batches getting three years.""There will be age relaxation for them as well. The first batch will get five years of age relaxation and the subsequent batches will get three years of age relaxation,"" Agrawal told DD News.DG CRPF Anish Dayal Singh said: ""All arrangements have been made to recruit ex-Agniveers in CRPF.

It recruits youths aged 17-and-half to 21 for four years, with 25% of them being retained for an additional 15 years.Opposition parties, including the Congress, have criticised the scheme, questioning the future of the 75% of Agniveers not retained after their four-year tenure.Various central government agencies and departments have announced plans to recruit former Agniveers, who are seen as experienced and disciplined personnel.The systematic planning to integrate ex-Agniveers into the CISF and BSF is part of a broader strategy to utilise their skills and training for national security roles, addressing both operational needs and career continuity for these individuals.",The reservation for ex-Agniveers in the central security forces was announced by the Union home ministry last year.

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for another round of Parliament storm over Manipur. Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday made it clear that ""Congress and INDIA bloc will raise the Manipur issue with full force in Parliament.""Rahul, who recently made his third visit to the strife-torn state, reiterated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should personally visit Manipur, listen to the problems of the people and appeal for peace.The former Congress chief, who met victims of violence in three relief camps, assured people that his party will raise the problems being faced by the people of Manipur in the upcoming session of Parliament.""We can put pressure (on the government) and we will put pressure on them. I can help you, I can raise the issue and put pressure but I can't reassure you when you will be able to go back to your homes because the government has the answer to this. You will see in the next session, I will raise your voice,"" Rahul is heard telling people in videos shared of his visit to a relief camp in Manipur.Parliament will reconvene on July 22 for the Budget session . The opposition has been relentless in its attacks on the government over its failure to end violence in Manipur. Their main target is Prime Minister Modi who has not visited the state since it plunged into violence on May 3 last year after ethnic clashes broke out between the Meiteis and the Kukis. Some 200 people have been killed till now while thousands have been displaced following large-scale arson that gutted homes and government buildings.In the just concluded Parliament session, the Prime Minister faced opposition sloganeering over Manipur situation right through his reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address. The Lok Sabha later adopted a motion moved by defence minister Rajnath Singh condemning the behaviour of opposition members and accusing them of violating parliamentary traditions. The Congress, however, justified the sloganeering blaming the government's unwillingness to give an MP from Manipur five minutes to speak before the PM's reply in Lok Sabha.While PM Modi did not mention Manipur in his speech in Lok Sabha, in Rajya Sabha he blamed the opposition for politicising a sensitive issue.""We are continuously trying to maintain peace and stability in Manipur. More than 11,000 FIRs have been registered, and more than 500 people have been arrested in Manipur, which is a very small state. Now, the incidents of violence are coming down. This means peace is possible,"" the PM said in his speech.""Both Central and state governments are actively working to resolve regional issues with patience and peace. Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited Manipur and stayed for weeks there, engaging with relevant stakeholders,"" he added.Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh , who has faced opposition flak for his failure to end violence, feels whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits the state or not should not be made an issue. ""We are keeping in touch with the PM round-the-clock and working under his guidance. All security-related, relief, and other works are being planned and performed as per the Prime Minister's advice and approval,"" the Manipur chief minister said countering the Congress's attacks on PM Modi.However, the Congress, which wrested two Lok Sabha seats of the state from the BJP, has made Modi's visit to the state a political issue and is unlikely to tone down its attack till the Prime Minister actually decides to visit the troubled northeast state. Rahul, who had visited Manipur weeks after ethnic violence and also began his 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' from the state in January 2024, will continue to try and capitalise on the issue.(With inputs from agencies)","Rahul Gandhi: ""Congress and INDIA bloc will raise the Manipur issue with full force in Parliament"" The opposition has been relentless in its attacks on the government over its failure to end violence in Manipur.

NEW DELHI: US envoy to India Eric Garcetti on Thursday highlighted the necessity of close cooperation between the United States and India, particularly as the world is seeing more conflicts.""I know that India likes its strategic autonomy , but in times of conflict, there is no such thing as strategic autonomy,"" Garcetti said in an event in New Delhi.""In crisis moments, we will need to know each other. I don't care what title we put to it, but we will need to know that we are trusted friends, brothers and sisters, and colleagues in times of need.""Garcetti further stressed the importance of investing in the US-India relationship. ""It's important for us as Americans and as Indians to remember that the more we put into this relationship, the more we will get out of it. The more we insist on a kind of cynical calculation in place of a trusted relationship , the less we will get,"" he said.He also urged his Indian counterparts not to take the bilateral relationship for granted.""While it is wider and deeper than it's ever been, it is not yet deep enough. If we take it for granted, I will have to fight many defence battles to help this relationship move ahead,"" Garcetti remarked, underscoring the ongoing efforts to strengthen ties between the two nations.Garcetti's comments follow the Biden administration's reaffirmation that India remains a strategic partner for the US, despite concerns about its relationship with Russia.Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently visited Russia for 22nd India-Russia annual summit, which was closely watched by Western countries due to the ongoing Ukraine conflict.During his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, PM Modi stressed that the Ukraine conflict cannot be resolved on the battlefield and emphasized the need for peace efforts.Spokespersons from the Pentagon, White House, and State Department addressed India's ties with Russia and PM Modi's visit to Moscow. Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said, ""India and Russia have had a longstanding relationship. From a US perspective, India is a strategic partner with whom we continue to engage in full and frank dialogue, including discussions about their relationship with Russia,"" as quoted by news agency PTI.Discussing the implications of PM Modi's visit, Ryder noted, ""I do not think anybody will be surprised if (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin tries to represent this visit in a way that seeks to somehow show that he is not isolated from the rest of the world. And the fact of the matter is President Putin's war of choice has isolated Russia from the rest of the world, and it has come at great cost.
