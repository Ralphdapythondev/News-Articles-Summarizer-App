297 Indian antiquities to return to India from USA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/297-indian-antiquities-to-return-to-india-from-usa/articleshow/113563018.cms,"The illicit trafficking of cultural property is a longstanding issue that has affected many cultures and countries throughout history. India has been particularly affected by this issue and a large number of antiquities have been smuggled out of the country.During this visit of PM to US, 297 antiquities were handed over to India.This takes the total number of antiquities recovered by India since 2014 to 640.The total number of antiquities returned from the USA alone will be 578.Apart from the current visit, the earlier visits of PM to USA have also been particularly fruitful in return of antiquities to India. During PM Modi 's visit to the US in 2021, 157 antiquities were handed over by the US government, including the exquisite bronze Nataraja statue from the 12th century CE. Also, a few days after the PM's US visit in 2023, 105 antiquities were returned to India.India's successful recoveries extend beyond the USA, with 16 artefacts being returned from UK, 40 from Australia among others.In stark contrast only one artefact was returned to India between 2004-2013.Further, in July 2024, on the sidelines of the 46th World Heritage Committee, at New Delhi, India and the United States signed the first ever 'Cultural Property Agreement' to prevent and curb the illicit trafficking of antiquities from India to the USA.The spectacular achievement over the last ten years demonstrates the government's resolve to reclaim India's stolen treasures and preserve its cultural heritage for future generations.PM Modi's personal bond with global leaders has played a pivotal role in securing these returns.

Hilsa: Cheers before Durga puja: Bangladesh to send 3000 tonnes of hilsa to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cheers-before-durga-puja-bangladesh-to-send-3000-tonnes-of-hilsa-to-india/articleshow/113562731.cms,"KOLKATA/DHAKA: Fish traders in Kolkata had all but given up hope of importing “Padmar ilish” this year, in what seemed like the ultimate red herring due to the political upheaval in Bangladesh . But in a surprise move, the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt announced on Saturday the approval of 3,000 tonnes of the prized hilsa fish for export to India just in time for Durga puja The announcement follows persistent requests from exporters in Bangladesh and Kolkata’s fish traders. Bangladesh, the world’s largest hilsa producer, remains keen to ensure domestic consumers still have access to the fish.The demand for fresh hilsa from Bangladesh is immense in Bengal. “Some traders are selling frozen hilsa from Myanmar, which lacks the taste of hilsa from the Padma-Meghna river system that connoisseurs in Bengal appreciate,” Fish Importers’ Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood said.The backdrop of this hilsa diplomacy is complex. Former PM Sheikh Hasina had banned the export of hilsa to India in 2012 after talks over the Teesta water-sharing agreement stalled. While Hasina lifted the ban before Durga puja in 2019, the new political landscape in Bangladesh had led many to believe that hilsa trade was unlikely to resume.The sudden change of heart sparked both excitement and confusion in Kolkata. “The order is likely to be issued on Sept 25, and the first consignment is expected to reach the city via the Benapole-Petrapole border the next day”, Maqsood said.Despite the large approved quantity, actual exports may fall short, with Maqsood adding that only around 1,500 tonne might reach India due to past trends. The trade window will remain open until Oct 22, before a 22-day hilsa fishing ban begins to allow the fish to lay eggs.Traders estimate prices in Kolkata market will hover between Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000 a kg, depending on the supply. Resumption of hilsa exports underscores importance of this fish in broader cultural and diplomatic relationship between Bangladesh and India. Whether the catch meets expectations remains to be seen, but return of hilsa diplomacy has again bridged borders in time for a festive celebration.","3,000 tonnes of the prized hilsa fish for export to India just in time for Durga puja.

Gene-therapy must be accessible to all: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gene-therapy-must-be-accessible-to-all-cji/articleshow/113562751.cms,"“Patient’s consent vital as gene-therapy in nascent stage”

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud on Monday spoke passionately on the urgent need for universal access to gene therapy that helps correcting rare genetic disorders , a treatment which is exorbitantly costly and beyond the reach of most parents.Mixing his over 40 years’ experience in legal profession, 24 of which as a HC and SC judge, with a decade long emotional attachment with his adopted girls afflicted with genetic disorder, the CJI virtually spoke for thousands of parents battling to provide their children a future better than what stars had foretold.Delivering the inaugural address at “Gene Therapy & Precision Medicine Conference” at Bengaluru, Justice Chandrachud said, “The quest to treat rare diseases is futile if access to these treatments remains a challenge, especially outside major urban centres”.He said factors outside the healthcare system such as class, caste, gender and regional location often play a significant role in determining an individual’s health status and asserted that access to essential treatments is part of the right to health guaranteed under right to life.At the core of impeding universal access to gene therapy is its exorbitant cost. “Approved gene therapies in the West range from Rs 7 to 30 crores per treatment, making them unaffordable for most in India... Consequently, many families resort to crowdfunding to access this critical treatment,” he said.While appreciating the govt efforts to provide insurance cover for such treatments up to Rs 50 lakhs, the CJI said effective addressing of the situation could only be through development of indigenous technologies tailored for our patient population.Societal awareness of genetic disorders is essential for the socio-cultural support base for such patients, the CJI said. For developing cost-effective gene therapy, he said, “The industry must step up its support through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives or direct investment in startups. To encourage more industry participation, there should be proposals for tax incentives and benefits, especially since the market for rare disease treatments is relatively small.”Lastly, he said for genetic therapy clinical trials, the fundamental right of a person to decide whether to undergo such treatment must not be ignored. “It is crucial that patients are fully informed about potential outcomes, risks, and alternatives. They must have the freedom to make decisions about their health without coercion, ensuring that their autonomy is always respected,” he said.","Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud spoke passionately on the urgent need for universal access to gene therapy that helps correcting rare genetic disorders.

Will Supreme Court be able to restrain over-speaking HC/SC judges?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-sc-be-able-to-restrain-over-speaking-hc/sc-judges/articleshow/113562669.cms,"Guidelines being advisory in nature, difficult to implement

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court ’s attempt to draw restraint boundaries for over-speaking judges while taking exception to a Karnataka HC judge’s uncalled-for remarks may not yield desired impact as its breach would not attract any drastic consequences, unlike the one faced almost a century ago by English Judge Hippy Hallet .Hippy Hallet aka Sir Hugh Imbert Periam Hallett was an English attorney who had impressed all with his knowledge of law. He was appointed as a judge in 1939. To get to the core of the disputes, he used to incessantly interrupt arguing counsel to ask questions, often making them flounder in presenting the case coherently.In one case - Jones vs National Coal Board [1957 (2) Queen's Bench 55] - he was so overbearing in his questions that both sides appealed against the verdict on identical grounds – the judge’s interruptions made it impossible for the counsel to put arguments properly.The SC Collegium would have rated a judge like Hallet highly for probing away to reach the truth in a case and would have laughed at the predicament of lawyers put to such a situation by the judge. Not in England.Justice Hallett's judgment was set aside. A fresh trial was ordered. The appeal judgment quoted Lord Chancellor Bacon, ""Patience and gravity of hearing is an essential part of justice; and an over-speaking judge is no well-tuned cymbal.""The English judiciary was so sensitive to this issue that the then Lord Chancellor sent for Justice Hallet and arranged that he could continue to sit for some time and then resign. Lord Alfred Thompson Denning, who set aside Justice Hallett's judgment, bemoaned the abrupt end to the judge's career.He said, ""It was a poignant case; for he was able and intelligent - but he asked too many questions."" What was an isolated instance in England has become a general practice in India. This over-speaking nature of a few judges, who are able and intelligent, is chipping away at the carefully crafted dignity of the judiciary.Coming back to the guidelines, the SC can at best caution or admonish a HC judge for breaching the advisory code of conduct in the courtroom. Will the guidelines be applicable to an HC judge’s speech at seminars or at conferences? Probably not.Recently a SC Judge, upset over a certain yoga guru’s conduct, had remarked “We will rip you apart”. Will the to-be-framed guidelines be applicable to a SC Judge?If a judge repeatedly violates the guidelines for courtroom observations and continues to indulge in irrational over-speaking, could it be regarded as misbehaviour or incapacity warranting his removal?For the CJI to recommend removal of a SC or HC judge under Article 124(4) of the Constitution, there must be inquiry headed by a panel of judges who would have to give a report proving the misbehaviour or incapacity of the concerned judge and recommend against his continue in the constitutional post.On receiving such a report, the CJI would have to decide forwarding the same to the government for initiation of removal motion under Article 124(4) in Parliament, which motion must receive support of two-third of the members present and voting in each House.Are the SC and CJI ready to take Hippy Hallet type of drastic action against HC and SC judges? There are over 1,000 HC judges in the country. Would social media be the guiding light for initiation of action against over-speaking judges or the concerned HC Chief Justice?If a constitutional post holder does not realize the dignity attached to the post he holds, no amount of guidelines would help bring sanity or balance in their observations.","Hippy Hallet aka Sir Hugh Imbert Periam Hallett was an English attorney who had impressed all with his knowledge of law.

UP medical aspirants converting religion to secure MBBS seats: A look at NEET UG admission criteria around minority reservation rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/up-medical-aspirants-converting-religion-to-secure-mbbs-seats-a-look-at-neet-ug-admission-criteria-around-minority-reservation-rules/articleshow/113364399.cms,"NEET UG Admission Criteria and Minority Reservation Explained

What is the Application Process for Minority Quota in NEET Counselling

A startling case has surfaced in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, where more than a dozen medical aspirants allegedly underwent religious conversion to secure admission to minority medical colleges . This troubling incident, now under investigation by local authorities, is believed to contravene the provisions of the Unlawful Conversions of Religion Act of 2021 (UPPUCRA-2021).The individuals involved hail from various regions, including several districts in Uttar Pradesh, New Delhi, and Maharashtra. According to media reports, the Uttar Pradesh Home Department and other relevant authorities are aware of the ongoing probe.A total of 20 candidates came under scrutiny for allegedly using religious conversion certificates to secure an MBBS seat, circumventing the law. Of these, seven admissions were cancelled by the counselling board, while seven others voluntarily withdrew. The remaining six candidates, all from outside Uttar Pradesh, have had their documents forwarded to their respective states for verification before any legal action is taken. In response to the incident, the Directorate of Medical Education has instructed the counselling committee to thoroughly investigate the matter and verify the certificates submitted in various admission categories.Admissions to all undergraduate medical and dental courses across India are primarily conducted through NEET (UG). Various categories of seats are available, including those under the All India Quota, state government quotas, central institutions, deemed universities, and private medical or dental colleges. This system also includes seats under management and NRI quotas, with some institutions specifically catering to minority communities. Minority quotas in private, unaided, and aided minority medical colleges are also a crucial component of the admission process.Institutions such as AIIMS and JIPMER conduct their own admissions under specific categories, while the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) oversees the process for central institutions and deemed universities.Minority reservation criteria for NEET UG admissions are based on a complex interplay between state and central government regulations. The status of a minority community varies by state, and a separate list is maintained for All India Quota seats by the central government. State-specific criteria may also apply, requiring candidates to have attended a minority college or institution for part of their education to qualify for the reserved seats. This ensures that both regional and national considerations are balanced in the distribution of these quotas.The process for securing a seat under the minority quota in NEET counselling can differ based on the type of counselling. State counselling is typically centralised and managed by state authorities, where minority quota seats are part of the broader allocation process. Conversely, certain private or minority-run institutions conduct their own college-based counselling, requiring candidates to apply directly to the institution to claim a minority seat. Candidates participating in either of these processes must meet the specific eligibility requirements, including the submission of valid minority status certificates .For minority quota admissions, a separate merit list is created, considering NEET scores and other factors such as qualifying exam marks in some states. The selection process usually involves multiple rounds of counselling to fill any remaining seats. Upon selection, candidates must provide all relevant documentation, including NEET scores, educational certificates, and proof of minority status.In cases where an institution claims minority status, the application for a Minority Status Certificate (MSC) must first be submitted to the authority designated by the state government, as outlined by the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions. This process is critical for ensuring the proper distribution of seats under the minority reservation policy in medical admissions.","A total of 20 candidates came under scrutiny for allegedly using religious conversion certificates to secure an MBBS seat, circumventing the law.

It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil.SEE ALSO: '3 lakh laddus daily, Rs 500 crore revenue annually': Tirupati's sacred sweet takes a sour turn after ghee adulteration charges The samples also contained fats from vegetable sources like coconut, linseed, rapeseed and cottonseed.The analysis was conducted on July 23 after the government received complaints of change in taste of the laddu prasadam.Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had sparked a major controversy on Wednesday when he told NDA allies that animal fat had been found in the ghee for the laddus when YSRC was in power. YSRC had reacted angrily, denying the allegations and claiming it to be one of Naidu’s political stunts.The analysis by the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), however comes with a caveat - there can be chances of false positive results in certain circumstances. The report lists several conditions where a result could go wrong, including in cases like overfeeding cows with feed rich in vegetable oils, underfeeding cows or the milk being subjected to technological treatments like removal of cholesterol.The report is silent whether the adulterants were deliberately added or crept in through feeding conditions and other factors.Naidu’s allegation and the NDDB’s report have shocked millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe as the Tirupati laddus are considered Maha Prasadam and carry a high sentimental value.The TDP govt had in June appointed senior IAS officer J Syamala Rao as the new executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) which manages the temple complex. As part of streamlining measures, an inquiry was ordered into the alleged poor quality, taste and texture of the laddus.TTD constituted an expert committee to look into the quality of the prasadam. The members included Dr B Surendranth, former principal scientist of the National Dairy Research Institute, Vijayawada, Bhaskar Reddy (dairy expert), Prof B Mahadevan (IIM-Bangalore) and Dr G Swarnalatha from the Telangana Veterinary UniversityApart from suggesting several measures to TTD to restore the taste and quality, the committee also sent samples of the ghee to NDDB, Gujarat. The lab reports, issued in July, confirmed the presence of foreign fats. TTD returned the ghee stocks supplied by AR Dairy Foods, Dindigul, in Tamil Nadu and blacklisted the contractor. Then, TTD selected Karnataka Milk Federation to supply the ghee.TTD sources said that while cow ghee was procured from the blacklisted contractor at Rs 320 per kg, the Tirupati trust is now procuring ghee at Rs 475 per kg from the Karnataka federation.TTD prepares and distributes about 3 lakh laddus to the devotees every day at Tirumala. Every year, the trust earns around Rs 500 crore from laddu sales alone.","The TDP govt in Andhra Pradesh made public laboratory analysis of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its famous Tirupati laddu prasadam.

This request came amidst uncertainty surrounding the shipments of the fish this year, following recent unrest and a change in government in Bangladesh.In a letter dated September 9, the Association's secretary, Syed Anwar Maqsood, highlighted that although Bangladesh implemented a ban onhilsa export in 2012, the country has been allowing limited exports from the first week of September until the end of the Durga Puja festival for the past five years as a gesture of goodwill.As the leading global producer of hilsa, Bangladesh typically imposes restrictions on the export of this fish to meet the high domestic demand. However, during the Durga Puja festivities, the country usually eases the export ban on hilsa.The practice of allowing hilsa exports to India between September and October each year, as a gesture of goodwill, had been a long-standing tradition under the previous Awami League government, led by the deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina.","Bangladesh will export 3,000 tonnes of Hilsa during the upcoming Durga Puja festival, which will take place from October 9 to 13.

17th woman to hold CM's post in independent India

NEW DELHI: New chief minister, Atishi , will continue to hold the 13 portfolios that she had earlier, including finance, planning, power, water, revenue, and public works department, while Saurabh Bharadwaj will have eight and new face Mukesh Kumar Ahlawat will handle five ministries.Apart from the ministries he held in the Kejriwal govt, Bharadwaj has been given charge of two more, social welfare and cooperatives, which were held by Raaj Kumar Anand, who quit the govt and party earlier this year.Mukesh Kumar Ahlawat, the new face in the council of ministers, has been assigned the remaining five departments that Anand held, including labour, employment, and SC&ST welfare.Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot, and Imran Hussain will retain the portfolios they held in the last govt. While Rai's three departments included environment and development, Gahlot will have the charge of five, including home, transport and women and child development, while Hussain will have two - food and supply, and election.Atishi was sworn in as the eighth chief minister of Delhi on Saturday at an event at Raj Niwas, replacing her mentor and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, who resigned from the post earlier this week. At 43, she's the second youngest CM of Delhi after Chaudhary Brahm Prakash (34) in 1952-55 and the youngest among the three women CMs -- Sheila Dikshit and Sushma Swaraj being the other two -- that the city has seen to date.Along with Atishi, five ministers also took oath, including four - Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot, Saurabh Bharadwaj and Imran Hussain - from the previous dispensation, and Mukesh Kumar Ahlawat, a new entrant to the Cabinet. She and others were administered the oath of office and secrecy by LG VK Saxena.Atishi has also become the 17th woman to hold the post of a chief minister in independent India. A first-time legislator, Atishi will have a brief stint of just five months as CM in this term.Before swearing in as CM, Atishi, along with her cabinet ministers, called on outgoing CM Kejriwal at his residence and held a brief discussion. Soon after taking oath, Atishi took blessings from Kejriwal by touching his feet. Former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, Delhi assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel, leader of opposition Vijender Gupta and police commissioner Sanjay Arora also attended the ceremony, as did her parents, Vijay Singh and Tripta Wahi, who were professors at Delhi University.Addressing a press conference soon after taking oath, Atishi said it was an ""emotional day"" for her as her ""guru"" and Delhi's son Kejriwal will not continue to be CM. She urged people to ensure Kejriwal returned to the top post again after the assembly polls in the capital in Feb 2025.LG Saxena extended his best wishes to Atishi and her council of ministers in a post on X after the event. ""May they work for the betterment of Delhi and its people,"" he wrote. The new govt is likely to prove its majority in the 70-member assembly in a special session on Sept 26-27. Atishi has been elevated to the top post at a crucial time for AAP, which is looking to retain office in Delhi for the third consecutive term, in polls scheduled early next year.With assembly polls around the corner, the new AAP govt is likely to have a challenging stint. Apart from playing a balancing act with the LG and bureaucrats, the new CM will also be expected to fast-track pending policies and schemes of public welfare, including the rollout of the Mahila Samman Nidhi Yojana, and relaunching the flagship doorstep delivery of services scheme.","Atishi was sworn in as the eighth chief minister of Delhi on Saturday.

J&K's ace swimmer looks to sink Omar's poll hopes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jks-ace-swimmer-looks-to-sink-omars-poll-hopes/articleshow/113559665.cms,"GANDERBAL: An ace swimmer seems to be giving the sinking feeling to National Conference mascot Omar Abdullah in Ganderbal . And the legend of Bashir Mir is that he is a daredevil who rushes to the ‘darya’ and plunges into the choppy currents to rescue people, sans concern about his own well-being.From the picturesque Kangan, Mir’s hometown, to the end of the buzzing Ganderbal right to the edge of Hazratbal in Srinagar, people only talk about Mir’s skill in water.The rest follows: if a young man routinely stakes his life for others, he would be around for his constituents, in good times and bad.With the endearing immodesty of a villager, Mir explains his widespread fame as a rescuer with a laconic, “I am a good swimmer.” But it hides the awe that young boys and old men across the length of Kangan-Ganderbal have for the 48-year-old youth leader of PDP . “Parvah nahin karta, kapde utarta hai aur darya mein kood jata hai, kitne log bachaye, kitne laash nikali,” is the refrain delivered in different words laced in chaste Kashmiri accent. It is as if the flowing waters of ‘nallah sind’ carry his gallant tales across the land.Kangan is on the route of Amarnath Yatra and Sonmarg. “People come from different parts of India. There are accidents. Someone slips while bathing. Sometimes vehicles fall in the river,” he said, adding that SDRF and NDRF enlist his support in tricky situations. “I am the expert. When they cannot go in or fail, they call Bashir, and he goes there,” he says with his likeable boast.According to Mir, over 20 years, he has taken out 70 dead bodies and rescued 22 who fell alone or while traveling in vehicles. “I'm famous for it,” he says.(But Bashir complains “the government never acknowledged me or gave me any award.”)The fame of water has Mir walking in the air in this election. “I am No 1. We will win, Inshallah. People know Bashir is a good man. Ganderbal is a small district with a 4 lakh population. ((They all know Bashir Mir)),” he said about his prospects against Omar.He contested twice for the neighbouring Kangan, and lost narrowly in 2014 against the NC stalwart Mian Altaf. Post-delimitation, the seat was reserved for STs, forcing Mir to migrate.Ganderbal has been a family bastion of the Abdullahs. But the man to raise the temperature in the hot seat is calm personified. Mir claims the young Abdullah did little for Ganderbal despite being the CM, a line echoed by many poor of the constituency.Mir asked, “Did you not see the videos of Omar turning his cap into a bowl begging for votes? Why do you think he is fighting from two seats now? (Everyone wants Bashir to be given a chance).”NC is banking on its organizational infrastructure and resources to tide over the challenge. (Over three generations, the NC has created lifelong supporters.) “I always voted for National. Omar will win,” said a 60-year-old. But Abdul Qadar, an NC worker, averred it was a tough fight. However, a cop near the NC office laughed away the talk of a challenge. “100% Omar will win. Omar campaigned for three days, then Farooq saab did for three days and now Omar will come again.”Given that the PDP is in a tough election this year, will it not hurt the young man despite his popularity? Mir returns to his endearing immodesty, “People will vote for Bashir.”","The legend of Bashir Mir is that he is a daredevil who rushes to the ‘darya’ and plunges into the choppy currents to rescue people. “Parvah nahin karta, kapde utarta hai aur darya mein kood jata hai, kitne log bachaye,. kitne laash nikali,” is the refrain delivered in different words laced in chaste Kashmiri accent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113559966,imgsize-1293405,width-400,resizemode-4/113559966.jpg"

Significantly, it also appointed chief justice of Jharkhand HC, for which the state had moved a contempt plea against the Centre in SC .President has signed the warrants of appointment for the chief justices of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madras, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh and Jharkhand.Govt's quick decision would perhaps ensure that differences between executive and judiciary on the issue of appointments in the higher judiciary do not snowball into tug-of-war as witnessed in judicial proceedings last year when SC expressed its deep displeasure over the Centre not adhering to the law. It had said the collegium system for appointment of judges was the law of the land and the Centre was bound to follow it and in case of reiteration, govt has no option but to accept the collegium's decision.Govt has appointed acting chief justice of Delhi HC Justice Manmohan as its chief justice. Delhi HC judge Justice Rajiv Shakdher has been appointed as chief justice of Himachal Pradesh HC. Another Delhi HC judge, Justice Suresh Kait will take charge as chief justice of Madhya Pradesh HC. Calcutta HC judge Justice Indra Prasanna Mukerji has been appointed chief justice of Meghalaya HC. Bombay HC judge, Justice Nitin Madhukar Jamdar will move to Kerala HC as its chief justice. Acting chief justice of J&K and Ladakh HC, Justice Tashi Rabstan has been appointed as chief justice of the same HC. Bombay HC judge, Justice Shriram Kalpathi Rajendran has been appointed as chief justice of Madras HC and chief justice of Himachal Pradesh HC, Justice M S Ramachandran Rao has been transferred to Jharkhand HCSC on Friday asked the govt to explain why some of the names recommended for judgeship are pending and at which level. Some of the issues raised by SC last year also remain unaddressed including the transfer of some HC judges and clearing those names which were reiterated by the SC collegium for HC judgeship. The delay and the Centre's policy of ""pick and choose"" from the collegium's recommendation is also a bone of contention between the two organs of governance and the court in its judicial proceedings repeatedly flagged the issue.SC had in 2021 framed comprehensive guidelines for time-bound appointment of judges and fixed the time period for all authorities involved in the process to take decision. It had said the Intelligence Bureau (IB) should submit its report/inputs within 4-6 weeks from the date of recommendation of HC collegium to the Centre, which should forward the file to SC within 8-12 weeks from the date of receipt of views from the state and IB report. The CJI , thereafter, would send recommendations/advice to the law minister within four weeks. The Centre would make the appointment immediately or it can send the recommendation back for reconsideration and if the names are reiterated then they should be appointed within 3-4 weeks.The apex court had last reiterated that govt could bring-in a new system by passing law but had said that ""no system can be perfect"". It had said the present situation of delay in appointment was not healthy and it discouraged meritorious lawyers from accepting judgeship.","President has signed the warrants of appointment for the chief justices of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madras, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh and Jharkhand.

""Some traders are selling frozen hilsa from Myanmar, which lacks the taste of hilsa from the Padma-Meghna river system that connoisseurs in Bengal appreciate,"" Fish Importers' Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood said.The backdrop of this hilsa diplomacy is complex. Former PM Sheikh Hasina had banned the export of hilsa to India in 2012, after talks over Teesta water-sharing agreement stalled. While Hasina lifted the ban before Durga puja in 2019, the new political landscape in Bangladesh had led many to believe that hilsa trade was unlikely to resume.Traders estimate prices in Kolkata market will hover between Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000 a kg, depending on the supply. Resumption of hilsa exports underscores importance of this fish in broader cultural and diplomatic relationship between Bangladesh and India. Whether the catch meets expectations remains to be seen, but return of hilsa diplomacy has again bridged borders in time for a festive celebration.","Bangladesh approves 3,000 tonne of the prized hilsa fish for export to India.

The boy who could do no wrong

KOZHIKODE: A man from Wayanad who briefly trained for the clergy before migrating to Norway in search of greener pastures has emerged as an alleged link in the sensational pager explosions in Lebanon on Tuesday that targeted Hezbollah fighters and killed 12 people, including civilians, and injured dozens.Norta Global Ltd, based in Sofia, Bulgaria - allegedly owned by Rinson Jose (37) of Wayanad, now a Norwegian citizen - is being probed by international security agencies following reports linking it to the sale of hundreds of pagers.Central intelligence agencies and Kerala Police special branch collected details on Friday about Rinson from his native village, Ondayangadi, near Mananthavady, Wayanad. Wayanad district police chief Taposh Basumathary said police had done a normal background check. ""Now that the identity and details of the family have come out in the media, police have taken steps to ensure they are safe. We are patrolling the area,"" he said.Family sources said Rinson, son of Moothedath Jose and Gracy, who used to work as tailors, had gone abroad with his twin brother, who now works in the UK. His sister is a nurse in Ireland. He lives in Norway with his wife and had last come home in Nov 2023 and returned in Jan 2024.""Rinson last spoke to his family here three days ago. They haven't been able to contact him on the phone since. We tried calling Rinson's wife on Friday as well, but no one answered. The news reports about him are unbelievable; he could also have been deceived,"" Rinson's uncle, Thankachan, told TOI.Hungarian media reported that Norta Global had facilitated the sale of the pagers. The firm's website - which described it as a leading technology company with strong focus on consulting, technology and payment integration, recruitment & outsourcing - has been taken down now.However, Bulgaria's State Agency for National Security said that Norta Global and its owner had ""not carried out any transaction linked to the sale or purchase of the merchandise"" or that which ""falls under laws on terrorism financing"".Reuters had reported on Thursday that Norta's Bulgarian headquarters was registered at an apartment building near Sofia that was also home to nearly 200 other companies, but there was no sign of Norta.Reuters said Rinson declined to comment on the pagers when reached by phone and hung up when asked about the Bulgarian business.Amund Djuve, the CEO of DN Media, where Jose currently works, told Reuters he was aware of the reports and had alerted police and security services. He said that Jose was travelling to the US.Oslo Police said it had initiated ""preliminary enquiries into the information that had come to light"". Norway's domestic intelligence agency, PST, said it was aware of the situation and declined to comment further, Reuters reported.According to Rinson's LinkedIn page, he has been working in the Oslo-based DN Media Group in Norway for nearly five years and was involved in leading digitisation, automation, and growth across multiple brands/publications. Besides mentioning him as an entrepreneur running NortaLink, an IT service, consultancy, procurement, and recruiting company from 2016 onwards, it identifies him as co-founder of an IT recruiting and business development firm and IT recruitment firm StarCruiter. Rinson had pursued a master's in international social welfare and health policy at Oslo Metropolitan University from 2012 to 2015. The profile also claims he was general secretary of International Students Union of Norway for one year from Sept 2012.In Ondayangadi, residents of the area said they knew Rinson as an upright person, while his shocked family members said they were sure he would not do anything wrong. Rinson's uncle, Thankachan, said Rinson studied at Ondayangadi school, then went to a seminary for a year, and later continued his studies in Wayanad and Bengaluru. He had worked at a call centre in Bengaluru and acquired an MBA from Pondicherry in 2010 before heading to Norway for higher studies. He said he didn't know of Rinson owning a company there. ""He was an employee at an organisation... The family is not that well off. Even now, his parents do tailoring work at home,"" he said.","Norta Global Ltd, based in Sofia, Bulgaria - allegedly owned by Rinson Jose (37) of Wayanad, now a Norwegian citizen - is being probed by international security agencies.

""At least nine innocent tribals have been shot dead and dozens injured at Khagarachari while over 100 houses and shops have been burnt at Dighinala Sadar,"" the Chakma leaders said in the memorandum.The memorandum stated that on September 12 the Prothom Alo had reported attacks and damages to at least 1,090 houses, business establishments and places of worship belonging to the minority communities between August 5 and 20 after the fall of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government. The leaders said that the attacks were being carried out in order to counter the growing use of the democratic space by the hill people and drive out the hill tribes out of the CHTs.On Thursday, the indigenous hill tribe students had organised “March For Identity” at Khagrachari under the banner of “Sanghat O Boishamyo Birodhi Pahari Chhatra Andolan” (Anti Conflict & Discrimination Tribal Students Movement) demanding recognition of their rights and guarantee for distinct identities. About 40,000 tribals had participated in the march.The Chittagong Hill Tracts was a tribal dominated area and despite having 98.5% non-Muslims, the Bengal Boundary Commission awarded the region to Pakistan during the partition of India in 1947. From 1979 to 1983, then Pakistan President General Ziaur Rahman implanted about 5,00,000 illegal plain settlers belonging to Muslim faith to reduce indigenous peoples of the CHTs into a minority on their own land. The illegal plain settlers presently constitute more than 50% of the total populations in the CHTs.",Leaders of Chakma community on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi not to hold any dialogue or meeting with Mohammed Yunus.

Expanding Air India's punctuality woes leave flyers frustrated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/expanding-air-indias-punctuality-woes-leave-flyers-frustrated/articleshow/113562007.cms,"NEW DELHI: ""Set your watches boys, we are right on schedule."" A beaming J R D Tata had remarked when Air India 's (AI) maiden international flight, which left Bombay on June 8, 1948, for London via Cairo and Geneva, reached its destination the next day. That's folklore for AI passengers now, especially those taking its USP medium to ultra long hauls, due to frequent long delays.While nobody expected miracles within two-and-a-half years of the airline returning to founder Tata Group in Jan 2022 after nearly seven decades as a PSU, AI's poor on time performance (OTP) is now irking and inconveniencing passengers who prefer not to look at their watches on delayed flights.Vistara, which was more punctual, will be merged into AI on Nov 12.Sample this: On Aug 31, 2024, Mumbai-London AI 129 left nearly nine hours after its scheduled departure time of 5.15am. The same day, Mumbai-New York (JFK) left after a 12-hour delay. AI 129, flight tracking sites show, left after 2pm on Aug 28, 29 and 30. And on Aug 23 and 24, it left after 8am. The list of delays is an endless one. A flight operating within 15 minutes of its scheduled departure/arrival time is considered on time.AI's domestic punctuality is also in the pits. Only struggling-to-survive SpiceJet and Alliance Air have seen worse OTP than it in recent months, as per DGCA data (see box). But passengers have options on domestic routes. AI's domestic market share in CY 2023 was 9.7%. International, however, is another story. AI offers the maximum medium to ultra long haul nonstops to North America, Europe, Far East and Australia.On many routes like Delhi-Chicago/San Francisco (SFO)/Washington; Mumbai-New York/SFO and Bengaluru-SFO, AI is the only direct service. For North America, AI direct flights are the fastest option as the airline overflies Russia and takes the shortest route. Delay of these flights is testing the patience of the loyal customer base of diaspora and Indian globetrotters that are so crucial for the airline.According to OAG, the top three airlines for international capacity share from India in April 2024 were Air India (20%), IndiGo (17%) and Emirates (7%).Comments were sought from AI on its international flight delays - why they are happening with such regularity and what is being about the same - and were awaited till the time of going to press.Recently, DGCA had to intervene after three back-to-back really long delays this summer: Mumbai-SFO AI 179 of May 24 by 18 hours; Delhi-SFO of May 30 by over 30 hours and June 1 Delhi-Vancouver by over 20 hours. ""AI is time and again failing in taking due care of passengers,"" the DGCA notice at that time said. DGCA does not give OTP figures for international flights.TOI spoke to a cross section of stakeholders to find out the reason for AI's poor performance. The common reasons - engineering and maintenance issues that are leading to poor technical dispatch reliability; frequent grounding of aircraft due to snags; spare shortage and poor crew planning.""In this backdrop, AI has bitten off more than it can chew in terms of having so many flights which it cannot operate without frequent delays or seeing cancellations. They are over-sweating the planes,"" said sources. AI has both added a number of international flights.Multiple stakeholders spoke about a management disconnect with the ground realities and the new managers not taking the legacy team along. ""They have antagonised the old key employees and keep criticising them. So many long-time employees now feel disconnected. Everything is on multiple apps and emails. If something is to be reported, do so by email. A reply may come a few days later,"" said multiple people.Even AI insiders admit that these issues will not get resolved just by inducting new aircraft. AI Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL) was hived off when AI was privatised. ""Systems and processes have to be in place. Our long hauls operate on the edge of the maximum carrying capacity and limit of aircraft. Even a small issue means leaving passengers or baggage behind; delaying or cancelling flights. Bombay House (Tata HQ) is seized of the matter; is watching the situation closely and is asking the questions that need to be asked,"" they said.","Air India's poor on time performance (OTP) is now irking and inconveniencing passengers.

MUMBAI: Tensions rose in Dharavi after a large number of residents gathered on streets to protest against BMC's move to demolish unauthorised construction at the Subhani mosque on the 90 ft road, forcing the civic team to discontinue the action on Saturday, reports Sanjeev Devasia. Police registered a case after stones were pelted at a BMC vehicle.A large crowd gathered to protest the action at around 9 am.Subsequently, according to BMC, after mosque's trustees sought a period of four to five days to remove the encroached construction on their own, BMC gave them that deadline. According to BMC, an eviction notice was earlier served and action was initiated as per the notice.The G-North ward had initiated action to carry out demolition of unauthorised parts of the mosque twice this year, the latest on Sept 5, but the action was stopped at the last moment on both occasions. Action was stopped in Jan due to instructions from top authorities.Political activists questioned BMC action and claimed some repairs have been carried out for the safety of the structure and BMC has no right to now demolish the structure as Dharavi redevelopment project has come into being and the mosque had a photo pass. ""Police were not prepared, and told us the situation could slip out of hands and result in violence,"" said a BMC official.","A large number of residents gathered on streets to protest against BMC's move to demolish unauthorised construction at the Subhani mosque.

"BJP, Congress intensify war of words as PM Modi visits US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-congress-intensify-war-of-words-as-pm-modi-visits-us/articleshow/113561629.cms,"Posters attacking PM creations of ‘Anti-India hate shop’, tied to Rahul’s recent US trip: Trivedi

BJP spreading lies, says Rahul, stands by his remarks on Sikhs

With posters attacking PM Narendra Modi circulating in the US on the day he reached there, BJP attacked Rahul Gandhi for the campaign linking it to leader of opposition's recent visit to the country.Dubbing the posters as creations of ""anti-India hate shop"", BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said, ""There is suspicion among Indians that if it is an outcome of Rahul Gandhi's warm meetings with the established and sponsored anti-India groups there as he has returned from the US only a few days back.Or is it the same group which was facilitating meetings of these pawns of anti-India forces with Rahul Gandhi,"" he said in a statement.The poster, shared by BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya on X, reads, ""Protest: Modi, You're Not Welcome in New York"" and calls on people to ""raise your voice against a decade of oppression."" A demonstration is planned for Sunday, September 22, at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Long Island.Trivedi said what is painful about the ""low blow"" from this ""nafrat ki dukan"" (hate shop) is that it is directed at a Prime Minister who took India to among the five top economies from 'Fragile Five', lifted over 26 crore people out of extreme poverty, turned the country into a pioneer in digital revolution and strengthened its internal and external security. The frustration arising from India's growing power and acceptance is born out of jealousy and nervousness, Trivedi said. ""This is an objectionable poster,"" Trivedi said. ""It is a hate advertisement and it is beyond doubt that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi got the meeting and support of those forces who are declared enemies of India...""Malviya said Gandhi's overseas engagements have consistently been detrimental to India's image. ""Every time Rahul Gandhi goes abroad, he indulges in the most divisive anti-India politics, including hobnobbing with agencies and collaborating with forces inimical to India's interest. He has gone to the extent of pleading with western powers to interfere in Indian politics.""Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi justified his recent remarks in the US that the ""fight"" in India is not about politics but whether a Sikh is allowed to wear turban and kada, and can visit gurdwara and all are free to practice their religion without fear.His post on X, an assertion that he does not regret his remarks, came after the BJP cited a joint statement of various Sikh groups to ask Rahul to withdraw his statement.Rahul said, ""The BJP has been spreading lies about my remarks in America. I want to ask every Sikh brother and sister in India and abroad - is there anything wrong in what I have said? Shouldn't India be a country where every Sikh - and every Indian - can freely practice their religion without fear?""He added, ""They are desperate to silence me because they cannot stand the truth... but I will always speak up for the values that define India: our unity in diversity, equality, and love.""At a gathering of Indian-Americans in Herndon, a Virginia suburb of Washington DC, Gandhi recently said, ""first of all, you have to understand what the fight is about. The fight is not about politics. That is superficial."" In the clip, Gandhi then asked a Sikh man sitting among the audience: ""what is your name, brother with the turban?""After the man shared his name, Gandhi said: ""The fight is about whether he, as a Sikh, is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India or he, as a Sikh, is going to be allowed to wear a 'kada' in India. Or he, as a Sikh, is going to be able to go to a gurdwara. That's what the fight is about. And not just for him, for all religions"".""And what the RSS is basically saying is that certain states are inferior to other states, certain languages are inferior to other languages, certain religions are inferior to other religions and certain communities are inferior to other communities. This is what the fight is about,"" Gandhi added.","Posters attacking PM Narendra Modi circulating in the US on the day he reached there.
