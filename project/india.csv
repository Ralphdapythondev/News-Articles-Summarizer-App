This is her first stint in the Upper House after serving 6 terms in Lok Sabha. This is will be the first time that Sonia would not contest in the Lok Sabha election since entering politics nearly two-and-a-half decades ago.Sonia had penned a letter to the voters of Rae Bareli announcing that she will not contest Lok Sabha polls due to health concerns.

Doordarshan's 'saffron' logo sparks political slugfest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doordarshans-saffron-logo-sparks-political-slugfest/articleshow/109465416.cms,"NEW DELHI: The visual makeover for Doordarshan 's news channels marked by a change in the colour of its logo from red to orange has sparked a controversy , with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and I&B minister locking horns over what the opposition called an attempt to ""saffronise"" the national broadcaster.Mamata slammed the move calling it ""absolutely unethical, grossly illegal, and speaks loudly of the pro-BJP bias of the national public broadcaster"" and demanded Election Commission's intervention.I&B minister Anurag Thakur, however, shrugged off the charge and suggested that Mamata's stand was in keeping with her resistance to ""anything saffron "".Prasar Bharti CEO Gaurav Dwivedi also pushed against the charge saying, ""No surprises there, your love for 'saffron' is publicly known :) Didi, Bharat Mata ki Jai."" He argued that the move was meant for visual enhancement and the colour that has raised hackles is, in fact, orange and not saffron as being alleged.Congress MP and former I&B minister Manish Tewari criticised the switch saying it was a move to assert BJP govt's control over the public broadcaster. ""This is an attempt on the part of the govt to saffronise and capture the govt institutions. The said move clearly undermines the neutrality and credibility of India's public broadcaster,"" he wrote on X.TMC MP Jawahar Sircar, who served as CEO of Prasar Bharati, also criticised the alleged saffronisation of the national broadcaster saying, ""As ex-CEO of Prasar Bharati it hurts to see the saffronisation of Doordarshan's logo - just before elections! It will influence voters, by overlaying the colour one religion and Sangh Parivar colour with a 'neutral' Public Broadcaster and a biassed Govt/Regime.""Dwivedi, however, argued that the adoption of a vibrant, visually appealing colour was part of the channel's branding and aesthetic upgrade. ""The colour is orange, not saffron,"" he clarified, further explaining, ""It's not just the logo that underwent change, the entire visual identity has been revamped. It's regrettable that people are reading more into this than necessary. We've been working on revitalising DD's look and feel for the past six to eight months.""Established on Sept 15, 1959, the national broadcaster had its logo designed by Devashish Bhattacharya, a student of the National Institute of Design.Contrary to political speculations, the broadcaster clarified that the colour change is rooted in the logo's history and aesthetic appeal. It pointed out that the original logo, chosen by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and introduced in 1976 along with theme music composed by Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Ahmed Hussain Khan, featured an orange hue against a green backdrop.The vice-president of Andhra BJP, Vishnu Vardhan Reddy attacked the critics saying, ""When #Doordarshan was launched in 1959, it had a saffron logo. Now, as the govt reintroduces the original logo, liberals and #Congress are outraging over it. It's blatantly obvious they harbour hate against 'Bhagwa' and Hindus.""","Mamata Banerjee and I&B minister Anurag Thakur lock horns over colour of Doordarshan's logo.

Deepfakes, or digitally altered video and photos, have started to crop up online as India prepares to vote in the Lok Sabha elections 2024 from April 19. Following a fake video of Bollywood actor Aamir Khan endorsing a political party made rounds on the internet, a digitally manipulated clip of actor Ranveer Singh is being shared online.In the video, the actor is shown criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government at the centre, at the same time seeking votes for Congress.The video ends with Singh urging voters to vote for “nyaay” and the tagline 'Vote For Congress ' is seen flashing on the screen.It doesn’t take a second look to identify that the video is doctored. The lip movements of the actor in the video clearly doesn't match the audio. Notably, it is an old video shot when the actor visited Kashi, and in fact praised PM Modi for changing the face of the 'City of Ghats'.In the original video, Singh says, “I cannot express in words the experience that I have had today. I have been a devotee of lord Shiva and I have come here for the first time…” Here’s the original video:Recently, Aamir Khan filed an FIR against a deepfake video that showed him endorsing a specific political party. The actor’s office strongly denied any connection to politics or affiliation with any political party and issued a statement.“We want to clarify [that] Aamir Khan has never endorsed any political party in his 35-year career. He has dedicated his efforts to raising public awareness through campaigns for the Election Commission for many past elections,” the actor’s office said in the statement, as per news agency ANI.“We are alarmed now to see a recent viral video alleging Mr Khan is promoting a particular party. He would like to clarify [that] this is a fake and totally untrue video. He has reported the matter to various authorities, including filing an FIR with the Cyber Crime Cell of Mumbai Police,” the statement added.A video appears to be from his TV show “Satyamev Jayate,” that aired almost a decade ago.","Deepfakes, or digitally altered video and photos, have started to crop up online as India prepares to vote in the Lok Sabha elections 2024 from April 19.
