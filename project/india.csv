The FDI which stood at Rs 4.42 lakh crore in FY 21-22 reduced to Rs 3.67 lakh crore in FY 22-23, Rs 3.427 lakh crore in FY 23-24,"" Patil stated.""The FDI equity investment in FY 23-24 has seen a reduction of just 3 per cent as compared to the previous year. However, this fall is over 25% as compared to the previous four years,"" Patil said.Patil argued that there is a negative impact on the state also as it is true for the entire country. ""But, there is no sharp decline in FY 23-24. The state government has taken constructive measures to better the scenario,"" he elaborated.He also emphasized that despite many challenges, Karnataka has attracted investments worth crores across various sectors.""Despite many challenges and adverse geopolitical conditions, Karnataka has attracted investments worth Rs1.13 lakh crore in 2023-24 across various sectors of ESDM, Li-ion Battery Manufacturing for EVs (Electric Vehicles), Core Manufacturing (Steel), Automobiles, Data Centres, among many others. The manufacturing sector has shown promising momentum,"" he added.Patil also mentioned that the central government has been focusing on local assembling industries in the manufacturing sector. However, such industries need to depend on foreign countries for their operations.""The hurdles in supplying components from foreign countries and tax norms have negatively impacted these industries resulting in a decrease in FDI.

"Install advanced safety system, govt tells dam owners amid forecast of above normal rainfall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/install-advanced-safety-system-govt-tells-dam-owners-amid-forecast-of-above-normal-rainfall/articleshow/110650016.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the country expecting 'above normal' rainfall during the four-month (June-September) monsoon season, the Centre has notified new regulations asking every owner of the specified dams to install a well-designed hydro-meteorological instrumentation network for inflow forecasting and flood warning.The move comes at a time when the forecast of 'above normal' rainfall indicates the possibility of a situation where filling up the dams to their full capacity may lead to flooding of low-lying areas in case of discharge of excess water for dam safety. The specified dams are those which fall under the National Register of Large Dams. There are 5,745 large dams in the country.As per the register, there are 234 large dams in India, which are more than 100-year-old whose safety is a major concern when their catchment areas get fairly good rainfall during monsoon. Madhya Pradesh has the highest number (63) of more than 100-year-old dams followed by Maharashtra (44), Gujarat (30), Rajasthan (25) and Telangana (21).Seeking to achieve the satisfactory level of dam safety assurance, the regulations notified by the National Dam Safety Authority on May 20, also asked every state dam safety organisation to keep ""perpetual surveillance of all specified dams under their jurisdiction, to observe various anomalies including cracks in the body of the dam or abutment, unusual seepage, deflection in the dam body and any other problem related to dam or hydro-mechanical equipment"" for the safety of the dams.Responsibility for safety of dams, including its operation and maintenance, rests primarily with dam owners which are mostly the state governments and central/state Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs). At present dam owners generally carry out the safety audit in terms of periodical pre-monsoon and post-monsoon inspection of their dams.According to the notification, hydro-meteorological stations of specified dams will now have to constantly measure rainfall (precipitation), water level, discharge, temperature, humidity, evaporation, wind velocity and direction, and snowfall, if any, for monitoring the safety of dams.","The Centre has notified new regulations asking every owner of the specified dams to install a well-designed hydro-meteorological instrumentation network for inflow forecasting and flood warning.

Rewilding in tiger reserves helps near-extinct vultures soar again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rewilding-in-tiger-reserves-helps-near-extinct-vultures-soar-again/articleshow/110646083.cms,"In Jan, when a bronze statue of ‘Jatayu’—the mythical vulture who fought valiantly to save Sita from Ravana—was unveiled at the Ram Temple consecration in Ayodhya, twenty real-life Jatayus or vultures—in desperate need of their own heroic rescue—were soft-released into the lush Tadoba and Pench tiger reserves in Maharashtra . This move was part of a vulture reintroduction program by the Bombay Natural History Society ( BNHS ) and a significant step forward in helping these unsung heroes — who do the dirty work of cleaning up after death and keeping the environment healthy — make a comeback from the brink of extinction .Over the next one year, 30 more vultures, out of 750 white-rumped, slender-billed, and long-billed vultures bred at various BNHS centres, will be rewilded in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan.“BNHS undertook the strategy of reintroducing vultures in tiger habitats with a large prey base to restore vultures in their predestined role as nature’s sanitation crew,” says Praveen Pardeshi, president, BNHS. “We intend to do the same in sanctuaries like Melghat and Koyna in Maharashtra that don’t have vultures as well as in other states.”Helping vultures reclaim their place in the ecosystem was crucial, according to Pardeshi, and the “next big challenge” following their 2003 discovery of ‘Diclofenac’, a veterinary drug used to treat cattle that was causing mass kidney failure in vultures after they scavenged treated livestock.This revelation explained the mystery behind the massive crash in vulture population in the '80s and '90s that had baffled scientists and prompted the International Union for Conservation of Nature to declare that the Indian vulture was “only one step away from total extinction.” By 2007, 99% of vultures in India—once numbering 40 million— had disappeared, with serious consequences for the environment. Following the findings, the Indian government banned the drug’s veterinary use in 2006.Despite this, India’s vultures continued to face threats—rapid habitat loss and starvation due to diminished forage. “Almost no farmer leaves their dead cattle outside anymore but buries them because of which no food is available for vultures, as it formerly was, in farmland areas,” notes Pardeshi. He hopes that ample food in Tadoba and Pench National Parks will sustain the vultures, allowing them to recycle the remains of prey hunted by tigers, leopards, and wild dogs and complete vital carbon and nitrogen cycles.India’s vulture conservation story — that began when BNHS joined forces with the Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, and Haryana forest departments about a decade ago to breed these vital but vulnerable scavengers that often get a bad rap for their ungainly look and scavenging habits— gained international attention at the first ever World Species Congress last month.Hosted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the virtual 24-hour gathering brought together government and environmental agencies to conservationists, wildlife groups and students to chart a “coordinated map of key actions” aimed at species recovery. It’s taken years of work to artificially hatch new fledglings of the three most endangered vulture species every year, research the safety of veterinary drugs, and identify regions in need of protection, “But the fight to revive vulture populations in the wild has not yet been won,” says Kishor Rithe, director of BNHS. “Sensitization of pharmacists and identifying vulture safe zones are some of the challenges before us,” he adds, given pharmacy surveys in 2017–18 that revealed yet again that diclofenac was still easily available.While BNHS teams are currently out in the field conducting pharmacy surveys, carcass sampling, educating cattle owners and sensitising villagers about vulture nesting colonies, they’re also raising funds to create ‘Vulture Safe Zones’ in UP, MP, and Assam, within a 100 km radius of the release sites, to keep vultures safe beyond the tiger reserves.“Also, the birds set to take off into the wild will be GPS or satellite tagged to track their movements. With support from the central and state governments, along with international funding agencies, India will definitely be able to revive its Jatayu population to earlier times, and large congregations of vultures will finally soar in the skies freely after nearly two decades,” says an optimistic Rithe.","In Jan, a bronze statue of ‘Jatayu’ was unveiled at the Ram Temple consecration in Ayodhya. 20 real-life Jatayus or vultures were soft-released into the lush Tadoba and Pench tiger reserves in Maharashtra.

History of Exit Polls

Difference between opinion poll and exit poll

When will the exit poll be declared?

NEW DELHI: The assembly elections in four states- Arunachal Pradesh Sikkim , Odisha , and Andhra Pradesh were concluded along with the Lok Sabha elections and now all have turned their attention to exit poll predictions which will be released on Saturday evening.Researchers conduct exit polls by asking questions from voters immediately after they have cast their ballots at the polling station. The purpose of these polls is to forecast the outcome of the election using the data gathered from voters on the day of the election itself.Exit polls serve as a tool to gauge the sentiment of the electorate and provide an early indication of the likely winners and losers. However, the accuracy of exit polls has been a subject of debate, as they have been known to miss the mark in some instances.Exit polls in India have a long history, with the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) being the pioneer in developing indigenous exit polls in the 1960s. However, it wasn't until the 1980s that media poll surveys became prominent.During this period, psephologist Prannoy Roy collaborated with David Butler to conduct in-depth studies on Indian elections. Their research and findings were compiled into the influential book ""The Compendium of Indian Elections,"" co-authored by Prannoy Roy, David Butler, and Ashok Lahiri. This publication marked a significant milestone in the analysis and understanding of electoral trends in India.Opinion polls are surveys which are carried out to find the voter sentiment regardless if they wish to vote or not, prior to the actual voting process. However, exit polls are performed immediately after individuals have exercised their right to vote on the designated election day.The exit poll of Assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha will be announced on Saturday, after 6:00 pm.The assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim were held on April 19 in first phase while assembly polls in Andhra Pradesh were held in the fourth phase on May 13. Meanwhile, Odisha assembly elections were held in four phases from May 13 to June 1.The results for the Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim assembly elections will be declared on June 2 while results for Odisha and Andhra Pradesh will be announced on June 4.","The exit poll of Assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha will be announced on Saturday, after 6:00 pm.

Plea hearing on June 5

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday surrendered at Tihar jail after paying obeisance at Mahatma Gandhi's memorial at Rajghat and praying at the Hanuman Temple in Connaught Place. He also went to the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) office and met with workers and party leaders.The CM was flanked by his wife Sunita, Delhi ministers and other top AAP leaders throughout his 'journey' back to jail.Moments after Kejriwal surrendered at Tihar jail after his Supreme Court-ordered interim bail came to an end, a Delhi court sent him to judicial custody till June 5.The court noted that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently moved an application seeking judicial custody of Arvind Kejriwal. The application was pending as he was on interim bail.After his surrender on Sunday, the application was taken by the Duty Judge of Rouse Avenue Court. Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal decided to send him to judicial custody till June 5.Kejriwal was produced from jail via video conferencing.Before surrendering, Kejriwal addressed party workers at the AAP HQ in Delhi.""The Supreme Court granted me bail for 21 days to campaign for elections. I want to thank SC for that. Today, I am going to Tihar Jail again. I did not waste even a minute of these 21 days. I did not campaign only for AAP but for various parties. I want to say to the people of Delhi that I am going to jail again, not because I have done a scam but because I have raised my voice against dictatorship ... PM Modi accepted this in front of the country that he does not have any evidence against me.""""PM Modi said in an interview that I believe that there is no proof or recovery against Kejriwal because he is an experienced thief. Let's assume that I am an experienced thief, you don't have any proof or any recovery against me so you put me in jail without any proof?... He gave a message to the whole country that if I can put him in jail in a fake case, then what is your stand? I will arrest anyone and put them in jail. I am fighting against this dictatorship and our country cannot tolerate this kind of dictatorship,"" he said at the party HQ.Lashing out at the exit polls which have predicted a resounding victory for the NDA, Kejriwal said: ""Take it in writing, all these exit polls are fake. One exit poll gave 33 seats to BJP in Rajasthan whereas there are only 25 seats there ... The real issue is why they had to do a fake exit poll 3 days before the day of counting. There are several theories regarding this, one of them is that they are trying to manipulate the machines (EVMs).""""I went to Connaught Place where I sought blessings of Lord Hanuman at the Hanuman Mandir. June 4 is also Tuesday and Lord Hanuman will destroy the dictators in our nation,"" he added.""Bhagat Singh said that when the power becomes a dictatorship, then jail becomes a responsibility ... Bhagat Singh was hanged to free the country. This time when I am going to jail, I don't know when I will come back ...

"After Jairam Ramesh alleged Amit Shah called DMs, EC says furnish details",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-jairam-ramesh-alleged-amit-shah-called-dms-ec-says-furnish-details/articleshow/110646031.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a firm counter, Election Commission on Sunday asked Congress neta Jairam Ramesh to back up his charge that Amit Shah had been calling up and “intimidating” district magistrates (DMs), who are also returning officers (ROs), ahead of counting, and sought details of the DMs contacted by the home minister as well as the factual basis of his “information”.In a letter to Ramesh on Sunday, EC noted that “the process of counting of votes is a sacred duty cast upon every RO and such public statements by a senior, responsible and experienced leader tend to put an element of doubt and thus, deserves to be addressed in larger public interest”. While underlining that no DM had reported any such attempt at undue influence, EC sought details and information from Ramesh that “he believes to be true”.“You, being a responsible, experienced and very senior leader of a national party, must have made such public statement, just before the day of counting, based on facts/information you believe to be true. It is requested that details of 150 DMs to whom such calls have been allegedly made by the home minister along with the factual matrix/basis of your information are shared by 1900 hours today... ie June 2, so that appropriate action can be taken,” EC said in its letter to the Congress general secretary in charge of communications.Significantly, EC has scheduled a press conference on Monday where it is likely to speak on several issues, including the “pattern” of doubts being raised on well-established electoral processes during general elections.Ramesh had, in a post on X on Saturday, claimed that “the outgoing home minister has been calling up DMs/collectors and had spoken to 150 DMs thus far”. “This is blatant and brazen intimidation, showing how desperate the BJP is. Let it be very clear: the will of the people shall prevail, and on June 4, Modi, Shah, and BJP will exit, and the INDIA Janbandhan will be victorious. Officers should not get under any pressure and must uphold the Constitution. They are under watch,” he had said.During the period of enforcement of model code of conduct, all officers are deemed to be on deputation to the EC and report directly to it.EC has been proactive through this election in either rebutting uncorroborated allegations — as it did in the case of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge ’s charge that there was mismanagement and delay in release of EVM data, even terming it a biased and deliberate attempt at spreading confusion.“EC cannot be a mute spectator to ‘shoot and scoot’ attacks by politicians, especially when they tend to create confusion in the minds of voters about electoral processes or create a false narrative. People tend to believe senior leaders, who should be responsible and desist from making unverified claims and attacks,” an EC functionary said.On Sunday, the Delhi chief electoral officer rebutted Congress neta Ajay Maken’s allegation — also made via a social media post — that the candidates’ counting agents would not be allowed at the assistant returning officer’s table. “It is clarified that counting agents of candidates are allowed at the tables of RO/AROs,” the Delhi CEO’s office posted on his official handle.","EC asks Congress neta Jairam Ramesh to back up his charge that Amit Shah had been calling up and “intimidating’ district magistrates.

The crash had left two software engineers in Kalyaninagar dead.Crime branch's investigating officer Sunil Tambe produced the teenager's parents before special judge AS Waghmare and moved a plea through the prosecutor, seeking their remand for seven days.

The duo, who was captured in the cameras on the hospital premises, is a vital link in the probe, Tambe said.According to the police, Dr Halnor collected blood from the minor but did not store it in a vial. Later, he drew sample from his mother, labelled a vial with the teenager's name, and sent it to the forensic science laboratory to test for alcohol content, Tambe said.

KOLHAPUR: Five inmates of Kolhapur’s Kalamba Central Jail attacked and killed another 59-year-old inmate convicted in the 1993 Bombay serial blasts case on Sunday morning.Munna — whose known aliases included Mohammad Alikhan and Manojkumar Bhawarlal Gupta — was beaten up with the concrete and metal cover of the drainage chamber near the prison ’s bathing well at 7.55am.CBI had registered a case against Munna at STF police station in Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act. He was brought to the Kalamba Central Jail in 2013. Before that, he was lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail.The attackers have been identified as Bablu (alias Sandip Shankar Chavan), Pratik (alias Pilya Suresh Patil), Ruturaj (alias Degya Vinayak Inamdar), Sourabh Vikas Sidh and Dipak Netaji Khot. While Bablu, Pratik and Ruturaj have been arrested under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), Sourabh and Dipak are in judicial custody. On Sunday morning, the five men approached Munna, who had come to the bathing well, and attacked him. Munna suffered deep cuts and started bleeding profusely. One prison worker tried to intervene, but he was also attacked.Swati Sathe, the deputy inspector general (prisons) said: “We are yet to ascertain the motive behind the attack, but the safety of the inmates is our prime concern. There are four convicts of the Bombay serial blast case currently lodged in the Kalamba. For their safety, we will separate them from the regular inmates. If required, we will shift them to other prisons. We will also increase CCTV coverage in the prison.”A case under IPC sections 302 (murder), 353 (assault on public servant), 323 (causing hurt voluntarily), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (armed rioting), 149 (common object to commit offence) has been registered against the five attackers at the Juna Rajwada police station.The primary investigation has revealed that some animosity had been brewing between the attackers and the deceased for along time.Sanjeevkumar Zade, the inspector of the Juna Rajwada police station, told TOI: “We are going to seek permission from the court to get the attackers’ custody. The motive behind the murder can be known after an investigation.”The Kalamba Central Jail has been mired in controversies over the past couple of years. The authorities have recovered banned narcotic substances such as ganja, mobile phones and SIM cards from inside the prison. Recently, more than 200 cellphones were reco vered from the jail. Amitabh Gupta, director-general (prisons), had dismissed 11 staffers, including two officials, for neglecting safety in the prison.Munna was a habitual absconder and a criminal who had escorted Tiger Memon, the prime accused in the serial blasts, in a four-wheeler from Mumbai to Raigad for the Shekhadi landing of a huge cache of arms, ammunition, hand grenades and RDX before the 1993 blasts.

What the exit polls predicted

NEW DELHI: A day after the exit poll results of the Lok Sabha elections 2024 gave a historic third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the NDA securing 350-400 seats, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi dismissed the pollsters terming it ""Modi media poll"" and ""fantasy poll"". The BJP , however, dismissed him with ""daydreaming"" jibe.""It is not exit poll, it is Modi media poll. It is his fantasy poll,"" the Congress leader told reporters after meeting with party's Lok Sabha MPs via video conference.When questioned about the number of seats the INDIA alliance would secure, Gandhi said, ""Have you heard Sidhu Moose Wala 's song '295'?

He stated that the INDIA alliance had a detailed discussion on numbers and it's impossible for them to get anything below 295 seats.Expressing confidence, Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy said the Congress will win at least 10 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats in the state and that the INDIA bloc would form a government at the Centre. He cited a post by BJP on 'X', where the saffron party claimed it would get four-five Lok Sabha seats in Telangana.The exit polls, released on Saturday, unanimously predicted a third term for PM Modi, with NDA expected to perform at least as well as it did in 2019, potentially surpassing the 350-seat mark. Some polls even suggested that BJP's pre-poll target of crossing 400 seats could be achieved.The polls also highlighted BJP's remarkable expansion in the eastern and southern states, particularly in West Bengal and Odisha, where it is projected to outperform the incumbent parties. In Bengal, BJP is expected to win between 19 and 31 of the 42 seats, while in Odisha, projections range from 9 to 20 of the state's 21 seats, with BJD potentially winning a maximum of 10 seats.According to the exit polls, the INDIA alliance is expected to win a maximum of 182 seats, with one poll even suggesting the possibility of the alliance falling below the 100-seat mark.While exit polls are generally considered more accurate than opinion polls conducted before elections, their track record in India has been mixed, with both successes and failures.

As exit polls indicated a likely third term for PM Narendra Modi and his BJP-led NDA, members of opposition INDIA bloc raised doubts about the credibility of the data on Sunday.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and the current chief Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the exit polls were designed to create a favourable perception for Modi and BJP , while suggesting that the party may be engaging in some form of manipulation.Gandhi called the exit polls ""Modi media poll"", saying: ""This is Modi ji's poll, it is a fantasy poll."" Asked how many seats INDIA bloc would secure, he said: ""Have you heard (slain Punjabi rapper) Sidhu Moose Wala's song '295'? We are winning 295 (seats).""West Bengal CM and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee dismissed the exercise as ""vague, fake, and done by BJP stooges"". ""I do not believe in it,"" she said thrice to emphasise her lack of faith in exit polls. ""Those who are working for a high-voltage Modi win, let me tell them that the (post-poll) mathematics is not so easy this time. How long govt (at Centre) will last is doubtful.""Banerjee alleged that the exit polls were prepared two months ago and conducted by a purportedly biased agency with ties to BJP.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav echoed Banerjee's sentiments, labelling the exit polls as a tool of ""pro-BJP media"" designed to manipulate public perception. He suggested that the exit polls, which he said were prepared months in advance, could pave the way for fraudulent practices.""Based on this exit poll, BJP wants to benefit from the share market which opens Monday. If these exit polls were not false and BJP was not losing, then BJP would not have blamed its own people. The disappointed faces of BJP functionaries are showing the truth,"" Yadav said.In Tamil Nadu, both DMK and BJP's former ally AIADMK rejected the exit poll findings. DMK spokesperson TKS Elangovan dismissed predictions of BJP victories in the state and its neighbouring regions, asserting that INDIA bloc would sweep all 39 constituencies in Tamil Nadu.Elangovan said exit polls suggesting a surge in seats for BJP in Karnataka, Telangana and Kerala is flawed. ""In Karnataka, only recently Congress defeated BJP in assembly polls. In Telangana, Congress formed govt by defeating BRS,'' he said.In Bihar, exit polls conducted by different agencies have shown varying results, with LJP (RV) of Chirag Paswan projected to win ""4-6"" seats and CPM ""2-3"" seats in Jharkhand. RJD criticised the discrepancies, particularly noting the projection of LJP (RV) winning more seats than the five it contested.In Maharashtra, pollsters projected that BJP, despite aligning with CM Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar's NCP, will not hit the 41 tally it won in 2019. Sena minister Deepak Kesarkar expressed confidence in his party's performance, despite the challenges of last-minute candidate announcements."," exit polls indicated a likely third term for PM Narendra Modi and his BJP-led NDA.

New Sankalps from the Sadhana in Kanyakumari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-sankalps-from-the-sadhana-in-kanyakumari/articleshow/110645712.cms,"These thoughts were penned by PM

Narendra Modi

on June 1 between 4.15pm and 7pm during his return flight from

to Delhi

My fellow Indians,The biggest festival of democracy, the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, is concluding today in our nation, the Mother of Democracy . After a three-day spiritual journey in Kanyakumari, I have just boarded the plane for Delhi. Through the day, Kashi and numerous other seats have been in the midst of voting.My mind is filled with so many experiences and emotions... I feel a boundless flow of energy within myself. The 2024 Lok Sabha elections are the first in the Amrit Kaal. I began my campaign a few months ago from Meerut, the land of the First War of Independence of 1857. Since then, I have traversed ac-ross the length and breadth of our great nation. The final rally of these elections took me to Hoshiarpur in Punjab, the land of the great Gurus and a land associated with Sant Ravidas Ji. After that, I came to Kanyakumari, at the feet of Maa Bharti.It is natural that the fervour of the elections was echoing in my heart and mind. The multitude of faces seen in rallies and road shows came in front of my eyes. The blessings from our Nari Shakti... the trust, the affection, all of this was a very humbling experience. My eyes were getting moist... I entered into a 'sadhana' (meditative state). And then, the heated political debates, the attacks and counter-attacks, the voices and words of accusations which are so characteristic of an election... they all vanished into a void. A sense of detachment came to grow within me... my mind became completely detached from the external world.Meditation becomes challenging amidst such huge responsibilities, but the land of Kanyakumari and the inspiration of Swami Vivekananda made it effortless. As a candidate myself, I left my campaign in the hands of my beloved people of Kashi and came here.I am also grateful to God for instilling in me these values from birth, which I have cherished and tried to live up to. I was also thinking about what Swami Vivekananda must have experienced during his meditation at this very place in Kanyakumari! A part of my meditation was spent in a similar stream of thoughts.Amidst this detachment, amidst the peace and silence, my mind was constantly thinking about the bright future of Bharat , the goals of Bharat. The rising sun at Kanyakumari gave new heights to my thoughts, the vastness of the ocean expanded my ideas, and the expanse of the horizon continuously made me realise the unity, the Oneness, embedded in the depths of the universe. It seemed as if the observations and experiences undertaken in the lap of the Himalayas decades ago were being revived.Friends,Kanyakumari has always been very close to my heart. The Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari was built under the leadership of Shri Eknath Ranade ji. I had the opportunity to travel extensively with Eknath ji. During the construction of this memorial, I had the opportunity to spend some time in Kanyakumari as well.From Kashmir to Kanyakumari... this is a common identity that is deeply ingrained in the heart of every citizen of the country. This is the 'Shakti Peeth' (seat of Shakti) where Maa Shakti incarnated as Kanya Kumari. At this southern tip, Maa Shakti performed penance and waited for Bhagwan Shiva, who was residing in the Himalayas at the northernmost parts of Bharat.Kanyakumari is the land of confluences. The sacred rivers of our country flow into different seas, and here, those very seas converge. And here, we witness another great confluence - the ideological confluence of Bharat! Here, we find the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, a grand statue of Saint Thiruvalluvar, Gandhi Mandapam, and Kamarajar Mani Mandapam. These streams of thought from these stalwarts converge here to form a confluence of national thought. This gives rise to great inspirations for nation-building. This land of Kanyakumari gives an indelible message of unity, especially to any person who doubts Bharat's nationhood and the sense of unity.The grand statue of Saint Thiruvalluvar in Kanyakumari seems to be looking at the expanse of Maa Bharti from the sea. His work Thirukkural is one of the crown jewels of the beautiful Tamil language. It covers every aspect of life, inspiring us to give our best for ourselves and for the nation. It was my great fortune to pay my respects to such a great figure.Friends,Swami Vivekananda once said, ""Every nation has a message to deliver, a mission to fulfil, a destiny to reach.""For thousands of years, Bharat has been moving forward with this sense of meaningful purpose. Bharat has been a cradle of ideas for thousands of years. We have never considered what we have acquired as our personal wealth or measured it purely by economic or material parameters. Therefore, 'Idam-na-mama' (this is not mine) has become an inherent and natural part of the character of Bharat.Bharat's welfare benefits our planet's journey to progress as well. Take the freedom movement as an example. Bharat gained independence on Aug 15, 1947. At that time, many countries around the world were under colonial rule. Bharat's independence journey inspired and empowered many of those countries to achieve their own freedom. That same spirit was seen decades later when the world came face to face with the once in a century Covid-19 pandemic. When concerns were raised about the poor and developing countries, Bharat's successful efforts provided courage and assistance to many nations.Today, Bharat's governance model has become an example for many countries around the world. Empowering 25 crore people to rise above poverty in just 10 years is unprecedented. Innovative practices such as Pro-People Good Governance, aspirational districts, and aspirational blocks are being discussed globally today. Our efforts, from empowering the poor to last-mile delivery, have inspired the world by prioritising individuals standing at the last rung of society. Bharat's Digital India campaign is now an example for the entire world, showing how we can use technology to empower the poor, bring transparency, and ensure their rights. Inexpensive data in Bharat is becoming a means of social equality by ensuring the reach of information and services to the poor. The whole world is witnessing and studying the democratisation of technology, and major global institutions are advising many countries to adopt elements from our model.Today, Bharat's progress and rise are not just a significant opportunity for Bharat alone, but also a historic opportunity for all our partner countries around the world. Since the success of the G20, the world has been increasingly envisioning a bigger role for Bharat. Today, Bharat is being acknowledged as a strong and important voice of the Global South. The African Union has become a part of the G20 group at the initiative of Bharat. This is going to be a crucial turning point for the future of African countries.Friends,The development trajectory of Bharat fills us with pride and glory, but at the same time, it also reminds the 140 crore citizens of their responsibilities. Now, without wasting a single moment, we must step forward towards greater duties and larger goals. We need to dream new dreams, convert them into reality and begin living those dreams.We must see Bharat's development in a global context, and for this, it is essential that we understand Bharat's internal capabilities. We must acknowledge Bharat's strengths, nurture them, and utilise them for the benefit of the world. In today's global scenario, Bharat's strength as a youthful nation is an opportunity from which we must not look back.The world of the 21st century is looking towards Bharat with many hopes. And we will need to make several changes to move forward in the global scenario. We also need to change our traditional thinking regarding reform. Bharat cannot limit reform to just economic reforms. We must move forward in every aspect of life towards the direction of reform. Our reforms should also align with the aspirations of a 'Viksit Bharat' (developed India) by 2047.We must also understand that reform can never be a unidimensional process for any country. Therefore, I have laid out the vision of reform, perform, and transform for the country. The responsibility of reform lies with leadership. Based on that, our bureaucracy performs, and when the people join in with the spirit of Jan Bhagidari, we witness a transformation taking place.We must make excellence the fundamental principle to make our country a 'Viksit Bharat'. We need to work quickly in all four directions: Speed, Scale, Scope, and Standards. Alongside manufacturing, we must also focus on quality and adhere to the mantra of 'zero defect-zero effect'.Friends,We should take pride in every moment that God has blessed us with birth in the land of Bharat. God has chosen us to serve Bharat and fulfil our role in our country's journey towards excellence.We must redefine our heritage in a modern way while embracing ancient values in a modern context.As a nation, we also need to reassess outdated thinking and beliefs. We need to free our society from the pressure of professional pessimists. We must remember that freedom from negativity is the first step towards achieving success. Success blossoms in the lap of positivity.My faith, devotion, and belief in the infinite and eternal power of Bharat are growing day by day. Over the past 10 years, I have seen this capability of Bharat grow even more and have experienced it firsthand.Just as we utilised the fourth and fifth decades of the 20th century to impart a new momentum to the freedom movement, we must lay the foundation for a 'Viksit Bharat' in these 25 years of the 21st century. The freedom struggle was a time that called for great sacrifices. The present times call for great and sustained contributions from everyone.Swami Vivekananda had said in 1897 that we must dedicate the next 50 years solely for the nation. Exactly 50 years after this call, Bharat gained independence in 1947.Today, we have the same golden opportunity. Let's dedicate the next 25 years solely for the nation. Our efforts will create a strong foundation for the coming generations and the coming centuries, taking Bharat to new heights. Looking at the energy and enthusiasm of the country, I can say that the goal is not far away now. Let us take swift steps... let us come together and create a Viksit Bharat.",PM Narendra Modi penned the letter during his return flight from Kanyakumari to Delhi.

They want to hide their own shortcomings,"" Saini said, when asked about the AAP government's allegations.""We are giving water to Delhi over and above the agreed-upon quantity,"" Saini told reporters in Karnal.On the exit polls predicting Prime Minister Modi to retain power for a third straight term, Saini said, ""We have been saying right from the start that the NDA will win 400 seats"".On exit polls predicting that the BJP may not win all the 10 seats in Haryana as it did in 2019, Saini said, ""When results are out, you will see that lotus (BJP's poll symbol) is blooming on all 11 seats (10 LS plus Karnal assembly bypoll seat).""Taking a dig at Delhi chief minister Kejriwal, Saini said, ""He did not pay attention to development, but to corruption. I want to say that they (AAP) should not try to divert public attention (by saying Haryana is not releasing the share of water) and focus on development and giving facilities to people"".""If people in Delhi face inconvenience, Haryana also feels the pain.

Results delayed due to agricultural practicals: KEA ED,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/results-delayed-due-to-agricultural-practicals-kea-ed/articleshow/110644274.cms,"BENGALURU: Dismissing accusations that the Karnataka Examination Authority (KEA) delayed the CET results by 42 days to aid private colleges with their management seat intakes , KEA Executive Director Prasanna H stated the delay was due to agriculture practical exams. These practical examinations are held for students availing agriculture quota for entry to BSc agriculture.Addressing media persons on Sunday, a day after the KEA results, Prasanna said the Karnataka CET agricultural quota exams were held on May 25, and the results were declared on May 31 -- this caused the delay. The KEA declared the CET results a day later, on June 1.According to data available with TOI , of the CET conducted in the past five years — 2019 to 2023 — there was a difference of anywhere between 21 to 43 days between the examination and results, impacting up to 2.4 lakh candidates.This year, about 3.1 lakh students wrote the CET, setting a record high compared to the past five years. Prasanna told TOI, “The greater number of students who attempted the examination this year, compounded with the delay in the OMR sheet for marking the students because of the agitation over out-of-syllabus questions, also impacted the announcement date of the results.”He was certain that meritorious students applying for seats under KEA would not be disadvantaged because 45 percent of seats are to be filled in private and autonomous institutes through KEA ranking. As for aided institutes, 95 percent of seats are filled by KEA ranking. “Some sections are trying to create confusion by saying that private institution managements have been filling seats for donations. But they are all far from the truth,” he said.According to statistics from KEA, however, 9,955 engineering seats for the academic year 2023-24 were remaining. A source from KEA added that they were eventually handed over by the KEA to the private institutes because there were no takers.Students’ Ranks Not Announced Can Check KEA PortalAbout 3,000 students who wrote the CET did not receive their ranks and were in a state of panic. Prasanna said students’ ranks were withheld because they might have mistakenly entered a wrong unique ID from PUC while submitting their CET applications. Now, since the two did not match, the error occurred. These students, he said, will be given a chance to check their ranks on the CET portal on Monday by entering their marks.The counselling dates, fee structure, and seat matrix are yet to be announced. Prasanna said the counselling dates for engineering, medical, dental, and other professional courses will be announced after UG-NEET-2024 ranking is out. Similarly the architecture students will get their ranks after taking NATA scores into consideration. As for the seat matrix, engineering colleges are seeking course extension from AICTE, and it will be announced after that. The fees, meanwhile, he said, may be in the range of 10 percent around the current structure and is yet to be decided.","The Karnataka CET agricultural quota exams were held on May 25, and the results were declared on May 31 -- this caused the delay.
