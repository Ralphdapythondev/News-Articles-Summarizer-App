How Indian musicians are drawing their followers into the metaverse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-indian-musicians-are-drawing-their-followers-into-the-metaverse/articleshow/109536023.cms,"Percussionist Bickram Ghosh and sitar player Purbayan Chatterjee are among many others who have taken the virtual plunge, creating masterclasses, jam sessions and one-on-one fan connect on immersive platforms

Travis Scott, Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, David Guetta and even Daler Mehndi -all have performed in the metaverse as avatars in recent years.The future of music in Web3 and the metaverse was much bandied about during the pandemic, when Covid-19 induced lockdowns made offline concert-hopping a no-go show. And now that Generative AI has all but taken over our lives, exciting Web3 startups in the music tech space are keeping the conversation alive around NFTs , virtual concerts and much more.“In the current digital landscape -where revenue from music streaming is scant for a significant number of artistes and discovery of music is getting tougher by the day --- it is crucial for artistes to engage with their fans on their own terms, on their own platform. Web3 not only gives them the chance to be independent, but also allows a certain level of autonomy,” says Shatadru Sarkar, founder of Metastar Media which has come up with an immersive platform called Artisteverse.Artisteverse aims to leverage immersive tech and Web3 innovations to bridge the gaps in traditional entertainment platforms. Imagined as a ‘Direct to Fan’ platform to help artistes better engage and monetize their core fan base, Artisteverse combines audio streaming, e-commerce, fan engagement and the metaverse to give them a custom-made virtual stage. As a one-stop-shop destination, Artisteverse will offer exclusive music videos, signature merchandise, endorsed instruments, VIP passes to concerts, NFTs and exclusive chats with artistes among other benefits.“For fans, it is all about getting exclusive access to music, along with a host of additional features, perks and rewards not available anywhere else, directly from the artist they love. We want to bring the fans into the artist's creative world and help foster a deeper connection that is not possible on existing streaming or social platforms,” Sarkar adds.Percussionist Bickram Ghosh and singer-songwriter Manasi Scott are the early birds in this music tech space. Last year, both unveiled their custom-designed virtual space. Ghosh, who is back as the curator of the music section at the Serendipity Arts Festival this year, says, “My albums and film songs are available everywhere, across all platforms. Planetbickram has that and everything else that I want to share with my fans and followers. All that they will not find on any other streaming or social media platform. There is a karaoke studio where fans can record their versions of my songs as well.”He will not just be releasing exclusive music on the platform. There will be masterclasses and tips for budding musicians too, from Ghosh’s learnings after having spent 35 years in the music industry.Sitar player Purbayan Chatterjee, who launched Classicool.in, a fully immersive and interactive 3D metaverse platform, on April 12, shares, “The listener or a fan of a particular artiste can directly enter the artiste’s world --- it’s almost like welcoming your fan into your own living room. And from there, they can access different rooms showcasing different elements of your work. The fan can get a direct preview not only of your craft but of your personality as well.”Such showcasing has its own benefits, says Chatterjee. One can reach out to fans directly, without the need to embed information and content into third party apps. He is the first sitar player to enter the metaverse. “Another feature that will be a lot of fun is getting into my virtual studio and jamming along to the backing tracks of the songs I have created in the past. We have also integrated my music academy PAAMF on the platform, allowing budding sitar players and students across the globe to connect with us online. There is an induction course to Indian classical music as well,” he adds.","Artisteverse aims to leverage immersive tech and Web3 innovations to bridge the gaps in traditional entertainment platforms.

MUMBAI/DELHI: The pursuit of high-paying jobs has hit a roadblock this placement season at the premium Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). With companies scaling back on hiring and offering lower salary packages , students at the tail-end are being offered annual packages below Rs 10 lakh.Organisations that would usually pick half-a-dozen students have picked one or two at best, forcing colleges to reach out to more companies.And many of those are offering annual compensation of Rs 10-15 lakh. Students who have bagged campus jobs at what they believe is a lower pay scale, are still in the market looking for better prospects on job portals and travelling cities to attend job fairs and interviews.""The global economic slowdown has significantly impacted the campus placements for the 2024 graduating batch of IIT Indore. The reduced hiring numbers of recruiters compared to the previous year have resulted in a challenging placement season. To offset the impact, IIT Indore has taken early steps by tapping into alumni networks and has broadened its pool of potential employers, including PSUs,"" said Professor Suhas Joshi, director, IIT Indore.A student at IIT Bombay said, ""Companies that till last year picked 5 to 8 students are picking 1 or 2 this year. Several are still not yet hired. From coaching classes to start-ups, some have recently been picked for salary packages of Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000 in phase 2.""Another student from an IIT-Kharagpur said, ""Spectrum Technologies offered Rs 3.6 lakh for trainee engineers and Rs 6 lakh for trainee design engineers. Startoon Labs and Gem Machinery offered Rs 5.5 lakh annually. Skyroot offered Rs 5 lakh. Sri Chaitanya and Next Education offer Rs 4.8 to 6 lakh per annum.""""The scenario now is that many students are taking up jobs offering the bare minimum threshold salary of Rs 6 lakh a year but are looking for other jobs,"" a source said. Students and placement office staff are trying to attract more companies, negotiating packages with NGOs, reaching out to job portals, and providing guidance to final-year students. Praveen Tyagi, owner of IITians' Pace, a tutorial for entrance tests, said, ""While AI has reduced jobs and international FANG companies did not come to the campus, we saw this as an opportunity to pick up talent. We conducted tests to hire IITians, and hundreds of them took our test. Students conducted mock online lectures, and those who had good communication skills were picked. We have offered 25 students Rs 12 lakh per annum.""At IIT Delhi, a significant number are still seeking employment through the Office of Career Services (OCS). As of April 5, out of 1,814 students registered with OCS, 1,083 have secured jobs, leaving approximately 40% yet to find employment.However, the situation appears more favorable for those in undergraduate programs (BTech+dual degree), with 81% of the 903 participants having received job offers. R Ayothiraman, professor-in-charge of OCS, mentioned plans to conduct separate placement drives specifically for PhD candidates.During recent placements, students at IIT-D were introduced to a variety of job roles. Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd proposed an annual package of Rs 19.5 lakh, while HCL Software offered Rs 21.9 lakh, Tata Consultancy Services and Larsen & Toubro presented annual packages of Rs 9 lakh and Rs 7 lakh respectively.The placement process at IIT Delhi is rigorous, with each phase lasting about 15 days. Students diligently prepare for interviews. ""We are mentally prepared for a set pattern of questions, but this time the companies were more demanding, seeking fewer candidates with specialized skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning for annual packages ranging from Rs 10-50 lakh,"" a student said, adding that he lacked the skills required because his interest lay in software development.","The pursuit of high-paying jobs has hit a roadblock at the premium Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) With companies scaling back on hiring and offering lower salary packages, students at the tail-end are being offered annual packages below Rs 10 lakh.

Besides, sources argued, Ketki Devi's candidature would be seen as a boost to women leadership, one of the party's key poll planks.A Delhi court last week deferred its order on framing of charges against Singh. Six women wrestlers have accused him of sexual harassment - an allegation he has denied vehemently.The matter was deferred after Singh moved an application before the court seeking further probe into reports of his presence at the WFI office on September 7, 2022. He also said the prosecution's analysis of call detail records had shown that one incident of alleged sexual harassment took place on a day when he was not present in the country.However, the chances of Mahajan and Namgyal seem bleaker as per party sources, who attributed the likely exclusion to their ""non-performance"" as MPs and ""negative feedback"" from their constituencies. Polling on all three seats is scheduled in the fifth phase on May 20, for which last date to file nominations is May 3.Although the party has not disclosed Mahajan's replacement, some media reports suggested that senior advocate Ujjwal Nikam was among those being considered for the prestigious Mumbai North Central seat.Historically, the constituency was considered a stronghold of Congress. Later, BJP ally Shiv Sena made its presence felt with its nominees Vidyadhar Gokhale (1989), Narayan Athawale (1996) and Manohar Joshi (1999)winning from here.

"India is 4th largest military spender after US, China & Russia, but gaps remain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-is-4th-largest-military-spender-after-us-china-russia-but-gaps-remain/articleshow/109510550.cms,"NEW DELHI: Global military expenditure registered the steepest year-on-year increase in well over a decade to reach a record $2,443 billion in 2023, with India remaining the world’s fourth largest defence spender after the US, China and Russia.India, of course, does not get the biggest bang for its buck. The country’s military modernization continues to be hobbled by the huge salary and pension bills of its 1.4-million armed forces, a weak defence-industrial base and the relative absence of concrete long-term plans to systematically build military capabilities, with proper inter-Service prioritization.China, in contrast, is rapidly modernizing its 2-million military across the traditional domains of land, air and sea as well as nuclear, space and cyber, recording its 29consecutive year-on-year hike in its “officially declared” military budget , which is almost four times more than India.Though China’s military spending is largely geared towards preventing any US-led intervention in Taiwan, the South and East China Seas, Beijing continues to flex its muscles all along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with India, refusing to de-escalate tensions while it also steadily steps up naval presence in the Indian Ocean Region.As per the latest data released by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday, the total global military expenditure increased by 6.8% in real terms in 2023.The 10 largest military spenders were the US ($916 billion), China ($296 billion), Russia ($109 billion), India ($84 billion), Saudi Arabia ($76 billion), UK ($75 billion), Germany ($67 billion), Ukraine ($65 billion), France ($61 billion) and Japan ($50 billion). Pakistan was placed at the 30spot with $8.5 billion.SIPRI said it is also the first time since 2009 that military expenditure went up in all the five geographical regions: the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Oceania. “The unprecedented rise in military spending is a direct response to the global deterioration in peace and security. States are prioritizing military strength, but they risk an action-reaction spiral in the increasingly volatile geopolitical and security landscape,” said SIPRI senior researcher Nan Tian.The Indian armed forces, on their part, continue to grapple with major operational shortages in several areas, ranging from fighters, submarines and helicopters to modern infantry weapons, anti-tank guided missiles and night-fighting capabilities.The Rs 6.2 lakh crore defence budget for 2024-25, for instance, allocates just 28% for military modernization. The defence outlay works out to just 1.9% of the projected GDP if the huge Rs 1.4 lakh crore pension allocation for the 32 lakh ex-servicemen and retired defence civilians is considered. It drops to less than 1.5% if the pension bill is excluded. This when at least 2.5% is essential for deterrence against the collusive threat from China and Pakistan.The long delay in setting up unified theatre commands means the country also still lacks an integrated and cost-effective war-fighting machinery. While China has the Western Theatre Command to handle the entire LAC, India has as many as four Army and three IAF commands for the northern borders.","Global military expenditure registered the steepest year-on-year increase in well over a decade to reach a record $2,443 billion in 2023. India remains the world’s fourth largest defence spender after the US, China and Russia. China, in contrast, is rapidly modernizing its 2-million military across the traditional domains.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109510679,imgsize-685161,width-400,resizemode-4/109510679.jpg"
Congress moves EC on PM Modi speech; calling a spade a spade: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-moves-ec-on-pm-modi-speech-calling-a-spade-a-spade-bjp/articleshow/109511870.cms,"PM Modi lashes out at Rahul, says 'Crown Prince couldn't save family seat’s honour'

NEW DELHI: Accusing PM Modi of trying to create enmity between religious communities and lying to defame the rival party, Congress on Monday petitioned Election Commission and demanded that the PM be “disqualified” for egregious violations of election laws in his speech in Rajasthan on Sunday.Congress said the PM is a serial offender who has attacked the dignity of the Constitution by violating the principle of secularism which is part of the basic structure, adding that “this is not a candidate who will be silenced by a simple censure”.An AICC delegation of Abhishek Singhvi, Gurdeep Sappal and Supriya Shrinate, which met the poll watchdog for detailed discussions, said “not just the PM, but the Election Commission is on trial”, adding that EC’s past “inaction” has emboldened BJP and Modi to commit repeat offences.As part of the offensive to counter the PM’s speech, party chief Mallikarjun Kharge has sought time from Modi to “educate” him about the Congress manifesto. AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said the PM is rattled by the response to Congress’s ‘nyay’ promises, which has forced him to “spread lies and Hindu-Muslim narratives to hide his monumental failure as the PM”.The Congress response came a day after a provocative speech by Modi in Rajasthan, in which he insinuated that Congress would redistribute wealth to Muslims, and even women’s ‘mangalsutra ’ was not safe.Singhvi said naming of a religious group and blaming it for the deprivation of the majority while using the Hindu imagery of ‘mangalsutra’ is “aimed at creating enmity between groups, far worse than any ever made by a sitting PM in the history of India, which cannot go unpunished”.Stating that Modi’s speech violates Section 123(2), 123 (3A), 123 (4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, besides other provisions of IPC, the petition said, “The only available remedy... is the disqualification of the candidates who try to create a divide between different classes of citizens. We hope that the Commission treats this situation with the gravity it deserves.” It warned the EC that inaction would tarnish its legacy.As it took the battle to the top, filing 16 petitions with the EC, accusing BJP of using religion, the Ayodhya issue and armed forces to seek votes, changing the colour of Doordarshan’s logo to saffron, and a media channel’s provocative programmes, Congress said Modi’s “desperate utterances” are a result of the ominous feedback BJP has received about the ground situation and the first phase of voting.Kharge rubbished Modi’s claims including his bid to caricature the party manifesto as having the imprint of “Muslim League”. He asked, “Is giving Rs 1 lakh annually to every woman a programme of Muslim League? Is giving jobs and training to the youth with Rs 1 lakh per year stipend a programme of Muslim League? We fill the SC/ST/OBC backlog, is it Muslim League?

Neither will Congress ever return to office nor will CAA go: Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neither-will-congress-ever-return-to-office-nor-will-caa-go-amit-shah/articleshow/109511360.cms,"NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Monday attacked Congress leader P Chidambaram's statement that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 ( CAA ) and the three new criminal laws will be revoked if Congress comes to office, calling it as a brazen act of appeasement and the former finance minister's party has lost nerve after seeing the first phase of voting. ""Neither Congress will ever come to office nor the five laws enacted for public welfare will ever be revoked,"" Shah said.Accusing Congress of appeasement, Shah said the opposition party is jittery after the trend of first phase of voting made it plain that it is headed for a crushing defeat.A promise to repeal CAA, enacted to provide citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis who fled to India to escape religious persecution in the Muslim countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, is not part of the Congress manifesto . However, Chidambaram, who is also the head of Congress's manifesto committee, made the commitment while talking to media in Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala) on Sunday.Though it has been seen as a rethink prompted by CPM's attacks on Congress and Rahul Gandhi for their silence on CAA, Chidamabram claimed that the promise to junk CAA was supposed to be part of the manifesto but could not make it to the final draft because of ""space constraint"".Shah was scathing in his response. ""This law (CAA) represents the fundamental principles of the Constitution. P Chidambaram is insulting the dreams of the architects of the country's independence who advocated for these laws by talking about scrapping them. CAA is the nation's law, and it ensures that no one can stop citizenship from being granted to the brothers and sisters of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Christian, Sikh and Parsi communities who have suffered religious persecution and come to India,"" the home minister said.Six days after the most successful operation by security forces in Chhattisgarh in which 29 Maoists were killed in Kanker district, Union home minister Amit Shah warned Naxals to ""give up arms or face severe consequences for spreading violence"". ""There can be no roads, education, electricity, ration shops, gas cylinders, employment, healthcare or homes until Naxalism is eradicated in Bastar.

Why everyone’s chasing minority votes in Kerala,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/why-everyones-chasing-minority-votes-in-kerala/articleshow/109515419.cms,"The quest for minority votes has been the holy grail for political parties in Kerala during elections , more so this time with BJP emerging a strong contender in the state. Congress-led UDF and CPM-led LDF are battling it out on who can stand up against the “communal fascist agenda” of the Sangh Parivar.In Malabar districts, not a single night has passed since the Centre notified the rules of Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on March 16 without political parties hitting the streets with flaming torches and chanting spirited anti-CAA slogans.Such aggressive wooing of minority issues is not surprising as Muslim and Christian communities together account for 44.9% of the state’s population as per the 2011 Census and political parties say that the figure would have only increased.In the larger Malabar region, which has eight constituencies spanning from Palakkad in the geographical centre of the state to the northernmost district of Kasaragod, all the seats have over 25% Muslim population — Kasaragod (30.8% approx), Kannur (26% approx), Vadakara (31.2%), Kozhikode (36.7%), Wayanad (41%), Malappuram (68%), Ponnani (62.4%) and Palakkad (29.4%). Also, when the Christian community is taken into consideration, 13 out of the state’s 20 seats have a minority population share of over 35%. There are six seats in the state where the Christian population has an over 20% share, mostly in the southern half of the state, the highest being in Idukki (41.8%) and Pathanamthitta (39.6%).The state’s history reveals that every time there has been even a flutter in minority voting behaviour, the electoral impact has been tectonic for both LDF and UDF. For instance, in the 2019 parliamentary elections, UDF won 19 of the 20 seats powered by the consolidation of Muslim and Christian votes, aided by the Wayanad candidature of Rahul Gandhi, who was projected as the future Prime Minister. According to a Lokniti CSDS post-poll survey, UDF secured 65% of Muslim votes and 70% of Christian votes while LDF got only 28% and 24%, respectively, in 2019.After LDF’s debacle in the 2019 LS polls, the tables turned in the 2021 assembly elections, which marked the first instance of LDF tasting success in their minority outreach and efforts to develop a trust factor. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan himself spearheaded the 2019 antiCAA movement with his announcement that it won’t be implemented in the state and the assembly passed a unanimous resolution against the Act. The election saw both Muslims and Christians warming up to LDF and helped it script an encore for the first time in the state’s electoral history by bagging 99 seats and reducing UDF to 41 seats. According to the postpoll CSDS Lokniti survey held in May 2021, there was an uptick in both Muslim and Christian votes for LDF — from 35% in the 2016 assembly elections to 39% in 2021.Knowing well that Muslim votes could be a determining factor, both UDF and LDF have decided to focus on the fear and apprehensions about CAA and NRC and BJP’s promise of implementing a uniform civil code. Congress is trying to appeal to minorities that as the prime opponent of BJP with a panIndia presence, it is the best bet against Sangh Parivar politics. It is also claiming that there is a tacit understanding between CPM and BJP to cover up corruption charges against top CPM leaders. On the other hand, CPM’s campaign has been focused on hammering in the message to minorities that Congress can’t be trusted. It has been harping on the highprofile defections of 12 former CMs from Congress across the country to BJP, and the switching of sides by the son of A K Antony and the daughter of K Karunakaran. Also, in the race for minority votes, CPM has been wooing IUML supporters by saying the party is getting a raw deal in UDF. At the same time, CPM is supporting IUML detractors in Samastha Kerala Sunni Jamiyyathul Ulema, the influential body of Sunni scholars.Christians, traditionally, are a guaranteed vote bank for UDF. Leaders like the late Oommen Chandy had very close links with all church leaders though now, UDF doesn’t have leaders of that stature to keep this relationship going. While the majority of the church denominations is not happy with the governing LDF, it is not clear if they would tilt fully to UDF this time too. However, Fr Antony Vadakkekara VC, public relations officer of the Syro-Malabar church, said that the church never takes a political stand during elections — “we only want all our members to exercise their voting rights. They are free to decide who to vote for” — he listed some issues that Christian voters should give priority to. Human-animal conflict in places close to forest regions, fall in rubber price, liquor policy of LDF govt, the approach of the Centre towards the farmers’ strike, backdoor appointments in public services and, last but not least, the alleged persecution of Christians in Manipur and other places are some of the issues the church is raising.There are roughly over 50 lakh Syro-Malabar Catholics in the state and around 5-6 lakh abroad. The strongholds of the church are Ernakulam, Chalakkudy, Thrissur, Kottayam, Mavelikkara and Pathanamthitta. They are also strong in certain pockets in Vadakara, Calicut and Kannur. Latin Catholics, who have a strong presence in the coastal areas, too have raised a few issues with the state govt and the opposition.“Based on the response to our demands from either parties, we will take a final decision,” said Sherry J Thomas, state president of Kerala Latin Christian Association. There are around 20 lakh Latin Catholics and are a force to reckon with in the coastal areas of Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha and Kochi.The feud between the Orthodox and Jacobite factions of the Malankara church is another decisive factor in Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta and Mavelikkara. Though the Orthodox church has not taken a public stand, the recent speech by the CM favouring the Church Act during a Jacobite church function in Kochi has not gone down well. The presence of various Pentecostal groups, especially in Pathanamthitta and Mavelikkara, cannot be seen lightly. Similarly, Mar Thoma church in Pathanamathitta and the CSI church in Idukki are also decisive.",The quest for minority votes has been the holy grail for political parties in Kerala during elections. Muslim and Christian communities together account for 44.9% of the state’s population as per the 2011 Census. Both UDF and LDF have decided to focus on the fear and apprehensions about CAA and NRC and BJP's promise of implementing a uniform civil code.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109515436,imgsize-1643493,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109515436.jpg"
Glaciers melting at unprecedented rates in Indian Himalayan region: Isro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/glaciers-melting-at-unprecedented-rates-in-indian-himalayan-region-isro/articleshow/109505281.cms,"The long-term changes in the Ghepang Ghat Glacial Lake area (Credit: Isro

BENGALURU: The Himalayan mountains , often called the “Third Pole” due to their vast glaciers and snow cover, are highly vulnerable to global climate change impacts both physically and societally. Isro Monday said that new research analysing decades of satellite imagery has revealed that glaciers across the Indian Himalayan region have been melting at alarming rates, leading to the significant expansion of glacial lakes .Research conducted worldwide has consistently shown that glaciers across the globe have been experiencing unprecedented rates of retreat and thinning since the onset of the industrial revolution in the 18th century.“...This retreat leads to the formation of new lakes and the enlargement of existing ones in the Himalayan region. These bodies of water, created by the melting of glaciers, are known as glacial lakes and play a crucial role as freshwater sources for rivers in the Himalayan region. However, they also pose significant risks, such as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods ( GLOFs ), which can have devastating consequences for communities downstream,” Isro said in a statement on Monday.For the research, Isro used satellite data from 1984 to 2023, which shows that of the 2,431 glacial lakes larger than 10 hectares identified in 2016-17 across river basins, a staggering 676 lakes have grown markedly since 1984. This includes 130 lakes within India — 65 in the Indus basin, seven in the Ganga basin, and 58 in the Brahmaputra basin.The changes have been drastic, with 601 of the expanding lakes more than doubling in size. Ten lakes grew 1.5 to 2 times larger, while 65 expanded 1.5 times. The analysis found many of the bulging lakes at higher elevations, with 314 between 4,000-5,000 metres and 296 above 5,000 metres.The glacial lakes are categorised based on their formation process into four broad categories, namely Moraine-dammed (water dammed by moraine), Ice-dammed (water dammed by ice), Erosion (water dammed in depressions formed by erosion), and other glacial lakes.“Among the 676 expanding lakes, the majority of them are Moraine-dammed (307) followed by Erosion (265), other (96), and Ice-dammed (8) glacial lakes, respectively,” Isro said.One example is Ghepang Ghat lake in Himachal Pradesh, which has grown 178% larger from 36.49 to 101.3 hectares between 1989-2022 at a rate of nearly 2 hectares per year.As glaciers rapidly melt, the swelling lakes not only indicate monumental environmental changes but also elevate risks of glacial lake outburst floods that can unleash devastating flooding downstream into mountain communities.",Isro says glaciers across Indian Himalayan region have been melting at alarming rates. This has led to the significant expansion of glacial lakes in the region. The lakes are created by the melting of glaciers and play a crucial role as freshwater sources for rivers.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109505315,imgsize-920633,width-400,resizemode-4/109505315.jpg"

By comparison, for the UK, 59% of students prioritised the quality of education while 61% focused on the reputation of universities. However, for Canada, the ability to combine work and study is the most frequently mentioned motivating factor.

Congress’s shahzada’ (prince) says if their govt comes to power, they will investigate who earns how much and has how much property, how many vehicles, your fixed deposits. Not only this, their govt will take over property and redistribute it. This is what their election manifesto is saying...” Modi said, adding that he wanted to “alert” people about Congress’s “intentions”.“This is akin to Maoist thinking... This is Communist thinking, which has ruined many countries... These family-oriented politicians have amassed vast fortunes by looting the people. They have never shared their wealth with the poor. Now, they have their eyes on the wealth of the people,” Modi said.The fresh attack coincided with Congress’s claim that PM had lied about their manifesto. Modi, however, stuck to his guns referring to the manifesto and Rahul Gandhi’s speeches.There was one variation, though. Unlike on Sunday, PM did not imply that Rahul Gandhi’s pitch for redistribution of assets was aimed at benefiting “infiltrators” and “those with more children”: the terms he used to refer to his prdecessor Manmohan Singh’s 2006 remark that Muslims should have the first claim on country’s resources.PM did speak about “appeasement” politics of Congress and SP, but the focus of the speech remained on “redistribution of assets”.Repeating his ‘mangalsutra’comment made earlier, the PM said, “Just think, our mothers and sisters have gold. In our country, this gold is considered ‘streedhan’ (women’s property) and is regarded as sacred. But, these people have their eyes on ‘mangalsutras’ and the wealth of our mothers and sisters. They plan to confiscate property and money as they see fit, based on a survey they conduct, by changing the law... suppose if you own two homes -- one in your ancestral place and a small flat in the city for the children’s future, they will snatch one saying that you don’t need two places and give it to someone else -- Congress will go that far.”Earlier, the PM began his speech at the Numaish Ground in support of BJP Lok Sabha candidates Satish Gautam (Aligarh) and Anoop Valmiki (Hathras) and took a dig at Congress’s Rahul Gandhi and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav . “Last time when I came to Aligarh, I requested all of you to lock the factory of nepotism and corruption of Congress and the SP — you locked it so well that both ‘shahzadas’ are still not getting the keys,” he said.On his govt’s zero-tolerance on terrorism and establishing peace along the border, he said, “Earlier, bombs and bullets were fired at the border. Our brave sons were martyred, their bodies returned home wrapped in the Tricolour. These incidents have stopped.” He also said “there were regular incidents of bomb blasts, serial blasts in which people used to lose their lives. Even Ayodhya and Kashi were not spared. Bomb blasts used to happen every day in big cities. Now there has been a full stop on such incidents. This is the Modi-Yogi effect.”Outlining his vision for creating employment opportunities, he pointed to the production of Brahmos missiles in UP. Accusing Congress of corruption in the defence sector, he said, “Congress, which was involved in scams in army purchases, could never have built a defence corridor here. Due to the BJP, our UP is going to become a big hub of the Army.”Praising CM Yogi Adityanath’s govt, PM said, “I want to open the eyes of those who keep identifying Yogiji only with bulldozers. No industrial development in UP happened after Independence as much as it has taken place during Yogiji’s tenure. He promoted the ‘One District, One Product’ scheme... airport was built in Aligarh, an international airport is being built near Jewar. Roads and rail connectivity were strengthened. AMU is here. Construction of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University is about to be completed...”He also recalled the contribution of late CM Kalyan Singh. “There are many religious places on this land, this land has given us ‘navratnas’ like Kalyan Singh Babu ji, Ashok Singhal ji.

'India must shine for all': What Congress said

What Congress' 2024 Lok Sabha manifesto says

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Modi, in his past few election speeches, has been relentless in his attack against the Congress over its manifesto promise of a ""nation-wide socio-economic and caste census."" PM Modi has accused the grand-old party of having ""plans to redistribute wealth"".The Prime Minister set the tone for this mega attack last Sunday at an election rally in Rajasthan where he linked Cong's manifesto plans with a 2006 statement of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on giving priority to minorities on nation's resources.Citing Manmohan Singh's 2006 speech, PM Modi has claimed that Congress, if voted to power, will take away people's wealth and redistribute it among the Muslims .""Earlier, when their (Congress) government was in power, they had said that Muslims have the first right on the country's assets. This means to whom will this property be distributed? It will be distributed among those who have more children,"" PM Modi had said at the Rajasthan rally .Since then, the Prime Minister has repeated this charge at all his election rallies. ""They have set their sights on your hard-earned money and property. Congress’s shahzada’ (prince) says if their govt comes to power, they will investigate who earns how much and has how much property, how many vehicles, your fixed deposits. Not only this, their govt will take over property and redistribute it. This is what their election manifesto is saying...,” he said at a rally in Aligarh.Reiterating his comments, PM Modi again on Monday said, ""Your Mangalsutra will not be safe under Congress rule,"" adding that Congress and INDI alliance have their eyes on the people's earnings and property.He made similar allegations on Tuesday at a rally in Rajasthan.""I have put forth the truth before the country that Congress is hatching a deep conspiracy to snatch your wealth and distribute it among the 'select' people,"" he said.Reacting strongly to PM's onslaught, Congress lodged a complaint with the EC seeking cancellation of PM Modi's candidature and stating that “this is not a candidate who will be silenced by a simple censure”.Calling PM Modi a ""serial offender"", Congress said that he attacked the dignity of the Constitution by violating the principle of secularism which is part of the basic structure.And while the political slugfest continues, let's have a look at what the then PM Manmohan Singh had actually said in 2006. The speech cited by PM Modi was given by Manmohan Singh in his address to the National Development Council on December 9.""I believe our collective priorities are clear.

Speaking at a function at his residence here after receiving the Padma award , Naidu said announcing ""freebies"" during elections without listing out funds mobilisation is an unhealthy trend which should be discouraged and people should question the leaders and parties making such lofty promises.Naidu was awarded the Padma Vibhushan award on Monday evening by President Droupadi Murmu at a function at Rashtrapati Bhawan.""Defections are being encouraged. We should strengthen the anti-defection law,"" he asserted.""Now, the worry is that there is a fall in the standards in public life. In political parties, people often change their parties. The latest trend is people are in one party in the morning and join another party in the evening and then they criticise your leader and say things left and right. Some of them are favoured with tickets also.""This is a very disturbing trend and people should avoid it. People should work at parties and prove their credentials. If anybody wants to change parties, one should resign from the post given by that party and then only join another party. One can understand making accusations, but what is happening is not accusing but abusing,"" Naidu said.He said another unhealthy trend is that people are making promises left and right, without considering where the money will come from, as there is no money.""Political parties must come out with a manifesto and secondly, should come out with schemes supported by the financial health of the state and third, how they are going to mobilise resources and then whatever they want to spend,"" the former vice president said.He wondered how it was possible to give everything for free as ""money does not come from trees"".But then some of the leaders and parties are making promises left and right even when the financial health of the state is weak, he observed.Naidu said even when the financial burden of lakhs of crores of rupees is there on states, still leaders make promises and everything is being promised for free.""I am against freebies. I am in favour of two things - education and health should be given free. Make education and health free, and you can avoid all others. They are not doing that,"" he lamented.""This sort of promises and freebies should be discouraged and political parties should question how you are going to mobilise resources. Manifesto and resource mobilisation and financial health of the state should be presented to the people,"" he said.Naidu also appealed to the voters to reject those candidates who use vulgar language and are known to be openly corrupt.""People who are in the habit of accusing and using vulgar language should be rejected in elections and people who are known to be openly corrupt, they should be rejected,"" Naidu asserted, noting that parties should present alternative policies instead of accusing.Narrating his recent meeting with a religious saint who migrated from Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu, he said though having Muslim origins he sang Ram bhajans every morning.Observing that culture is a way of living and religion is a way of worship, he said, ""Rama is a cultural embodiment of the state, he is not a religious person. Rama is an ideal human being, a great ruler, a great father, and a great son, who led an ideal human life. We must lead a life like him and try to follow his ideals.""He said his message to the people is that everybody should take an interest in public life, not necessarily politics.He said somebody asked him about what patriotism was as everybody is talking about it these days, he said, ""Everybody should be doing their respective work sincerely and should do their duties assigned to them, then you are a patriot and make the country strong.""The former vice president said India is on the rise and the entire world is looking at it, even as the Western powers and superpowers are not able to digest the country's growth.""But at the same time, they cannot ignore India and they have to maintain a relationship with India. India can never be ignored in the present situation.""We are the world's largest democracy and we must make efforts to make it the healthiest and ideal democracy, for that all political parties must ensure this,"" he noted.",Naidu was awarded the Padma Vibhushan award on Monday evening by President Droupadi Murmu at a function at Rashtrapati Bhawan.

Justice Gautam Patel, on a single bench, emphasised that the court's ruling was ""only decided on the issue of proof and not faith"".The suit was originally filed by Khuzaima Qutbuddin after the passing of his brother and the then leader, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, in 2014.Following Burhanuddin 's death, Mufaddal Saifuddin assumed the role of Syedna. In 2016, Qutbuddin's son, Taher Fakhruddin, took over the lawsuit claiming his father had passed on the powers to him.The lawsuit aimed to prevent Saifuddin from carrying out his duties as Syedna. Qutbuddin asserted that Burhanuddin had appointed him as the mazoon and secretly anointed him as his successor through a private ""nass"" before the public announcement in 1965. Fakhruddin argued that his father had designated him for the position before his passing. Justice Patel, in dismissing the suit, emphasized maintaining neutrality and focusing on the evidence presented.The Dawoodi Bohras, a Shia Muslim denomination, have a significant presence in India and globally, with a strong tradition in trade and entrepreneurship. The community follows the appointment of a successor through ""divine inspiration"" and the conferral of a ""nass"" to a deserving member. The lawsuit also sought to restrict Saifuddin from acting as the community's top religious leader, known as the Dai-al-Mutlaq. It alleged that Saifuddin had taken over leadership in a fraudulent manner and requested access to Saifi Manzil, the Syedna's residence in Mumbai.Qutbuddin maintained that Burhanuddin privately designated his half-brother as his successor, urging him to keep it confidential, a commitment Qutbuddin honored until his death. Saifuddin contested these claims, stating that the alleged nass from 1965 lacked witnesses and could be challenged. He cited a more recent conferral of nass in 2011, witnessed at a London hospital, as per the Dawoodi Bohra faith's doctrines.The court's ruling addressed the specific legal aspects of the case, emphasising the importance of evidence over matters of faith. The dispute within the Dawoodi Bohra Community highlights the complexities surrounding leadership succession and religious doctrine within the community.(With inputs from agencies)","Bombay high court dismisses lawsuit challenging Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin as leader of Dawoodi Bohra Community. Justice Gautam Patel emphasised that the court's ruling was ""only decided on the issue of proof and not faith"" The suit was originally filed by Khuzaima Qutbuddin after the passing of his brother and the then leader,Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, in 2014.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109524928,imgsize-1402578,width-400,resizemode-4/109524928.jpg"
PM Modi's remarks on Muslims aimed at communal polarization: Kerala CM Vijayan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modis-remarks-on-muslims-aimed-at-communal-polarization-kerala-cm-vijayan/articleshow/109524062.cms,"KANNUR: Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said that the remarks made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the Muslim community during the election campaign in Rajasthan's Banswara are defamatory and aimed at communal polarization .""The derogatory reference to intruders and 'hoarders' is untrue and part of their ideological code. The fact that the Prime Minister himself has come forward to take political advantage by saying communalism during the elections is an illustration of the challenges facing democratic and secular values in the country,"" he said during a press conference in Kannur.In an election rally in Rajasthan's Banswara Prime Minister Narendra Modi had claimed that the Congress manifesto talks about redistributing wealth to Muslims .The Kerala chief minister said that the Election Commission should take cognisance of the prime Minister's speech.""The Muslim community was also accused of stealing the country's wealth. The Election Commission should take strong action against these defamatory and communal remarks. All the progressive and secular forces of the country need to come together to ensure transparent and democratic elections. The essence of this country is based on secularism and friendship. Any attitude or statement that harms it needs to be questioned and opposed,"" Vijayan said.He accused the BJP of undermining the country's constitutional institutions, eroding their independence and autonomy.""The formation of the selection committee for the Election Commission, excluding the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, is particularly concerning. Numerous legal violations by high-ranking officials in the central government, including the Prime Minister, have been alleged, yet the Election Commission has remained silent, failing to assert its neutrality,"" he said.""Furthermore, the Commission's lack of intervention in the Prime minister's statement of communal propaganda during elections, aimed at inciting religious sentiments, raises serious doubts about its impartiality.

Significant human rights abuses in Manipur after outbreak of ethnic conflict: US report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/significant-human-rights-abuses-in-manipur-after-outbreak-of-ethnic-conflict-us-report/articleshow/109524025.cms,"WASHIINGTON: There were significant human rights abuses in Manipur after the outbreak of ethnic conflict, the US State Department said on Monday in its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described the incident as ""shameful"" and urged action on the case, it said.In its annual report of the State Department, which is mandated by the US Congress, it also mentions the raids by tax authorities on the office of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the conviction and sentencing to two years of prison to Rahul Gandhi by a court in Gujarat.Released by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the report mentions some of the positive developments on the issue of human rights and freedom of expression and gathering in the year 2023, the duration of the report.In July, the government permitted a march in Srinagar, the main city of Kashmir, allowing Shia Muslims to mark the religious Muharram event. This procession represented the first government-sanctioned recognition of the event in Srinagar since it was banned in 1989. The government imposed some restrictions on the use of slogans or the display of logos of any banned organisations, it said.India has previously criticised the US for releasing reports on human rights and religious freedoms based on ""misinformation and flawed understanding.""Motivated and biased commentary by some US officials only serves to undermine further the credibility of these reports, the Ministry of External Affairs had said last year.The State Department report also talks about the ethnic violence in Manipur.""The outbreak of ethnic conflict between the Kuki and Meitei ethnic groups during the year in India's northeastern state of Manipur resulted in significant human rights abuses. Media reported at least 175 persons were killed and more than 60,000 displaced between May 3 and November 15,"" the State Department said.Activists and journalists reported armed conflict, rapes, and assaults in addition to the destruction of homes, businesses, and places of worship.India has previously said that interference in the country's internal affairs is unacceptable, and reflects a colonial mindset.""Indian authorities at all levels, including the judiciary, are seized of the situation in Manipur and are taking steps to maintain peace and harmony and law and order,"" the Ministry of External Affairs had said in response to media queries on the European Parliament discussing developments in Manipur last year.The report said that local human rights organisations, minority political parties, and affected communities criticised the national government for the delayed action to stop the violence and provide humanitarian assistance.On September 4, UN experts urged the government to step up relief efforts and provide timely action to investigate acts of violence, hold perpetrators accountable, and foster a process of reconciliation between the Meitei, Kuki, and other impacted communities.According to the report, there were a number of press and civil society reports of representatives of political parties using disinformation tactics against civil society organisations, religious minorities, such as Sikhs and Muslims, and the political opposition, sometimes depicting them as security threats.Referring to the tax raid on BBC offices, the report said although tax authorities described the search as motivated by irregularities in the BBC's tax payments and ownership structure, officials also searched and seized equipment from journalists who were not involved in the organisation's financial processes.There were multiple reports of journalists and human rights activists being investigated in J&K, with at least 35 journalists reporting facing assaults, police interrogations, raids, fabricated cases, and restrictions on movement since 2019,"" the report said.","There were significant human rights abuses in Manipur after the outbreak of ethnic conflict.

"Citizenship, connectivity, poor infrastructure, unemployment, key issues in Barak Valley",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/citizenship-connectivity-poor-infrastructure-unemployment-key-issues-in-barak-valley/articleshow/109522389.cms,"SILCHAR/KARIMGANJ: Citizenship , unemployment , poor infrastructure and lack of proper connectivity with the rest of the country are the major issues being highlighted by candidates contesting in the two Lok Sabha constituencies - Silchar (SC) and Karimganj - in Assam's Barak Valley, bordering Bangladesh. Thirty-two candidates are in the fray in the two Lok Sabha constituencies in Barak Valley which will go to the polls on April 26.In these two constituencies in the valley, which gets its name from River Barak, the ruling BJP first made inroads winning both seats in 1991 and 1996 when the party had practically no organisational base in the state.In Silchar, the contest is likely to be among BJP's candidate and Assam minister Parimal Suklabaidya, Congress's Surya Kanta Sarkar and AITC's Radheyshyam Biswas, a former AIUDF MP from neighbouring Karimganj. In Karimganj, a close contest is expected between BJP's sitting MP Kripanath Malla, Congress candidate Hafiz Ahmed Rashid Choudhury and AIUDF's Sahabul Islam Choudhury.The delimitation exercise in the state last year will play a crucial role in the polls in the Barak Valley with the Scheduled Caste (SC) status of Karimganj, having a predominantly minority electorate, being removed and added to Silchar.The number of assembly segments in Karimganj has been reduced from eight to five with some constituencies merged together but Silchar, with a mixed but majority Hindu voters, has its earlier seven segments.In both the constituencies, with a 129 km long border with Bangladesh, citizenship is a major issue, as there is a sizeable population of Hindu Bengalis, displaced from the neighbouring country who entered the valley over a period of time.BJP's Silchar candidate Parimal Suklabaidya told PTI that the citizenship problem was created due to the partition of the country and no political party took any step to solve it for 70 years but it was the BJP that took steps to bring a law which will help people who have come to Barak Valley from then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).''It is true that some people are finding it difficult to apply online and there are issues related to submission of documents but Union home minister Amit Shah has been apprised of the matter. He has assured that the process will be simplified after the Model Code of Conduct is lifted'', the BJP leader said.His Congress rival Surya Kanta Sarkar told PTI that most of the people of Barak Valley were initially in favour of CAA because the displaced people believed that it will help them as with citizenship they will not need any other document.''The rules in the CAA are now like a trap as whoever applies for citizenship directly is established as a Bangladeshi and so far only one person in Barak Valley has applied and if the law is so good as BJP claims, then why are people not applying under it. People have realised that they have been betrayed'', Sarkar alleged.Connectivity with the rest of Assam and the country has also been a major issue in the valley and the BJP candidates of both constituencies claim it has been almost resolved with the East-West Corridor nearing completion.The opposition parties alleged that though Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised in 2014 that it will be completed soon but even after 10 years, the progress has been more than ""unsatisfactory"" and with the present status, it will take another five to six years to be completed.''We have to go through Meghalaya to reach the state capital and the condition of the road is in a pathetic condition. This creates a lot of problems for the people of Barak Valley and many developmental and other related works get delayed'', Trinamool Congress Silchar candidate Radheyshyam Biswas said.BJP's Karimganj candidate Kripanath Malla claimed that during the last 10 years of BJP rule at the Centre, a lot of development, particularly related to infrastructure, has taken place but ''this is a continuous process and more projects will be implemented in Barak Valley when Narendra Modi becomes the Prime Minister for the third consecutive term''.His rival Sahabul Islam Choudhury of the AIUDF, however, alleged that infrastructural development in the Barak Valley has been almost negligible as compared to the other parts of Assam and the mini-secretariat promised by the state government is also yet to become functional.The roads are in a pathetic condition and there is only one airport at Silchar whose infrastructure also needs to be upgraded.Unemployment issue is also a major concern that is being highlighted by the candidates as many youth have to migrate to other cities for jobs with the opposition highlighting the closure of the only industry, the Cachar Paper Mills, leading to large-scale unemployment of the workers.Suklabaidya, however, pointed out that the government is also planning to set up a large industry or a group of small industries on its land either on its own or in PPP mode which will provide employment to the youth of the Barak Valley who usually have to go outside for employment.","Thirty-two candidates are in the fray in the two Lok Sabha constituencies in Barak Valley which will go to the polls on April 26. Citizenship is a major issue, as there is a sizeable population of Hindu Bengalis, displaced from the neighbouring country who entered the valley over a period of time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109523776,imgsize-1141524,width-400,resizemode-4/109523776.jpg"
'Saale sahab kya karenge': Smriti Irani takes a dig on Rahul Gandhi amid buzz over Amethi candidacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saale-sahab-kya-karenge-smriti-irani-takes-a-dig-on-rahul-gandhi-amid-buzz-over-amethi-candidacy/articleshow/109522277.cms,"Jijaji ki nazar hai, saale sahab kya karenge.

NEW DELHI: As the Congress delays its candidate announcement in Uttar Pradesh's Amethi , incumbent BJP MP Smriti Irani has targeted Rahul Gandhi and his brother-in-law Robert Vadra . Irani said that in her five years in office, she accomplished more for the constituency than Gandhi did in his 15-year tenure.These comments came after speculation stirred by Vadra's potential candidacy for the Amethi seat, traditionally held by the Congress and won by Irani in 2019.Amethi is scheduled to vote on May 20 during the fifth phase of the Lok Sabha polls .In a jocular tone, Irani remarked to a gathering in Amethi, '(brother-in-law is eyeing the seat, what will he (Rahul Gandhi) do?) There was a time when people travelling in buses would leave their handkerchief to mark their seat so that no one sits on it. Rahul Gandhi will also come to mark his seat with a handkerchief because his brother-in-law is eyeing this seat.'""Has this ever happened? Just 27 days left for the election, yet the Congress has not announced its candidate. Such arrogance. What I could achieve in five years for Amethi, Rahul Gandhi could not accomplish in 15,"" Irani added.Before her victory over Rahul in the 2019 election, he had held the Amethi seat for three consecutive terms. Historically, the seat has been represented by his parents Sonia Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, as well as his late uncle Sanjay Gandhi, and was regarded as a Congress stronghold.Gandhi, who is currently contesting from Kerala's Wayanad, was recently asked if he would also be the Congress candidate in Amethi. ""I will do whatever the party orders me,"" he replied.Earlier, Vadra sparked speculation by stating that the people of Amethi believe that if he contests there, ""they'll have the option of correcting their mistake of electing Smritiji"". ""I am sure they will ensure my victory by a huge margin if I contest,"" he expressed.Wayanad is set to vote on April 26, and the deadline for filing nominations for the Amethi Lok Sabha seat is May 3. This allows Gandhi to announce his nomination after the polling in Wayanad.Irani's campaign is currently in full swing, with her alleging that Gandhi will arrive in Amethi after April 26 and attempt to sow division among people on the basis of caste.""After the Wayanad voting on April 26, Rahul Gandhi will visit here to claim that Amethi is his family's domain and fuel caste-based tensions. Despite the Congress party declining the invitation for the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration ceremony, Rahul Gandhi will be observed visiting temples in Amethi. Thus, it's crucial to remain vigilant and cautious,"" she stated during a local gathering.Earlier this January, key Congress figures had abstained from attending the Ram Temple's consecration ceremony in Ayodhya, citing the BJP's politicization of the project.Irani has accused Gandhi of neglecting the issues of Amethi in Parliament, asserting that the people of the constituency didn't even have access to drinking water during his tenure as MP.","BJP MP Smriti Irani has targeted Rahul Gandhi and his brother-in-law Robert Vadra.

NEW DELHI: Hearing a case on misleading advertisements by Patanjali Ayurved, the Supreme Court of India on Tuesday said that the Ramdev-owned company's public apology in newspapers should be of same size in which it advertises its products.Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Ramdev, said that an apology has been published in newspapers. But the Supreme Court reprimanded him on why the apology was published yesterday only.The SC said that FMCG firms cannot be allowed to take people of this country - particularly babies, children and senior citizen - for a ride as they are influenced by misleading advertisements and the Union government must wake up to this.Expanding the ambit of its proceedings on misleading advertisements which was earlier confined only to Patanjali Ayurveda products, the SC asked Centre on action it has taken against other FMCG companies for giving misleading advertisements.The SC said that it was asking questions to the ministry of consumer affairs, ministry of information and broadcasting as co-respondents (in the case). State licensing authorities across the country will also be added as parties and they too need to answer certain questions, says Supreme Court.The SC also told Indian Medical Association (IMA) that while it was pointing fingers at Patanjali, four fingers were pointing at them. ""Your doctors also endorsing medicines in the allopathic field. If that's happening, why should we not turn the beam at you?""The SC deferred hearing on contempt proceedings against Patanjali founders Ramdev and Balkrishna as they could not file affidavit on public apology published in newspapers.

The Prime Minister is not above the citizens of India. The Prime Minister is not above the law of India. The Prime Minister has to accept the laws of India.

It is almost unbelievable that the Prime Minister of a secular country like India should speak in words, quite frankly, he speaks as though a communal bigot speech. It is not befitting the Prime Minister of India.

What is the credibility of the Election Commission if they don't take action against the Prime Minister?"" she said.Karat's reaction came a day after PM Modi said that Congress's manifesto suggests taking 'the gold of mothers and sisters' and redistribution of wealth with 'people with more children' and 'infiltrators'.""Their Mangalsutra, the question is not of the cost of gold in it, it is linked to her dreams of her life. You are talking of snatching it in your manifesto...will distribute gold and redistribute. When it was their government, they had said that Muslims have the first right over the country's wealth. Who will you distribute after collecting the wealth, distribute it to those who have more children, and distribute it to infiltrators,"" he said at a rally on April 21.PM Modi was referring to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's remarks made in December 2006 that the minorities should have first claim on the country's resources.","CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat filed a police complaint against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his recent remarks.
