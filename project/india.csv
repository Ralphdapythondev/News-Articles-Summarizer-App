"G N Saibaba, DU professor cleared of Naxal links after 10-year ordeal, dies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/g-n-saibaba-du-professor-cleared-of-naxal-links-after-10-year-ordeal-dies/articleshow/114180555.cms,"Sai’s struggle started at 5 & never ended, say friends

HYDERABAD: Barely seven months after he was cleared of having links with Maoists by Bombay HC, which called the trial court proceedings a “failure of justice”, former DU professor GN Saibaba died Saturday night at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences hospital. Doctors said he was admitted for removal of gallstones and died of post-surgery complications.The 57-year-old wheelchair-bound teacher and activist spent over seven years in jail after he was first arrested in May 2014.He was acquitted in March by the HC. “When I went to prison, I had no ailm ent other than my disability. Now, my heart is 55% functional... liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected,” he’d said on his release.Acquitting him, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court had called the trial court proceedings a “failure of justice”, and pointed out the lack of sanction under UAPA to prosecute him. It also said the prosecution had failed to establish the seizure of incriminating material from his house.“When I went to prison, I had no ailments other than my disability. Now, my heart i s only 55% functional, and I am facing muscular complications. My liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected. My right hand is partially functional. My doctor says I need multiple surgeries,” he had told reporters after his release on March 6.“I couldn’t go to the prison hospital. There was not a single access ramp for the disabled in the jail, no separate toilets. I was always physically lifted for my toilet and bath needs. How can one live like that?” he had said. Saibaba was kept in the ‘anda cell’ (solitary confinement) atNagpur central jail , which, he said, affected him mentally as well.Probe agencies came across Saibaba’s name allegedly after the arrest of a JNU student who claimed to have been acting as a courier between the professor and Maoists holed up in Abujhmarh forests in Chhattisgarh. Saibaba was arrested by Maharashtra police for allegedly conspiring to wage war against the nation besides violations under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). A Gadchiroli court convicted him of the charges and awarded him life imprisonment in 2017. After a prolonged legal battle, he was acquitted by the high court.“Saibaba played a key role in several people’s movements like pro-reservation protests in 1989-90, democratic rights of prisoners in 1993, movement to support the rights of Adivasis, and several others. Though he hailed from Andhra Pradesh, he led a huge public meeting in support for the formation of separate Telangana in 1997,” said K Ravi Chander, convener for Forum Against Repression, who knew Saibaba for 35 years.Saibaba was born in Anakapalli in AP. After graduating, he p ursued his postgraduation in University of Hyderabad. He was working as an English professor in Delhi University until he was arrested. After he was released from jail, he underwent medical treatment in Delhi for various health complications — a fallout of his prolonged stay in jail. He is survived by his wife and daughter.His friends and colleaguesremembered Saibaba, whom they fondly called Sai, as a fighter. “He got polio when he was five years old. That is when his struggle began and never ended,” said Nandita Narain, former St Stephen’s College professor. “I learnt about him when I was elected member of DU’s Executive Council from 1996 to 2000. He once came to my house with his wife when he didn’t have a wheelchair. He was just dragging himself, but had a big smile on his face.”Narain added, “Those 10 years in jail left him completely broken. He was thrown around and dragged when he got arrested. He had 21 ailments when we last counted. They did this to him because he spoke up on issues that nobody spoke about. They wanted to crush his voice. He still had the determination. In the prison, he used to teach inmates.” She also remembered, “When he came out of prison, he made pickles with lemons from Medak himself and gave them to me. He said it would be good for my health.”Saibaba had a strong presence and he drove things, recalled Karen Gabriel, viceprincipal of St Stephen’s. “We had common issues that we were fighting like land grabbing, illegal mining, etc., and we became good friends”.Gabriel said Saibaba hadn’t ever been fragile. “Then we saw how fragile they made him in prison. He was barely able to lift his right arm when left jail. His organs were damaged,” she said. “I spoke to his family and they are in a shambles.”(With inputs from Meghna Dhulia)",Former DU professor GN Saibaba died Saturday night at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences.

The prisoners, one serving a life sentence and another awaiting trial, escaped unnoticed until it was too late for prison authorities to track them.Even as Haridwar was agog with rumours that the two escapees were playing the role of monkeys in the ‘vanar sena’ (Lord Ram’s army of monkeys) and pretending to search for Sita when they fled, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami ordered a probe into the incident.The investigation will be headed by DIG Prison. Meanwhile, six jail staffers have been suspended on charges of dereliction of duty.One of the escapees, Pankaj , is a sharpshooter from Praveen Valmiki gang, and was sentenced to life for the murder of a sanitation worker in Roorkee. The other, Rajkumar , hailing from UP’s Gonda is an undertrial facing charges of kidnapping.

During the Ramlila performance, they used the distraction to tie the ladders with clothes and scale the prison wall.Jail authorities had started the tradition of Ramlila inside the prison a few years ago, allowing inmates to take part in acting while others, including guards, watched.Cops have filed a case and formed several teams to hunt for the accused.

NIA probes sabotage angle in train accident near Chennai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nia-probes-sabotage-angle-in-train-accident-near-chennai/articleshow/114180064.cms,"Photo by C Suresh Kumar

CHENNAI: NIA is investigating whether sabotage caused the Mysuru-Darbhanga Bagmati Express to veer off the main line and collide with a parked goods train Friday night at Kavarapettai station , 40km north of Chennai. The collision injured eight people and overturned 12 coaches.There were no casualties, as the coupling of the advanced Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches prevents telescoping, and the train was traveling at 90 kmph or less.“The reason for the accident could be many. A worn-out signal operating panel in the station master’s room or ongoing signal modification work in the area. But sabotage cannot be ruled out and needs to be investigated,” said a railway source.Officials are investigating how the express train entered the loop line, where the speed limit is only 30 kmph, despite receiving a green signal for the main line. Southern Railway general manager RN Singh confirmed that the driver followed the signals correctly after leaving Chennai. A suburban train heading towards Gummidipoondi had left Kavarapettai station minutes earlier, and Bagmati Express was given a green signal for the main line. Yet, the train inexplicably entered the loop line, resulting in the crash.Officials are also probing whether tampering with outdoor signalling gear and switch points at Kavarapettai station led to train switching from the main line to a loop line. Sources informed TOI that bolts and brackets at the switch point were found opened and several nuts were missing, raising concerns about sabotage. The accident comes on the heels of a similar tampering attempt reported in Sept at nearby Ponneri station.The switch point is a crucial mechanism that enables trains to shift from one track to another. Properly functioning signalling equipment is essential to ensure these transitions occur safely, following green or red signals displayed to the train driver. Any malfunction or tampering with these components could lead to trains being diverted onto incorrect tracks, significantly increasing the risk of accidents.On Saturday morning, southern circle commissioner of railway safety AM Chowdhary inspected the accident site, joined by NIA officers.The inquiry will begin next week, Chowdhary said. More than a dozen officials, including the driver of Bagmati Express, his assistant, and the on-duty station masters of Kavarapettai and Ponneri stations, will be summoned for questioning.Personnel from CRS and NIA inspected the site, with railway officials confirming that while the route and signal were correctly set for the main line, the train’s diversion to the loop line was “unusual”.","NIA investigating whether sabotage caused Mysuru-Darbhanga Bagmati Express to veer off the main line and collide with a parked goods train.

Ratan Tata's legacy





I dedicate my last years to health: Ratan Tata in Assam

NEW DELHI: Ratan Tata , chairman emeritus of one of India's biggest conglomerates Tata Group , died at 86 after prolonged illness. He was admitted to the hospital due to his age and related medical conditions.In a statement, Tata's family said, ""We his brothers, sisters, and family take solace and comfort in the outpouring of love and respect from all who admired him. While he is no longer with us in person, his legacy of humility, generosity and purpose will continue to inspire future generations.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned Ratan Tata and called him a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.""Shri Ratan Tata Ji was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being. He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond the boardroom. He endeared himself to several people thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""One of the most unique aspects of Shri Ratan Tata Ji was his passion towards dreaming big and giving back. He was at the forefront of championing causes like education, healthcare, sanitation, animal welfare to name a few,"" he added.Ratan Tata, who is also known for his charitable work, served as the chairman of the Tata Group from 1991 to 2012. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the conglomerate founded by his great-grandfather over a century ago.In 1996, Tata established Tata Teleservices, the telecommunications arm of the group, and in 2004, he led the initial public offering of Tata Consultancy Services, the group's IT company.After stepping down as chairman in 2012, Tata retained the honorary title of chairman emeritus for several Tata companies, including Tata Sons , Tata Industries, Tata Motors , Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals.Tata was awarded two of India's highest civilian honors: the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.One of India's most successful business tycoons, he is also renowned for his philanthropic endeavors. His personal involvement in philanthropy began in the 1970s with the initiation of The Aga Khan Hospital and Medical College project, which laid the foundation for one of India's premier healthcare institutions.After becoming the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, Tata's philanthropic efforts gained new momentum. He actively guided the Tata Trusts, established by his great-grandfather Jamsetji, towards addressing crucial social needs and established institutes of excellence such as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, while also funding educational initiatives across India.Despite his reputation for class and elegance, Tata was not immune to controversies. Although the Tata Group was not directly implicated in the 2008 scam involving the allocation of second-generation telecom licences, Tata was drawn into the controversy through leaked recordings of purported phone calls he made to lobbyist Nira Radia. However, he was not implicated in any wrongdoing.In December 2012, Tata handed over control of Tata Sons to Cyrus Mistry, his deputy at the time. However, the owners had issues with the functioning of the first non-Tata family member, leading to Mistry's ouster in October 2016. Ratan Tata was said to be one of the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on several projects, including Mistry's decision to discontinue the loss-making small car Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata.Since 2017, Tata has been the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons. During this time, he has taken on a new role, supporting young entrepreneurs of the 21st century by investing in new age tech-driven start-ups that will play a significant role in shaping the future of the country. In his personal capacity and through his investment company RNT Capital Advisors, Tata has invested in over 30 start-ups, including Ola Electric, Paytm, Snapdeal, Lenskart, and Zivame.One wet monsoon evening not many moons ago, dog-lover Tata had decreed that any strays outside the conglomerate's HQ in downtown Mumbai be allowed shelter. Some never left but their benefactor is no more.","Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Group, dies at 86 after prolonged illness.

NEW DELHI: Congress , which reacted to its Haryana debacle by blaming it on EVMs and rejecting the result as “unacceptable”, has decided to pause the line of attack and has turned the focus inwards to look into the role of factional feuds and weaknesses that prevented a win.The decision was taken at a review meeting convened on Thursday by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , with the party brass agreeing that it will firm up its position on EVMs as one of the key causes for the electoral loss only after it had gathered “firm evidence” of wrongdoing, sources said.A statement issued by Kharge’s office later in the evening said the party has decided to depute a technical team to look into complaints and discrepancies noted by candidates. “Congress will issue a detailed response based on the fact-finding team’s report on the counting process and functioning of electronic voting machines,” it said.The deliberations, held against the backdrop of supporters of factions led by former Haryana CM B S Hooda and former Union minister Kumari Selja pointing fingers at each other, saw Rahul Gandhi asserting the need for all to bury their differences and unite for the party’s interest. “The party’s interest is paramount,” a source quoted him as saying in the meeting. Fight between rival factions is widely seen to be the major factor in Congress’s defeat.Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting, with sources attributing their exclusion to the concern to “avoid bad optics”. The party is planning to carry out booth-level assessment by seeking a report from each candidate to study the factors that played a role in the loss.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Ajay Maken said, “As you all know, as the exit polls and opinion polls had showed, the results were unexpected. There was a lot of difference between the exit polls and the actual results. We discussed what could be the reasons.” On whether infighting had hurt Congress’s chances in the polls, Maken said, “There are various reasons, from EC to internal differences, we have discussed all that and will hold more discussions going forward.”On Tuesday, party general secretary Jairam Ramesh and spokesperson Pawan Khera had blamed the “slow counting of EVMs” for the party’s defeat to BJP: a bitter surprise which has helped the saffron rival gain momentum and raised doubts about the viability of Congress’s planks — guaranteed MSP purchase of entire farm produce, scrapping of Agnipath scheme, caste census and an “imperilled Constitution”.The rejection of the outcome, a first for a national party, drew a strong protest from EC, which rejected all the charges and raised eyebrows in independent quarters. BJP, of course, lashed out at Congress.Besides Kharge and Rahul, general secretary K C Venugopal, senior observers for the polls Ashok Gehlot and Maken, as well as secretaries for the state participated in the review meeting. Party in-charge of the state Deepak Babaria joined the meeting online from Ahmedabad.","Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting.

What is the Mahadev betting scam?

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Sourabh Chandrakar, one of the main promoters of the Mahadev betting app , is expected to be brought to India soon following his recent formal arrest in Dubai on the basis of an Interpol issued arrest warrant in a money laundering and fraud case.Chandrakar along with another promoter of the app, Ravi Uppal was detained in that country late last year following the ED 's request for issuance of a Red Notice (RN) against them.Sources said Chandrakar is expected to be either extradited or deported to India over the next few days after he was formally placed under arrest in Dubai recently.Red corner notices was issued against Chandrakar in October 2023 after the ED had moved a special court in Raipur, filed a chargesheet and obtained a non-bailable warrant against him.The Mahadev online betting scam, a complex web of illicit operations involving individuals from Bhilai, the steel city, and orchestrated from the UAE and various states in India, was uncovered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) following a series of raids in Chhattisgarh in 2023.The scandal, which unfolded during the previous Congress regime in Chhattisgarh, has since become one of the most significant controversies in the state.According to ED findings, the Mahadev online betting app was an unauthorized platform that facilitated illegal betting on various sports, including cricket and football, as well as other forms of gambling. Operating across India and internationally, the app attracted a large number of users with the promise of easy money.However, beneath the surface, it was allegedly involved in laundering vast sums of money, funnelling illegal earnings through a complex network of offshore accounts and shell companies.The ED's crackdown involved a series of high-profile raids across multiple locations, targeting individuals who wielded significant power during the Congress regime. These raids resulted in the seizure of incriminating evidence, including digital devices, financial records, and documents that revealed the extent of the app's illicit activities.The ED suspects that the betting app laundered over Rs 5,000 crores—a staggering amount that has raised concerns about the reach of such illegal operations within the Indian financial system.","Saurabh Chandrakar, the promoter of the Mahadev Online Book gaming-betting app, was arrested in Dubai.

MUMBAI: In one of the last cabinet meetings before the announcement of the assembly elections, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , who holds the finance portfolio, was present for only around 10 minutes and left immediately after tribute was paid to Ratan Tata Thursday.Thirty-eight decisions - many of them having major financial implications - were taken in the two and a half hours that the meeting continued for after he left.Chief minister Eknath Shinde presided over the meeting, and deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis was with him all the time.Insiders said it was possible he was unhappy with the state of affairs and the high number of urgent proposals being brought before the cabinet meeting at the last minute without prior circular. Over the past few weeks, the finance department has raised objections to several proposals moved in the cabinet.While Ajit Pawar could not be reached for his comments despite repeated attempts, NCP state unit chief and Lok Sabha MP Sunil Tatkare said there was no question of any friction in Mahayuti .""I was in Raigad and don't know what happened in the cabinet. But there is no question of any friction in the Mahayuti, and nothing should be read into anyone leaving the cabinet early if that has happened at all,"" Tatkare said.The state has already come under criticism for a slew of pre-election sops costing Rs 96,000 crore announced in the budget, including the Ladki Bahin scheme. The expenditure on the Ladki Bahin scheme on its own is slated to be Rs 46,000 crore per year.The state is on a spree of clearing land allotments, subsidies and guarantees in the run-up to polls. The finance dept has already warned that fiscal deficit could be as high as Rs 2 lakh crore for 2024-25.The department has warned that the fiscal deficit had crossed 3% of the GSDP, the limit set by the Maharashtra Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act.""This was probably first time that Ajit Pawar has left the cabinet like this. The exact reason is not known, but this is uncommon. His chair was vacant throughout the meeting,"" an official said.Over the last few weeks, fault lines have emerged between the Mahayuti partners - Shiv Sena and Ajit's NCP.","Ajit Pawar, who holds the finance portfolio, was present for only around 10 minutes.

to the CM-to-be

?

Would you now take a maximalist position to trap the Omar govt?

You are an elected MP but only on temporary bail?

AIP could win only one seat after all the hype.

There was a buzz around you because of your Lok Sabha win, but you fizzled out.

Did the allegations that you were a BJP proxy hurt your performance?

You won the Baramulla Lok Sabha elections from prison. Did the bail hurt you in the assembly elections?

Engineer Rashid’s AIP came a cropper after creating a buzz in J&K elections. But Rashid told TOI NC has started on a false note by not listening to his advice, which will hurt J&K in getting back statehoodI requested him ""don't take oath till statehood is restored"". Even Jammu region and BJP MLAs could not have opposed that stance.Nobody is taking away the MLAs. But Omar said Engineer is doing BJP's job. Is BJP silly to ask me to create issues for Omar that will bring a bad name to the Centre? Had he listened to me, we would have got statehood in 15 days. Now, I don't know how long we have to wait. He has missed the bus.I will support Omar on all steps he takes for the betterment of people. Had I wanted him to fail, I would have demanded he seek everything (from the Centre) in one day. My agenda is realistic.It is up to the people of India and the GoI. They must drop charges against me like they dropped the Public Safety charges against others. Let them respect the people's mandate. I drew crowds. If the PM told the world that people voted in large numbers in Kashmir, I also played a role in that. Please don't oppose my bail. I have taken oath under the Constitution and the media calls me anti-national.My party has been denied registration for seven years, and then a common symbol. We had 8-10 symbols for 34 candidates. So, I could not send a common message to people. I was released when the scrutiny for two phases of nominations was over. So, I could not make a proper selection of candidates. I knew only 2-3 candidates out of 34. It was a one-man show.Unfortunately, people came to know about me only after my release. But I became an MLA in 2008, I stood by my people. I had 4 lakh followers on social media. Anyway, AIP is the second largest force in Kashmir because we have an MP and an MLA, and a reasonable vote share in 30 odd seats.Here is a man who suffered for 5.5 years in jail, and they created a narrative to suit their politics. The verdict is out, and I am satisfied. People will see how Omar Abdullah will take things forward and he has already started taking U-turns. I was a single MLA but used to keep the entire govt and assembly on their toes on legitimate issues. I singlehandedly from 2008-18 forced Omar, Mufti, Mehbooba to respond to people's issues positively. Let them create perceptions. This is Kashmir. Keep on watching what happens in the future.No. People did not ever vote for me because they took mercy on me for being in jail. It was not a sympathy vote. I contested the LS polls in 2019 also and lost by 2,7000 votes. It was not a sympathy wave ever, but a vote for my unique model of governance.",Engineer Rashid's AIP came a cropper after creating a buzz in J&K elections.

Hindus should take lessons from the events in Bangladesh, he said as his organisation enters its 100th year.On society, and the country in general, he said there is a famous saying that even God does not care about the weak.“It is the job of the administration to prevent such indigents from happening, and to control and punish the culprits immediately. But until they arrive, society has to protect itself and its property along with the lives of loved ones,” he said.Bhagwat said his description of the situation was “not meant to scare, intimidate, or incite fighting”. “We are all experiencing the existence of such a situation. It is everyone’s responsibility to make the country united, happy, peaceful and strong. Hindu society has a greater responsibility,” he added.Bhagwat said Hindus in Bangladesh are facing persecution and have been reduced to a minority. They will need help from the “Bharatiya govt” and Hindu community all over the world.He said there is a “sudden increase in the incidents in the country that incite fanaticism without any reason (sic)” but there are “democratic ways ways to express it and oppose them”.He said “resorting to violence, attacking a particular community… trying to create fear is hooliganism”.He said “deep state”, “wokeism” and “cultural Marxism” are topics of discussion nowadays. “In fact, they are the declared enemies of all cultural traditions. Complete destruction of values, traditions and whatever is considered virtuous and auspicious is a part of the modus operandi of this group,” he said and called for a national narrative against such elements while remaining within the purview of the law. These elements are capturing educational institutions and spreading their distorted philosophy, he said.","Mohan Bhagwat said Hindus in Bangladesh are facing persecution and have been reduced to a minority.

How many Kashmiri Pandits were forced to leave?



National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah on Saturday appealed to the Kashmiri Pandits to ""come back home"". The Kashmiri Hindu community faced a mass exodus in the early 1990s when armed insurgency and terrorism peaked in the Valley, forcing them to flee Kashmir In an assurance to the Kashmiri Pandits, Abdullah, who is also J&K's former CM, said they ""should feel that the National Conference government is not their enemy"".""I hope that our brothers and sisters who have left from here come back home. Now the time has come, they should return to their homes. We do not think only about Kashmiri Pandits, but we also think about the people of Jammu, we should treat them well, they should also feel that the National Conference government is not their enemy. We are Indians and we want to take everyone along,"" Farooq Abdullah said.Abdullah's NC party, in alliance with the Congress party, swept the recently concluded J&K assembly polls, bagging 42 seats in the 90-member House while the Congress won six seats.In the polls, more than 35,000 displaced Kashmiri Pandits from across the country were eligible to vote at 24 polling stations in the first phase of the three-phased Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir In the second phase, nearly 40 per cent of eligible Kashmiri Pandits cast their ballots across the polling stations in Jammu, Delhi and Udhampur.The Kashmiri Pandits registered a voter turnout of over 30 per cent in the third and final phase of the elections in Jammu and Kashmir. Spread across 16 assembly segments in three districts of North Kashmir, out of 18,357 registered displaced Pandit voters, 5,545 turned up to cast their votes at 24 specially designated polling booths in Jammu, Udhampur and Delhi-NCR.The migration numbers have changed a lot over time, even in official records, presumably because they are constantly updated.In the years right after Kashmiri Pandits started leaving, the government put out an estimate of 50,000 families who had left Kashmir because of militancy.The 2022 estimate is actually lower — at 44,684. The number of migrant people, according to the Union ministry of home affairs in 2022, is a little over 1.5 lakh.","National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah appealed to the Kashmiri Pandits to ""come back home"" The Kashmiri Hindu community faced a mass exodus in the early 1990s when armed insurgency and terrorism peaked in the Valley.

NEW DELHI: Highlighting serious concerns in the functioning of madrasas across the country and their failure to connect Muslim children to the mainstream, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has written to all states and Union Territories recommending that state funding to madrasas and the Boards running them be stopped and the latter be disbanded.“Madrasas Boards pose multifaceted challenges to the realisation of rights of children, from not providing quality education to exclusion from mainstream education to lack of accountability,” states the NCPCR’s report titled ‘Guardians of Faith or Oppressors of Rights: Constitutional Rights of Children vs. Madrasas'. The Commission argues that constituting a Board or adhering to Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) Codes does not mean that the madrasas are following the provisions of Right To Education Act 2009 (RTE).Recommending that children from the Muslim community who are attending madrasas should be enrolled in formal schools , the commission which has sent its report to all states with the letter underlines that “religious education cannot be at the expense of formal education which is a fundamental right under the Constitution of India.”The commission has also recommended that all non-Muslim children enrolled in madrasas without consent of guardians or parents be taken out and admitted in schools for receiving fundamental education. Pointing out that Article 28 of the Constitution prohibits the imposition of religious instruction without consent of parents or guardians in case of minors, the report states that largely the states/UTs could not furnish the consent of parents of non-Muslim children for letting their children attend madrasas.Data shared by states which have Madrasa Boards shows that there were 9,446 non-Muslim children in madrasas in Madhya Pradesh followed by Rajasthan (3,103), Chhatisgarh (2,159), Bihar (69) and Uttarakhand (42) which comes to a total of about 14,819. The Madrasa Board in Odisha said there were no non-Muslim students enrolled and Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal did not provide the data as per the report.In the letter to chief secretaries, NCPCR chairperson Priyank Kanoongo said, “the exemption of religious institutions from RTE Act led to exclusion of children attending only religious institutions from the formal education system in keeping with RTE.”“What was intended to empower children ultimately created new layers of deprivation and discrimination due to wrong interpretation,” Kanoongo added.NCPCR states that the madrasas while providing religious education are not following the principle of secularism. “Also the exams administered by the Board of Madrasa Education and the books prescribed are not as per the curriculum given by NCERT and SCERT, keeping the students of Madrasas behind those who fall within the purview of RTE,” the report states.The NCPCR report also drew attention to the need to map the unmapped madrasas in the country. “There are 19,613 recognised madrasas and 4,037 unrecognised madrasas in the country (UDISE+ 2020-21). The enrollment for recognised Madrasas is 26,93,588 and for unrecognised Madrasas is 5,40,744,” it is stated. “Based on the estimation of 1.1 crore Muslim children that are out-of-school and attending madrasas, there could be more than 80,000 unmapped madrasas in the country,” the commission noted with concern.",National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has written to all states and Union Territories recommending that state funding to madrasas and the Boards running them be stopped.

The Blue Line, established in the 1970s, has been a longstanding point of tension.The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations has expressed its full support for the joint statement issued by the 34 countries contributing troops to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ).India, being a major contributor of troops, emphasised the paramount importance of ensuring the safety and security of peacekeepers in accordance with the existing UN Security Council resolutions.The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations said, ""As a major Troop Contributing Country, India aligns itself fully with the joint statement issued by the 34 UNIFIL troop contributing countries. Safety and security of peacekeepers are of paramount importance and must be ensured in accordance with extant UNSC Resolutions.""The United Nations Security Council established UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in response to Israel's ""invasion"" of Lebanese territory. Since its inception in 1978, UNIFIL has been deployed along the ""Blue Line,"" the border demarcating Lebanon and Israel. The UN Security Council extended the peacekeeping mission's mandate for an additional year in August, ensuring its continued presence in the region.The ministry of external affairs also commented on the situation, stressing the need for measures to protect UN personnel. ""We are concerned at the deteriorating security situation along the Blue Line. We continue to monitor the situation closely. Inviolability of UN premises must be respected by all, and appropriate measures taken to ensure the safety of UN peacekeepers and the sanctity of their mandate,"" said the MEA.Meanwhile, IDF acknowledged the concern for the injured peacekeepers and explained the circumstances. ""Earlier today (Friday), IDF soldiers operating in southern Lebanon identified an immediate threat against them. The soldiers responded with fire toward the threat. An initial examination indicates that during the incident, a hit was identified on a @UNIFIL_post, located approximately 50 meters from the source of the threat, resulting in the injury of two UNIFIL personnel,"" IDF had said on X.Meanwhile, directly addresseing the situation, the spokesperson for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) Andrea Tenenti said that UN peacekeepers stationed in southern Lebanon have decided to maintain their positions near the border, despite the recent injuries sustained by five of their members and the damage to their facilities during the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.According to Tenenti, Israel had requested UNIFIL to withdraw from positions ""up to five kilometres (three miles) from the Blue Line"" that separates the two countries. However, the peacekeepers unanimously decided to refuse this request, which would have affected all 29 of their positions in the southern region of the country. Tenenti stated, ""There was a unanimous decision to stay because it's important for the UN flag to still fly high in this region, and to be able to report to the Security Council.""Tenenti also expressed concern that the recent escalation by Israel against the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah could potentially escalate into ""a regional conflict with catastrophic impact for everyone"", emphasising that the only viable solution is through diplomatic means.","India has expressed concern over the safety of peacekeepers following an incident along the Blue Line between Lebanon and Israel.

NEW DELHI: In 2013, Ratan Tata candidly spoke about his initial experience as a student at Harvard University , revealing how he felt “confused” and “humiliated” by the impressive accomplishments of his peers. Tata described anxiously crossing off each day on his calendar, eager to return to what he referred to as the “normal world,” according to a report from the Harvard Gazette.Reflecting on those early days, Tata said, “It was the only time in my life where I sat and crossed out day by day how many days were left before I could return to the normal world.”Tata attended Harvard Business School ’s (HBS) Advanced Management Program in 1975.He recounted his experience during the 2013 dedication ceremony of Tata Hall, a seven-story glass-and-limestone building at HBS named in his honour. The Tata Group , along with the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Tata Education and Development Trust, had donated $50 million in 2010 for its construction, which began in 2011. Tata Hall now serves as a residential and educational space for the executive education program.Despite the challenging start, Tata noted the transformative impact of his time at Harvard. “As I look back, those 13 weeks were probably the most important 13 weeks of my life. They transformed me and my perspective,” he said, adding that the initial confusion he felt gradually faded, allowing him to appreciate the depth of his learning experience at the institution.“But what it did do for me, as I soon found out, the confusion sort of disappeared, and you understood the magnitude of what you had learned in a manner that I believe is not possible to do in places other than at this business school,” he explained.In designing Tata Hall, Tata, an architect by training, aimed to create a welcoming and transparent environment for students. “Can the building touch the ground lightly?” he had asked the architect, showcasing his vision for the structure.Harvard’s dean, Nitin Nohria , lauded Tata's contribution, stating, “Although our School has welcomed international students since its very first class in 1908, Tata Hall represents by far the most significant gift made by an international alum.” The facility supports over 9,000 executive education students annually, featuring 179 bedrooms, two classrooms with 99 seats each, and multiple conference spaces.","Tata attended Harvard Business School’s (HBS) Advanced Management Program in 1975.

The petitioner had siblings and his mother, who could have applied for the appointment but failed to do so within the prescribed time, the court noted.The court said the delay reflects ""inactivity and inaction"" on part of the litigant. Furthermore, the petitioner's claim for compassionate appointment was also weakened by the fact that his family had other earning members, which negated the immediate need for employment support.Considering legal principles surrounding delay and laches, the court dismissed the writ petition, reiterating that such inordinate delays are detrimental to equity and justice. The petitioner's failure to act promptly, coupled with absence of a compelling reason for the delay, led to the conclusion that the case could not be entertained.In a twist of fate, the petitioner died of Covid in 2020 during pendency of the petition. Thereafter, his legal representatives were brought on record.","Chhattisgarh HC has dismissed a writ petition on grounds of unjustifiable delay. The petitioner, Tamrdwaj Yadav, had moved HC, challenging rejection of his application for compassionate appointment. The court said the delay reflects ""inactivity and inaction"" on the part of the litigant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114179806,imgsize-2476726,width-400,resizemode-4/114179806.jpg"
