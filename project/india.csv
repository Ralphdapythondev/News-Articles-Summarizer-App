Shehzada and his gang are waiting for polling on April 26 to get over so that they can find another safe seat for him.Their own alliance partners are abusing the shehzada in Wayanad.

This is her first stint in the Upper House after serving 6 terms in Lok Sabha. This is will be the first time that Sonia would not contest in the Lok Sabha election since entering politics nearly two-and-a-half decades ago.Sonia had penned a letter to the voters of Rae Bareli announcing that she will not contest Lok Sabha polls due to health concerns.

Doordarshan's 'saffron' logo sparks political slugfest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doordarshans-saffron-logo-sparks-political-slugfest/articleshow/109465416.cms,"NEW DELHI: The visual makeover for Doordarshan 's news channels marked by a change in the colour of its logo from red to orange has sparked a controversy , with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and I&B minister locking horns over what the opposition called an attempt to ""saffronise"" the national broadcaster.Mamata slammed the move calling it ""absolutely unethical, grossly illegal, and speaks loudly of the pro-BJP bias of the national public broadcaster"" and demanded Election Commission's intervention.I&B minister Anurag Thakur, however, shrugged off the charge and suggested that Mamata's stand was in keeping with her resistance to ""anything saffron "".Prasar Bharti CEO Gaurav Dwivedi also pushed against the charge saying, ""No surprises there, your love for 'saffron' is publicly known :) Didi, Bharat Mata ki Jai."" He argued that the move was meant for visual enhancement and the colour that has raised hackles is, in fact, orange and not saffron as being alleged.Congress MP and former I&B minister Manish Tewari criticised the switch saying it was a move to assert BJP govt's control over the public broadcaster. ""This is an attempt on the part of the govt to saffronise and capture the govt institutions. The said move clearly undermines the neutrality and credibility of India's public broadcaster,"" he wrote on X.TMC MP Jawahar Sircar, who served as CEO of Prasar Bharati, also criticised the alleged saffronisation of the national broadcaster saying, ""As ex-CEO of Prasar Bharati it hurts to see the saffronisation of Doordarshan's logo - just before elections! It will influence voters, by overlaying the colour one religion and Sangh Parivar colour with a 'neutral' Public Broadcaster and a biassed Govt/Regime.""Dwivedi, however, argued that the adoption of a vibrant, visually appealing colour was part of the channel's branding and aesthetic upgrade. ""The colour is orange, not saffron,"" he clarified, further explaining, ""It's not just the logo that underwent change, the entire visual identity has been revamped. It's regrettable that people are reading more into this than necessary. We've been working on revitalising DD's look and feel for the past six to eight months.""Established on Sept 15, 1959, the national broadcaster had its logo designed by Devashish Bhattacharya, a student of the National Institute of Design.Contrary to political speculations, the broadcaster clarified that the colour change is rooted in the logo's history and aesthetic appeal. It pointed out that the original logo, chosen by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and introduced in 1976 along with theme music composed by Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Ahmed Hussain Khan, featured an orange hue against a green backdrop.The vice-president of Andhra BJP, Vishnu Vardhan Reddy attacked the critics saying, ""When #Doordarshan was launched in 1959, it had a saffron logo. Now, as the govt reintroduces the original logo, liberals and #Congress are outraging over it. It's blatantly obvious they harbour hate against 'Bhagwa' and Hindus.""","Mamata Banerjee and I&B minister Anurag Thakur lock horns over colour of Doordarshan's logo.

INDIA alliance tries to convince TMC for joint manifesto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-alliance-tries-to-convince-tmc-for-joint-manifesto/articleshow/109465647.cms,"TMC objects to caste census in manifesto

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress has thrown a spanner in the works of the INDIA alliance plan to release a joint manifesto for the opposition bloc to convey a sense of purpose and unity going forward in the Lok Sabha elections .Well-placed sources said efforts are on to bring TMC chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee around by impressing upon her the urgency to put out a minimal consensus document laying out the promises of the opposition to the voters as her opposition is proving to be the main stumbling block to its release.Sources said TMC has objected to the inclusion of “caste census” in the joint document, which is in line with its earlier red flag to the flagship policy measure on social justice. However, TMC had in the past come around when the INDIA grouping in one of its meetings succeeded in putting “caste census” in its agenda document, and then also repeated it in the public rallies.For the TMC to again raise an objection to the promise that if voted to power, the opposition will hold a nationwide headcount to determine the population of OBCs as well as other communities, appears to have raised doubts in key opposition quarters behind the intention of the Bengal outfit. Sources said the TMC appears more keen to stall the joint document, and is only using “caste census” as a pretext. Meanwhile, Mamata again on Saturday accused Congress and CPM for being hand in glove with BJP in West Bengal, and said “I had coined the name INDIA, but INDIA doesn’t exist in Bengal, it exists outside the state”.Sources said there is no point in releasing a document without “caste census” because it is a key plank of the Congress manifesto, and there is an unanimity on it in the coalition barring the TMC. Else, the option is to unveil the manifesto without the TMC’s support.The joint document is also likely to have a few key flagship promises made by Congress in its manifesto, on which there is practically an agreement with other constituents of the India bloc ."," Trinamool Congress has thrown a spanner in the works of the INDIA alliance plan to release a joint manifesto for the opposition bloc.

They have come together in 2024 as well, (but) BJP will win maximum seats in the state,"" Shah said in reference to Congress's Rahul Gandhi and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav.In Kota, Rajasthan, Shah said if people had voted for Congress in 2019, Kota would have become a bastion for Popular Front of India (PFI), an oblique reference to the banned outfit's foundation day rally in 2022. Alleging that Congress will lift the ban on PFI if it is elected to office, Shah asked, ""Ban on PFI should continue or not?""The question was answered with a resounding ""Yes"".

""Rahul Baba, don't spread lies, and listen to me with an open ear.

"In battle for Goa, BJP bets on Modi’s guarantee, Congress rakes up local issues",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-battle-for-goa-bjp-bets-on-modis-guarantee-congress-rakes-up-local-issues/articleshow/109470958.cms,"In the sultry Goa, the battle lines are drawn. As the mercury rises, so does politicking. On one side is the saffron front of BJP , while on the other is the disparate coalition of INDIA bloc led by Congress . There is a third character, too, in the Dance of Democracy: Revolutionary Goans , buoyed by their success in the 2022 assembly elections, have made a debut in the parliamentary polls.In the tiniest state, where politics of personalities trump politics of parties, it is no wonder that parties look for cues from their central leaderships when it comes to Lok Sabha elections . It is here that BJP has taken a head start. Armed with PM Modi’s guarantee, a double-engine govt and Viksit Bharat as the slogan, it has also thrown its weight behind ‘ Nari Shakti ’ by fielding a woman candidate for the first time in the party’s history for the parliamentary elections. After much dithering, discussions and meetings, giving some anxious moments to its die-hard supporters, Congress finally announced its candidates and it has gone back to the oft-repeated tactics of minorities’ fear under BJP rule, while harping on local issues like the Mhadei diversion, coal handling, double-tracking and unemployment.As the two national parties slug it out on the electoral arena, RG has tried to sneak in with its hyperlocal hyperbole. Playing on the sentiments of the people, RG has tried to evoke the loss of Goan identity and the struggle for survival of Goans. The numbers are stacked in favour of BJP. In the 40-member House, BJP and its alliance partners have 33 MLAs, while Congress and its allies have six with a lone RG MLA bringing up the total. BJP has also persisted with its OBC face, five-time MP and Union minister Shripad Naik from the dominant Bhandari community for the North Goa seat, while both Congress and RG have played the time-tested card of having a Hindu —Ramakant Khalap and Manoj Parab— from the north and a Catholic— Capt Viriato Fernandes and Rubert Pereira— from the south.The lone woman in the fray is Pallavi Dempo, who is having her first tryst in politics from South Goa. What is working in favour of BJP is its well-oiled machinery of karyakartas that allows it to put boots on the ground, being in office in both the Centre and the state and a distinct first mover advantage. Having already held a public meeting of PM Modi in South Goa before the elections were announced, the party is planning another one in the south again to consolidate its vote bank. There is a reason for uneasiness in the BJP camp over the South Goa seat. Having won the seat only twice—in 1999 and 2014—the saffron party knows that sometimes numbers alone are not enough. The underlying current of resentment and distrust against the party may sometimes swell, eclipsing the numbers, leaving it high and dry like it happened in 2019.BJP lost the seat by around 10,000 votes. BJP is also aware of the 2.2% drop in the vote share, while Congress saw a 6.6% increase with AAP garnering 3.1% of the total share. Now, with AAP along with other motley parties becoming part of the INDIA bloc, BJP is desperate to ensure that it continues to wipe out the 2.2% deficit and push its vote share above the 55% mark so that it can retain both the seats comfortably. There is a prestige issue also at stake for CM Pramod Sawant, who was unable to defend the South Goa seat in the last LS polls.No wonder, Sawant has been camping in the south assuaging those hardcore karyakartas who may be feeling betrayed by the introduction of a political novice as their candidate, while giving confidence and assurances to them. “This (having a woman candidate) is an honour and justice for women,” says Sawant, adding that this time he is confident of securing both the seats by record margins. Congress has been putting on a brave front. “Regardless of Modi’s influence, we will win both the seats due to false promises of BJP, silent voting in our favour, and discontent among BJP workers regarding candidate selection,” says its state president Amit Patkar.

Cases in India: First Blue Whale Challenge victim in 2017

A first-year Indian student in the US was found dead last month. It is reported that he took his own life last month while purportedly playing a game of dares called the “Blue Whale Challenge”, which became a social media phenomena a few years ago. This death, which has been widely reported as a murder, is now being investigated as “apparent suicide”.Often called the “suicide game”, the “Blue Whale Challenge” was created by Philipp Budeikin , a former convict in Russia, in 2013.It has reportedly claimed the lives of over 130 boys and girls in India, the US, China and other countries.This online challenge pressures players into self-harm and suicide over 50 days. Each day involves a “dare” which has to be filmed and shared as “proof.” These dares start easy (horror movies) but escalate to self-mutilation.The cases reported have seen young victims, who are given easy tasks initially, fostering addiction. Later, psychological manipulation keeps them engaged as dares become increasingly dangerous over 50 days.The game works by selecting vulnerable “players"" from social media by “the curator”. Blackmail and cyberbullying prevented the players’ escape.Budeikin was arrested with charges of inciting at least 16 teenagers to kill themselves. He pleaded guilty and was also sentenced to three years in prison.In India, the first victim of the deadly challenge was reported dead in July 2017, when 14-year-old Mumbai schoolboy Manpreet Singh Sahani, jumped to death from the seventh floor of a building.A Class X student in West Bengal committed suicide and his body was found in the bathroom with face covered in a plastic bag and with a cord. Another boy, son of a former minister, jumped to death in Delhi. A teenager in Kerala hanged himself to death allegedly while completing a Blue Whale challenge.The Ministry of Electronics and IT in an advisory shared in 2017 called the Blue whale game “an abetment to suicide"".","A first-year Indian student in the US was found dead last month.

Deepfakes, or digitally altered video and photos, have started to crop up online as India prepares to vote in the Lok Sabha elections 2024 from April 19. Following a fake video of Bollywood actor Aamir Khan endorsing a political party made rounds on the internet, a digitally manipulated clip of actor Ranveer Singh is being shared online.In the video, the actor is shown criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government at the centre, at the same time seeking votes for Congress.The video ends with Singh urging voters to vote for “nyaay” and the tagline 'Vote For Congress ' is seen flashing on the screen.It doesn’t take a second look to identify that the video is doctored. The lip movements of the actor in the video clearly doesn't match the audio. Notably, it is an old video shot when the actor visited Kashi, and in fact praised PM Modi for changing the face of the 'City of Ghats'.In the original video, Singh says, “I cannot express in words the experience that I have had today. I have been a devotee of lord Shiva and I have come here for the first time…” Here’s the original video:Recently, Aamir Khan filed an FIR against a deepfake video that showed him endorsing a specific political party. The actor’s office strongly denied any connection to politics or affiliation with any political party and issued a statement.“We want to clarify [that] Aamir Khan has never endorsed any political party in his 35-year career. He has dedicated his efforts to raising public awareness through campaigns for the Election Commission for many past elections,” the actor’s office said in the statement, as per news agency ANI.“We are alarmed now to see a recent viral video alleging Mr Khan is promoting a particular party. He would like to clarify [that] this is a fake and totally untrue video. He has reported the matter to various authorities, including filing an FIR with the Cyber Crime Cell of Mumbai Police,” the statement added.A video appears to be from his TV show “Satyamev Jayate,” that aired almost a decade ago.","Deepfakes, or digitally altered video and photos, have started to crop up online as India prepares to vote in the Lok Sabha elections 2024 from April 19.
