Professionals Congress launches 'Speak-Up' campaign to promote workplace wellness to help combat stress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/professionals-congress-launches-speak-up-campaign-to-promote-workplace-wellness-to-help-combat-stress/articleshow/113976054.cms,"NEW DELHI: Urging young professionals struggling with workplace stress to “speak up”, All India Professionals’ Congress (AIPC) on Saturday launched ‘For Anna For All: Workplace Wellness ’ campaign named after Anna Sebastian Perayil, a 26-year-old a CA from Kochi whose alleged death due to extreme work pressure has triggered a nation-wide discussion on workplace stress.The campaign launch follows the assurance given by Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi to the parents of Anna Sebastian during a video call with them on September 21 where he assured them that the Congress will take up the issue affecting professionals nationally and will also raise it in Parliament.Under the ‘Speak-Up’ campaign, AIPC has launched an online platform — ‘ www.profcongress.in/speakup ’ to enable professionals to share their experience with regards to work conditions and incidents and also provide suggestions. According to AIPC complete anonymity will be maintained for professionals who want to remain anonymous.“Millions of professionals across India are facing the same stress and pressure that Anna Sebastian experienced. It’s clear we must do more to support them,” Rahul Gandhi said in a post on X.“This initiative to create healthier working conditions for professionals is a crucial step in the right direction. I encourage everyone to get involved and help drive this movement forward. Together, we can make a meaningful difference,” he added.Sharing the details, AIPC chairman Praveen Chakravarty highlighted that it was a multi-phase programme and an expert group will also be created to draft guidelines for offices across India on ways to improve workplace conditions and wide consultations will be held with professionals and their families.According to AIPC, as a final step Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi will raise this issue in Parliament seeking a constructive discussion on the draft guidelines and urge the government to pass a law.Noting that the problem was widespread, Chakravarty disclosed that 3000 employees of one company have already written to the Professionals’ Congress about their stressful work conditions.He also clarified that the campaign was “completely apolitical”; it was not an Opposition party’s charge against the government. “Nor was it an issue about any particular company or about revenge,” he added.","All India Professionals’ Congress (AIPC) on Saturday launched ‘For Anna For All: Workplace Wellness ’ campaign.

Congress-NC have the edge in J&K: Exit polls

NEW DELHI: Exit polls on Saturday predicted that the Congress will be sweeping back into power in Haryana after a gap of 10 years, while its alliance with the National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir seems to be in a strong position and may form the next government, which last held assembly elections 10 years ago.Exit polls released on Saturday predicted a Congress sweep in Haryana with the party winning around 55 seats, the BJP 27 seats, INLD 2 seats, JJP 1 seat and others around 5 seats.In his first reaction to the exit poll results, senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda said: ""I feel that we will win 65 plus-minus seats. Congress will form the government with a thumping majority.""Haryana CM and BJP leader Nayab Singh Saini said he was ""confident that the BJP would form the government again with a complete majority on October 8"".""BJP will form the government with full majority. We are confident. Work has been done for every section of society in the last 10 years, and the state has been freed from regionalism and dynastic politics,"" said Saini on the exit poll predictions.The 90 seats of Haryana went to the polls in a single phase on October 5. The majority mark is 46 seats.The exit polls for the Haryana assembly elections were released shortly after voting concluded around 6pm.In the 2019 assembly elections, the BJP had won 40 of the 90 seats, forming a coalition government with the JJP, which won 10 seats. However, JJP later broke out of the coalition and BJP relied on independent MLAs to sustain the government. The Congress had secured 31 seats.Exit polls for the Jammu and Kashmir assembly election have predicted that the Congress-National Conference alliance may win around 43 seats, 3 short of the majority, while the BJP may win 27 seats, PDP 7 and others 13.With a hung assembly likely, former deputy chief minister of J&K Kavinder Gupta hinted that the BJP is already holding talks with ""like-minded"" parties.""It is only in the exit polls that Congress-NC has got these seats, but BJP will emerge as the biggest party once the correct results are out. We are confident of getting more than 35 seats in Jammu province and the remaining from Kashmir. BJP will be in a better condition in Kashmir ... Talks are going on with like-minded parties,"" Gupta said.National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah also dismissed the exit poll predictions.In a post on X, Abdullah said, ""I'm amazed channels are bothering with exit polls, especially after the fiasco of the recent general elections. I'm ignoring all the noise on channels, social media, WhatsApp Etc because the only numbers that matter will be revealed on the 8th of Oct. The rest is just time pass.""The Election Commission of India said that an overall 63.88% voter turnout was recorded in the assembly elections in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which was held in three phases: September 18, September 25 and October 1.The counting of votes for Haryana and J&K will take place on October 8.","Exit polls released on Saturday predicted a Congress sweep in Haryana.

To maintain transparency, we have installed CCTV cameras at the dais where our colleagues will be holding the fast,"" another junior doctor said.""We will join duty as promised but will not eat anything,"" he told PTI.The doctors' protest was triggered by the rape and murder of a trainee woman doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.The doctors had reverted to total cease-work on October 1, citing an attack on their colleagues at the College of Medicine and Sagore Dutta Medical College but withdrew it on Friday after a 24-hour ultimatum to the Mamata government.The junior doctors have set a 10-point charter of demands revolving around the security at hospitals, threat culture and patient care services. They have also demanded the removal of the health secretary, an investigation into corruption in West Bengal Medical Council and West Bengal Health Recruitment Board, as well as student council elections in all medical colleges.The Bengal Junior Doctors' Front has raised several demands, including the installation of CCTV cameras on hospital premises, round-the-clock security for healthcare workers, and stricter protocols to prevent incidents of violence against medical professionals.The doctors have also highlighted the culture of fear and intimidation within state-run hospitals, alleging that the administration has not provided a safe working environment.Later, they said unless they saw demonstrable intent on the part of the government to address these issues with clear action on the ground, they would be compelled to carry on with the protest.","The doctors' protest was triggered by the rape and murder of a trainee woman doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday ruled out bilateral talks with Pakistan during his upcoming visit to the country for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ).Speaking at the Sardar Patel lecture on Governance, Jaishankar said that while India desires good relations with Pakistan, it cannot be achieved by disregarding the issue of cross-border terrorism and engaging in unrealistic expectations.""Like any neighbour, India would certainly like to have good relations with Pakistan, but that cannot happen by overlooking cross-border terrorism and indulging in wishful thinking. As the Sardar demonstrated, realism must be the foundation for policy. India's relationship with China is similarly an issue on which the Sardar Patel's instincts are on record, and they differ considerably from that of Prime Minister Nehru,"" Jaishankar said.Jaishankar also highlighted the differing views of Sardar Patel and former Prime Minister Nehru regarding India's relationship with China, citing their famous correspondence in 1950.In a press conference following the event, Jaishankar clarified that his upcoming visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting will be a multilateral event, and he will not be discussing India-Pakistan relations ""I mean, I'm not going there to discuss India-Pakistan relations. I'm going there to be a good member of the SCO. But, you know, since I'm a courteous and civil person, I will behave myself, accordingly,"" he added.Jaishankar is scheduled to visit Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on October 15 and 16.The SCO, established in June 2001, is a Eurasian permanent intergovernmental international organisation consisting of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, and China.

It is circulating in the media and on social media, and Kumari Selja has confirmed it. In broad daylight, on a Congress platform in the presence of Deepender Hooda, a female leader was openly harassed and abused by Congress workers who are likely Hooda supporters. If women in Congress are not safe on public platforms during the day, how can the state's women feel secure? Congress is the most anti-women party, and tickets are being sold for money and influence. Sharda Rathore mentioned it, and Simi Rosebell John spoke about the casting couch,"" Poonawalla said.""Many female Congress leaders have left due to the misconduct by so-called Congress men. Yet, Priyanka Vadra, who promotes the slogan of women's empowerment, remains silent. Silent in Kannauj, Kerala, Kolkata, and even in Kathua, where a supporter of the accused was given a ticket and made a star campaigner. It is clear that Congress is anti-women, and their own leaders are revealing this. This is a published report. The discomfort of the female leader is visible in the video when she was being harassed. Congress signifies an anti-women mindset. Congress means if I am a girl, can I be safe from these Congress men? Will Priyanka Vadra and Rahul Gandhi take action against Hooda supporters?"" he added.Meanwhile, Congress leader Kumari Selja condemned the incident and demanded strict action against the accused party workers.""I spoke with her, and she mentioned that she was harassed there quite a bit. People were touching her, elbowing her, trying to remove her from the stage, as we also saw in the video. I confirmed this with her, and she said she was mistreated in such a manner. The point is, if this happens to a woman who works hard to rise in politics or any field and faces such behavior, what could be worse or more condemnable than this?""

Dalrymple criticises British Musuem exhibition 'Silk Roads' for ‘excluding’ India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dalrymple-criticises-british-musuem-exhibition-silk-roads-for-excluding-india/articleshow/113949562.cms,"Ceramic figure of a lute player (Credit: Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford)

LONDON: Historian William Dalrymple has criticised an exhibition at the British Museum featuring over 300 objects from the Silk Roads from CE 500 to CE 1000 for excluding India.Speaking to TOI from London after visiting the show, Dalrymple said he was shocked India was excluded given that India was the “biggest trading partner where East-West trade took place” during this period.The exhibition “Silk Roads”, which opened last week, claims to “challenge the popular concept of the Silk Road as a single trade route, instead showing how the Silk Roads were made up of overlapping networks.”“Hanging from the ceiling in a single corridor are various location names — it covers almost all of Asia, except India, and it seems so bizarre, because India was the largest trading partner of the Roman empire,” the author said.“When you are trying to present the trade routes of the ancient world and do all the minor sites of international trade and miss out the biggest trading partner where east-west trade took place in its greatest quantity, it is bizarre, particularly when you open the exhibition with a Buddha from Swat and end with a purse containing Rajasthani garnets,” he said.“They acknowledge these garnets, but there is no display for India which should be at the heart of the show. It ends up being a bizarre omission, almost inexplicable, to anyone that knows the centrality of India to ancient trade networks,” he added, pointing out not one Roman coin horde has ever been found in China, yet Roman coin hordes are found in India every year.India was the greatest trading partner with Rome of the classical world, while China and Rome had only the very faintest impression of each other’s existence, Dalrymple said.This is a theme of his book, ""The Golden Road”, in which he argues this notion of an East-West overland route linking China with the Mediterranean, the so-called Silk Road, is a myth which grew out of a Sino-centric reframing of history. “Silk was not even the biggest product imported from the East; pepper from India was,” he said.“India has a haunting presence throughout the exhibition,” Dalrymple said.Buddhism is a central feature, even if the exhibition misses out the home of Buddhism, India.“Nalanda doesn’t feature at all,” he said. “Yet this was the period when the Buddhist monks were coming from Japan and China to Nalanda.”A spokesperson for the British Museum said: “We don’t recognise the characterisation made by Dalrymple. The exhibition goes beyond the narrow 19th-century definition of the Silk Road to present a richer, more complex story of the Silk Roads as overlapping networks.”“Maps in the exhibition and accompanying book also refer to sites from India. For instance, a map showing the probable route of the 9th century ship that sank off the coast of Indonesia, near the island of Belitung, recognises that the vessel most likely stopped at ports along the coast of the Indian subcontinent,” the spokesperson said, adding, “Objects featured throughout the exhibition point to the importance of India in the trade of goods and the transmission of knowledge.”“The game of chess is noted as an invention in India probably around 500 CE and is represented by the world’s oldest group of chess pieces, made from elephant ivory probably sourced from India,” the spokesperson said.",Historian William Dalrymple has criticised an exhibition at the British Museum for excluding India.

"Seek science milestones, not personal glory: Gaganyaan astronaut; next batch selection soon: Isro Chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/seek-science-milestones-not-personal-glory-gaganyaan-astronaut-next-batch-selection-soon-isro-chief/articleshow/113946017.cms,"Gaganyaan group Captain Angad Pratap

No personal glory

Comprehensive training

BENGALURU: In an online talk Friday, the first such for any of the four astronaut-designates of the Gaganyaan programme since their selection, Group Captain Angad Pratap said that as India’s human spaceflight programme evolves, the astronaut pool would become more diverse and that aspirants should internalise that there are no personal glories to be sought but only science milestones. Isro chairman S Somanath, in an exclusive interview to TOI on Friday, said that the space agency has already discussed the need for more astronauts with the Indian Air Force (IAF) and that the process would be initiated at a suitable time. IAF’s Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM) in Bengaluru screened and selected the first batch of Gaganyaan astronauts and will be involved in creating the larger pool too.Pratap, delivering a talk on ‘who can become an astronaut’ offered insights into the rigorous selection process and training regimen for India’s future space explorers.While giving a disclaimer that he isn’t involved in making policies for future astronaut selection, Pratap emphasised that Isro is particularly interested in candidates from experimental domains and those involved in direct aerospace research.“Any research work that can address the current challenges faced by Isro in its technical pursuits will certainly get preference,” he said. As the programme evolves, Prathap predicts a shift in the selection pool. While early batches may predominantly consist of military aviators and researchers, future selections are likely to diversify.Likening the process to cricket, Pratap described the first batch of astronauts as “openers” or pioneers. “...For the coming decade, they will form the first era of astronauts. These individuals must navigate uncertainties and exhibit patience as the programme develops,” he said.He stressed that becoming an astronaut is a commitment to space research and science, not about fame or simply experiencing a space ride. “The only thing one needs to do is love science. Do science and become science,” he advised aspiring astronauts.“...Remember, your choice to become an astronaut is always for science and it’s not about you…It can never be about celebrity status. But for those who wish to become an astronaut purely to go to space and get a view of the Earth or those who wish to get a kick out of it thinking they are the best, maybe this field is not for them. If someone joins the astronauts corp for such reasons, he or she may not last more than a few years. There’s no personal glory to seek, there are only milestones for the cause of science to seek,” he said.Pratap said the Gaganyaan training programme is comprehensive, covering six key verticals: core academics, physical fitness, aviation skills, psychology, survival skills, and miscellaneous skills. He said astronauts undergo 3-5 hours of daily physical training, including yoga and supervised nutrition.They must also master space theory, participate in simulator sessions, and engage with scientists. Aeromedical training is highlighted as a critical component of the Astronaut Training School (ATS). Survival training in various environments — snow, desert, and sea — is also mandatory.Pratap outlined several core qualities required for aspiring astronauts: honesty and integrity, excellent stress management skills, ability to handle rejection, gratitude for the collective effort behind space missions, sustained focus and discipline, and maturity, humility, and groundedness.On whether any of the four astronaut-designates has been shortlisted to be part of the first Gaganyaan crewed flight, Somanath told TOI: “There will be a process to identify which one of the four will go as part of Gaganyaan, once we have the maturity in terms of the programme. As of now, we are yet to even demonstrate uncrewed missions, we need to do three of them. Once they are done, the health and other parameters of the four astronaut-designates will be reassessed and the committee will choose. All four will be eligible for selection.”","Isro chairman S Somanath said that the space agency has already discussed the need for more astronauts with the Indian Air Force (IAF) Group Captain Angad Pratap said that as India’s human spaceflight programme evolves, the astronaut pool would become more diverse.

The woman is a New Zealand citizen of Indian origin who had got her marriage with an Indian, an NRI, registered in New Zealand in May 2013.They lived together until Nov of the same year and when the husband returned to India, she kept coming to India. She later found out her husband had been married previously. She lodged an FIR against him for breach of trust. The husband was arrested and got bail after a week. However, they continued to meet each other. In her FIR lodged in Sept 2014, the woman said her husband had raped her when at a hotel in Navsari. The man then sought quashing of the FIR. His counsel said the man's second marriage was valid because he was a Muslim, and this would make the rape charge invalid. The govt opposed the quashing petition. ""Since marriage with the applicant of the victim is illegal, when he established physical relations with her during Sep 2014 at Navsari it was a clear case of an offence under IPC Sec 376,"" the prosecutor argued.Justice Umesh Trivedi took note of the fact the woman later married a man of her choice and was not interested in the criminal proceedings. ""They entered into a marriage and got it registered in New Zealand, and thereafter stayed together as husband and wife. Whether entering into that marriage is legal or illegal, physical relations were established with express consent.

For youngsters who are successful at NEET, the MBBS degree continues to be the most sought-after choice, with students vying for seats in various colleges and quotas, including the expensive management seats.However, dental course, which was once the clear second option, now has Ayurveda - India's ancient system of medicine - snapping at its heels.The numbers tell the story: In Maharashtra, private Ayurveda colleges closed their recent first-round admissions with a NEET score cut-off of 387, while private dental colleges settled at 396. Dental still holds a slight edge, but the competition is uneven as there are 95 private Ayurveda colleges compared to 25 private dental institutions.A similar trend is seen in govt institutions - admissions to the four dental colleges ended at NEET score of 606, while cut-off at the 22 govt and aided Ayurveda colleges was 436 at the end of first round.In the previous year, the last candidate to get a govt Ayurveda seat had scored 516 in NEET while the corresponding admission in govt dental was 515. In private colleges, the dental cut-off was 201 as compared to 206 of Ayurveda.""This year, top Ayurveda colleges have recorded high cut-offs. Students who missed an MBBS seat by a whisker, have put down their next option as Ayurveda instead of dentistry.

""Before Covid, Ayurveda was languishing... though there were fewer colleges than now, seats remained vacant,"" he said.Pawar pegs Ayurveda's rising popularity to several factors: opening up of govt jobs for Ayurveda graduates, expansion of their scope of work that allows them to practise as general physicians and the increase in the number of patients turning to ""various Indian-pathy"" post-Covid.Ayurveda's rise has been so swift that there are whispers that some colleges now charge capitation fees - though illegal, it's a sign of the field's growing clout.""Ayurveda colleges previously charged 3x the regular fee for institutional quota seats, while MBBS colleges were allowed to charge 5x.

""With a sharp focus on rigorous research, enhanced standards in Ayurvedic education, and a commitment to a truly holistic view of health, we are redefining the field.

""Indian govt has championed it, digitising records and promoting its benefits, but what's striking is people from all walks of life are now embracing it.""

If they (BJP) think they will form the govt, then they live in cuckoo’s world.”NC vice president and Farooq’s son Omar Abdullah echoed his father’s sentiments, saying the party would prefer to sit in opposition rather than forge an alliance with BJP. “Any kind of arrangement would ruin any party in Kashmir,” he said.The statements came in response to speculation of potential post-election alliances, particularly if neither NC nor BJP secures the required number of seats for govt formation.The elections were the first in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 and the region’s bifurcation into two Union territories, including Ladakh. J&K now has a 95-member assembly — 90 elected and five nominated by the lieutenant governor.PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti ’s younger daughter Iltija Mufti accused BJP-led Centre for changing rules in J&K, alleging Saturday that these moves were meant to reduce the CM’s role to that of a “glorified mayor” and leave the govt powerless.“With the LG nominating five MLAs and the chief secretary changing transaction of business rules, it’s clear that the incoming govt will be a toothless tiger… How much more will the Government of India strip J&K of any semblance of authority and autonomy? Rubber stamp CM…” Iltija wrote on X.Iltija’s remarks followed Omar’s suggestion that BJP had “accepted defeat” in J&K. “Why else would the chief secretary be assigned the duty to change (assembly’s) transaction of business rules…?” Omar asked Friday.","National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah ruled out any possibility of a post-poll alliance with BJP to form the next govt in J&K. Results of the assembly elections are declared on Oct 8. “The vote we got here is the vote against BJP,” said the former J &K CM.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113972404,imgsize-25576,width-400,resizemode-4/113972404.jpg"
