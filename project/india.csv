US lawmakers questions FDAs drug inspection programme in India and China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-lawmakers-questions-fdas-drug-inspection-programme-in-india-and-china/articleshow/111244891.cms,"WASHINGTON: Three top American lawmakers have questioned the foreign drug inspection programme of the Food and Drug Administration in India and China. In a letter to FDA commissioner Robert Califf, the lawmakers on Monday wrote that the difference in inspection outcomes appears to be just another example of institutional weaknesses and dysfunction in the FDA's foreign drug inspection programme.The letter dated June 21 was written by House Energy and Commerce committee chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, subcommittee on health chair Brett Guthrie, and subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Chair Morgan Griffith following the analysis of the outcomes of FDA inspections in India and China from January 2014 to April 2024. ""The results of this analysis were surprising, revealing tremendous variation in inspection outcomes. Some FDA inspectors found compliance issues during all or almost all of their inspections. Other inspectors rarely reported finding a single compliance issue. Two inspectors never found a single compliance issue throughout a combined 24 inspections in India,"" they wrote.Another inspector found zero compliance issues in 20 out of 23 inspections (85 percent) in China while finding compliance issues in almost half of domestic inspections during the same period. These are unusual inspection outcomes, the opposite of what would be expected given the widely reported failures in quality control and lack of adherence to current good manufacturing techniques by drug manufacturing facilities in China and India, the lawmakers wrote.""By contrast, 16 FDA inspectors, with over 325 inspections collectively in India, found compliance issues during every inspection they conducted. As a measure of what a pattern of rigorous inspections should look like, the committee reviewed the inspection outcomes for 3 FDA inspectors with a professional reputation for thoroughness who also had at least 10 inspections in China or India during the studied period,"" they wrote.These expert inspectors reported finding no compliance issues during inspections in China at a rate of only 6.7 to 11.4 percent and at a rate of zero to 9.5 percent in India, they said, adding that such large variations in inspection outcomes are troubling, and they merit further investigation. At a minimum, the committee is concerned that these findings suggest vast differences in the skill, thoroughness, and competence of FDA inspectors.As such, the lawmakers pressed for more information regarding the agency's foreign drug inspection programme.","Three top American lawmakers have questioned the foreign drug inspection programme of the Food and Drug Administration in India and China.

"IB chief, NHRC secretary general get 1-year extension",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ib-chief-nhrc-secretary-general-get-1-year-extension/articleshow/111240765.cms,"Intelligence Bureau chief Tapan Kumar Deka

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday announced a one-year extension for Intelligence Bureau director Tapan Kumar Deka until June 30, 2025. This comes close on the heels of national security adviser Ajit Doval's reappointment as the national security adviser for a period co-terminus with that of the Narendra Modi govt.

The continuity in the higher echelons of the central security establishment under Modi govt 3.0 is being seen as crucial to the regime's keenness to move further on key priorities like countering terrorism in J&K that now has the Jammu region on target, holding J&K assembly polls peacefully, pushing back Maoists further in Left-wing-extremism-hit pockets, initiating talks with different communities in Manipur to end the ethnic strife, reaching a settlement with Nagas and tackling pro-Khalistan elements in Punjab.

Deka, a 1988 batch IPS officer belonging to Himachal Pradesh cadre, was appointed its director in June 2022. He has served in different security theatres, including LWE-hit areas, through his career in the premier central intelligence agency, and was instrumental in the strategy to defang Indian Mujahideen.

The Centre on Monday also gave a year's extension to secretary general of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Bharat Lal.

Indian Migrants Pay Rs 80 Lakh for New Illegal US Entry Routes via Charter Flights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/rs-80-lakh-new-routes-and-charter-flights-how-indian-are-trying-to-illegally-enter-into-us/articleshow/111193058.cms,"Here are some FAQs based on Reuters investigations:

What are the new routes for illegal migrants?

What triggered the investigation into these new routes?

What is the cost of these new smuggling routes?

How have US authorities responded to this new smuggling tactic?

What are the broader implications of these smuggling routes for US immigration policy?

How are these new routes avoiding traditional migration barriers?

What role does Nicaragua play in these smuggling operations?

What impact has this had on the passengers caught in these operations?

In a new phase of illegal immigration to the United States, migrants from India and other nations are paying smuggling networks substantial fees for travel packages that include airline tickets, bus rides, and hotel stays en route to the US-Mexico border .These routes involve charter flights to Central America, with migrants then traveling overland to the border.The Biden administration is working with regional governments and travel companies to curb this flow, revoking US visas for owners and executives of charter airlines and other companies suspected of facilitating smuggling.As per a Reuters investigation, one route starts in West Africa, with migrants paying up to $10,000 for multi-stop commercial flights to Nicaragua before continuing by land to the US. The second route, serving migrants from India, offers charter flights to Central America and overland transfers to the US border for between $72,000 and $96,000 per person, with full payment often due after arrival in the US.Nicaragua has emerged as a new entry point for many migrants, with President Daniel Ortega's government allowing individuals from anywhere in the world to fly directly in exchange for a cash payment. The US has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on Nicaraguan officials and sanctions on government-affiliated companies over irregular migration and repressive policies, the Reuters investigation found.On July 15, when a Legend Airlines Airbus A340 touched down at San Salvador airport after an 18-hour journey from the United Arab Emirates, the crew sensed something was amiss. Salvadoran officials, suspecting the nature of the flight, refused to connect the jet bridge, leaving approximately 300 passengers, all Indian nationals, stranded on the plane. According to three former crew members who spoke to Reuters anonymously, several passengers admitted their intentions to travel to Mexico and then cross into the US illegally.Salvadoran officials and their US counterparts grew suspicious after noticing an unusual pattern of charter flights arriving in El Salvador with Indian nationals who claimed to be tourists but had minimal luggage for extended stays. Nearly all passengers disembarking in San Salvador were later found to have crossed the US border illegally, the Reuters report said.According to Indian court documents and KT Kamariya, a deputy superintendent of police in Gujarat, India, migrants from India pay between 6 million ($72,000) and 8 million rupees ($96,000) for packages that include charter flights to Central America and overland transfers to the US border.The US administration has been collaborating with regional governments and travel companies to curb the flow of migrants. Measures include revoking U.S. visas for owners and executives of companies suspected of facilitating smuggling and warning commercial airlines to monitor passengers who might be intending to migrate illegally.These new routes complicate the enforcement of US immigration laws, especially as the Biden administration faces criticism and political pressure over high border crossings. The administration attributes the surge in migration to global economic and political instability, while opponents argue that current policies encourage illegal migration.The new smuggling routes bypass visa requirements for direct flights to Mexico and the dangerous Darien Gap trek between Colombia and Panama. Instead, migrants are flown to Central American countries like Nicaragua and El Salvador, from where they make overland journeys to the US border.Blas Nuñez-Neto, the US Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for Border and Immigration Policy, identified Nicaragua as a new entry point for many migrants. The Nicaraguan government, led by President Daniel Ortega, has been accused of exploiting migration flows by allowing anyone from around the world to enter the country in exchange for cash payments.Many migrants, like Gurpreet Singh from India, have faced multiple failed attempts to enter the US, often resulting in financial ruin and legal troubles. Singh, who paid $72,000 for a smuggling package, was deported from several countries and now faces forgery charges in India.","Migrants from India and other nations are paying smuggling networks substantial fees for travel packages that include airline tickets, bus rides, and hotel stays.

NTA NEET updates: 750 Students Skip NEET-UG Retest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/750-of-1563-students-skip-neet-ug-retest-nta/articleshow/111209526.cms,"CBI

files FIR over

alleged irregularities

in NEET-UG

Key developments since May 5 NEET exam

The CBI's involvement follows the education ministry's announcement to hand over the probe, a move that some protesting students had demanded. The CBI has registered a new case against unidentified individuals under Indian Penal Code sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating), among others.

The development comes after widespread protests and student litigation regarding paper leak claims. The accusations of irregularities led to protests in various cities, legal battles, and political disputes, with the opposition accusing the government of jeopardising students' futures.

Ten students have approached the Supreme Court, seeking directions for the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to investigate the alleged irregularities in NEET-UG. Their petition also requests that the Bihar Police expedite their investigation and submit a report to the apex court.

In another instance, the Supreme Court has asked the Center, the National Testing Agency (NTA), and others to respond to multiple petitions, including those calling for the cancellation of the NEET-UG 2024 exam and a court-monitored probe. The court has also paused proceedings on similar petitions in various high courts.

Following criticism over alleged discrepancies in various competitive exams, the central government has replaced NTA Director General Subodh Singh. Additionally, a seven-member panel led by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan has been established to review the NTA's functioning and suggest exam reforms.

NEW DELHI: National Testing Agency (NTA) on Sunday said that 750 of 1,563 students who were awarded grace marks skipped the retest conducted for NEET-UG candidates. Meanwhile,813 appeared for the retest after an order from the Supreme Court.The retest took place at seven centers. An official reported, “As many as 813 of the 1,563 candidates who were earlier awarded grace marks in NEET-UG appeared for a retest on Sunday.”Among them was an exam center in Chandigarh which was set up with all necessary arrangements including police and invigilators. However, it closed its gates after two students scheduled for the NEET-UG retest on Sunday did not show up.The NEET-UG exam, administered by the NTA on May 5, took place across 4,750 centers in 571 cities, including 14 international locations. Over 23 lakh candidates participated in the examination.An unprecedented number of students—67—scored a perfect 720, raising concerns about potential irregularities. Among these, six students from a center in Faridabad, Haryana, have attracted particular suspicion.Controversy also arose over grace marks awarded to students affected by time loss at six centers due to a late start. The Center informed the Supreme Court that these grace marks would be scrapped, and 1,563 affected students would be offered a retest.The NEET-UG examination is a critical pathway for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH, and other related courses in both government and private institutions nationally.The NEET-PG entrance exam has also been postponed, marking the fourth entrance exam affected recently.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed an FIR over alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG exam conducted on May 5, following a reference from the Union education ministry. CBI sent dispatched special teams to Godhra in Gujarat and Patna in Bihar to take over existing police investigations.The ministry's complaint to the CBI cited 'certain isolated incidents' in a few states during the examination, prompting the agency to investigate allegations of irregularities, conspiracy, cheating, impersonation, breach of trust, and evidence destruction.","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed an FIR over alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG exam conducted on May 5.

He comes down often to meet his mother, but this time he drove all the way. His route took him through the UK , France, Germany, Belgium, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Estonia, China, Tibet, Nepal and finally, India.The first leg of the journey saw Mungale accompanied by a Nepales, Roshan Shresta, up to Kathmandu.“I had planned this after reading about the historic Silk Route, and later after I read about a couple who had done it, but emails to the couple did not yield any response from them, I thought I’d plan it myself,” Mungale said. “When I shared this plan with my wife, she thought I was joking, but later, she supported it, and that’s how I planned the entire trip. Though it was planned before the pandemic, it got postponed until now.”Mungale meticulously charted his entire driving route before setting off. Averaging 400-600 km a day, sometimes covering up to 1,000 km, depending on the conditions, he was careful to avoid late-night driving to ensure safety. “We had done pre-maintenance on the SUV, but faced a minor technical problem when we reached Poland, but we overcame it, and it was a smooth drive from there.”Experiencing the diverse nature and culture of each country along the way, the IT professional took two months of leave without pay. Mungale secured all necessary permissions before entering each country.“Being a British national, I did not have any issues entering European countries or any other country. All my documents were ready, and the legal processes were taken care of.”“We did not face any major weather in any climatic conditions, though it was summer in most places... We had also reached the higher altitudes of 5,200 mts and faced minor altitude sickness, snow and extreme cold, altogether amazing experience but well prepared for that as well,” Mungale said.“Food was not a problem either, as apart from beef and insects, I eat everything. We would take a break after 3-4 pm and start searching for hotels or places to stay overnight,” he revealed.In the second leg, from Kathmandu, Mungale was joined by his wife and a relative for the remainder of the trip. Each leg of the journey was meticulously planned to manage fatigue and ensure safety. The entire 18,300 km journey required nearly 3,000 litres of fuel.Mungale’s journey stands as a testament to human endurance and the spirit of exploration, highlighting wonders and challenges of overland travel across diverse terrains and cultures.","Virajit Mungale embarked on his adventure on April 20, till June 17.

EVM plea

Firebrand OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal is hurt over the way he was humiliated by BJP and Shiv Sena brass as well as NCP president Ajit Pawar in the run-up to the LS and the RS polls.Although Bhujbal has no plans to quit NCP, he feels he was more respected in undivided NCP led by his political mentor, Sharad Pawar. From once being a member of the core committee that decided the nominees for assembly and LS elections, he was ultimately denied a nomination after a long wait.When the discussion for the Nashik LS seat began, although Shiv Sena's Hemant Godse was Eknath Shinde's first choice, the BJP leadership felt that Bhujbal had elective merit. At a meeting at the residence of Ajit Pawar, Bhujbal was told he would be NCP's Nashik LS pick and that his name would be declared at any moment.Bhujbal began massive preparations in the region. He waited and waited, and ultimately on the last day of filing of nominations, Shinde declared Godse's candidature, which surprised all since he had not been in the zone of consideration. Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Rajabhau Waje defeated Godse.Then, Bhujbal was given the hope that he would be nominated to the Rajya Sabha from the seat vacated by Praful Patel. Bhujbal knew it was a false promise, yet he held on to the hope of showing his presence in the national capital. At the last moment, Ajit Pawar's wife, Sunetra Pawar, was nominated to the Rajya Sabha. Bhujbal lodged a silent protest, but it was a futile exercise.Senior BJP functionaries are surprised by Sujay Vikhe Patil applying for verification of EVMs at 40 police stations. Defying expectations, Sujay, the son of revenue minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, lost theLS polls from Ahmednagar to NCP (SP)'s Nilesh Lanke by 28,929 votes.Eight other candidates who lost the polls, including three from BJP, have sought EVM check and verification.Sujay has demanded checking of EVMs of Karjat-Jamkhed assembly seat represented by NCP (SP)'s Rohit Pawar, Parner represented by Lanke, Shrigonda by BJP's Babanrao Pachpute, Rahuri by NCP's Prasad Tanpure, and Shevgaon by BJP's Monika Rajale. Apparently, at a meeting convened by the local BJP unit, Sujay was told he received negligible votes in 40 booths and he then decided to approach the district election officer.BJP functionaries feel that Sujay's decision has given ammo to the opposition, which had already been insisting on restoration of the ballot paper system. A senior party functionary says it's being doubted if he even consulted the BJP brass before taking the call.","OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal is hurt over the way he was humiliated by BJP and Shiv Sena brass.

PM Modi sets stage for stormy session with 'Emergency' attack; opposition responds with 'save Constitution' march,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/reading-the-numbers-in-the-house-oppn-revels-in-stronger-presence-modi-led-nda-vie-to-stave-off-challenge/articleshow/111237054.cms,"Rahul Vs Modi Encounter; Cong MP's Action During PM's Oath Goes Viral | Watch

NEW DELHI: The 18th Lok Sabha started on a stormy note with both the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led opposition making their intent clear on Day 1 of the session. With the BJP short of majority and the Congress nearly doubled in strength, the number dynamics of the Lower House has changed and Monday offered a glimpse of the fireworks that could follow in the days ahead.Prime Minister Modi set the stage for the government's offensive making a special mention of the ""dark days of Emergency"" in his speech ahead of the session. The Prime Minister said the new generation will never forget the day when the Constitution of India was completely rejected by suppressing democracy and the country was turned into a prison. He exhorted people to take a resolve to protect democracy and democratic traditions of India so that such an event never arises again.The Congress-led opposition, on the other hand, kept the campaign momentum going as it took out ""Save Constitution"" march to Lok Sabha and later waived copies of the Constitution, both outside and inside the House.In his customary pre-session remarks, Modi targeted his political rivals as he said people want debate and diligence, and not drama and disturbance, in Parliament. The Prime Minister also reached out to the opposition and stressed on consensus as the need of hour to run the country. “To run a government, we need a majority but to run a country we need consensus,” he said. Substance is important, not slogans , the PM added.However, with his Emergency attack to isolate the Congress within the opposition ranks, PM Modi made it clear that the government was ready to take the fight to the opposition camp.PM Modi's attack evoked a strong reaction from the Congress with party chief Mallikarjun Kharge accusing him of imposing ""undeclared Emergency"" in the last 10 years, which the people of the country have ended by not giving the BJP a majority.Kharge said the Prime Minister made a longer than usual customary address ""but clearly, even after the moral and political defeat, the arrogance remains"".""Narendra Modi ji, you are giving advice to the Opposition. You are reminding us of the 50-year-old Emergency, but have forgotten the last 10 years of Undeclared Emergency, which was ended by the people,"" the Congress president said in a post on 'X'.""People have given their mandate against Modi ji. Despite this, if he has become the Prime Minister, then he should work,"" Kharge said, adding that the nation was hoping that he would say something on important issues.Taking a swipe at Prime Minister's words that ""people need substance, not slogans"", Kharge said the Prime Minister should remind himself of this.Inside Lok Sabha, it was Rahul Gandhi, who led the charge against the Prime Minister as the Congress leader showed a copy of the Constitution when PM Modi took his oath. Rahul demanded that the government address ten fiascos in 15 days that have erupted since the Modi-led NDA government returned to power.For the first time since he became the Prime Minister in 2014, PM Modi faces an opposition that will not just be vociferous in its attacks but will also have strong numbers in the House. The Prime Minister and his government will face their first challenge on Wednesday, when the House elects a Speaker.The opposition has made it clear that if the government does not take steps for consensus, it will contest both the Speaker and deputy Speaker's post. Revolutionary Socialist Party's Lok Sabha MP NK Premachandran has dropped hints that INDIA bloc will field candidates for the election of these posts.""Definitely, we will contest the Speaker post as well as the Deputy Speaker post. Let the government come out with their opinion on whether they are going to discuss with the opposition parties so as to have a consensus on the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, and then we will think of it. Otherwise, we will definitely contest,"" Premchandran told ANI.With the session commencing under the shadow of medical exam NEET controversy, cancellation of UGC-NET exam, terror attacks in Kashmir, West Bengal train accident, and the Tamil Nadu hooch tragedy, a rejuvenated opposition is all geared up to corner the government. The opposition will also focus on unemployment, price rise and economic disparities to put pressure on the government.Ever since the results were out on June 4, the BJP has tried to push the message that it is business as usual arguing that a third term is vindication by the people for the ruling dispensation. However, the opposition is not buying this argument and leaves no opportunity to remind the BJP that it no more has a majority and is dependent on allies for the survival of NDA government.The opposition criticized the appointment of Mahtab, a seven-term member, as pro-tem Speaker over Kodikunnil Suresh, a Congress member with eight terms. The Congress-led opposition claimed that this decision breached the tradition that the senior-most MP should be chosen for the role.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh accused the BJP of bias against Dalits, questioning why Karnataka MP Ramesh Chandappa Jigajinagi, also a seven-term parliamentarian, was overlooked for the pro-tem Speaker position.","The 18th Lok Sabha started on a stormy note with both the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led opposition making their intent clear on Day 1 of the session.

Senior AAI official found dead dressed as a woman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/senior-aai-official-found-dead-dressed-as-a-woman/articleshow/111240141.cms,"RUDRAPUR/DEHRADUN: A senior Airports Authority official was found dead under suspicious circumstances at his official accommodation at the airport on Monday. TOI is withholding his name.The official was found hanging from a ceiling fan dressed in women's clothes, including a maxi, undergarments, bindi, lipstick and bangles. His wife, a teacher, was in Pithoragarh at the time of the incident.SSP (Udham Singh Nagar) Manjunath TC told TOI: ""Relatives and colleagues forced open the official's bedroom door to find him hanging. He was taken to a hospital where doctors declared him 'dead on arrival'. There was no sign of forced entry in the room, which was locked from inside. There were no signs of physical assault either.""A police officer, who is part of the investigation, said, ""The official was in his two-bedroom accommodation with two relatives. All three had dinner together on Sunday and went out at night before returning to the apartment. Preliminary investigation suggests that the two were in one room while the official was in the other. They had planned to visit a nearby mango orchard around 8am on Monday. However, when AAI official didn't wake up in the morning despite several calls by the two, they informed his colleagues living in the same neighbourhood. They then broke open the door of his room to find him hanging from a noose made from a dupatta tied to the ceiling fan... We're probing why he was in women's attire.""SP (city) Manoj Katyal said police are questioning the two relatives and his colleagues.He added: ""We have also seized his mobile phone to examine his call details and other data to conduct a cyber forensic probe.

Another dirty NEET secret? Students' ranks jump on 2nd attempt from obscure centres,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-dirty-neet-secret-students-ranks-jump-on-2nd-attempt-from-obscure-centres/articleshow/111240029.cms,"Experts: NEET issue not local, likely to have ‘large spread'

MUMBAI: When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range. However, in her second attempt the following year, her rank leapfrogged from 2 lakh-plus to 8,000. At present, the 20-year-old is a student of LTMG Sion Hospital in Mumbai.Another aspirant from 2022 who had secured a rank beyond 10 lakh now studies in a govt hospital in Mumbai after she secured a rank of around 13,000 in her second attempt in 2023.This ""second-time lucky"" trend, with students scoring ""unbelievable"" ranks after taking a year's break to prepare for the second attempt, has been seen as baffling by academics in medical corridors. And there was a common thread: the second time, each had taken the exam from an obscure centre. While some took it from a tiny village in Belagavi, others opted for a small town near Patna and other places not popular as coaching hubs.Govt sources said attempts are on to make a list of students who scored well in their second attempt at obscure centres and are now pursuing MBBS in govt-run medical colleges.This year, a similar scenario emerged when students from various states opted to take the exam from a school in Godhra, Gujarat. The Gujarat police, who blew the lid off the scam, said students were asked to fill answers for the questions they knew and leave the rest unanswered.""The empty answer-sheets were to be filled in by the centre's deputy superintendent during the half-hour gap the supervisors get to pack the papers. The answer key was to be provided by coaching institutes, which make the key available online after the exam,"" Godhra superintendent of police Himanshu Solanki said. A counsellor said police should investigate how students managed to get allocated to centres that are ""compromised"".When candidates fill their NEET (UG) application, they are expected to give two cities as options for exam centres. Parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said, ""Before filling the form in Feb, parents called me about agents who had said that they would fill the form for the candidates and that exam centres would be far from cities.""They had assured the parents that their child would get ‘high’ rank and demanded Rs 1 lakh as advance and Rs 9 lakh after the results. I had dissuaded them from falling into any such trap, parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said.The National Testing Agency (NTA) has always maintained that a computer randomly generates an exam centre based on the choice of cities given by each candidate. “If computer-generated centres are given, how are students who have paid ending up in compromised exam centres,” asked Shenoy.In another instance last year, a private university’s head was surprised to find the brightest first-year students failing on concepts that they had cracked in the entrance test conducted by the university just about 10 months ago and analysed the problem closely to find that some of their exam centres were compromised. “We changed the test agency we worked with. We realised that the exam centres were compromised,” the head of the university, who did not want to be named, told TOI.Experts said the NEET 2024 controversy is not just “local” but probably one with a “large spread.” The NTA needs to “look closely” at the system and “find gaps and fix them”, they said.Student representative and counsellor Sachin Bangad said, “A student should be allotted a local centre based on the combination of where the candidate took the Class X, XII exams and the address on the Aadhar card. Additionally, govt officials need to be roped in for supervision. Like in the polling system, they should be informed merely a night before where their exam supervision duty is.”An officer, who has worked with the Maharashtra admission process for decades, said NEET should be conducted on computers for safety reasons. “Additionally, the new provisions brought in for the post-graduate test, to break down the test into multiple-timed sections that cannot be revisited once the time is up, should also be brought into the UG test,” the officer added.","When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range.

So many engineers are here and the Pran Pratishtha was held on January 22, but water is leaking from the roof. Nobody would've thought this,"" Das told PTI.In a comment to ANI, Das said: ""In the first rain, the rood of the sanctum sanctorum where the idol of Ram Lalla was installed has started to leak.

This is expected because Guru Mandap is exposed to the sky as the second floor and completion of Shikhar will cover this opening.""""I also saw some seepage from the conduit as this work on the first floor is in progress.

It separates the Gulf of Mannar, an inlet of the Indian Ocean to the south, from the Palk Strait, an inlet of the Bay of Bengal to the north.There are numerous theories about the formation of this bridge. However, geological evidence suggests that these limestone shoals are remnants of land that once connected India and Sri Lanka.Historical records indicate that this natural bridge was traversable until the 15th century, after which it gradually eroded due to storms over the years, the ESA said.The European Space Agency noted that some of the sandbanks in the Ram Setu are dry, and the sea in this area is very shallow, ranging from only 1 to 10 meters deep, as indicated by the light color of the water.Mannar Island, covering around 130 square kilometers, is connected to mainland Sri Lanka by both a road bridge and a railway bridge, which are visible at the southern end of the island.On the Indian side of Adam's Bridge, Rameswaram Island, also known as Pamban Island, can be accessed from the Indian mainland via the 2-km-long Pamban Bridge. The island's two main towns are Pamban, on the western edge, and Rameswaram, approximately 10 km east of Pamban.Both sections of Adam’s Bridge are part of protected national parks in their respective countries. The sand dunes serve as breeding grounds for birds such as the brown noddy, while numerous species of fish and seagrasses thrive in the shallow waters.

NEW DELHI: The divide between the treasury and the opposition benches in the 18th Lok Sabha went beyond seat-arrangements to appear like battlelines drawn on the first day of the new House.INDIA bloc kicked off the day with a protest in the Parliament complex. Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi , K C Venugopal, and Trinamool MPs like Mahua Moitra, DMK's Kanimozhi and T R Baalu, N K Premachandran, Rajkumar Roat and others, held up red-covered copies of the Constitution and led rounds of lusty sloganeering.Rahul said, ""We will protect the Constitution from attacks by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. Our message is going deep."" As part of a plan, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav with this troupe of 37 MPs walked into Parliament, all with a copy of the Constitution. It was in Hindi, with white covers.Modi entered the house at 10.57am, to the now familiar chants of ""Modi, Modi"" and loud applause. And when at 11.07am, he took the podium to say ""main Narendra Damodardas Modi"" for oath, Rahul Gandhi, K Suresh, K C Venugopal, Gaurav Gogoi, Deepender Hooda, Supriya Sule, Dimple Yadav raised copies of the Constitution - the same was done to Amit Shah. It appeared bitter, a spillover of the no-holds-barred campaign that ended days ago. Suresh, ignored for pro tem Speaker, would be recorded in history as the first protester in the 18th House, rising within minutes of convening to ask that his name be dropped from the panel to assist pro tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab. His shouts were ignored, which led to even louder shouts.The Prime Minister, on his part, did not make any pretence of bonhomie. He took the oath, and took his seat. Given a go by was decades-old custom of a round of the opposition benches with folded hands and pleasantries. Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah, took his cue. Gaurav Gogoi and Kalyan Banerjee pointed out ""the old conventions are being broken"". But there were no takers for feel-good. Gogoi, when his turn came, took oath from the podium on the treasury side, and even shook a few hands.The seating appeared to betray the tension. Bang opposite PM Modi, across the aisle, was his implacable critic Rahul Gandhi. There has been no announcement yet on the leader of opposition, but Rahul led the show in the absence of Sonia Gandhi, who has moved over to the House of the Elders. Not clear from afar was if they glanced at each other.One of the heroes of the Battle 2024, Akhilesh Yadav appeared to rub it in. He sat sporting his trademark red cap with an easy smile plastered on his face, but gave primacy to Awadhesh Prasad, the veteran and Dalit who arguably gave BJP the sorest wound by winning the Ayodhya (Faizabad) constituency. The red caps appeared like red rags to the ruling camp.It continued in that tone.

Trudeau: AI attack reminder of shared duty to condemn terror,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trudeau-ai-attack-reminder-of-shared-duty-to-condemn-terror/articleshow/111239777.cms,"NEW DELHI: Paying homage to the victims of the Air India Kanishka bombing , Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said it remains the deadliest terrorist attack in Canadian history, and a reminder of the shared responsibility to unequivocally condemn terrorism . The two sides paid their respects to the 329 victims, 280 of them Canadians, amid growing strife in bilateral ties caused, as India has repeatedly said, by the political space given by Canadian authorities to Khalistan extremists who advocate violence against India.Earlier on Sunday, the Indian high commission in Ottawa said in a press release, while remembering the victims, that the bombing was a cowardly act of terror, carried out by Canada-based Khalistani terrorists.Stating that perpetrators and co-conspirators of the dastardly act remained free, the Indian mission said any act of glorifying terrorism including the bombing of AI-182, in 1985, is deplorable and should be condemned by all peace-loving countries and people. ""It is unfortunate that such actions are allowed to be routine on many occasions in Canada,'' said the statement. Foreign minister S Jaishankar had said on Sunday in a post on social media that the anniversary is a reminder why terrorism should never be tolerated. Canada has observed the anniversary of the June 23, 1985, terrorist attack since 2005 as National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism. ""Today, we remember and honour every Canadian whose life was cut short or forever changed by a terrorist attack,'' said Trudeau in his message.""Thirty-nine years ago today, 329 innocent people, including 280 Canadians, tragically lost their lives when a bomb, planted on Air India Flight 182 in Canada, exploded mid-flight. This remains the deadliest terrorist attack in Canadian history. It reminds us of the senseless violence that terrorism perpetuates and of our shared responsibility to unequivocally condemn terrorism,'' he added. Trudeau further said Canada is doing its part to counter terrorism and violent extremism and has updated its counter-terrorism strategy. While he made no special mention of Khalistan extremism, the Canadian PM cited the example of how his govt has listed Iran's IRGC under Canada's Criminal Code. ""On this day - and every day - we stand united against hate, intolerance, and division. We reaffirm Canada's determination to fight against violent extremism and keep our people safe,'' Trudeau said.","The two sides paid their respects to the 329 victims, 280 of them Canadians.

NEW DELHI: The routine custom of newly-elected Lok Sabha members being administered oath by the pro tem Speaker was marred on Monday with opposition members nominated by the President to the panel of chairpersons refusing to take oath when their scheduled turn arrived in order to avoid presiding over the session in the absence of pro tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab.PM Modi was the first to take oath followed by members of the panel of chairpersons, which included Radha Mohan Singh and Faggan Singh Kulaste of BJP, after which the council of ministers took oath before other MPs in alphabetical order.However, the three opposition MPs in the panel of chairpersons - K Suresh (Congress), Sudip Bandyopadhyay (Trinamool Congress) and T R Balu (DMK) - gave a miss to the oath-taking. They were listed just after PM Modi and ahead of the council of ministers.With substantial increase in their numbers, most opposition MPs, particularly from Congress and Samajwadi Party, carried copies of the Constitution to the House. While Modi was taking oath, opposition members rose to their feet, holding copies of the Constitution. They did the same when Union home minister Amit Shah took oath, but remained seated this time.Congress MP from Mavelikara K Suresh was the first to raise objection when proceedings started as he asked the chair to drop his name from panel of chairpersons.When Modi reached Parliament Monday, he was accompanied by Union ministers from four different regions of the country - Jitendra Singh, L Murugan, Arjun Ram Meghwal and Kiren Rijiju, to which a senior BJP leader said, ""It is true spirit of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.""Meanwhile, Independent MP from Baramulla in Kashmir Abdul Rashid Sheikh could not take oath Monday despite his name being called as he has been lodged in jail since 2019 after being charged by the NIA in a terror-funding case.

Bihar govt’s recent inquiry of a possible paper leak in the NEET-UG 2024 exam has sparked off a heated controversy across the country. This essential exam, which serves as the doorway for medical students, is now being scrutinized, raising serious concerns about the integrity of Indian examination boards and the steps required to assure fairness in high-stakes testing. Full cancellation or rewriting for some the crux of the dispute is whether the entire NEET-UG 2024 exam should be cancelled or only specific applicants should be compelled to retake the exam. Both sides make compelling points.A leaked paper compromises the exam’s integrity, making it unfair to all candidates. A complete cancellation ensures that no student benefits from the leaked content.Setting a strict precedent against any form of malpractice is essential to maintaining the credibility of such exams in the future.Identifying and segregating those affected by the leak may be practically impossible, as the leaked content could have spread widely and undetectably.A full cancellation and rescheduling would significantly disrupt the academic calendar, causing undue stress and inconvenience to lakhs of students.If the leak can be traced to specific individuals or groups, only those applicants should be penalized, preserving the efforts and hard work of the majority.Reorganizing an exam for a subset of candidates is more feasible and cost-effective than a nationwide rescheduling.The controversy surrounding the NEET-UG 2024 paper leak extends beyond the immediate decision of whether to cancel the exam. It casts a shadow on the credibility of Indian examination boards, prompting a re-evaluation of their practices and procedures.Security Measures The repeated instances of paper leaks in various examinations call for a comprehensive overhaul of security measures. This includes adopting advanced encryption technologies, ensuring secure transportation and storage of exam papers, and employing robust digital surveillance methods.Examination boards must enhance transparency in their operations. Clear protocols for handling leaks and a public commitment to addressing malpractices can rebuild trust among stakeholders.Leveraging technology can help mitigate the risk of paper leaks. Online exams with randomized question sets, block chain for secure record-keeping, and AI-based monitoring systems are potential solutions that need to be explored and implemented.Establishing a rapid response team to investigate and address any allegations of malpractice can ensure that such issues are resolved swiftly and decisively, minimizing disruption to the examination process.The NEET-UG 2024 paper leak incident is a critical juncture for Indian examination boards. Whether the decision is to cancel the entire exam or to require a rewrite for specific candidates, the priority must be to uphold the principles of fairness and integrity. This situation underscores the need for systemic changes to prevent future occurrences and restore confidence in the examination system. As the nation awaits a resolution, it is imperative that stakeholders collaborate to reinforce the robustness and reliability of the educational assessment framework.","Bihar govt’s recent inquiry of a possible paper leak in the NEET-UG 2024 exam has sparked off a heated controversy across the country.

""It is my turn to speak today and yours to listen,"" she told the audience of civic body chiefs, ministers, MLAs and senior officials.As many in her range of firing visibly squirmed, Mamata named fire services minister and Bidhannagar MLA Sujit Bose, accusing him of encouraging encroachments in Kolkata's Rajarhat and in front of Salt Lake Sector V's Webel Bhavan. She also accused state food processing minister and Howrah (Central) MLA Arup Roy and Howrah (North) MLA Goutam Chowdhury of extortion. TOI tried to contact both for comment, but they didn't respond.

You are going around in big cars, dining at fancy restaurants. Everything is fine, but first think of the people. I see many of you going around in cars with beacons. Even I don't (do that)."" Her 70-minute tirade at Nabanna, the state secretariat, came 20 days after the Lok Sabha verdict, which saw Trinamool trumping BJ-12 in Bengal, albeit with some unexpected setbacks in the urban belt.To Trinamool functionaries, she said that those indulging in extortion or doing shoddy work would be thrown out of the party. She said tickets for future elections would be given out based solely on performance. ""I don't want 'master' extortionists. I want people's servants,"" she said, as the municipal corporations of Howrah, Bidhannagar, and Siliguri copped the bulk of her criticism. Mamata listed improper waste management, water supply, electricity wastage, parking rackets and extortion among the ills afflicting the state.She announced a key change in the govt tender process. Civic bodies are no longer authorised to give out contracts. Instead, a committee comprising the chief secretary and secretaries of home, finance, land and irrigation departments, police commissioners and an officer of the rank of additional director-general of police will oversee the process.She also issued show-cause notices to the sub-divisional officers in charge of civic bodies in Howrah, Haldia and Cooper's Camp (Nadia).""Why should the govt's image be tarnished because of the misdeeds of a few?

Members of Congress, TMC, DMK, Left and others held a protest after paying respects at Mahatma Gandhi's statue in Parliament complex, holding copies of the Constitution and ""promising to protect it"".Opposition MPs flashed copies of Constitution in what appeared to be a celebration of the success in paring down BJP’s numbers.“Tomorrow is the 25th of June.

The new generation of Bharat must never forget how the Constitution was completely disregarded, torn apart, and the country was turned into a prison, with democracy utterly suppressed,” the PM said in his address to media ahead of the session’s commencement.Modi, who had rebutted the charge that BJP intended to change the Constitution during the campaign and had argued that, to the contrary, it was the opposition which had violated the decision of the founding fathers by implementing quotas for Muslims on grounds of religion, sent out an equally loud signal that for him, the battle over the Constitution was not over yet. Taking up suspension of democracy and civil rights during the Emergency, he said, “These 50 years since the Emergency remind us to protect our Constitution and democracy with pride.

We commit ourselves to ensuring a vibrant democracy and fulfilling the common man’s dreams as outlined by the Indian Constitution.”The remarks appeared to be a prelude to a BJP campaign to recall the days of the Emergency when most of its stalwarts were put in prison.Modi sought to play down his lower-than-expected numbers by highlighting his success in getting a record third term. Terming NDA’s third victory as remarkable and significant, he said the third consecutive mandate also meant a three-fold jump in his responsibilities, as he sought to assure that he would work three times harder. “We will achieve three times the results, moving forward with this new mission,” he said, adding, “This House of ours will become a House of resolutions. Our 18th Lok Sabha should be filled with resolutions that bring the dreams of the common man to fruition.”He emphasised the importance of consensus in governance, but not without mentioning the role of a “responsible opposition”. Recalling disruptions during Parliament proceedings in the past, he said people expect debate and diligence, not tantrums, drama and disturbance. “They seek substance, not slogans. The country needs a good and responsible opposition,” he said, adding that he would try to take everybody along.","PM Modi marks the beginning of the maiden session of the new Lok Sabha by lobbing the ""Constitution"" issue back at the INDIA bloc. Members of Congress, TMC, DMK, Left and others held a protest after paying respects at Mahatma Gandhi's statue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111239983,imgsize-965691,width-400,resizemode-4/111239983.jpg"

Karnataka bans artificial colours in kebabs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-bans-artificial-colours-in-kebabs/articleshow/111239903.cms,"Image credit: lexica.art

After 'Gobi Manchurian' and 'Cotton Candy', Karnataka govt has now prohibited the use of artificial colouring agents in the preparation of kebabs (veg and non-veg) across the state, saying it adversely affected the public health.

In case of violation of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 rule 59, it can file a case in the court which can lead to imprisonment ranging from seven years to lifeterm and a fine up to Rs 10 lakh, an official order stated on Monday.

According to the Food Safety and Quality department, the quality of kebabs being sold across the state were found to be ""poor"" due to addition of artificial colours, which can have serious impact on the health of the public.

World's oldest egg gives 1st evidence of ostrich presence in south India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worlds-oldest-egg-gives-1st-evidence-of-ostrich-presence-in-south-india/articleshow/111239772.cms,"VADODARA: A team of archaeologists stumbled upon an ostrich nest that dates back 41,000 years - the oldest found in the world - in Andhra Pradesh.

Archaeologists from the Vadodara-based MS University, and colleagues from Germany, Australia, and US found this archaeological evidence while investigating a fossil-rich site in Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh. The nest was the home of 9-11 ostrich eggs, the researchers said.

Typically, an ostrich nest is 9-10 feet wide and can accommodate 30-40 eggs at a time. Researchers say this finding is crucial in finding out why megafauna (animals weighing more than 40kg) went extinct in India. The discovery of nearly 3,500 pieces of ostrich eggshells from a patch of 1x1.5 metres is not only the first evidence of the presence of ostrich in south India, it is also the first time that archaeological evidence of a 41,000-yea-old ostrich nest has been established.

Megafauna, literally large animals, refers to animals like horses, elephants, cattle, and hippopotamus. Some of these megafauna became extinct around 40,000 years ago from different parts of the world. ""The oldest ostrich eggshell were discovered from the Siwalik Hills on the Indian side of the Himalayas. They date back more than 20 lakh years. Even in peninsular India, the oldest evidence of ostrich eggshells was discovered from Katoti in Rajasthan, which date back to 60,000 years,"" said Devara Anilkumar, assistant professor at the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at MSU. He has been working on the project since April 2023.

On Monday, the ministry of personnel and public grievances and pensions also notified the rules for conduct of public exams by the Centre, which prescribe the procedures for conducting inquiry and filing of reports against those involved in cheating during public exams. This means that students as well as those involved in paper leaks in Bihar and elsewhere will face up to 10 years in jail and a fine of up to Rs 1 crore. Similarly, students who allegedly resorted to unfair means in locations such as Godhra can face a sentence of at least three years along with a Rs 10 lakh fine.The law aims to prevent unfair means in public examinations conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), railways, banking recruitment examinations and the National Testing Agency (NTA), among others.According to the rules, educational institutions, coaching centres, or any other entities found to be complicit in facilitating unfair means can face legal action, including fines and other penalties. Involvement of ""coaching centres"" in recent irregularities are already being probed. Coaching institutes and their personnel as well as examination authorities and service providers can face up to 5-10 years in jail.These measures are significantly tougher than current regulations for dealing with cheating, forgery, and paper leaks which are punishable with imprisonment of maximum of three years, and will apply to irregularities in exams currently under investigation, like NEET-UG and UGC-NET by CBI.These rules require the National Recruitment Agency ( NRA ) to establish norms, standards, and guidelines for computer-based tests (CBT), among other responsibilities. The rules include provisions for ""engagement of services of other govt agencies by public examination authority,"" ""preparations of norms, standards and guidelines,"" and ""reporting of incidents of unfair means or offences,"" among others. ""The National Recruitment Agency, on behalf of the central govt, shall in consultation with the stakeholders, prepare norms, standards, and guidelines for the computer-based test mode of examination, which shall be notified by the central government,"" the rules state. These guidelines should cover ""standard operating procedures for registration of public examination centres,"" ""space requirements within the computer-based test centres,"" ""layout of the seating arrangement,"" ""specifications and layout of computer nodes,"" ""specifications for the server and network infrastructure,"" and ""specifications for electronic platforms for conducting computer-based tests,"" among others.Pre-examination activities, such as pre-audit for the examination readiness of the public examination centres, candidate check-in, biometric registration, security and screening, seat allocation, question paper setting and loading, invigilation in the examination, post-examination activities, and guidelines for providing scribes will also be part of the norms.","The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act was enacted in Feb in the last session of the previous Lok Sabha.
