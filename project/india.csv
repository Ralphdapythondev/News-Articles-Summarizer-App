Rajnath admits Centre initiated talks in 2016 'but Hurriyat shut their doors',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-admits-centre-initiated-talks-in-2016-but-hurriyat-shut-their-doors/articleshow/113177606.cms,"NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh revealed on Sunday that in September 2016, four Opposition MPs had attempted to engage with Hurriyat Conference leaders as part of the central government 's efforts to initiate peace talks in Kashmir . However separatist leaders refused to meet with the delegation, Singh said while addressing an election rally in the Ramban assembly constituency in Jammu.Singh, who was serving as the home minister then, recounted his discussions with the then-chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti, assuring her that the situation in Kashmir would normalize. He also mentioned that a delegation of MPs, led by Singh himself, had visited the state during that period.The delegation included senior leaders such as Sharad Yadav from the JDU and representatives from Left parties. Singh had suggested that these leaders engage with the Hurriyat Conference, as the BJP was not well-received by the separatists. However, when Sharad Yadav and some Left leaders approached the Hurriyat leaders, they were met with closed doors and a refusal to engage in dialogue with the country's senior MPs.""There were senior leaders like Sharad Yadav (of the JDU) and from the Left parties (in the delegation). I told them that we are from the BJP and the Hurriyat people do not like us and they get irritated on seeing us. You talk to them and tell them that we are ready to talk, but there shall be peace in Kashmir. After asking me, Sharad Yadav and some Left leaders visited the Hurriyat Conference leaders, but they shut their doors on them, saying they will not talk with senior MPs of our country,"" the defence minister said.In his speech on Sunday, Singh also mentioned the filing of FIRs against Kashmiri youth who were involved in stone-pelting incidents that occurred after the death of Burhan Wani.Singh said, ""There were cases against young and innocent children and there were repeated demands from the people to withdraw the cases. People were demanding withdrawal of cases against innocent and minor children and I talked to Mehbooba and asked her to release them. We did everything but the way they (Hurriyat leaders) should have responded, they did not,"" Rajnath said.This marks the first time the central government has acknowledged its attempts to reach out to separatists in 2016, a period marked by widespread protests in Kashmir following the killing of militant commander Burhan Wani. The admission comes despite the Narendra Modi government's consistent portrayal in public of its tough stance against separatists.During the all-party delegation's visit to the state in September 2016, amidst violence that claimed 72 lives, four Opposition MPs broke away from the 26-member group and visited the Srinagar residence of hardline Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who was under house arrest. Geelani, however, snubbed the MPs and refused to open his doors.Hardline Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani didn’t let the MPs in as then-JDU leader Sharad Yadav and Communist leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja kept waiting at the door of his upscale Hyderpora residence for about ten minutes before returning.At the time, Singh had said that the MPs visited on their own, saying, ""I want to clarify that some members of the all-party delegation went to meet Hurriyat leaders. We had neither said no nor yes to their meetings (with separatists). You know what happened. I do not wish to go into the details.""He had further said, ""But whatever information those friends gave us upon their return, it can be said it was not Kashmiriyat (Kashmiri value system). It cannot be called insaniyat (humanity). When someone goes for talks and they reject it, it is not jamhooriyat (democracy) as well.""",Four Opposition MPs had attempted to engage with Hurriyat Conference leaders in September 2016.

"A tiny flower nearly killed a tiger habitat, until a snip in time saved it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-tiny-flower-nearly-killed-a-tiger-habitat-until-a-snip-in-time-saved-it/articleshow/113177559.cms,"TN forest department’s Lantana weed eradication drive helped restore the dying Mudumalai reserve and while doing so reduced human-wildlife conflicts

It’s hard to believe that one of the biggest threats to a tiger’s survival could come from a small, beautiful flower. Yet, Lantana camara , a tropical American shrub, has invaded over 40% of India’s tiger range, with the Shivalik hills, Central India, and the Southern Western Ghats being the worst affected.Introduced by the British in the 1800s as an ornamental plant from Latin America, the weed quickly spread across the country.By 2020, it was estimated to occupy more than 40% of India’s tiger habitats.Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris, home to more than 100 tigers, has also suffered from Lantana invasion, which has led to a decline in vegetation and green patches in its core and buffer zones. That’s when the question arose: Is MTR a dying forest?But then, in the last year, there has been a sudden transformation. Shoots of indigenous species began sprouting across the reserve, and the forest seems to be experiencing a complete regeneration of vegetation. Wildlife officials say the recovery is due to concerted efforts to remove the invasive weeds, which helped restore the ecosystem.The MTR comprises 32,100 hectares of core zone across six ranges, with an additional 36,700 hectares in the buffer zone spread over four ranges. Faced with a threat to the ecosystem, invasive and exotic species such as Lantana camara, Senna spectabilis, Prosopis juliflora and wattle are being removed. While the buffer zone— a shrub forest—is infested with various invasives, the core zone, a dense forest, is overrun by Lantana. The process of removing these invasives began in early 2022.In the buffer zone of MTR, about 20% of the area is en croached by invasive species , while the core zone sees at least 50% occupied mainly by Lantana. “Continuous removal of invasives has led to regeneration of natural grass and other indigenous species,” says D Venkatesh, conservator of forests and field director of MTR. “We maintain the cleared areas, but this process needs to continue for five years for the forest to be free from invasives.” He adds that while the invasives are initially fully uprooted, seeds or small roots left behind pose a threat as their dormancy period can last up to 50 years, potentially allowing them to sprout again even decades later.Lantana camara is a perennial shrub that grows about 2m-5m tall and forms dense thickets in various environments. “Lantana is the primary invasive species in MTR, suppressing the natural regeneration of grasses and indigenous species. Once it’s cleared, removing secondary invasives becomes easier,” says Venkatesh.MTR is home to 25 species of grasses and legumes, including a protein-rich variety of grass. “Wild animals help spread the seeds of these species across the forest, maintaining a natural cycle facilitated by wildlife in any forest land,” says Venkatesh.“Even after uprooting invasives, the forest will witness subsequent resprouting,” says Arun Kumar, deputy director of MTR-buffer zone. “This makes maintenance important. Without it, the initial efforts would be utterly wasted. The health of the habitat is important as regenerated grasslands attract herbivores, both small and large.”The forest department has identified key passages in the reserve for invasive removal. Arun Kumar says in the expansive 50-hectare area of the Singara range, where invasive removal has been done and second-year maintenance is underway, herds of elephants are frequently attracted by the fresh grasses. “The health of a forest triggers a chain reaction in the ecosystem. The natural regeneration of grasses and legumes can help reduce conflicts in fringe areas, as a healthy habitat tends to keep animals within their boundaries.”Tamil Nadu Newsprint & Paper Limited is involved in removing Senna spectabilis species, which is found in the buffer zone of MTR. “The bark of Senna is so resilient that even a small piece left behind can quickly resprout. Therefore, extra care is needed during the removal process,” he adds.C Vidhya, deputy director of the MTR-core zone, says the Senna species has only a scattered presence in MTR’s core area. “The real issue is Lantana. But we can’t say Lantana is all bad. It also provides ambush cover for carnivores and fruits for birds and monkeys. In some ways, it plays an eco-friendly role too. If we focus solely on tigers and herbivores, Lantana appears to be a threat.”Vidhya says 50% of the core area is infested with Lantana. “Our fight against Lantana focuses on crucial animal passages and riverines, ensuring removal does not open up the forest too fully. Riverines and water bodies are lifelines for animals during summer, and must be preserved.”The forest department has conducted individual assessments of every grid-compartment in the core zone. Officials say since herbivores don’t consume much Lantana, they don’t contribute to its propagation. Instead, Lantana fruits are primarily dispersed by birds and monkeys. After passing through their digestive systems, the seeds become even more viable, with a stronger tendency to sprout than through natural spread.Vidhya confirms the flourishing of grass and indigenous species is a direct result of Lantana removal. “When you remove invasive species, the ecosystem undergoes modifications, increasing the carrying capacity and utility index of the grasslands,” says Gajannan D Muratkar, advisor to 39 tiger reserves, including MTR and environmental science professor at Amaravathi University in Maharashtra. “An interconnected ecosystem forms between grasslands, modifying the diversity index of the ground flora. It helps contain small and large herbivores within these pockets.”Uprooting invasive species also corrects soil features such as moisture, colour and texture. The natural regeneration of grasses reflects the improved quality of the soil, he says.For Lantana removal, the forest department relies on local tribal communities, skilled in the techniques needed for this task. However, the department struggles with limited funds for the removal efforts, often using money generated from selling Senna species to support the work.In the core zone, 1,221 hectares have been identified as critical for Lantana removal, with about 355 hectares—29%—cleared. In the buffer zone, 1,615 hectares have been cleared and maintained into the second year. The process progresses stage by stage in other areas as well. “We’re seeing amazing results. Once fully completed, the forest ecosystem will sustain itself and support the wildlife,” says Venkatesh.","Lantana camara, a tropical American shrub, has invaded over 40% of India’s tiger range, with the Shivalik hills, Central India, and the Southern Western Ghats being the worst affected. Lantana is the primary invasive species in MTR, suppressing the natural regeneration of grasses and indigenous species.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113177618,imgsize-1460010,width-400,resizemode-4/113177618.jpg"

""These estimated years can go on an infinity if new rape and Pocso cases are added to the existing fast-track courts and no new courts of this category are set up,"" the report brought out by non-profit ' India Child Protection ' says. It calls for making the remaining 268 FTSCs functional under the scheme and setting up at least 1,000 more to deliver within the timelines wherein trial in rape cases need to be completed within two months after filing of chargesheet and within one year in Pocso cases.The report says the number of cases for trial before FTSCs each year has also risen - from 1,95,991 in 2020 to 2,78,494 in 2023 - reflecting both addition of new cases and continuing challenge of managing pending caseloads. ""Correspondingly, the number of cases disposed by FTSCs each year has seen significant improvement, with 37,148 cases disposed in 2020, rising to 76,319 in 2023. Also the percentage of cases disposed during the year out of the total cases for trial (pending and new) has also shown an increase, rising from 19% in 2020 to 27% in 2023,"" the report says.Asserting the need to deal with pending cases, the report also assesses year-wise data of the number of new cases instituted and cases disposed in that year to compare what would be the status of disposal if there were no pending cases and the data represented only disposal for that year itself. For instance in 2023, 81,471 new rape and Pocso cases were instituted, while 76,319 cases were disposed by FTSCs, which comes to a disposal rate of 94%.""While all of the number of disposed cases may not be the same that came to FTSCs that year itself, this data indicates that India is close to reaching the tipping point to justice, a point when the number of cases disposed in a given year is equal to or greater than the number of new cases instituted during the same year. In this backdrop this report calls for expediting disposal of pending cases by creating 1,000 new FTSCs so that India is able to build on the momentum seen in terms of disposal rate,"" said Bhuwan Ribhu, child rights activist and founder of India Child Protection.Stating that there is no real-time data available on acquittal and conviction in rape and Pocso cases, the report calls for provided this data on the FTSC dashboard to enable assessment of the success of the courts.","Fast-track special courts set up by govt on Supreme Court's directions for expediting trial have disposed of 52% (2,14,463) out of 4,16,638 rape and Pocso cases since the initiation of the FTSC scheme in Oct 2019.

KOLKATA: The actor who alleged that director Arindam Sil kissed her in public during a film shoot without her consent said she was appalled to see Sil taking part in a ' Reclaim the Night ' demonstration. The actress has decided to seek legal assistance. Leena Gangopadhyay , the chairperson West Bengal Commission of Women ( WBCW ), told TOI: ""The actor told us that since she was humiliated publicly, she wanted a public apology in writing.Sil had initially wanted to say that it was an unintentional act. But the actor protested since she said that the director had even asked if she had liked being kissed. Then he agreed to rephrase the letter. There is no question of us forcing him to delete any word.""Reacting to the incident, Sil told TOI: ""There is nothing on my mind right now. I am extremely clear in my conscience. I am sorry if she has felt bad for any unintentional act of mine. I am seeking expert advice. For the rest, I leave it to time. People have the right to say whatever they want to. But I guess they don't know the truth.""The incident at a resort occurred on April 3 on the sets of 'Ekti Khunir Sandhane Mitin'.""First, he demanded that I sit on his lap. I vehemently refused. But he commanded in an authoritative tone, 'I am saying - sit!' He was so intimidating I didn't know how to say no. After I sat, he kissed me on my cheek. I was shocked but didn't know what to do. I swiftly moved away, while he feigned innocence, as if nothing had occurred... . People were smiling as if it was some kind of a joke. I told the director about it when he went back in front of the monitor. His reply was: 'Didn't you like it?'"" she claimed.The actress said it is ""deplorable"" to witness Sil apologize to her in writing and subsequently deceive the media by claiming that he had kissed her accidentally. "" If a predator can go to this length after apologising to me, I will have to seek legal advice.""""The production house assured me that such an incident would not recur and that they would guarantee the presence of someone from their end on the floor to ensure my security.

LUCKNOW: The bulldozer grunts on the shore of Ganga in UP's Unnao , baring its teeth. There are trucks and tractors waiting to be loaded with sand, and more almost certainly on the way.This is how it is here, where the sand mining mafia built a road that cuts through Ganga at Sumerpur Ghat. This unauthorised road has split the sacred river into two streams, creating a pathway for transporting their illicit cargo under cover of night.On another road of Unnao, shadows of a dark tragedy loom large over the Tripathi household.Shubham Mani Tripathi, a young journalist in his mid-20s, was gunned down in cold blood on June 19, 2020. His crime? Publishing a series of investigative articles exposing illegal activities of Kanhaiya Awasthi and his wife Divya Awasthi - known as ""bhu mafia"".""My brother was killed for speaking the truth,"" Shubham's elder brother Rishabh Mani said. ""In a town where silence once protected the corrupt, Shubham's voice - though silenced - was an example of courage and resistance. The least we can do is to ensure that his killers pay for their crimes."" Just three months before his murder, Shubham had married on Feb 26, 2020, marking what should have been the beginning of a new chapter in his life. Shubham's father died in March 2020, deeply affected by the threats his son received from the Awasthis.The family's home is now under round-the-clock security, with an armed policeman permanently stationed there - a grim reminder of the threats that still hang over them. But the administration provided no financial assistance or job offers.At 30, Rishabh runs a small cafe and online service centre. ""After my brother's death, I was responsible for managing everything for the family. My priority was seeking justice for Shubham and ensuring the killers were held accountable. I couldn't afford to spend time pursuing financial aid from govt offices.""The road to justice has been long and arduous. Of the 16 charged in connection with Shubham's murder, only five are currently behind bars. The incarcerated Awasthi couple's assets and properties, worth Rs 15 crore, have been seized. The Supreme Court 's recent rejection of Kanhaiya's bail application has brought some solace to the Tripathi family, but the pain of their loss remains ever-present.","Shubham Mani Tripathi, a young journalist in his mid-20s, was gunned down in cold blood on June 19, 2020.

Besides, they also found employment in their respective blocks during the rejuvenation work on the rivulet.The district administration spent Rs 1.35 crore to make this happen.Shri Krishna, Pratapgarh district development officer, said : ""The rejuvenation work of the small river Sakarni has been done with the help of villagers .

GST on grants: Taxing blow to research?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gst-on-grants-taxing-blow-to-research/articleshow/113177449.cms,"It’s tax terrorism say academicians and could derail projects and curtail innovation

There’s a storm brewing in India’s academic circles , and it’s not about a new discovery or theory, but an unexpected tax on research grants .Seven Indian institutions – including the govt-run IIT Delhi, and Anna University in Chennai – recently got showcause notices from the directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI) for unpaid taxes on research grants they received since 2017.While IIT Delhi faces a demand for ₹120 crore, including penalties over the past seven years, other universities have been asked to pay between ₹5 crore and ₹60 crore.“Tax terrorism” is what entrepreneur and Infosys co-founder T V Mohandas Pai called it on social media handle X, tagging GST India and PM Modi. While the DGGI says research and develop ment grants received by educational institutions are not exempt from tax, many academicians, scientists, and funding agencies disagree. They say grants, especially for educational institutions, are difficult to secure, and tax relief on these funds is a common practice in several countries.“GST on research grants will reduce money allocated for research. So, the govt must remove GST,” says Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan, a strong advocate for education, who funds research projects in institutions such as IIT and Indian Institute of Science (IISc). Experts say research is inherently a risky endeavour. Without the burden of taxes, institutions are more likely to invest in innovative and potentially high-risk projects that could lead to significant breakthroughs. “Some large and reputable research studies go on for several years.The Framingham Heart Study, for instance, is a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular co hort study of residents of Massachusetts that began in 1948,” says orthopaedic surgeon Dr George Thomas, former editor of the Journal of Indian Medical Ethics. “The National Institutes of Health invested USD 14 million in the Lower Extremities Assessment Project (LEAP), a comprehensive research initiative des igned to evaluate and improve outcomes in patients with severe injuries of the legs. Without large investments, breakthrough research is difficult. Taxing research grants reduces the already low investments.”Researchers also say funds for research have remained the same for years, though the scope of research has expanded. “It has not kept pace with inflation ,” says scientist Ashok Jhunjhunwala, who has chaired govt committees and boards of institutions such as IIT. He says GST on research could be covered by the grantee. “When researchers receive grant money from the ministry, the govt should pay the GST. Researchers would welcome it because they currently pay GST on equipment or components bought with grant funds. If grants were given with GST already paid, they could offset the GST costs they currently bear,” he says.Research grants are fully itemised with amounts allocated for equipment, components, travel, salaries and overheads. “Where is the GST money supposed to come from within this? Placing a GST demand on research institutions is just harassment.” While several universities are gearing up for litigation against the demand, legal experts say Centre should reconsider this issue before it reaches the courts.“GST is levied on the supply of goods and services,” says advocate K Vaitheeswaran, an expert on taxes and head of the taxation committee of the Madras Chamber of Commerce and I ndustry. “For example, at a shop there is a tax on sold goods. GST is on the supply of goods or services for consideration. When a university receives a research grant, there is no quid pro quo to provide any goods or services. A grant is not a consideration; it is akin to a donation.”Legal experts say there is no certainty in research outcomes, which may or may not result in saleable goods or services, and so, research grants and donations received from govt or private agencies should not be taxed based on anticipated outcomes but on monetised results. “When income tax provides an accelerated tax shield for research institutions notified under section 35(1)(ii), GST too should extend the same reasoning and logic for research grants,” they say.Academicians hope this issue will be discussed at the GST council meeting on Sept 9, chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. “Research grants to universities must be considered a subsidy as funds are used solely for delivering public good without any profit motive, making it a quasi-government endeavour by the university,” says an academician. Pai recommends setting up an expert co mmittee within GST India like the one at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.“Questions should be referred to this committee, position paper prepared, put out for publ ic comments and after that issued as the official view,” says the public policy advocate. “This will ensure uniform policy throughout the industry and eliminate arbitrary action by GST officers which harm the country and business as well as reduce tax terrorism. Officials must raise contestable questions and debate it out before they issue such notices. Tax on resear ch grants given to universities can have a chilling effect on research outputs. I hope it’s axed.”","Seven Indian institutions – including the govt-run IIT Delhi, and Anna University in Chennai – recently got showcause notices from the directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI) for unpaid taxes on research grants they received since 2017.

MUMBAI: A central GST (CGST) superintendent, accused of detaining a businessman for 18 hours and demanding a bribe of Rs 60 lakh, was nabbed by CBI last week after a dramatic chase in the middle of the night near Oshiwara police station.In his bid to escape, the official, Sachin Gokulka, dumped one of his aides - a consultant who had allegedly accepted the bribe on his behalf - on the road but was soon caught by the CBI team in pursuit.The consultant and a chartered accountant (CA) were also arrested, and an FIR was filed against two IRS officers - additional commissioner, CSGST, Deepak Kumar Sharma, and joint commissioner Rahul Kumar -as well as three other CGST superintendents.Rahul Kumar, currently posted in another state but who previously worked in Mumbai, is accused of facilitating the deal by contacting Sharma. CBI has searched the premises of Sharma, the four superintendents and the other two aides.As per a complaint, Gokulka and the other three GST superintendents - Nitin Kumar Gupta, Nikhil Agrawal and Bijender Janawa - detained a Goregaon businessman for 18 hours on Sept 4 and threatened to arrest him if he failed to pay a bribe of 60 lakh - reduced from the original demand of 80 lakh - to settle a pharmaceutical company 's issue. The businessman was allegedly abused and slapped multiple times, and coerced into calling a relative to arrange 30 lakh, which was to be delivered to a middleman, chartered accountant (CA) Raj Aggarwal, throughhawala .After receiving the initial amount, the CGST officials released the businessman the following day, instructing him to arrange the remaining 30 lakh by that evening, which he was asked to deliver to Aggarwal.The businessman approached CBI. He could only arrange for 20 lakh, which he handed over to Aggarwal, who was supposed to pass on the money to a consultant, Abhisekh Mehta. CBI caught Mehta when he arrived to collect the money from the CA. He revealed that he was to hand over the bribe directly to Gokulka.In the presence of CBI officials, Mehta spoke to Gokulka over the phone, who asked him to turn up near Oshiwara police station for the bribe handover. CBI then set a trap.Gokulka, accompanied by two women, arrived in a car at the spot around 2.30am on Sept 6. He asked Mehta, who was waiting in another vehicle, to join him. When Mehta got into his vehicle with the amount, the official sensed something amiss and sped away. After a while, he asked Mehta to get out of the car with the money and drove away. The CBI team, which was in pursuit, managed to nab Mehta and subsequently traced Gokulka.CBI produced Gokulka, Aggarwal and Mehta in court on Sept 6. They were remanded in the agency's custody till Tuesday.", CGST superintendent Sachin Gokulka accused of detaining businessman for 18 hours and demanding a bribe of Rs 60 lakh.

NEW DELHI: As counter-Naxal forces brace to meet the March 2026 deadline set by home minister Amit Shah for ending Left-wing extremist (LWE) violence, the CRPF has augmented its strength in the Maoist bastions of south Bastar ( Chhattisgarh ) by deploying an additional 4,000 personnel.The force's four battalions, comprising 4,000 troops, were recently ordered to leave their stations in Jharkhand and Bihar - where LWE violence has been largely tackled with sustained, intelligence-based counter-operations over the past few years - and join the large number of battalions already fighting Maoists in south Bastar.While three battalions have been brought in from Jharkhand, one battalion is reaching from Bihar.The CRPF has set up over 100 forward operating bases (FOBs) in what once were Maoist strongholds inaccessible to governance and local administration. A CRPF source told TOI 10 FOBs have been established so far this year in south Bastar.Once FOBs are set up, administration moves in to reach benefits of government schemes to villages in the vicinity.The strategy has paid off by exposing local people to development and social sector benefits, while weaning them off the influence of Left-wing extremists. Shah had, during a recent visit to Raipur, declared March 2026 as the outer limit for ending Naxalism in the country.For this, he had emphasised on the need for a ""strong and ruthless"" plan of action.As per a reply given by the ministry of home affairs to a question in the Lok Sabha in Aug this year, incidents of LWE violence in the country have dipped 73% from the high level witnessed in 2010. The resultant fatalities among civilians and security forces too reduced by 86% in 2023 as compared to 2010.","The CRPF has augmented its strength in the Maoist bastions of south Bastar.

NEW DELHI: After a week marked by flip-flops over forging an alliance in Haryana, Sunday was marked by a 'take it or leave it' offer from Congress to AAP. A likelihood of a tie-up in Haryana between the two parties is hinged on AAP accepting Congress's twin conditions on number of seats and specific constituencies.Congress added a twist to the tail by releasing a list of nine candidates for Haryana elections .Though a small number after the initial list of 32, that does not seem to impact the alliance talks , but at the same time, added a sense of urgency for going ahead in the Congress camp and not be held hostage by negotiations with AAP, in a clear nudge to Kejriwal's party to make up its mind fast. A decision on a tie-up is likely to be sealed by tonight. AAP sources conceded that Congress had not responded to its offer till late.With AAP putting off its plan of announcing its first list of candidates on Sunday, it appears Kejriwal's party may be willing to climb down on its demand for 10 seats to move closer to agreeing to 4-6 seats that Congress is likely to cede, sources said.If the alliance works out, AAP sources said an announcement will follow on Monday. The last date to file nominations is Sept 12.Congress's Haryana in-charge Deepak Babaria and AAP's Raghav Chadha along with others were engaged in hectic negotiations till late. According to sources, AAP is likely to be offered seats where Congress does not think winnability will be a factor for its candidates or where it performed poorly in the past.""An alliance seems possible on 4-6 seats if AAP agrees to the nature of constituencies that Congress is offering,"" a Congress source said. The development comes amid strong opposition from the Haryana unit of the party.Meanwhile, sources said Congress may spare three seats for Samajwadi Party in Haryana. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has asked Congress for Hathin constituency in Palwal, Dadri in Charkhi Dadri and Sohna in Gurgaon district.Earlier in the day, Chadha said Congress and AAP were trying to forge an alliance by keeping aside their individual aspirations. He also said AAP will not proceed with the alliance ""if there is no win-win situation"".AAP's three-time MLA from Malviya Nagar in Delhi Somnath Bharti cautioned his party against an alliance with Congress by citing how the Congress leadership never campaigned for him when he was the candidate while AAP leaders went all out to campaign and garner support for Congress candidates.","AAP may be willing to climb down on its demand for 10 seats to move closer to agreeing to 4-6 seats that Congress is likely to cede, sources said.

21 cities achieve target of 40% PM10 cut 2 years before deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/21-cities-achieve-target-of-40-pm10-cut-2-years-before-deadline/articleshow/113175463.cms,"NEW DELHI: Twenty-one cities including Greater Mumbai, Varanasi, Agra, Lucknow, Kanpur, Dehradun, Dhanbad, Trichy and Tuticorin have reduced the concentration of critical air pollutant PM10 by more than 40% in 2023-24 compared to 2017-18 levels, according to the latest compilation of data from 131 cities made by the environment ministry.Though these 21 cities have met the target of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) two years in advance, most of them including Greater Mumbai, Varanasi, Agra, Kanpur, Lucknow, Dehradun and others have still not met the acceptable limit (national standards) of keeping PM10 concentration within the annual average levels of 60 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3).For example, Greater Mumbai reduced PM10 levels by nearly 42% (from 161 µg/m3 in 2017-18 to 94 µg/m3 in 2023-24) but city continues to be in polluting category due to not meeting the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). On the other hand, the reduction of over 40% in the pollutant levels put Trichy, Tuticorin (both in Tamil Nadu) and Kadapa (Andhra Pradesh) in the list of 18 cities which meet those standards of being clean cities.Under NCAP launched in 2019, the ministry had planned to reduce PM10 levels by 40% by 2025-26 from the baseline year 2017-18. Overall, 95 out of 131 polluting cities have shown improvement by reducing levels of PM10 in varying percentages where 18 of them have, so far, reached the acceptable limit of this critical air pollutant. PM10 (particulate matters that do not exceed 10 micrograms in diameter) is small enough to enter the lungs through breathing causing serious health hazards.Data on improvement in air quality in these cities was shared by the ministry at a function to observe ‘International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies’ in Jaipur on Sept 7 where Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav awarded nine cities in three different categories for better implementation of different actions for mitigating air pollution under NCAP.Surat, Jabalpur and Agra were awarded for being the top three cities in the million-pluspopulation category, whereas Firozabad, Amravati and Jhansi received the award in the category of 3-10 lakh of population, and Raebareli, Nalgonda and Nalagarh in the category of less than three lakh of population. Except for Nalgonda in Telangana, none of these cities, however, figured in the list of 18 which met the national standards for clean air. The cities were awarded under the ‘Swachh Vayu Survekshan’ 2024 on the basis of different mitigation measures where the weightage of improving PM10 levels is merely 2.5% in this annual survey.High-polluting cities such as Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Nasik and Kota too recorded improvement in terms of reducing PM10 to an extent, but the levels of pollutant there are still quite far away from the acceptable limit. Delhi reduced the level of PM10 from 241 µg/m3 in 2017-18 to 208 µg/m3 in 2023-24 (nearly 14% decline) but the city continues to be highly polluting by recording pollutant levels by more than three times of the national standards.Under NCAP, city action plans (CAPs) have been prepared by all 131 ‘non-attainment’ cities and are being implemented by urban local bodies. The non-attainment cities are those which did not conform to the NAAQS during 2011-15.The Centre has earmarked nearly Rs 20,000 crore for these cities during 2019-20 to 2025-26, out of which 49 million plus population cities are funded under the 15th Finance Commission air quality grant and remaining 82 cities by the environment ministry.

'India does not have respect for ... '

Rahul on AI

NEW DELHI: Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , on his three-day visit to the United States, addressed pressing issues such as unemployment , education , and technology. He remarked that both the West and India are grappling with job crises and advocated for India to ""boost its own production "" to combat unemployment.Rahul said that while many countries are grappling with unemployment, some, such as China and Vietnam, are not facing such difficulties.Gandhi traced the roots of this issue to historical shifts in global production. “The West, including the United States and Europe, once led global production in the mid-20th century,” he said.He noted a significant change over the decades, with production gradually relocating from the US to South Korea, Japan, and eventually China. Today, China dominates global production, a shift Gandhi attributes to Western and Indian retreat from manufacturing.“The West, including America and Europe, has largely abandoned the manufacturing sector, leaving it to countries like China and Vietnam,” the LoP in Lok Sabha explained.The Congress MP added that India needs to reimagine its approach to production. “India cannot simply accept that manufacturing will be the domain of other countries,” he said. “We need to develop our own manufacturing capabilities in a way that aligns with democratic principles.”Reflecting on his recent Bharat Jodo Yatra, Gandhi shared how it reshaped his political outlook. “The Bharat Jodo Yatra fundamentally changed the way I think about my work,” he said. He discussed how the Yatra introduced the concept of love into political discourse, which is rare globally. “The most powerful thing that happened organically was the introduction of the idea of love in politics,” Gandhi mentioned.Talking about education and skills in India, Rahul suggested that the real issue is not a lack of skills but a lack of respect for skilled individuals. “India does not have respect for people who possess skills,” he remarked. He criticised the disconnect between the education system and the business sector, advocating for better integration through vocational training. “Our education system doesn’t connect with the business system. Bridging that gap through vocational training is fundamental,” Rahul said.Regarding Artificial Intelligence (AI), Gandhi acknowledged both its challenges and opportunities. “Every time you get a new technology, the argument is made that it’s going to take jobs away,” the Congress MP said. However, he also pointed out that while AI might displace some jobs, it will create new ones as well. “It’s going to hit different people differently. If you position it properly, it’s an opportunity; if not, you’re in trouble,” Gandhi explained.Rahul Gandhi made his remarks during a live interaction with students at the University of Texas in Dallas, USA.Gandhi arrived in Dallas on Sunday and was welcomed by Sam Pitroda, Chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress, and members of the Indian diaspora.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi is on a three-day visit to the United States.

Doval to travel to Russia today for Brics meeting of NSAs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doval-to-travel-to-russia-today-for-brics-meeting-of-nsas/articleshow/113174029.cms,"NEW DELHI: NSA Ajit Doval will travel to Russia on Monday to participate in a meeting of Brics national security advisors , ahead of the summit in Oct in Kazan.According to Russian authorities, PM Narendra Modi in his recent phone conversation with President Vladimir Putin had expressed readiness to participate in the Brics summit that will see him visiting Russia for the second time this year, after the bilateral visit in July.The NSAs' meeting is held every year by the host country, which holds the rotating presidency, in the lead up to the Brics summit.Russia holds the presidency this year. The 'Meeting of Brics and Brics Plus High-Level Security Officials' will be held in St Petersburg on 10-12 Sept.India also participated in a meeting of Brics Sherpa and Sous Sherpa last week in Russia. The BRICS engagement takes place against the backdrop of renewed efforts to bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end. Significantly, Putin had said last week that three Brics countries - India, China and Brazil - can be trusted to mediate in the conflict.The meeting of top security officials will discuss the conflict, with Doval likely to reiterate Modi's stated intention of actively supporting any initiative for a diplomatic solution.During his recent visit to Ukraine, Modi had urged President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to talk to Putin, underscoring India's position that it's important to involve both sides in any effort for enduring peace.Doval is expected to have several bilateral meetings with his counterparts. He had met China's Wang Yi, member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Political Bureau, on the sidelines of the same meeting in Johannesburg in 2023 and conveyed to him that the situation along the LAC in eastern Ladakh since 2020 had eroded strategic trust and the public and political basis of the relationship. South Africa held the summit last year.","NSA Ajit Doval will travel to Russia on Monday to participate in a meeting of Brics national security advisors.

""The country is fully prepared to deal with such isolated travel related cases and has robust measures in place to manage and mitigate any potential risk,"" it added.Recently, the World Health Organisation declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in view of the disease's spread in African nations and even outside, in Europe and Pakistan, for example.""In 2022 too, mpox was declared a PHEIC as cases were being reported from countries that were not endemic for mpox such as EU countries, US. It was the Clade II of the virus that was circulating in that PHEIC period. The 2024 PHEIC, on the other hand, is due to the surge, primarily in Congo (DRC) and other countries of the African continent since Jan this year. This is due to Clade Ib of the virus which is known to be more transmissible and has a higher fatality rate as compared to Clade II.

Correlated Events

Distinct Activity

BENGALURU: In multiple “firsts”, India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission has detected more than 250 seismic signals on the Moon’s south polar region , including 50 distinct ones that have no correlation to the activity of the rover’s ( Pragyan ) movement or operations of other instruments but could be possibly linked to Moonquakes .This marks the first collection of seismic data from Moon’s southern polar region and the first such data anywhere on the lunar surface since the Apollo era.This experiment by Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA), a scientific instrument aboard Vikram lander , was conducted at the landing site of 69.37° South and 32.32° East.ILSA, which operated for 190 hours between Aug 24 and Sept 4, 2023, is the first instrument to record ground accelerations from the south polar region of Moon and the first on the lunar surface that employed sensors fabricated by silicon micromachining technology.The findings have been analysed and published by a group of Isro researchers in ICARUS , a scientific journal dedicated to the field of planetary science.The paper has been published by J John, V Thamarai, Teena Choudhary, MN Srinivasa, Ashwini Jambhalikar, MS Giridhar, Madan Mohan Mehra, Mayank Garg, KV Shila, Krishna Kummari, SP Karantha, Kalpana Arvind and KV Sriram, from Isro’s Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems (LEOS) in Peenya, Bengaluru.LEOS director Sriram told TOI: “Of the more than 250 seismic events recorded, approximately 200 signals correlate to known activities involving Pragyan’s movements or the operation of scientific instruments, the 50 others do not have any explanation. There needs to be further studies to understand what may have caused these activities.”Researchers say the longest and relatively large amplitude (maximum extent of a vibration or oscillation, measured from the position of equilibrium) records from ILSA are those corresponding to Pragyan’s navigation. The longest continuous signal record lasts for 14 minutes.About 60 signals catalogued correspond to Pragyan’s movement controlled by ground commands. The rover that weighed about 25kg had six wheels and was driven with motors. It moved at a typical speed of 1 cm per second. The dynamics of the rover and the wheel-soil interaction had been a source of complex ground vibration signal input to ILSA.“As the distance of the rover from ILSA was increased, there had been a systematic reduction in the amplitude of the signal under normal roving conditions. For example, when the rover was away from the lander by around 7m, the average peak to peak amplitude was around 200 μg (microgravity). This amplitude was halved when the distance became 12m and was one order less when the separation was 40m,” the paper, accessed by TOI, reads.Researchers further said that any event that could be classified as deep quake or shallow quake was beyond the targeted objectives and design specifications of ILSA and that they were aware of the very low probability of occurrence of those classes of events during the one lunar day operation of the instrument.However, from the data investigated as a part of the paper, there are about 50 instances where the amplitude of output from the instrument is distinctly different from its normal background level.“From the mission command history, it was confirmed that any activity that can cause ground vibration was not performed during this timeframe,” the paper reads. Hence, researchers classified these as ‘uncorrelated events’.Among the 50 uncorrelated events, the maximum peak to peak amplitude of the signal is as high as 700 μg in certain instances. “The frequency content in the signals are spread over a wide range up to 50 Hz. The signals discussed here lasted only for a few seconds. Although several distinct signals lasting less than a couple of seconds are also observed, they are not included in the count reported in this paper,” the paper read.","India's Chandrayaan-3 mission has detected more than 250 seismic signals on the Moon’s south polar region.

If voted to govt, we will make J&K a model state in the next 10 years.""At a rally in Banihal for BJP candidate Mohd Saleem Bhat, the defence minister iterated that India was ready to start a dialogue with Pakistan if the latter stopped sponsoring terrorism in J&K.""Who would not like to improve relations with neighbouring countries? We also want improved relations with Pakistan, but first, they should stop terrorism.""J&K's first assembly election in a decade starts Sept 18 with the first of three phases of polling. In Ramban, BJP nominee Thakur is up against National Conference 's Arjun Singh Raju and rebel candidate Suraj Singh Parihar.The defence minister termed the electoral exercise a ""historic"" one that the world would be keenly watching. ""I was recently in the US, and people of Indian origin there asked me what the J&K election would yield. I categorically told them that Kashmir would have a BJP govt,"" Singh said. ""You will see a new J&K.""Without naming PDP chief and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti, he said people who declared J&K would be on fire if Article 370 were touched had realised that the BJP-led govt at the Centre was not one to back out of taking tough decisions. ""We abrogated it openly and not a single bullet was fired. Rather, a peaceful atmosphere has prevailed across J&K since.""Home minister Amit Shah had said while releasing BJP's manifesto for the polls Friday that Article 370 was ""history"".Singh echoed Shah's remark while slamming Farooq Abdullah's NC for promising to restore the abrogated provision that used to guarantee special status to J&K. ""I want to tell them that no power on earth can bring back Article 370 till BJP is there.""The defence minister also fired a salvo at Farooq's son and NC vice president Omar Abdullah for suggesting that Afzal Guru should not have been hanged after being convicted in the Parliament attack case. ""What were we supposed to do with Guru if not hang him? Garland him?""He said the Narendra Modi govt believed in solid governance, from punishing the guilty to getting justice for the oppressed.""In J&K, daughters were not safe, and the marginalised, including refugees from West Pakistan and the Valmiki community, were denied the right to vote. Under Modi's leadership, these people were granted their rights. The Pahari community received ST status. They were also provided political reservation, as were the Gujjar-Bakarwals.""",J&K's first assembly election in a decade starts Sept 18 with the first of three phases of polling.
