He was sharing some insights on social media from the latest QS World University Rankings by Subject which were published on April 10.In an exclusive interaction last year Quacquarelli told TOI that “Now is a time for Indian universities to be recognised in their own right.”Commenting on the progress made, the QS chief said that among all G20 nations, this year, Indian universities demonstrated the highest performance improvement (a significant 14% year-on-year improvement in their average ranking).“In terms of research output, India has become one of the world's most rapidly expanding research centres. From 2017 to 2022, its research output surged by an impressive 54 per cent, making it the world's fourth-largest producer of research,” he said.Attributing the progress of India in the global high education arena to the National Education Policy 2020 , he cited that the latest subject rankings show that these targets are beginning to manifest in the significant presence and enhanced performance of Indian universities:In an interaction with TOI he said: “We're beginning to see a significant moment of transformation of Indian higher education, where it can take the next leap. You already have IITs that are very, very powerful in the technology, engineering, and design space, they are performing well. They still have a journey of transformation.”India now ranks prominently across 44 out of the 55 QS Subject Rankings . Standout performances were noted in Computer Science, Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Business Studies, and Physics, among others.Across Asia, India now holds the second-highest number of featured universities in the QS Subject Rankings, behind China.He said that by allowing top brands to come to India and open campuses, “you're signalling that India is a centre of excellence. All the universities in India will benefit from having to compete,” adding “a very high proportion of faculty at American business schools are Indian. Your brightest kids have been leaving India, and they are enhancing the reputation of the institution they go to. Now is a time for Indian universities to be recognised in their own right.”","Nunzio Quacquarelli is the founder and president of QS Qu Acquarelli Symonds.

'Naked communal appeal': Shashi Tharoor on PM's comment that Congress will distribute private wealth to Muslims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/naked-communal-appeal-shashi-tharoor-on-pms-comment-that-congress-will-distribute-private-wealth-to-muslims/articleshow/109505288.cms,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Congress candidate from Thiruvananthapuram, Shashi Tharoor , termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's comment that Congress, if voted to power, would distribute people's private wealth to Muslims as disgraceful.""This is a very disgraceful speech made by the Prime Minister. The fact is that people realise that when he says that the Congress party is going to take all your wealth and give it to the Muslims, this is just a nakedly communal appeal, which normally any civilised Election Commission would disallow and warn the candidate for speaking like this.It is simply not decent,"" Tharoor told ANI.Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the Congress party has plans to redistribute gold and hard-earned money to "" illegal immigrants "" and asked people whether this is acceptable to them or not.""Congress manifesto says that it will calculate the gold owned by our mothers and sisters, collect information, and then distribute it to those whom former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that Muslims have the first right to country's wealth. They will check how much gold our sisters own, how much silver tribal families have, and how much money government employees have there,"" the PM said in an election rally in Rajasthan on Sunday.Tharoor said that he was truly disappointed by the Prime Minister's speech.""The Congress party is constantly accused by Mr Modi of having ruled the country for 65 years. Have we taken away people's wealth and given it to the Muslim community? How can the Prime Minister talk like this? I am truly disappointed,"" he said.Meanwhile, former Union Minister and Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal asked whether 20 crore people in the country mattered to PM Modi or not, adding that Election Commission of India must issue notice to him over the comments.Addressing a press conference, Kapil Sibal said, ""You (PM Modi) are giving a speech that the Congress will give the properties of the women to infiltrators and terrorists. Do 20 crore people do not matter to him? Do they not have any aspirations? Politics has stooped down to such a level and it has not happened in history and I do not want it to happen. I want to ask a question to the Election Commission why action was not taken immediately. You (EC) should condemn it and a notice should be given to PM Modi.""Sibal claimed that the Prime Minister made these remarks as he might have sensed that voting in phase 1 of the Lok Sabha elections has not gone BJP's way.""Recently, PM Modi gave a speech, it seems that the first phase of elections has not been in their favour. After that speech, I feel that a lot of people would be disappointed. I don't think any Prime Minister have made such remarks since independence which indicates that minorities living here are intruders.

Glaciers melting at unprecedented rates in Indian Himalayan region: Isro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/glaciers-melting-at-unprecedented-rates-in-indian-himalayan-region-isro/articleshow/109505281.cms,"The long-term changes in the Ghepang Ghat Glacial Lake area (Credit: Isro

BENGALURU: The Himalayan mountains , often called the “Third Pole” due to their vast glaciers and snow cover, are highly vulnerable to global climate change impacts both physically and societally. Isro Monday said that new research analysing decades of satellite imagery has revealed that glaciers across the Indian Himalayan region have been melting at alarming rates, leading to the significant expansion of glacial lakes .Research conducted worldwide has consistently shown that glaciers across the globe have been experiencing unprecedented rates of retreat and thinning since the onset of the industrial revolution in the 18th century.“...This retreat leads to the formation of new lakes and the enlargement of existing ones in the Himalayan region. These bodies of water, created by the melting of glaciers, are known as glacial lakes and play a crucial role as freshwater sources for rivers in the Himalayan region. However, they also pose significant risks, such as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods ( GLOFs ), which can have devastating consequences for communities downstream,” Isro said in a statement on Monday.For the research, Isro used satellite data from 1984 to 2023, which shows that of the 2,431 glacial lakes larger than 10 hectares identified in 2016-17 across river basins, a staggering 676 lakes have grown markedly since 1984. This includes 130 lakes within India — 65 in the Indus basin, seven in the Ganga basin, and 58 in the Brahmaputra basin.The changes have been drastic, with 601 of the expanding lakes more than doubling in size. Ten lakes grew 1.5 to 2 times larger, while 65 expanded 1.5 times. The analysis found many of the bulging lakes at higher elevations, with 314 between 4,000-5,000 metres and 296 above 5,000 metres.The glacial lakes are categorised based on their formation process into four broad categories, namely Moraine-dammed (water dammed by moraine), Ice-dammed (water dammed by ice), Erosion (water dammed in depressions formed by erosion), and other glacial lakes.“Among the 676 expanding lakes, the majority of them are Moraine-dammed (307) followed by Erosion (265), other (96), and Ice-dammed (8) glacial lakes, respectively,” Isro said.One example is Ghepang Ghat lake in Himachal Pradesh, which has grown 178% larger from 36.49 to 101.3 hectares between 1989-2022 at a rate of nearly 2 hectares per year.As glaciers rapidly melt, the swelling lakes not only indicate monumental environmental changes but also elevate risks of glacial lake outburst floods that can unleash devastating flooding downstream into mountain communities.",Isro says glaciers across Indian Himalayan region have been melting at alarming rates. This has led to the significant expansion of glacial lakes in the region. The lakes are created by the melting of glaciers and play a crucial role as freshwater sources for rivers.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109505315,imgsize-920633,width-400,resizemode-4/109505315.jpg"

Tragedy strikes IIT Kharagpur: Student found deceased in hostel room

To mark 50 years of association, Nandan Nilekani gives IIT-Bombay highest ever grant in India of Rs 315 crore

MUMBAI/DELHI: The pursuit of high-paying jobs has hit a roadblock this placement season at the premium Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). With companies scaling back on hiring and offering lower salary packages , students at the tail-end are being offered annual packages below Rs 10 lakh.Organisations that would usually pick half-a-dozen students have picked one or two at best, forcing colleges to reach out to more companies.And many of those are offering annual compensation of Rs 10-15 lakh. Students who have bagged campus jobs at what they believe is a lower pay scale, are still in the market looking for better prospects on job portals and travelling cities to attend job fairs and interviews.""The global economic slowdown has significantly impacted the campus placements for the 2024 graduating batch of IIT Indore. The reduced hiring numbers of recruiters compared to the previous year have resulted in a challenging placement season. To offset the impact, IIT Indore has taken early steps by tapping into alumni networks and has broadened its pool of potential employers, including PSUs,"" said Professor Suhas Joshi, director, IIT Indore.A student at IIT Bombay said, ""Companies that till last year picked 5 to 8 students are picking 1 or 2 this year. Several are still not yet hired. From coaching classes to start-ups, some have recently been picked for salary packages of Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000 in phase 2.""Another student from an IIT-Kharagpur said, ""Spectrum Technologies offered Rs 3.6 lakh for trainee engineers and Rs 6 lakh for trainee design engineers. Startoon Labs and Gem Machinery offered Rs 5.5 lakh annually. Skyroot offered Rs 5 lakh. Sri Chaitanya and Next Education offer Rs 4.8 to 6 lakh per annum.""""The scenario now is that many students are taking up jobs offering the bare minimum threshold salary of Rs 6 lakh a year but are looking for other jobs,"" a source said. Students and placement office staff are trying to attract more companies, negotiating packages with NGOs, reaching out to job portals, and providing guidance to final-year students. Praveen Tyagi, owner of IITians' Pace, a tutorial for entrance tests, said, ""While AI has reduced jobs and international FANG companies did not come to the campus, we saw this as an opportunity to pick up talent. We conducted tests to hire IITians, and hundreds of them took our test. Students conducted mock online lectures, and those who had good communication skills were picked. We have offered 25 students Rs 12 lakh per annum.""At IIT Delhi, a significant number are still seeking employment through the Office of Career Services (OCS). As of April 5, out of 1,814 students registered with OCS, 1,083 have secured jobs, leaving approximately 40% yet to find employment.However, the situation appears more favorable for those in undergraduate programs (BTech+dual degree), with 81% of the 903 participants having received job offers. R Ayothiraman, professor-in-charge of OCS, mentioned plans to conduct separate placement drives specifically for PhD candidates.During recent placements, students at IIT-D were introduced to a variety of job roles. Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd proposed an annual package of Rs 19.5 lakh, while HCL Software offered Rs 21.9 lakh, Tata Consultancy Services and Larsen & Toubro presented annual packages of Rs 9 lakh and Rs 7 lakh respectively.The placement process at IIT Delhi is rigorous, with each phase lasting about 15 days. Students diligently prepare for interviews. ""We are mentally prepared for a set pattern of questions, but this time the companies were more demanding, seeking fewer candidates with specialized skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning for annual packages ranging from Rs 10-50 lakh,"" a student said, adding that he lacked the skills required because his interest lay in software development.","The pursuit of high-paying jobs has hit a roadblock at the premium Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) With companies scaling back on hiring and offering lower salary packages, students at the tail-end are being offered annual packages below Rs 10 lakh.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Calcutta High Court issued a decision on Monday in the West Bengal School Service Commission ( SSC ) recruitment scam case. In its decision, the state's highest court invalidated the appointment of nearly 24,000 teachers, and non-teaching staff. The court specifically cancelled all appointments for teaching and non-teaching staff made through the 2016 state-level exams in state-sponsored and aided schools.A division bench of Justices Debangsu Basak and Md Shabbar Rashidi also ordered the cancellation and directed the CBI to conduct further investigation into the appointment process. They also asked for a report from the CBI within three months.In 2014, the West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) announced that the State Level Selection Test (SLST) would be used to recruit teachers for West Bengal's state-run schools.The actual recruitment process began in 2016. However, this process was met with numerous challenges, including several petitions filed in the Calcutta High Court alleging irregularities in the recruitment process.The petitioners claimed that many candidates who received lower grades were placed higher on the merit list, raising concerns about the fairness of the selection process. Furthermore, there were allegations that individuals who did not even make the merit list received appointment letters.In another case, in 2016, the West Bengal government directed the School Service Commission to hire approximately 13,000 Group-D employees for state-run and government-aided schools. By 2019, the panel tasked with making these appointments had expired.During the hearing, it was claimed by the petitioners that the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) hired at least 25 people for these positions. The petitioners also claimed that after the SSC panel expired, over 500 people were appointed and are now receiving salaries from the state government.A CBI investigation was launched in response to an order from the Calcutta High Court bench of Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay. In 202, the investigation focused on the appointment of 269 primary school teachers in Bengal government-sponsored and aided schools, which were deemed illegal because the candidates allegedly did not pass the Teachers Eligibility Test (TET). The CBI's FIR alleged irregularities in the TET 2014 primary selection process, claiming that incorrect questions and answer keys were used to exclude eligible candidates.It was also claimed that some ineligible TET 2014 candidates were appointed as Assistant Teachers, with candidates who submitted blank exam papers receiving appointments. The agency also claims that an additional panel was formed, which included people who failed the TET-2014 exam. This process has been criticised for displaying favouritism and nepotism.Justice Gangopadhyay directed Bengal Industries and Commerce Minister Partha Chatterjee, who previously held the education portfolio, to appear before the CBI for questioning. The Enforcement Directorate is conducting a separate investigation into alleged money laundering linked to the teacher recruitment scam . While the CBI investigates the criminal aspect, the ED tracks the money trail. The financial investigation agency has filed two FIRs in connection with the case.Earlier in April, the Enforcement Directorate attached over Rs 230 crore worth of properties belonging to former adviser to the WB SSC - Shanti Prasad Sinha and an alleged middleman Prassanna Roy. Both had been arrested and sent to judicial custody. Middleman Roy was involved in the alleged collection of money and details from candidates, according to the ED, as reported by TOI.The primary teachers recruitment scam in the state has seen significant action from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), with properties worth Rs 135 crore already attached or seized. This brings the total attachment in the two teachers recruitment scams to over Rs 365 crore.The attached assets include 96 cottah land in Patharghata, 117 cottah in Sultanpur, 282 cottah in Maheshtala, and 136 cottah in New Town, all of which are associated with Roy and his shell entities.Following the West Bengal School Service Commission (WB SSC) recruitment scam case, the Calcutta High Court issued comprehensive directives for all. The court has ordered that the School Service Commission (SSC) conduct new recruitments for the affected posts. Those who were improperly appointed have been ordered to repay their salaries within six weeks.Furthermore, the High Court has directed the West Bengal School Service Commission to initiate new appointments within the next 15 days. This decision affects over 23 lakh candidates who took the 2016 State Level Selection Test (SLST) for 24,640 vacant teaching and non-teaching positions.","The Calcutta High Court issued a decision on Monday in the West Bengal School Service Commission ( SSC ) recruitment scam case.

"Worried over dip in voting, Election Commission plans to boost turnout",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worried-over-dip-in-voting-election-commission-plans-to-boost-turnout/articleshow/109482222.cms,"NEW DELHI: Concerned over the drop of nearly three percentage points in overall voter turnout in the first phase of Lok Sabha elections this year as compared to 2019, with the decline recorded in 19 of the 21 states and Union territories that voted on Friday, the Election Commission will be making a mid-poll correction in its strategy to boost turnout .Though the polling percentage has inched up since Friday as more reports from remote polling stations came in - with the latest figure now 66% and expected to rise further by at least 0.1-0.2 percentage points - it is still way short of the 69.2% turnout recorded in 2019 for the same 102 constituencies where polling has been completed.Conceding that the EC ""is very concerned about the dip in turnout"", one of its senior functionaries said that voter enthusiasm, though apparent, was not enough to bring them to the polling stations. ""EC had made tremendous efforts to push up turnout. There were targeted interventions like the turnout implementation plan (TIP) under the Systematic Voter Education and Electoral Participation Program (SVEEP), voting appeals by celebrities roped in as EC ambassadors, tie up with BCCI to use IPL as a platform to motivate voters and improving polling booth facilities to make voting a pleasant experience, but they seem to have fallen short,"" said the EC functionary.Sources told TOI that the EC is analysing the reasons for the lower turnout. ""The issue was discussed in meetings through the weekend and we will be coming out with more strategies by Monday under the turnout implementation programme,"" said the EC functionary.As per sources, the possible reasons for lower turnout may be the summer heat as polling this time started eight days later than in 2019; apathy caused by many voters perceiving the result to be a foregone conclusion; and a clash with the festival and wedding season.Among the states and UTs, only three states - Chhattisgarh, Meghalaya and Sikkim - saw higher turnouts as compared to 2019. Nagaland witnessed 57.7% turnout, over 25 percentage points less than in 2019. The decline in Manipur was 7.7 percentage points, in Madhya Pradesh over 7 percentage points and in Rajasthan and Mizoram over 6 percentage points.Bihar recorded the lowest turnout at 49.2%; even if this did not take the EC by surprise as the poll covered a Left-wing extremism-affected area, the corresponding turnout in 2019 was higher at 53.47%. UP too saw the turnout slip to 61.1% from 66.5%.The two states where polling has been completed - Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand - saw the turnouts going south as well. In Tamil Nadu, it fell to 69.7% to 72.1% despite the big-ticket campaign that saw DMK and BJP trading barbs over the controversial 'sanatan dharma' comment by Tamil Nadu minister Udhaynidhi Stalin. Uttarakhand too saw lesser voter enthusiasm, with the turnout there dipping to 57.2% from 61.5% in 2019.West Bengal, which has been a high-turnout state, saw an impressive turnout at 81.9% but even this was less than the 2019 figure of 84.7%.EC sources said it is difficult to identify the category of voters who may have contributed to the lower turnout. ""We do not profile the voters and count them as separate categories. The only solution is to encourage and mobilise all the categories with tailored inteventions to shun apathy and be counted,"" said an EC official.The commission is expected to come out with revised turnout-boosting strategies before the next round of polling gets under way on April 26.",The Election Commission will be making a mid-poll correction in its strategy to boost turnout. The polling percentage has inched up since Friday as more reports from remote polling stations came in.

RANCHI: Two empty chairs for jailed Arvind Kejriwal and Hemant Soren headlined INDIA bloc ’s bid to turn the tables on BJP at a joint rally here today as the Delhi chief minister’s wife Sunita Kejriwal led the offensive by accusing the Narendra Modi govt of conspiring to kill her diabetic husband in Tihar jail by denying him insulin.“Their politics is very dirty.Now there is a camera fixed on his food, each morsel of food is being monitored, what a shame it is. He is diabetic and has been administered 50 units of insulin for the past 12 years now. But inside the jail, he is not given any. They want to kill him,” Sunita alleged at the Ulgulan Nyay Rally here.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Kejriwal’s AAP colleague and Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav were among those attended the event.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav were among those attended the event and declared that the ongoing general election was a fight to “save the Constitution and democracy”. The chorus was that the opposition bloc would not be intimidated by arm-twisting tactics like putting Kejriwal and former Jharkhand CM Hemant behind bars. Congress’s Rahul Gandhi could not make it to the event, citing illness.Other than the two empty chairs, two giant banners showing Hemant and Kejriwal behind bars were placed at the rally on Ranchi’s Prabhat Tara ground. That was to send the message that both will return soon. Kejriwal has been held in an ED case related to Delhi’s liquor policy and Hemant in an alleged Ranchi land scam.“Court has not yet found Kejriwal and Hemant guilty, yet Modi ji has put them in jail. Kejriwal has been a diabetes patient for 20 years and has been taking 50 units of insulin daily for about 12 years,” Sunita said, iterating charges about a plot to kill her husband.Sunita questioned the ED probe. “What kind of investigation is this where you put innocent people in jail without proving guilt? This is dictatorship. What is my husband’s fault? He improved govt schools in Delhi, provided good education, built hospitals and mohalla clinics,” Sunita said. Her AAP colleague Sanjay Singh declared that “these empty chairs won’t be so after poll results on June 4”.Hemant’s wife Kalpana read out a message penned by her husband from jail. “BJP had been hatching conspiracies against me for four years and put me in jail over a baseless case. In the same fashion, they put Delhi CM behind bars. This is the first time since independence when opposition leaders are being jailed in a well-planned manner before a Lok Sabha election,” Hemant said.Congress chief Kharge claimed Hemant, a tribal, had paid the price for being a part of INDIA bloc.",Two empty chairs for jailed Arvind Kejriwal and Hemant Soren headlined INDIA bloc’s bid to turn the tables on BJP at a joint rally here today. Delhi chief minister's wife Sunita Kejriwal led the offensive by accusing the Narendra Modi govt of conspiring to kill her diabetic husband in Tihar jail.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109484514,imgsize-731920,width-400,resizemode-4/109484514.jpg"
Israel-Iran attacks show India needs greater thrust on multi-layered air & missile defence systems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-iran-attacks-show-india-needs-stronger-air-and-missile-defence-systems/articleshow/109448246.cms,"NEW DELHI: Missile defence is technically complex and very expensive. It’s virtually like firing a bullet to stop an incoming bullet. But with the sheer operational criticality of air and missile defence systems being reinforced by the tit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Iran, India needs to majorly crank up efforts to make its airspace as impregnable as possible.India has taken some strides in the arena but much more clearly needs to be done for an effective multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, reliable command and control posts, land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles.Unlike India, Israel of course has only a small territory to defend. And it did so effectively on April 13, thwarting Iran’s mass missile and kamikaze drone attack with its wide array of defence systems, from the short-range Iron Dome to long-range Arrow, as well as help from some others like the US.India’s air defence systems are geared towards protecting only some vital areas and installations. “India is simply too vast to be effectively protected from all kinds of aerial threats. But yes, apart from buying bullets, we need to invest much more in bulletproof jackets as well. Missile defence is now an overwhelming tactical necessity rather than a strategic one,” a senior officer said.For one, India needs to get cracking on operationally deploying its indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy nuclear and other ballistic missiles both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 15-25 km to 80-100 km for “a higher kill probability”.After “successfully completing” a series of tests for Phase-1 of the land-based BMD system quite a while ago, the DRDO also conducted the maiden flight-trial of a sea-based interceptor missile in April last year.The government, however, has so far not sanctioned full-scale deployment of the BMD system at any vital location. This could be due to the exorbitant costs involved or a few technological gaps, or even strategic calculations that it may provoke Pakistan to go in for a larger nuclear arsenal and countermeasures to defeat the BMD system, as reported by TOI earlier.IAF, of course, now has three squadrons of Russian S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems, which can detect, track and destroy incoming strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, drones and even some intermediate-range ballistic missiles at a range of 380-km. They are deployed in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan.Delivery of the remaining two S-400 squadrons, under the $5.43 billion contract inked in 2018, has been delayed to 2025-26 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.Parallelly, India is developing its own long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system under the ambitious Project Kusha. With an interception range of around 350-km, this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29.Then, there is the Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile (MR-SAM) systems, with an over 70-km range, jointly developed with Israel. After the Navy and IAF, Army in Feb last year operationalized its first `Abhra’ MR-SAM regiment in the 33 Corps, which defends the frontier with China in Sikkim and the Siliguri Corridor.Army and IAF have also inducted the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, with an interception range of 25-km, while a new-generation sleeker version is also now ready for user trials.The armed forces also have a variety of shorter range air defence weapons. These range from the older Russian Igla-1M (5-km), OSA-AK-M (10-km) and Pechora missiles and upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5-km) to the newer Israeli low-level Spyder quick-reaction anti-aircraft missiles (15-km range) and Russian man-portable Igla-S (6-km) systems. DRDO is also testing the indigenous very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS) missiles, which has a range of up to 6-km.","India needs to majorly crank up efforts to make its airspace as impregnable as possible.

"Powered by brand PM Modi and RLD tie-up, Hema Malini in lead role again",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/powered-by-brand-pm-modi-and-rld-tie-up-hema-malini-in-lead-role-again/articleshow/109485295.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two folk artistes sing with ear-splitting gusto, exalting PM Modi ’s development work. The sparse audience listens with bored indifference, until the duo belts out a bardic dare to Pakistan. A spontaneous cheer breaks out. The singers are support acts. At Rampur Chauraha , all are waiting for actor-politician Hema Malini . The two-time BJP MP, aiming for a hat-trick, is two hours late.The chauraha (crossroads), about 20km from Mathura , is a collection of faceless stores and a capacious temple complex. Old men in turbans mill about. A bunch of young men attending coaching classes for aspiring cops in nearby Raya nagar panchayat have stopped to catch a glimpse. They are first-time voters. Sholay is her only film they can name. Barring a few women in ghoonghat, it’s an all-male crowd.Saffron and green – caps of two different colours reveal the freshly-crafted political alliance for the polls. Imprinted with the slogan ‘Bhaichara Zindabad’ (long live brotherhood), the green cap represents Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). Last month the regional party, primarily based out of west Uttar Pradesh, tied up with BJP and became a cog in the NDA wheel. RLD is contesting the Baghpat and Bijnor Lok Sabha seats, and backing BJP in other constituencies. “Feel free to wear either cap,” someone announces.The temple town has been BJP’s pocket borough since 2014. The constituency’s five assembly seats (Chhata, Mant, Goverdhan, Mathura and Baldev) are with it. Hema pocketed 53% of votes in 2014 LS polls, rising to a staggering 61% five years later, although her victory margin dipped. RLD had cornered 34% of the votes then. Simply put, BJP and RLD had polled a combined 95% votes for Mathura in 2019. In politics, one plus one does not always equal two, but with RLD and BJP joining forces, the Lotus is undeniably in pole position here.Hema’s second-term Parliament attendance was a modest 50%, about 30% lower than the national average. Voters aren’t positive in their assessment either. Jat farmer Malkhan Singh bluntly says she has been missing in action. But he also proffers, “I will vote for her. Who else can one vote for?” For him, the competition is absent. Neither he, nor others sitting with him, have heard of Congress candidate Mukesh Dhangar, also backed by Samajwadi Party and AAP, in the INDIA alliance.Dhangar, 36, is an MBA in HR and marketing from Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow. “Yeh chunav pravasi aur Brijwasi ke beech ka chunav hoga (the contest is between Brijwasi (local) and the outsider,” he told ANI earlier this month. Suresh Singh, 65, is the BSP candidate. Mathura’s SC population is roughly 20%. Jats, Thakurs and Brahmins are also numerically significant in these parts. Incidentally, the BJP candidate is married to film star Dharmendra, a Jat and former BJP MP from Bikaner, which increases her acceptability.Every slogan on view is woven around Modi, “Main hoon Modi ka parivar” and “Phir ek baar Modi Sarkar” being the most familiar. Talking to prospective voters, it isn’t hard to fathom why. Brand PM is the most saleable. Virendra Singh, who runs a medicine shop, laments the absence of electricity in his village Tambaka. “Kat-ti zyaada hai, aati kam hai. (there’s more load shedding than light),” says Virendra, a Prajapati by caste. But he likes Modi and will vote for him because he can reach out to the PM directly online and make complaints or suggestions on his website.Virendra had received a WhatsApp message from ‘Viksit Bharat Sampark’, asking him, “What’s your opinion of the Modi government’s work?”. ‘Bahut achha (very good)’ or ‘theek thak (okay)’ or ‘kharab (poor)’. He answered, ‘bahut achha’, and received a ‘thank you’ message.Bachchu Singh, a Jat working in a Delhi factory, is annoyed that his specially-abled wife’s application for awas yojna (housing plan) was rejected. But he says he likes Modi’s work and will vote for BJP. He can’t explain why. Sukhwinder Singh of Bansai village complains reservoir water doesn’t flow to the fields anymore and his pleas aren’t heard. “But I’ll always be a BJP voter,” says the 34-year-old. Sometimes voting preference and disappointment with governance seem delinked.The singing stops. Hema arrives in a grey MG Hector. After receiving the obligatory mementos, she sits in a sofa with a demeanour that says, “I would rather be elsewhere,” while local BJP and RLD politicians praise her work, especially expansion and improvement of local roads.In Feb, former PM and the tallest of Jat leaders, Charan Singh – also the grandfather of Jayant Chaudhary who runs RLD – was posthumously bestowed Bharat Ratna by the Modi government. The gesture has presented both sides with an electorally saleable emotional hook.Reading out mostly from a prepared speech, Hema underlines that the former PM deserved Bharat Ratna, which the earlier government had failed to confer. As earlier, the Bharat Ratna reference draws full-throated approval. She speaks about her devotion to Lord Krishna, whose birthplace is Mathura. “Isiliye main yahan baithi hoon (that’s why I am here),” she says while avoiding any reference to the ongoing Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Idgah case, currently in Allahabad high court. The speech lasts barely 12 minutes. The entourage drives away to slogans shouted in the actor-politician’s praise. There are more meetings to attend, voters to woo.","Two-time BJP MP Hema Malini aiming for a hat-trick in Mathura. The temple town has been BJP’s pocket borough since 2014.

Congress plans to redistribute wealth to ‘infiltrators’: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-plans-to-redistribute-wealth-to-infiltrators-pm-modi/articleshow/109482926.cms,"JAIPUR/BANSWARA: Congress is in the grip of “urban Naxals” determined to execute their beliefs and convictions through the party, PM Narendra Modi said on Sunday while drawing a link between opposition party’s pitch for distribution of wealth in its manifesto and his predecessor Manmohan Singh’s Dec 2006 statement that minorities have first right to the country’s resources.“Just look at their manifesto. What they have said is of grave concern and reflects their plan to implement their Maoist vision on the ground. They have said that if Congress gets to form govt, they would conduct a survey of everyone’s assets: how much gold our mothers and sisters have and their value would be computed, including the silver ornaments of our tribal sisters, the assets of govt employees, everything. They don’t stop at that. They go on to say that the assets will be equitably redistributed. Is it acceptable to you? Does govt have the right to expropriate your hard-earned assets? Should the govt seize your assets?” PM said, adding that for women, their gold is not just an ornament but something that is intrinsically linked to their aspiration and self-respect.He connected Congress’s manifesto to Dr Manmohan Singh’s statement about minorities having the first right claim on national resources. “Does this tell you whom the assets are going to be distributed among? It is going to be distributed among those who have more children, among the infiltrators?” Modi said to a loud “no” from the big crowd.“Should the assets you have acquired through your toil go to infiltrators? Is this acceptable to you? This is what Congress has proposed through their manifesto. They would conduct a survey of your assets, seize them and then redistribute them. I must caution you that even the mangal sutras of our mothers and sisters are not safe from this urban Naxal thinking,” he said.Modi had earlier attacked Congress manifesto for its “Mughal mindset”.The PM’s broadsides at Congress came at an election rally in Rajasthan’s Banswara, where Rahul Gandhi had announced five of the party’s “guarantees” on the sidelines of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on March 7.He reiterated his charge about Congress now being in the group of “urban Naxals”. “One of my friends asked those leaving Congress why they were exiting. They said the party was in the clutches of Leftists,” Modi said.He said Congress’s catchphrase “mohabbat ki dukaan” was part of an elaborate subterfuge for the reality of “fear, hunger and corruption being sold in Congress shops”.“I am more like a family member to you. You have known me for the last 23 years. You also know the work my govt has done in the last 10 years. How can you hand over the nation to someone with no track record?” he said, accusing Congress of depriving Rajasthan’s Vagad area of roads, rail and other connectivity during its tenure.“It is Modi’s guarantee to provide you with all these facilities. We have started work to connect Banswara via the Dungarpur-Ratlam railway line. Congress govt left these projects in the doldrums. After June 4, these tasks will be taken up at a faster pace,” he said.He also accused Congress of intimidating Dalits and tribals and spreading fear among minorities. “They are spreading all kinds of lies about democracy, the Constitution and reservation. But India has moved ahead of fear; hence their lies will not work,” Modi said.",Modi draws link between opposition party’s pitch for distribution of wealth in its manifesto. “Does this tell you whom the assets are going to be distributed among?” Modi said to a loud “no” from the big crowd.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109483173,imgsize-929508,width-400,resizemode-4/109483173.jpg"

But after some time, the compounder convinced the family that he could perform the surgery. He then proceeded with the operation,” said Faizul Ansari, the Musrigharari station house officer.Her condition deteriorated soon after she was taken inside the operation theatre. “She was then transferred to another private medical establishment, about 10km away, without the family’s consent. She was declared dead there, after which her body was brought back to the clinic,” said Ansari.The enraged family started protesting outside the clinic and demanded the immediate arrest of medical staff and the clinic’s owner-cum-doctor, who was supposed to conduct the surgery.

"PM Modi makes 'redistribution of wealth' charge against Congress again, but no mention of Muslims this time",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-makes-redistribution-of-wealth-charge-against-congress-again-but-no-mention-of-muslims-this-time/articleshow/109503457.cms,"ALIGARH : Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday accused the Congress again of planning to redistribute people's property if it is voted to power, but stopped short of saying that the wealth would go to Muslims .Addressing an election rally in western Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh, a constituency with a sizeable Muslim population, Modi accused the opposition Congress and the Samajwadi Party of following a policy of “appeasement” and yet doing nothing to uplift the socio-economic condition of the community.In contrast, he cited the enactment of a law against instant triple talaq and an increase in the Haj quota as moves during the BJP government 's term to help the community.On Sunday, the prime minister had triggered a political row by claiming that the Congress manifesto promised “redistribution” of wealth after conducting a survey.Citing former prime minister Manmohan Singh's 2006 remark on Muslims having the “first claim” on the country's resources, Modi said in Rajasthan's Banswara that the Congress was set to hand over the wealth of others to “infiltrators” and “those who have more children"".In Aligarh Monday, Modi repeated the point about redistribution of wealth, saying he wanted to “alert” people about the “intentions” of the Congress and the opposition INDIA bloc.""The Congress “shahzade” (prince) says if his government comes, they will investigate who earns how much and how much property they have. Not only this, he further says the government will take over the property and redistribute it. This is what their election manifesto is saying,"" he claimed, referring to Rahul Gandhi.""Just think, our mothers and daughters have gold. This is ‘stridhan' (women's property). It is considered sacred, even the law protects it. But now they are eyeing a change in law and snatching the property of our mothers and sisters,” he said.“These people have their eyes on their ‘manglasutras',” Modi added, accusing the opposition of trying to “steal” the gold women possessed.He claimed that the opposition planned to conduct a survey of the property owned by salaried people. “If you own two homes, it will snatch one – the Congress will go that far,” he said.""This is Maoist thinking... this is communist thinking. By doing this they have ruined so many countries. Now the Congress and the INDI Alliance want to implement the same policy in India,” the prime minister said.But, unlike in the Rajasthan speech that triggered the opposition charge of “hate speech”, Modi stopped short of saying that the wealth will be distributed among Muslims. He also did not refer to Manmohan Singh's statement made nearly two decade back.He said the Congress and the SP followed a policy of “appeasement” without doing anything for the social and economic progress of Muslims, and also referred to the Pasmanda Muslims – the backward sections among the community.“The lives of a number of daughters were ruined due to triple talaq. We made a law against it and made the future of the daughters secure,"" he said.Attacking the opposition, he said the 'parivarwadi' people have created empires by “looting” people and not giving anything to the poor from their “immense wealth”.“Now their eyes have fallen on the property of people of the country. The Congress considers it as their birthright to loot people's wealth,"" he charged.The PM said the people of Aligarh had put a lock on dynastic politics, corruption and the appeasement practised by the two “shahzade”.The reference was to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, who are fighting the Lok Sabha elections as allies.He referred to law and order in Uttar Pradesh and the security situation on the country's borders earlier when “our brave sons were martyred every day”.“Today all this has stopped. Earlier, terrorists used to explode bombs, serial blasts took place. Even Ayodhya and Kashi were not spared. Bomb blasts used to happen every day in big cities, now there has been a full stop on serial bomb attacks,"" he said.""What we did in 10 years is just a trailer, we have to do a lot of work,” he said.The prime minister said he will work constantly for the country. “Modi is born for 'mehnat' (hard work), not 'mauj' (enjoyment).”Aligarh will vote on April 26 in the second phase of the Lok Sabha elections. UP has 25 parliamentary constituencies, the highest number among all states.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the Congress of planning to redistribute people's property if it is voted to power.

Their adoption of pioneering practices to reduce carbon footprints and embrace eco-friendly solutions plays a crucial role in fostering a more environmentally conscious plane.Vehicular emissions are a major cause of air pollution in urban areas.Various research suggests, they contribute 20-30% of PM 2.5 at breathing level, and 8% of total greenhouse gas emissions in India come from the transport sector. In Delhi, vehicular emissions exceed 30%.Worldwide the transport sector accounts for a quarter of total emissions, out of which road transport accounts for three-quarters of transport emissions.Passenger vehicles are the largest chunk of this, releasing about 45% of CO2.Sustainable transport options such as shared rides are a better solution for urban cities.

Excise case: Delhi court reserves order on BRS leader K Kavitha's bail plea in CBI case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/excise-case-delhi-court-reserves-order-on-brs-leader-k-kavithas-bail-plea-in-cbi-case/articleshow/109500904.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Rouse Avenue court of Delhi on Monday reserved the order on the bail plea moved by Bharatiya Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha in connection with CBI case related to the excise policy case.Special Judge Kaveri Baweja on Monday fixed May 2 for pronouncement of order in the matter.The plea further stated that the ruling party at the Centre is using investigative agencies to publicly connect the petitioner to the Delhi excise policy so that further coercive actions can be taken against her.The investigating agencies are well aware that there is no substance in the allegation of the petitioner's involvement in the alleged scam. The intention behind the purported investigation against the petitioner is not to ascertain her involvement in the alleged scam, since it is painfully clear that none exists.The political masterminds are well aware that if the petitioner can be connected to the alleged scam, it will bring her, and by logical implication, her father, the erstwhile Chief Minister of Telangana, into disrepute. The political mileage gained from such actions can be used in the general elections scheduled for 2024. This is the sole and singular motive of the purported investigation. This is political propaganda at its shameful lowest, even by the not-so-high standards in Indian politics, stated bail plea.BRS leader K Kavitha was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) last week. She was arrested by CBI while in judicial custody in the ED case.Advocate Nitesh Rana, along with Deepak Nagar and Mohit Rao, appeared for the K Kavitha in the matter.Earlier, the CBI remand application stated that ""Kavitha Kalvakuntla was required to be arrested in the instant case to conduct her custodial interrogation for confronting her with the evidence and witnesses to unearth the larger conspiracy hatched among the accused, suspect persons regarding the formulation and implementation of the Excise Policy, as well as to establish the money trail of ill-gotten money generated and to establish the role of other accused/suspect persons, including public servants, as well as to unearth the facts which are in her exclusive knowledge.""The directorate of enforcement (ED) arrested K Kavitha, MLC, Telangana legislative council, on March 15, in the case of the alleged liquor policy scam.The CBI inquiry was recommended based on the findings of the Delhi Chief Secretary's report filed in July showing prima facie violations of the GNCTD Act 1991, Transaction of Business Rules (ToBR)-1993, Delhi Excise Act-2009, and Delhi Excise Rules-2010, officials said.The ED and the CBI had alleged that irregularities were committed while modifying the excise policy, undue favours were extended to licence holders, the licence fee was waived or reduced and the L-1 licence was extended without the competent authority's approval. The beneficiaries diverted ""illegal"" gains to the accused officials and made false entries in their books of account to evade detection, the probe agencies said.As per the allegations, the excise department had decided to refund the earnest money deposit of about Rs 30 crore to a successful tenderer against the set rules.Even though there was no enabling provision, a waiver on tendered licence fees was allowed from December 28, 2021, to January 27, 2022, due to Covid-19, the probe agency said adding that there was an alleged loss of Rs 144.36 crore to the exchequer.",BRS leader K Kavitha was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) last week.

EC declines comment on PM's Rajasthan poll speech

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday reiterated his charge that Congress, if voted to power, will conduct wealth survey to seize the assets of people and take away their life-long savings. PM Modi had on Sunday said if Congress comes to power, it would redistribute wealth of people and cited former PM Manmohan Singh's remark that the minority community had the first claim on the country's resources.'Your Mangalsutra will not be safe under Congress rule,' PM Modi said at a rally in Aligarh and claimed that the Congress manifesto says they will calculate the gold with mothers and sisters, get information about it and then distribute that property.""I want to warn my countrymen. Congress and INDI alliance have their eyes on your earnings and your property. The 'Shehzada' of Congress says that if their government comes to power, they will investigate who earns how much, who has how many property. Our mothers and sisters have gold. It is 'stree dhan', it is considered sacred, the law also protects it. Now these people's eyes are on the 'Mangalsutra' of women. Their intention is to steal the gold of mothers and sisters,"" PM Modi said.""If you have an ancestral home in your village and you also purchase a small flat in your city for future of your children, they will take away one of the two. This is Maovadi thinking, this is the thinking of communists. By doing this they have already ruined many countries. Now the Congress and INDI alliance want to implement the same policy in India,"" the Prime Minister added.Congress Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Monday said that the party filed a petition with the EC against PM Modi's remarks hours after Kharge sought an appointment with Narendra Modi to ""educate him"" about its poll promise document.""We respect the office he (PM Modi) holds; he is as much our PM as yours or the BJP . The higher the position he holds, the more the obligation he holds to exercise restraint. Unfortunately, the statement he quoted, it is seriously objectionable. We can never expect this from the PM. We would pray to him with folded hands to withdraw these comments and clarify,"" said Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi on party delegation's meeting with ECI over PM Modi's purported remarks.AICC general secretary in-charge of the organisation K C Venugopal said copies of the manifesto would be sent to the Prime Minister by its party leaders and Lok Sabha candidates.""Narendra Modi made a statement that was not befitting the post of Prime Minister. How can a Prime Minister lie about everything and spread such fake news? His speech yesterday makes it clear that he is the one who lies the most in this country,"" Venugopal said.Attacking Modi, the Congress leader said, ""AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge has sought an appointment with the PM to educate him about our manifesto. We will give him a copy of our manifesto. All our Congress workers and candidates will also send him a copy of our manifesto.""The Election Commission declined to comment on remarks made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his poll speech in Rajasthan.

Centre assures swift action on Karnataka's drought relief plea in Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-assures-swift-action-on-karnatakas-drought-relief-plea-in-supreme-court/articleshow/109499787.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre informed the Supreme Court on Monday that its will resolve expeditiously issues related to Karnataka government's plea seeking financial assistance for drought relief and something will happen by April 29.Attorney general R Venkataramani, representing the Centre apprised the court that the Election Commission has allowed the Union government to deal with the issue and something will happen before next Monday (April 29).AG Venkataramalso apprised the bench of justices BR Gavai and Sandeep Mehta it will be done expeditiously and no argument is needed now.Justice Gavai observing the federal structure remarked that this has to happen amicably.The court adjourned the matter for further hearing on April 19.The court was hearing Karnataka government plea seeking financial assistance for drought relief. The Karnataka government was represented by senior advocate Kapil Sibal. Karnataka Government, in the plea filed through advocate DL Chidananda, urged the top court to direct the Centre to forthwith take a final decision and release the financial assistance from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) to the state.The plea also sought to declare that the action of the government in not releasing the financial assistance for drought arrangement as per the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) is Ex-Facie violative of the fundamental rights of the people of the State of Karnataka guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.The Karnataka government said that the impugned action of the Central government in denying financial assistance to the State is ex-facie violative of the fundamental rights of the people of Karnataka guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Further, the impugned action of the Central government is violative of the statutory scheme of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the manual for drought management and the guidelines on Constitution and administration of the state disaster response fund and National Disaster Response Fund, the state government said.Karnataka government submitted that under the Manual for Drought Management, the Central Government is required to make a final decision on the assistance to the State from the NDRF within a month of the receipt of the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT).The plea said that Karnataka is reeling under severe drought, affecting the lives of its citizens. ""For the Kharif 2023 season as a whole, after fulfilling all the Indicators of the Manual for Drought Management 2020,a total of 223 out of 236 taluks are declared as drought-affected during Kharif 2023 with 196 taluks categorized as severely affected and the remaining 27 categorized as moderately affected.The southwest monsoon (SWM) set in over the coast of Karnataka on June 10, 2023, as against the normal onset of June 5. The monsoon gradually advanced thereafter and covered the entire State on June 24, as against the normal coverage date of June 15. The delayed onset coupled with sluggish progress of SWM during June resulted in Malnad districts and North interior Karnataka districts with large agriculture land recording large deficit rainfall,"" the petition said.""After strictly adhering to the procedure outlined in the Manual for Drought Management-2020, Karnataka notified 223 out of 236 taluks as drought-affected. Cumulatively for the Kharif 2023 season, the agriculture and horticulture crop loss have been reported in more than 48 lakh hectares with the estimated loss (cost of cultivation) of Rs.35,162 crore. The State Government has sought Rs.18,171.44 crore under National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), through three Drought Relief Memorandums submitted in September-November 2023 i.e., Rs.4663.12 crore towards crop loss input subsidy, Rs. 12577.9 crore towards gratuitous relief to families whose livelihood has been seriously affected due to drought, Rs.566.78 crore for addressing the shortage of drinking water relief then and Rs.363.68 crore towards cattle care. Crops have failed, and reduced water availability has affected domestic, agricultural, and industrial-hydel energy water supply,"" the petition added.Karnataka Government said that agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for a large section of the State, hence present drought situation has damaged crops and affected livestock, leading to lower yields, reduced income for farmers, increased food prices and increased shortage of water in urban and rural areas as well due to reduced groundwater levels and shortage or no water storage in lakes as well as reservoirs.""The total estimated loss due to crop damage in the State is Rs. 35,162.05 Crore and the assistance sought from the Government of India under NDRF is Rs. 18,171.44 Crore. In terms of the Disaster Management Act, of 2005, the Union of India is under obligation to render financial assistance to the State Governments.However, despite the calamity being of a severe nature, despite the constitution and visit of an Inter-Ministerial Central Team(IMCT) in October for a first-hand assessment of the humanitarian needs towards response and relief of immediate/temporary nature, damages caused and relief work carried out by the state and submission of their report for allocation of funds from NDRF, despite the submission of the sub-committee of the National Executive Committee's report for allocation of the funds under NDRF to the High-Level Committee(HLC) and despite repeated requests by the State, the Union of India has not convened the High-Level Committee to take action on the Sub-Committee of the National Executive Committee's report on the Memorandums submitted by the State Government seeking financial assistance, which has impaired the fundamental right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India to its people,"" the petition said.","The court was hearing Karnataka government plea seeking financial assistance for drought relief. Karnataka Government, in the plea filed through advocate DL Chidananda, urged the top court to direct the Centre to take a final decision and release the financial assistance to the state.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109499928,imgsize-2075401,width-400,resizemode-4/109499928.jpg"
