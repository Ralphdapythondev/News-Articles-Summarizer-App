"'ED team has reached my house to arrest me,' claims AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-team-has-reached-my-house-to-arrest-me-claims-aap-mla-amanatullah-khan/articleshow/112979028.cms,"NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan on Monday claimed that Enforcement Directorate officials reached his residence to arrest him. Khan is under central probing agency's lens in connection with a money laundering case linked to the Waqf Board.Taking to X, the AAP leader said, "" It is currently 7 am and the ED officials have come to arrest me in my house. My mother-in-law has cancer and had surgery just four days ago; she is also at my house.I have written to them and responded to every notice they sent. Their intention is to arrest me and hinder our work.""""For the past two years, they have been continuously harassing me with false cases, creating some trouble or the other every day. It's not just me; my entire party is being targeted. The Chief Minister was in jail, Sanjay Singh was in jail, and Satendra Jain is still in jail. Now they want to arrest me too. Their sole aim is to break us and our party. I request you all to pray for me,"" he added.Khan further alleged that despite central agency's clean chit, a case has been filed against him. Khan also said he has been replying to all the notices being sent by the agency. But a team is here to arrest him on a search warrant, he said.""This case is entirely fake, and it is also being investigated by the CBI and now the ED. This case has been ongoing since 2016, and the CBI itself has stated that there was no corruption or transaction involved. Despite this, they have filed a false case against me, among many others. This is one of those cases, and they have come to arrest me for it, "" he further said.Several Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders, including Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh, hit out at the BJP government at the Centre, saying agencies are targeting those who raised their voice against the ruling party.On X, Sisodia said the only work left for the ED is to ""suppress every voice raised against the BJP and break it"". Those who do not break, are arrested and put in jail, he alleged.Singh claimed that the ED has no evidence against Khan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""dictatorship"" and the ED's ""hooliganism"" continue, he alleged.The money laundering case against Khan stems from a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR and three Delhi Police complaints.The Enforcement Directorate had alleged in a statement that ""illegal recruitment"" of staff took place in the Waqf Board and ""illegal personal gains"" were made by unfairly leasing the Waqf Board properties during Khan's chairmanship from 2018 to 2022.",Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan is under central probing agency's lens in connection with a money laundering case linked to the Waqf Board.

600mm July-August rain mark not breached in last 30 yrs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/600mm-july-aug-rain-mark-not-breached-in-last-30-yrs/articleshow/112978223.cms,"July and Aug are the rainiest months of the year in India and the most crucial for kharif sowing . However, in recent decades, countrywide rainfall in these two months has been lower than the average of previous decades.This statistic puts the situation in perspective: July-Aug rainfall crossed the 600mm mark in 28 years from 1901 to 1994, that is, once every 3.4 years on average.However, the 600mm-mark hasn't been breached even once in the last 30 years.""In the last 20-30 years, we have barely seen what can be called a strongly wet year where the monsoon has been clearly above 10% of normal,"" said Roxy Mathew Koll , a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology .A look at the 30-year average rainfall in July-Aug brings out the decreasing trend clearly. Monsoon rainfall in July-Aug has averaged 530.2mm in the last 30 years (1995-2024).This is way lower than the averages in the previous 30-year periods - 543mm during 1965-1994, 587.1mm in 1935-1964 and 559.3 in 1905-1934.One explanation that is given for this trend is that the monsoon behaves in a cyclical manner over ""epochs"" lasting around 30-40 years.The last epoch of decreasing monsoon rainfall began around the 1970s and was preceded by an epoch of higher rainfall. We are currently supposed to be moving into an epoch of higher rainfall, Koll says.However, some experts believe this hypothesis worked well in the previous century but may be running into problems in recent times. ""We keep saying that we are coming out of the weak monsoon epoch but we haven't seen any clear evidence of it yet. It has been a long epoch and we are still in the dip,"" says Koll.Koll further adds that there are certain regions within the country - the Uttar Pradesh-Jharkhand belt and Kerala, for instance - which are showing a stark decline in rainfall in recent decades and this could be linked to climate change .""Climate change patterns are getting more regional. Earlier, the epochal and decadal patterns were much clearer,"" Koll says.""Now, these patterns seem to be getting disrupted. The all-India picture is an aggregate of the regional trends and the decrease in monsoon rainfall in some regions may well be getting reflected in the countrywide trends,"" Koll adds.","In the last 20-30 years, we have barely seen a strongly wet year where the monsoon has been clearly above 10% of normal. Monsoon rainfall in July-Aug has averaged 530.2mm in the last 30 years. This is way lower than the averages in the previous 30-year periods.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112978432,imgsize-17510,width-400,resizemode-4/112978432.jpg"

There is an agreement (with India) and legal processes.It is better not to speculate,"" he told reporters.On whether the interim govt was aware of Hasina's whereabouts in India, the foreign affairs adviser said, ""It is better to ask India about it.""Bangladesh has revoked Hasina and her kin's diplomatic passports, raising questions about whether she can stay in India any longer and whether she faces possible extradition. The approval for the ex-PM to enter India after she fled Bangladesh in the wake of a student-led uprising last month had been granted at short notice, according to officials at the Indian ministry of external affairs.Hossain said in response to a question on MoUs with India that such agreements were not legally binding, and there was always scope for reviewing them in national interest. He confirmed the interim govt's chief adviser Muhammad Yunus will attend 79th UNGA session this month.","Interim govt will do whatever it takes to get deposed PM Sheikh Hasina back home to face justice, foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain says.

New-age brands wooing Gen Zs bag VC funding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-age-brands-wooing-gen-zs-bag-vc-funding/articleshow/112975728.cms,"MUMBAI: India's new-age consumer brands are piquing the interest of venture capital investors. The brands - which have mushroomed over the past few years and most of which are less than 10 years old - have been able to tap into evolving consumer demands and identify gaps in the market, something traditional companies may be late in recognising.Be it the five-year-old luggage brand Mokobara, young fashion brand Snitch or older incumbents like Sugar Cosmetics and Boat, these companies have managed to cater to the tastes of the fashion-forward Gen Z and millennials while also localising their assortment to suit desi nuances.""The big brands which existed were averaging people's requirements. Consumers are demanding more, they want more than average and are willing to pay a premium for that. There is now a fairly large chunk of people who have a reasonable amount of discretionary income,"" V S Kannan Sitaram, co-founder and partner at Fireside ventures, told TOI.The VC fund, for instance, recently invested in Gurgaon-based Moxie Beauty which makes haircare products for Indian hair type, habits and weather - a proposition which global brands hardly offer.Several new-age brands like Mokobara, Sid's Farm, Foxtale, Bummer, and ICON have raised funding from investors this year. Last month, Accel led a $9 million funding in luggage brand Uppercase. New-age direct-to-consumer brands have already pocketed over $400 million from investors so far in 2024, data sourced from market research firm Tracxn showed. Since 2014, the segment has collectively bagged more than $5 billion in funding, the data showed.Analysts at Bain & Company describe these brands as ""insurgent"", with higher adoption among Gen Zs who prefer buying from digital-first brands. ""The increase in India's income and consumption has led to the rise of insurgent brands - young, new brands that cater to the underserved needs of the emerging affluent consumer class. These brands are already growing faster than their respective categories - by approximately three times,"" said Hariharan Premkumar, managing director and head of India at DSG Consumer Partners, which has funded new-age companies like Farmley, Go Desi and SuperBottoms. Such brands are trying to create new categories for Indian consumers who are increasingly seeking more solutions as well as products which can cater to different needs and occasions.With consumers demanding more, there is also an opportunity for them to premiumise. ""The premium segment is underserved and offers a good beachhead for insurgent brands to build from there,"" said Premkumar. In fact, estimates suggest that premiumisation and new category creation will account for about 50% of overall consumption growth by 2030, providing ample scope for new-age brands to capitalise on.With the emergence of quick commerce platforms, brands can also reach consumers faster, said Maanav Sagar, partner at Bharat Founders Fund.","India's new-age consumer brands are piquing the interest of venture capital investors.

Delay in heinous crime trials raises questions about sensitivity: Prez Murmu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delay-in-heinous-crime-trials-raises-questions-about-sensitivity-prez-murmu/articleshow/112974909.cms,"NEW DELHI: President Droupadi Murmu on Sunday said people feel the judicial process lacks sensitivity when verdicts in heinous crimes like those against women, including rape, is long delayed and said every judge and judicial officer has the ""moral responsibility to respect dharma, truth and justice"".Speaking at the valedictory ceremony of the national conference of district judiciary, Murmu said it had become a part of social life that those who commit crimes roam around freely and fearlessly, while the victims cower in fear of court cases and reprisal from the criminals.In what could be a reflection on liberal bail policy adopted by the Supreme Court and HCs by invigorating the 'bail is the rule and jail is the exception' principle, the Prez said, ""Those who suffer from their crimes live in fear as if those poor people have committed some crime.""She said commoners are afraid of courts and approach the judiciary for grievance redressal as a last resort. ""Often, they tolerate injustice silently because they feel that fighting for justice can make their lives more miserable. For them, going away from the village to the court even once becomes a cause of great mental and financial pressure,"" she said.""In such a situation, many people cannot even imagine the pain that poor people experience due to the culture of adjournment. Every possible measure should be taken to change this situation,"" she told the gathering of SC judges, HC chief justices and over 800 judicial officers.Murmu said the Constitution has provided for grassroots level democracy through panchayats and municipalities and asked the top judges whether they could devise a justice system at the grassroots level. The Gram Nyayalaya Act, which came into force on Oct 2, 2009, is yet to be fully implemented. A PIL seeking implementation of the Act in letter and spirit is pending in Supreme Court.The Prez was concerned about the future of children of women prisoners and said the lives of these youngsters must be taken care of to ensure that they achieve their full potential. ""Taking measures to improve their thinking and mental health, providing them with useful skills for living, and providing them free legal aid should also be our priority,"" she added.She said pendency was a huge challenge for the judiciary and expressed dismay that many cases were yet to be decided even three decades after their institution. She suggested holding of frequent Lok Adalats to settle maximum number of cases amicably between contesting parties.""District-level courts determine the image of the judiciary in the minds of crores of citizens. Therefore, providing justice to the people through district courts with sensitivity and promptness and at a low cost is the basis of the success of our judiciary,"" she said.","President Droupadi Murmu said people feel judicial process lacks sensitivity.

Increasing our disposal-to-filing ratio hinges on attracting skilled personnel. At district level, vacancies in judicial personnel stand at 28% and of non-judicial staff at 27%. For disposal to outweigh the institution of cases, courts must work beyond the capacity of 71-100%.""""Time has come to think of national integration by recruiting members to judicial services across narrow walls of regionalism and state-centred selections,"" he added. Centre's AIJS, proposed in 2015, had virtually no takers, as only Haryana and Mizoram govts and HCs of Tripura and Sikkim had favoured it. Others opposed it on grounds of linguistic barrier and federalism.The CJI said though women were outnumbering men in recent recruitments of judicial officers across states, sadly only 6.7% district court infrastructure are female friendly. ""Is this acceptable in a nation where basic level of recruitment in some states sees over 60-70% women joining?"" he asked & said judiciary's focus areas were on increasing accessibility measures which could be understood by carrying out infrastructure audits, opening medical facilities and creches in court and technological projects.""Inclusivity in judiciary is a reflection of our broader commitment to equality and justice. Some key measures are developing a comprehensive framework for gender equality in decision making; adopting measures to recruit, retain and promote members from diverse and vulnerable groups; and monitoring impact of gender equality initiatives,"" he said.He said panel on reducing arrears of cases had devised an action plan for reducing pendency through case management. Stages of tackling pendency are - preparatory stage of forming district level case management committees to identify target cases, undated cases, and reconstruction of records; resolve cases which have been pending for 10-20 years, 20-30 years and over 30 years.He said from Jan to June 2025, judiciary shall execute third phase of clearing the backlog of cases pending for over a decade in courts.",Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said district courts working with 30% vacancy in judicial officers had achieved 95% disposal rate.

HISAR/KOLKATA: Five men associated with a cow vigilante group have been arrested and two boys below 18 detained for allegedly beating a 24-year-old migrant worker from Bengal named Sabir Malik to death in Haryana 's Charkhi Dadri district on Aug 28. The lynching happened on the suspicion that migrant workers were eating beef in the village.CM Nayab Singh Saini condemned the crime on Saturday, saying; ""Mob lynching is unacceptable.We've implemented strict laws for cow safety and preservation. There's no compromise when it comes to protecting cows. People are very devoted, and villagers often react strongly when they hear about cow slaughter. I urge them to exercise caution and avoid such actions.""Nuh MLA Aftab Ahmed of Congress criticised BJP govt. ""There is nothing called law and order in Haryana.

His body reached his home on Friday. The West Bengal Migrant Workers Welfare Board has reached out to his family and has assured them of all help.On Aug 27, rumours circulated about migrant labourers from Assam and Bengal eating beef in Hansawas Khurd village.

"Pune: Sculptor behind 'Statue of Unity' working on 100-foot Sambhaji Maharaj statue, says PCMC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-sculptor-behind-statue-of-unity-working-on-100-foot-sambhaji-maharaj-statue-says-pcmc/articleshow/112966880.cms,"Statue of Unity

PUNE: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Commissioner Shekhar Singh has refuted the reports of cracks on some parts of the Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj statue that have arrived in the city. Singh said that the renowned Indian sculptor Ram Sutar , who had designed the ‘Statue of Unity’ in Gujarat, has been appointed as the sculptor for the 100-foot statue that will be installed in the Moshi area in Pimpri Chinchwad. IIT Bombay was also roped in to look into the structural stability of it.Singh said that the videos circulating on social media platforms are ‘an act of mischief’ and the reports of cracks are false. It may be noted that the civic body will be spending more than Rs 40 Crore for the project, and the statue will be installed on around 2.5 acres of land near the PMRDA’s exhibition hall located in the Moshi area to also make it visible for the citizens travelling from the Pune-Nashik highway . The NCP (SCP) leaders and several activists of the city have questioned the quality of the statue and they have demanded an inquiry into the matter.Tushar Kamthe, the city president of NCP (SCP) Pimpri Chinchwad, who on Saturday visited the fabrication godown where the parts of the statue are kept, said, “The wastewater is flowing under the parts of the statue kept in the fabrication godown. Besides, there are cracks to a ‘Mojadi’ (a type of Indian shoe) of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and other parts of the statue which are clearly visible.”The municipal commissioner said that till now only the pedestal work is completed and the installation of the statue is yet to start. “The design of the statue has been finalised by IIT Bombay, renowned sculptor Ram Sutar, and PCMC . Currently, the bronze parts which are made in the fabrication centre of Ram Sutar in Delhi are being transported to his fabrication shed in the city. Once all parts arrive, the installation process will begin,” he said.He further said that IIT Bombay will also do a concurrent evaluation of the structure and a full-time renowned structural engineering firm has also been appointed by PCMC for the project so that the works related to the strength of the statue and pedestal are carried out without any error. It may be noted that earlier the statue was being installed at Vinayaknagar in the same area and some works were also carried out there but later, the civic body changed the plan and it was shifted to PMRDA’s land to make it also visible to people travelling via Pune-Nashik highway. However, the municipal corporation has already paid around Rs 5 Crore to the contractor for the works that were carried our in the earlier proposed site which has now gone into a waste. The municipal commissioner earlier had said that, the base work which was completed earlier can be used for some other project and it will not go waste.","The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Commissioner Shekhar Singh has refuted the reports of cracks on some parts of the Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj statue that have arrived in the city.

So far, no fresh officer recruited under this new regime has joined work as the first batch is still undergoing training and railways isn’t funding enough takers as well.Sources said the Indian Railways had placed an indent for recruiting 150 personnel with the Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ) under the Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS) in 2022.But only 130 candidates were selected. While around 40 of them reported for training at LBSNAA at Mussoorie, the remaining opted for extra-ordinary leave (EOL). Those who reported at LBSNAA are undergoing the final phase of training at a railway institute in Lucknow.Though officials said successful candidates taking OEL is normal as they prepare for more exams and without salary, the second round of recruitment in 2023 has not found enough takers. While the railways had placed an indent for another 150 personnel under IRMS, barely 84 have been selected, sources said.The govt had approved IRMS by clubbing earlier eight railway services, including engineering, traffic, accounts and personnel.TOI has learnt that the delay in appointment and lukewarm response have caused some shortage of manpower across zones, prompting the railways allowed re-engagement of retired junior railway officers as consultants on an ""exigency basis"" till Dec 2026 to address the staff crunch .In a recent letter, the Railway Board said that re-engagement of retired railway officers as consultants is aimed at addressing the challenges faced by “Zonal Railways due to vacant posts” and to ensure the continuity of operations and services.These consultants will be assigned responsibilities such as inspections, supervision and drawing. “They will be discharged immediately upon the joining of a selected candidate through UPSC or other departmental selection processes,” it said, indicating the delay in getting personnel under the IRMS regime.Meanwhile, there are reports that some recruits under IRMS have written to the Railway Board amid speculation of the national transporter demerging the services into technical and non-technical branches.",Railways seems to be in a fix to get enough fresh technical manpower.

People consider every judge in the country as God. Every judge and judicial officer of our country has the moral responsibility to respect dharma, truth and justice. At the district level, this moral responsibility is the lighthouse of the judiciary. The district-level courts determine the image of the judiciary in the minds of crores of citizens. Therefore, providing justice to the people through the district courts with sensitivity and promptness and at a low cost is the basis of the success of our judiciary,"" said the President, who also unveiled the flag and insignia of the Supreme Court on the occasion.While noting that in recent years there have been significant improvements in the availability of infrastructure, facilities, training and human resources of the judiciary at the district level, the President highlighted that pendency and backlog of cases is a big challenge before the judiciary.She stressed the need to ponder upon the serious issue of cases remaining pending for as long as over 32 years.The President emphasised that programmes such as special Lok Adalat week should be organised more frequently, which will help in tackling the pendency of cases.The President further said there are many challenges before our judiciary which will require coordinated efforts by all stakeholders to resolve them. ""For example, the judiciary, government and police administration should work together to find solutions to issues related to evidence and witnesses,"" she said.The President said that when court decisions in a heinous crime like rape come after a generation has passed, the common man feels that the judicial process lacks sensitivity. She stated that it is a sad aspect of our social life that, in some cases, people with resources continue to roam around fearlessly and freely even after committing crimes. Those who suffer from their crimes live in fear as if those poor people have committed some crime, she added.The President further said that the poor people from villages are afraid to go to court. ""They become a participant in the justice process of the court only under great compulsion. Often they tolerate injustice silently because they feel that fighting for justice can make their lives more miserable. For them, going away from the village to the court even once becomes a cause of great mental and financial pressure. In such a situation, many people cannot even imagine the pain that poor people experience due to the culture of adjournment. Every possible measure should be taken to change this situation,"" the President added.The President also noted that the SC has ordered the implementation of the provision of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita with retrospective effect. Under this, there is a provision to release first-time accused and those who have served one-third of the prescribed maximum imprisonment period, on bail.

"North India likely to see heavy rainfall in September, cautions IMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/north-india-likely-to-see-heavy-rainfall-in-sept-cautions-imd/articleshow/112957620.cms,"NEW DELHI: Continuing its Aug trend, monsoon rainfall in most parts of the country in Sept is likely to be ' above normal ', with some states, including Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and parts of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, expecting extremely heavy rainfall that could lead to floods and landslides, India Meteorological Department said Saturday. India reported 16% more than 'normal' rainfall in Aug, the fifth highest in the month since 2001 and 29th highest since 1901.Good rains (287mm) in Aug, however, could not bring down the overall temperature during the month as it reported the highest average minimum temperature and fourth-highest average mean temperature since 1901.This can be attributed to variation in spatial distribution of rainfall - northwest India got 32% more than 'normal' rainfall in Aug (second highest in the month since 2001), whereas south peninsula received merely around 1% more than normal rains in the month.Though the country as a whole is likely to get 'above-normal' rainfall in Sept, in certain areas - north Bihar, northeast UP, most parts of northeast India, extreme northwest India and many parts of south peninsular India - it is likely to be 'below normal'. Overall, the four-month (June-Sept) monsoon season, as predicted in mid-April, will be logged as 'above-normal' rainfall activity.Good rains in Aug, mainly in 'monsoon core' zone (rainfed areas), already had its positive impact on kharif sowing. Total acreage of the season is well on course to cross 'normal' (average of past five years) sown area, indicating possibility of a higher foodgrain output in the crop year. Good rains in monsoon season also mean adequate soil moisture and enough water in reservoirs to feed rabi (winter-sown) crops.La Nina phenomenon has, however, not yet formed. It is now expected to be formed by Sept-end, but it won't have any effect on the current rainy season as the summer monsoon may, by that time, be in its withdrawal phase.La Nina during Sept-Nov generally weakens the northeast (winter) monsoon in southeast India.""It is, however, too early to predict its impact. We would be able to say anything on this by Sept-end. We'll also see how the La Nina will lead to cyclonic conditions,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD.On the reasons for heavy rainfall in Aug, he said six low-pressure systems formed during the month (out of that one became a deep depression and another a cyclone) could be one of the major influencing factors. Aug generally sees an increase in trend for the 'break' (pause) days of monsoon, but such a phase was missing this time and the month could see one of the highest number of active days in the recent past. Earlier such high numbers of active days were observed in 2020 and 2022.Mohapatra said, ""Above-normal maximum (day) temperatures are likely over most parts of the country, except for some areas in northwest India, south peninsular India, and some pockets of east-central India, where normal to below-normal maximum temperatures are likely.""","Some states, including Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and parts of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, expecting extremely heavy rainfall that could lead to floods and landslides.

National Security Guard (NSG)

Para SF (Para Special Forces)

Garud Commando Force

Ghatak Force

COBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action)

Special Frontier Force (SFF)

Special forces , or Special Operations Forces (SOF), are elite military units designed for high-stakes missions that require specialised skills and tactics. Emerging in the early 20th century and expanding significantly during World War II, these forces have become vital for disruptive operations, including sabotage and covert strikes. Their primary role is to handle high-risk situations that demand precise and strategic intervention.Established by the Indian Navy in 1987, MARCOS excels in direct actions, special reconnaissance, amphibious warfare, and counter-terrorism.Known for their rigorous training and mental toughness, MARCOS are often referred to as the ""Dadiwala Fauj"" (Bearded Army) due to their disguises.India's premier counter-terrorism force, the NSG, is tasked with VIP security, anti-sabotage checks, and neutralising threats to critical infrastructure. With a demanding selection process that sees a 70–80% dropout rate, the NSG is split into the Special Action Group (SAG) and the Special Rangers Group (SRG).Formed in 1966, the Para SF is part of the Indian Army 's elite Parachute Regiment. These commandos specialise in rapid deployment behind enemy lines to disrupt and destroy key defensive positions.Created in 2004, the Garud Commando Force is the Indian Air Force’s special operations unit. It boasts the longest training period among Indian special forces—three years. Garud commandos are responsible for protecting air force bases, conducting rescue operations, and supporting air operations.Operating within the Indian Army, the Ghatak Force consists of elite infantry platoons that lead assaults and spearhead strikes. Each battalion has a Ghatak Platoon, composed of highly motivated and physically fit soldiers trained for counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations.A specialised unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), COBRA was formed to combat Naxalism. It is one of the few Indian forces exclusively trained in guerrilla warfare and has played a significant role in countering Naxalite groups.Established in 1962, the SFF was created for covert operations behind enemy lines, particularly in conflicts with China. Operating under India's external intelligence agency, RAW, the SFF reports directly to the Prime Minister and the Directorate General of Security.","Special forces, or Special Operations Forces, are elite military units designed for high-stakes missions that require specialised skills and tactics.

5 rape-murder cases a week reported during '17-'22: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-rape-murder-cases-a-week-reported-during-17-22-study/articleshow/112974698.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid continuing outrage over the brutal rape-murder of a doctor at a govt run hospital in Kolkata and recent cases of sexual assault in other states, a new report that analysed National Crime Records Bureau data on cases of rape/gangrape followed by murder said 1,551 cases were reported under this category between 2017 and 2022.The highest number of cases of rape/gangrape with murder at 294 were reported in 2018 and the lowest at 219 in 2020.The number was 223 in 2017; 283 in 2019; 284 in 2021 and 248 in 2022. State-wise data for six years showed that UP reported the highest cases (280) followed by Madhya Pradesh (207), Assam (205), Maharashtra (155) and Karnataka (79).The analysis, carried out by non-profit Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, highlighted that going by the total number of 1,551 cases, this works out to an annual average of a little more than 258 cases. ""In other words, on an average, almost five cases (4.9) of rape/gangrape with murder were reported every week between 2017-2022,"" the report said. The NCRB in its annual 'Crime In India' report began reporting statistics about rape/gangrape followed by murder as a separate category from 2017.As far as outcomes go, out of the 308 cases in which trial was completed, a little less than two-thirds (65%) of cases (200) resulted in conviction. In more than a third of cases, the outcome was one of discharge (6%) or acquittal of the accused (28%). The rate of conviction was lowest in 2017 (57.89%) and highest in 2021 (75%). It was 69% in 2022.NCRB's data showed that the number of rape/gangrape with murder cases before trial courts increased year on year during the period under study. The total number of cases - backlog plus new cases sent for trial - was at its lowest (574 cases) in 2017 and steadily increased to 1,333 by 2022 which is an increase of 132%.CHRI director Venkatesh Nayak said, ""It is extremely worrisome that in a large number of cases, the police filed a final report instead of a chargesheet after the completion of investigation. As many as 140 cases of rape/gangrape with murder were closed with a final report during the six-year period with 97 of these closed due to insufficient evidence to try the accused for rape/gangrape with murder.""NCRB captures this data with regard to cases where the police investigation was not able to unearth sufficient evidence to try the accused or where the accused remained untraced, or the complaint was found to be false or where the case ended as a mistake of fact or law or the issue was in the nature of civil dispute.In four of the six years under study, the rate of chargesheeting was above 90% even during the pandemic years. The success rate dipped below 90% in 2018 (87%) and more recently in 2022 (85%). However, the findings also show that the police have not been able to complete investigation in 32-49% cases of rape/gangrape with murder during this period.","The highest number of cases of rape/gangrape with murder at 294 were reported in 2018. The number was 223 in 2017; 283 in 2019; 284 in 2021 and 248 in 2022.

What is stopping them (the Kerala government)? What is haunting you? Because you are part and parcel of that...it is something you want to hide because your people are involved,"" Nadda remarked, news agency ANI quoted.He further urged Kerala's chief minister to clarify the involvement of Communist leaders, saying, ""I am very sorry to say that the Hema Committee report very specifically said that Communist party leaders are involved. The chief minister should come out and tell what really happened.""Nadda's comments were made during an event in Palakkad where he interacted with various prominent figures from Kerala.The Hema Committee, led by former high court judge K Hema, was established following a high-profile sexual assault case in 2017 involving a female actor in Kerala. The actor was abducted by five men, assaulted in a moving vehicle, and later filed a police complaint. The committee submitted its findings to Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in 2018, but the report was only made public on August 19, 2024, five years after its submission.According to the report, many female actors in the Malayalam cinema industry have faced sexual harassment, with some revealing that they were approached inappropriately before starting projects. The report also highlighted instances where female actors felt unsafe in their accommodations, with intoxicated industry workers reportedly knocking on their doors. Despite these concerns, many victims hesitated to report the harassment to the police, fearing repercussions.In response to the growing allegations of sexual harassment within the Malayalam film industry, the Kerala government has decided to form a special investigation team led by senior women police officers under the leadership of IG Sparjan Kumar.Several prominent figures from the Malayalam film industry, including former general secretaries of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) Siddique and Edavela Babu, filmmaker Ranjith, and actors Mukesh, Sudheesh, and Riyas Khan, have been publicly accused of sexual harassment or misconduct by some women.","BJP National President and union minister JP Nadda criticized the Kerala government for its handling of the Hema Committee report on the Malayalam film industry.

The CJI emphasized the importance of intricate coordination and data management in executing these strategies effectively.""The three stages of the action plan include first, the preparatory stage of forming district-level case management committees to identify target cases, undated cases and reconstruction of records. The second stage, which is ongoing, aims to resolve cases which have been pending before the courts for 10 to 20 years, 20 to 30 years and more than 30 years. Third, from January to June 2025, the judiciary shall execute the third phase of clearing the backlogs of cases pending for over a decade in courts. This effort requires an intricate coordination of various applications and data management systems to plan and track our strategies. Some of the other strategies for dealing with the backlog include pre-litigation dispute resolution,"" the CJI said.The CJI also underscored the success of the Supreme Court's first-ever National Lok Adalat, where nearly 1,000 cases were resolved amicably in just five working days. During the conference, CJI Chandrachud pushed for a standardized recruitment process that transcends regional and state-specific biases, promoting national integration and ensuring a more equitable selection of judges.""To fill the vacancies, the conference deliberated upon the criteria for selection of judges and standardizing the recruitment calendars for all vacancies. The time has really come now to truly think of national integration by having a recruitment to the judicial service which crosses the narrow domestic walls of regionalism and state-centered selections,"" he said.The CJI reaffirmed the Constitution's foundational principles of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity, which continue to guide the judicial system's evolution. ""Over 75 years ago, the axis of the Earth aligned itself a little more closely with the axis of justice India, one fifth of the human race, gave itself a democratic and republican constitution. The Constitution, which promised to digress from the path of a hierarchical and discriminatory society governed by colonial operation. A Constitution which would modernize the country and champion social justice through a democratic and peaceful process. The Constitution premised on the timeless principles of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. Our Constitution was an amalgam of the experiential and the aspiration of stability and change,"" he added.CJI Chandrachud reiterated that justice delivery is a critical service, particularly for the most vulnerable citizens. He lauded the past decade's efforts to modernize the judiciary, focusing on creating tech-savvy, accessible court environments with improved facilities and services.""Justice delivery is an essential service which we provide to our citizens, especially the most vulnerable. Efforts in the past decade have modernized our judiciary, aiming for a tech savvy and accessible infrastructure such as trained personnel, spacious court complexes, facilitation centers, E seva kendras, medical facilities and creche,"" he said.","Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud called for a transformative overhaul. He stressed conducting infrastructural audits of courts at the district level to foster an inclusive and efficient judicial system. He also underscored the success of the Supreme Court's first-ever National Lok Adalat, where nearly 1,000 cases were resolved amicably in five working days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112970935,imgsize-499712,width-400,resizemode-4/112970935.jpg"

'Maharashtra does not forgive anyone': Uddhav-led Shiv Sena's sharp attack on PM Modi's apology over Shivaji Maharaj statue collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-does-not-forgive-anyone-uddhav-led-shiv-senas-sharp-attack-on-pm-modis-apology-over-shivaji-maharaj-statue-collapse/articleshow/112942749.cms,"NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut on Saturday mocked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his apology over the collapse of Shivaji Maharaj statue in Maharashtra's Sindhudurg and said any apology will not compensate for the insult to Chhatrapati. He also accused PM Modi of apologising just to get away with the controversy.""This is a political apology, a political moment.They are asking for an apology to get away with it. Apologisng will not compensate for the insult to Chhatrapati, it will never be enough. If the Prime Minister sincerely apologizes, then he should have apologized to the nation 5-10 years ago when 40 of our soldiers were killed in Pulwama, causing widespread grief,"" Raut said.""Forty soldiers were killed at once due to your failure. Even today, killings continue in Jammu and Kashmir, and the promise of homecoming for our Kashmiri Pandits has not been fulfilled; you should apologize for that too. You have lied so many times. You should apologise to the nation every day, but you haven't. This is Maharashtra; Maharashtra does not forgive anyone, especially in matters related to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj . So, you have no other option but to apologise,"" he added.Raut's reaction came a day after PM Modi said aplogised to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and those hurt by the collapse of the 17th-century warrior king’s statue at Rajkot Fort in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra.""Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is not just a name for me, for us Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is our idol.

The fall of the statue triggered a massive political firestorm in the state as opposition slammed the state government, alleging it had paid little attention to the quality of work. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray criticised the ruling BJP government, expressing disbelief that even the revered figure's monument could fall victim to alleged corruption within the BJP's ranks.""It is unimaginable that the statue of our deity, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj would also be a subject of the BJP's corruption,"" Thackeray stated in his post.The opposition leader further accused the BJP of attempting to shift the blame onto the Indian Navy. He pointed out a pattern of favouritism towards certain contractors, subpar quality of work, and inaugurations timed to coincide with elections rather than genuine sentiment.On the incident, Sindhudurg guardian minister Ravindra Chavan, who holds the PWD portfolio, said, ""A case has been filed against the proprietor of the firm M/s Artistry, Jaydeep Apte, and structural consultant Chetan Patil (both involved in statue work) in Sindhudurg."" Chavan said, ""The steel used in making of the statue had started rusting.
