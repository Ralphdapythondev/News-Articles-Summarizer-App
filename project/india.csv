"HC: Words, gestures in email can insult woman's modesty",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-words-gestures-in-email-can-insult-womans-modesty/articleshow/112726026.cms,"Mumbai: An email would amount to an utterance, ""gesture"" and ""exhibit"" - words used in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to define what constitutes an act intended to offend a woman's privacy and dignity - held Bombay HC in a judgment pronounced Wednesday.Words and gestures communicated via email would fall under the ambit of offence under IPC Section 509 that deals with words, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman, ruled the HC bench of Justices Ajay Gadkari and Neela Gokhale.The ruling came as HC granted partial relief to a Mumbai resident and quashed part of a 2009 FIR against him registered with the cyber call for alleged sexual assault and criminal intimidation of a woman, who is now over 70 years old. HC, though, did not quash the part of the FIR that invoked prosecution for offence intended to invade a woman's privacy and outrage her modesty under Section 509 and Section 67 of Information Technology Act (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form), based on emails to third persons. The emails, HC said, ""are a personal attack on her dignity, poise and self-esteem"". Interpreting Section 509, HC said, ""Insult can manifest as an intrusion upon the woman's privacy... encroaching upon her personal space or violating her sense of privacy intentionally, in a manner that affronts her modesty.""""The purpose of law is not to allow the offender to sneak out of the meshes of law,"" ruled HC. It said ""intent"" is the linchpin of the offence and opined the emails intruded on the woman's privacy and ""demonstrate his intent"".There were allegations of emails containing the woman's personal details being shared. HC, invoking SC's constitutional bench judgment on privacy, said, ""Sharing such details... especially the residents of the same Society who she is likely to see frequently and without her consent is an affront to her personal dignity."" Words used in the email about the woman may tend to deprave and corrupt persons who read it, said HC, as it said some could ""conjure"" an image of her.In 2011, the man petitioned HC to have the FIR and case quashed, arguing it was out of ""vengeance"" over animosity between the two. HC did not accept his arguments, stating, ""If such narrow interpretation is accepted, many a man will walk away, unhindered by consequences merely by shooting emails or using social media to malign a woman and outrage her modesty... Modern technology makes such manner of perpetrating the offence verily real.""","Bombay HC rules that an email would amount to an utterance, ""gesture"" and ""exhibit"" Ruling came as HC granted partial relief to a Mumbai resident and quashed part of a 2009 FIR against him registered with the cyber call for alleged sexual assault.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

PM and his Poland counterpart Donald Tusk spoke about the negative impact of the Ukraine war on global food and energy security, especially for the Global South, and said the threat of use of nuclear weapons is unacceptable.""They underscored the importance of upholding international law, and in line with the UN Charter, reiterated that all states must refrain from the threat of or use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state,"" said the joint statement.Tusk described Modi's Ukraine visit as historic and said Poland believed India can play a very essential and constructive role in ending the war. ""PM Modi confirmed his willingness that he is ready for peaceful, rightful and immediate end to war,"" said Tusk.After his engagements in Warsaw, Modi flew from Warsaw to the Rzeszow Jasionka airport in southeastern Poland and drove to Przemysl on the Polish-Ukrainian border, from where he undertook a 10-hour overnight train journey to Kyiv. Most leaders, including US President Joe Biden, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have used the same 'VIP luxury' train run by the Ukrainians to travel to Kyiv.The first visit by any Indian PM to Ukraine will last for 7-8 hours, during which Modi will have bilateral talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and interact with the Indian community, including students.""We support dialogue and diplomacy for an early return of peace and stability. For this, we are willing to contribute in every possible way along with our friendly countries,"" said Modi.During his meeting with Zelensky, Modi is likely to reiterate his govt's position that it's ready to offer any assistance within its means for restoration of peace than to come up with his own formal proposal for peace. India has maintained that while it's open to mediate if it's asked to, it won't initiate any peace proposal on its own. The Indian govt wants Russia to be also involved in any international initiative for enduring peace. While Zelensky is expected to focus on his 10-point peace plan that seeks Russian withdrawal from Ukraine and accountability for war crimes, it's unlikely that Modi will endorse it.The PM delivered a similar message of peace while addressing the Indian community in Warsaw on Wednesday, as he said India is the land of Lord Buddha's legacy, does not believe in war and advocates for peace in this region.""India is an advocate of permanent peace in this region.

Even destiny wants India-US relations to be strong,"" he said addressing the Indian community in Washington on Thursday.""When Columbus went on the expedition to discover America, he met the native Americans...so I believe, from the start, destiny wants India-US ties to be strong.

What are the realistic deliverables you expect from Modi?

What is victory for Ukraine?

Sirens go off in Kyiv as PM Modi makes his way to Ukraine for a historic visit. The alert was issued for ballistic missile strikes covering parts of central Ukraine including Cherkasy, Poltava and Sumy regions. While it remains to be seen what impact the Russian attack has on the visit, I spoke to Larysa Bilozir, an independent People's Deputy of Ukraine, on expectations from the visit:Ukrainian people are very happy that Indian PM Modi is coming for the first visit in 30 years.This is a very important visit for us because Modi I believe is a humanistic person as he keeps saying in meetings with world leaders, including Putin, that India is for peaceful solutions to conflicts. We are very grateful to India’s participation in the Ukraine Peace Summit. India also played a key role in the Black Sea Grain Initiative. So we are grateful that Modi is coming to Ukraine to show solidarity with us.First, the return of our abducted children. There is already a coalition of more than 70 ombudsmen from around the world who are helping us get back our children. India can and should participate in this effort. The Russians are abducting our children and they are being forced to fight against Ukraine. There are around 20,000 Ukrainian children that need to be returned by Russia .Second, we need India’s support in the return of our civilians. Third, we need help in return of the bodies of disappeared Ukrainians. Fourth, we need help in ensuring food security. India as a leader of the Global South has a critical role to play here. Fifth, we need help with energy security. And sixth, we need help in ensuring just peace.Victory is when all our territories and people will be restored and returned. It is about the preservation of our state. We also have to realise that even if we recover all our territories, Russia won’t stop attacking us. So ultimately victory is decolonising Russia. Russia has enslaved so many nations – Dagestan, Chechnya, parts of Georgia, etc. So victory will be when Russian imperialism is destroyed. We will continue to fighting till the end for our freedom.",Ukrainian people are very happy that Indian PM Modi is coming for the first visit in 30 years.

"Dhaka blames India for flooding, Delhi hits back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhaka-blames-india-for-flooding-delhi-hits-back/articleshow/112724351.cms,"NEW DELHI/DHAKA: The Indian government on Thursday strongly denied claims in Dhaka that flooding of districts on the eastern borders of Bangladesh had been caused by the opening of Dumbur dam upstream of the Gumti river in Tripura, saying that floods on cross-border rivers is a shared problem on both sides. Indian govt sources also warned the interim govt against any official backing of ""misplaced"" narratives.The warning came in the wake of allegations by one of the advisers to the interim govt, Mohammad Nahid Islam, that India's ""non-cooperation"" was the reason for the flooding.""Without any prior warning and without giving us time for preparation, the dam was opened. Through this India showed an inhuman approach and is demonstrating non-cooperation with Bangladesh,"" Islam said after a meeting of the advisory council with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.Amid cross-border acrimony, there were rumours in Dhaka that Yunus had summoned Indian envoy Pranay Verma. Sources in Delhi, however, said that the request by Verma for a call was lodged several days ago and before the events related to the floods.Nahid, one of the coordinators of the protests against ousted PM Sheikh Hasina, who is supervising information and broadcasting affairs, hoped that India will come out from this ""anti-Bangladesh policy"".""Any official backing of such misplaced narratives is unhelpful to bilateral ties and the use of the word 'summon' is clearly an attempt at disinformation,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.In a statement, the foreign ministry said this problem requires close mutual cooperation, adding India continues to provide real-time flood data to Bangladesh as per a bilateral protocol.With the two countries sharing 54 common cross-border rivers, river water cooperation is an important part of their bilateral engagement. Looking to allay concerns in Bangladesh about India's alleged role in the floods, which followed the political crisis in the country, Indian govt said it remained committed to resolving issues and mutual concerns in water resources and river water management through bilateral consultations and technical discussions.India pointed out that the catchment areas of the Gumti river that flows through India and Bangladesh have witnessed the heaviest rains of this year over the past few days and the flood in the neighbouring country is primarily due to waters from these large catchments downstream of the dam.""Dumbur dam is located quite far from the border - over 120km upstream of Bangladesh. It is a low-height (about 30m) dam that generates power that feeds into a grid and from which Bangladesh also draws 40MW power from Tripura. Along the about 120km river course, we have three water level observation sites at Amarpur, Sonamura and Sonamura 2,"" said MEA .""Heavy rainfall has been continuing since Aug 21 in whole of Tripura and adjoining districts of Bangladesh. In the event of heavy inflow, automatic releases have been observed,"" it added, while recalling that the Amarpur station is in part of a bilateral protocol under which India is transmitting real-time flood data to Bangladesh.""Data showing a rising trend has been supplied to Bangladesh up to 3pm on Aug 21, 2024. At 6pm, due to flooding, there was a power outage, leading to problems of communication. Still, we have tried to maintain communication through other means created for urgent transmission of data,"" said govt.Heavy rainfalls have caused heavy flooding, the worst since 1956, in Tripura with more than 80% of the state capital, Agartala, waterlogged. The situation worsened in the city after it received 233mm rain on Wednesday that could not be pumped out as the Haora river was overflowing.Eight districts of Bangladesh have been flooded due to heavy rains and onrush of water from the upstream, said the ministry of disaster management and relief on Wednesday. The eight districts are Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Feni, Chattogram, Noakhali, Comilla and Khagrachhari. At least 1,796,248 people have been affected, the ministry said on Thursday.(With inputs from AKM Moinuddin in Dhaka)","India strongly denies claims in Dhaka that flooding of districts on eastern borders of Bangladesh had been caused by the opening of Dumbur dam upstream of the Gumti river in Tripura.

Supreme Court reaffirms 'general' seats open to meritorious SC/ST/OBC candidates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-reaffirms-general-seats-open-to-meritorious-sc/st/obc-candidates/articleshow/112724350.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has reiterated the settled principle that SC/ST/OBC candidates who make it to the merit list on their own are entitled to be selected for open seats in the general class . The open category is open to all, and the only condition to be eligible is merit, irrespective of class, the court said.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan granted relief to petitioners from SC/ST/OBC categories who were not given MBBS admission under Unreserved (UR) Category Government School (GS) quota in MP for 2023-24 despite being more meritorious, having scored higher marks in the entrance exam than those who were eventually admitted.the bench said the principle was to be applied in both horizontal and vertical reservation. While vertical reservation applies separately for each of the groups specified under the law (such as SC, ST, OBC), horizontal quota is provided to other categories of beneficiaries such as women, veterans, transgender community, and individuals with disabilities, cutting through vertical categories.The court said petitioners were denied admission in medical colleges in Madhya Pradesh in 2023-24 session due to ""erroneous application of methodology in applying horizontal and vertical reservation"". It said that a meritorious reserved category candidate who is entitled to the 'General' category of the said horizontal reservation on his own merit, will have to be allotted a seat from the said 'General' category of the horizontal reservation. GS quota was introduced by MP in 2023.The petitioners alleged that the procedure followed by the govt in sub-classifying the candidates further into categories as UR-GS, SC-GS, ST-GS, OBC-GS and EWS-GS was totally illegal.""The methodology adopted by the respondents in compartmentalising the different categories in the horizontal reservation and restricting the migration of the meritorious reserved category candidates to the unreserved seats is totally unsustainable. In view of the law laid down by this Court, meritorious candidates belonging to SC/ST/OBC, who on their own merit, were entitled to be selected against the UR-GS quota, have been denied the seats against the open seats in the GS quota,"" the court said.Referring to previous verdicts of SC, the bench said the horizontal as well as the vertical reservation would not be seen as rigid ""slots"", where a candidate's merit, which otherwise entitles her or him to be shown in the open general category, is foreclosed. ""It was observed that by doing so, it would result in communal reservation, where each social category is confined within the extent of their reservation, thus negating merit,"" the court said.""It is to be noted that, in the present case, the cut-off for UR candidates was much less as compared to the cut-off for SC/ST/OBC/EWS candidates. As such, the respondents ought to have admitted the present appellants against the UR-GS categories. It is further to be noted that many seats from UR-GS category were required to be transferred to the general category,"" the court said.","Supreme Court reiterates settled principle that SC/ST/OBC candidates who make it to merit list on their own are entitled to open seats in the general class. The open category is open to all, and the only condition to be eligible is merit, irrespective of class, the court said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112724391,imgsize-48196,width-400,resizemode-4/112724391.jpg"
