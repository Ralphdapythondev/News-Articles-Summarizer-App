"Pant Varsity develops way to use pine leaves to boost rural economy, reduce forest fires",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pant-varsity-develops-way-to-use-pine-leaves-to-boost-rural-economy-reduce-forest-fires/articleshow/110317446.cms,"Rudrapur:

Researchers at GB Pant Agriculture and Technology University in Pantnagar, Udham Singh Nagar, have discovered a method to convert pine leaves (pirul), the primary cause of forest fires, into valuable bio-grease and bio-resin . The research promises to prevent forest fires and enhance the local economy.Tarannum Jahan, under the mentorship of Prof T K Bhattacharya and Prof A K Verma from the biochemistry department of the College of Sciences and Humanities, led the research.""The bio-grease we developed reduces friction in ball bearings and prevents rust, while the bio-resin is highly effective for glueing plywood,"" said Verma.The technology, developed under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)- All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP)- Energy in Agriculture & Agro-based Industries (EAAI) project, has been patented and sold to Green Molecules, a Gujarat-based company. ""This initiative will not only increase the value of pine leaves but also provide villagers with a new source of income, thereby mitigating forest fires,"" said A S Nain, director of research.Nain added, ""Uttarakhand generates approximately 2 million tonnes of pirul annually. The increase in its market value due to this research will significantly benefit local villagers financially. The methods involve producing bio-resin by mixing pyrolysis oil with phenyl, formaldehyde, and caustic soda at specific temperatures. Bio-grease is created by combining caustic soda and animal fat with pyrolysis oil, and then cooling the mixture to form a lubricant"".For her contribution, Jahan received the ‘Young Woman Scientist Excellence’ Award from Uttarakhand Governor Lt Gen (retd) Gurmit Singh.Anil Hafeez, an agricultural scientist, said ""This innovation is a game-changer for forest conservation and rural economies. It leverages a previously hazardous material to create sustainable products, providing dual benefits of environmental protection and economic growth.”","Researchers at GB Pant Agriculture and Technology University in Pantnagar, Udham Singh Nagar, have discovered a method to convert pine leaves into valuable bio- grease and bio-resin.

"For Kanshi Ram’s ‘Pagla’, polls are all about music",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-kanshi-rams-pagla-polls-are-all-about-music/articleshow/110317348.cms,"Singing was what Kishore Kumar picked up naturally, listening to the women folk in his village in Mau. It was this talent of his that made BSP founder Kanshi Ram give him the nickname of ‘ Pagla ’.Thereafter he came to be known as Kishore Kumar Pagla by party workers and leaders. “Behenji knows me and calls me for party events,” says the 70-year-old who is busy these days with BSP campaigns and public rallies of senior leaders where he sings folk songs .“Kanshi Ram ji kahte the, arre pagle, tune mujhe apna diwana bana diya. He loved my andaaz (Kanshi Ram Ji used to say that I had impressed him with my songs and style of singing),” the BSP cadre in Ambedkarnagar said.In one of the election rallies of Akash Anand, held in April in Ambedkarnagar, he was present on the stage, singing. “A few years ago, I met him at a party event in Patna, where I sang in front of him. People wonder how I sing so effortlessly even at this age. But it’s my passion to sing, and sing for my party,” said Pagla, who counts himself among the committed cadre of BSP. He has no training to boast of.“I picked it up from the womenfolk of my village, who used to sing on every occasion. In the weddings, they sang gaalis (cuss words) and sohar on dholak. I used to sing with them,” says ‘Pagla’ who was born in a Dalit family in a nondescript village in Mau. “We had some land. Before I joined BSP, I did odd jobs to take care of my family,” he says.In 1984, when a few people from the Bahujan movement reached his village to encourage Dalits to join DS-4 (Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti), he became a part of the social movement that Kanshi Ram had launched. “I had studied a little. The movement told us about great thinkers, from every religion. I got moved by it all and joined the party,” he added.Other than doing the works he was given at the party, he also took to entertaining people with his songs and that’s how he got noticed by Kanshi Ram.“On one of the Behenji’s birthdays, Kanshi Ram Ji had called me to Delhi and there he told her, ‘tum isko apne karyakram mein le jaao, istemaal karo, tum bhashan dena, yeh gaana gayega’ (take him to your programmes, he will sing while you address people).”Asked if his commitment to the party has paid off, he said, “Yes. I was made a member of a music institute in UP when Behenji became the CM.”‘Pagla’ does not write songs. He composes tunes on a harmonium. And that’s where the role of party cadre, like Ghulam Kiwiriya, comes in. Based in Ambedkarnagar, Kiwiriya has lost count of the number of songs he has written till now.“It must be around 800 songs. In 2005, Behenji had called me to Delhi and that’s when my songs were recorded in a studio,” says Kiwiriya, a weaver who has been with the party since its founding days. “Many songs written by me have not only been sung by big singers but also other singers in the party.” The songs reflect the ideology of the party and are inspired by the Bahujan movement.Kiwiriya can sing himself too. He is also called to sing at party events and campaigns. “I only request those who call me to pay the fare, at least.” “In villages, where pamphlets do not communicate much, it is the song that works out the connection with voters,” he says.Kiwiriya could be heard singing at the rallies that the party is organising in every state for the Lok Sabha elections.","‘Pagla’ picked it up from the womenfolk of his village, who used to sing on every occasion.

Raja vs ‘mantri’ face-off to affect Pratapgarh poll?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raja-vs-mantri-face-off-to-affect-pratapgarh-poll/articleshow/110317304.cms,"It’s the battle of prestige between two regional parties on the twin turfs of Pratapgarh and Kaushambi .On one side is Anupriya Patel ’s Apna Dal (Sonelal) faction and on the other is Jansatta Dal (Loktantrik) led by Raghuraj Pratap Singh aka Raja Bhaiya. Given the high stakes, focus is on the electoral shift in the 10 assembly segments of the two constituencies between 2017 and 2022 UP assembly elections.In a veiled attack on Raja Bhaiya at a rally in Kunda assembly segment of Kaushambi reserved seat last week, Anupriya had slammed the “self-proclaimed kings who thought Kunda was their fiefdom”.“Ab raja EVM se paida hote hain (Now kings are born from EVMs),” she had said. The statement was seen as Patel’s aggressive posturing to consolidate Dalit and OBC votes in the region. The Kunda strongman hit back saying that “EVMs give birth to Jan sewaks (public representatives) and not Kings”. “Raja Rajwade to saat dashak pehle hi khatam ho gaye,” he had said while criticising Patel’s statement. He also claimed that there was “anti-incumbency” against the sitting BJP MP Vinod Sonkar who is seeking a second term from Kaushambi.Her attack came after Raja Bhaiya, who had been getting closer to the BJP since 2017, took a “neutral” stance and asked his supporters to “vote as per their wish” in the Lok Sabha elections. Raja Bhaiya, the scion of Bhadri estate in Pratapgarh, has been a seven-time MLA from Kunda since 1993 and wields clout in Kunda and its adjoining areas.Anupriya Patel is an ally of BJP and a minister in the Modi govt. She is in the fray from Mirzapur Lok Sabha seat which is located close to Kaushambi. While Jansatta Dal (Loktantrik) is not contesting the Lok Sabha elections, the buzz is that the party might campaign against Patel in Mirzapur.Kaushambi went to the polls on May 20 while Pratapgarh will vote on May 25.Samajwadi Party had wrested five out of 10 assembly seats in Kaushambi and Pratapgarh from the BJP in the 2022 UP elections. Three of these five seats — Sirathu, Manjhanpur and Chail – were in Kaushambi. In fact, Sirathu was won by Anupriya’s elder sister and Apna Dal (Kamerawadi) member Pallavi Patel who had contested on an SP ticket.Pallavi, however, ended her association with the SP in March this year and even left the INDIA bloc to form PDM Nyay Morcha — Pichda (backwards), Dalits and Muslims — with AIMIM chief Asaduddiin Owaisi. Likewise, SP MLA from Chail (Kaushambi), Pooja Pal, too drifted towards the BJP this year and even cross voted for BJP’s Rajya sabha candidates. She also thanked CM Yogi Adityanath for addressing the pain of her community. Pal is the widow of BSP legislator Raju Pal who was shot dead by gangsters Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf in Prayagraj in 2005.In Pratapgarh, SP had wrested Patti and Raniganj assembly seats from BJP in the 2022 UP elections. Of the other three seats, BJP and Apna Dal (S) had won Pratapgarh and Vishwanathganj, respectively, while Rampur Khas was retained by Congress’s Aradhana Mishra.BJP MP from Pratapgarh, Sangam Lal Gupta, was elected from Pratapgarh assembly seat in 2017 on AD ticket. He had then defeated SP’s Nagendra Singh with an impressive margin of over 34,000 votes.In 2019, Gupta had won from Pratapgarh Lok Sabha seat on BJP ticket while defeating SP-backed BSP candidate Ashok Tripathi by around 1.18 lakh votes. Gupta is back in the fray and facing SP Singh Patel of SP and Prathamesh Mishra of BSP.","Anupriya Patel is an ally of BJP and a minister in the Modi govt.

We can confirm that there are injuries and one fatality on board the Boeing 777-300ER. There were a total of 211 passengers and 18 crew on board.”“Singapore Airlines offers its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. Our priority is to provide all possible assistance to all passengers and crew on board the aircraft. We are working with the local authorities in Thailand to provide the necessary medical assistance, and sending a team to Bangkok to provide any additional assistance needed,” the statement added.The flight had taken off from Heathrow at 10.38 pm on May 21. It encountered severe turbulence, possibly near in the airspace of Myanmar or Thailand. According to website Skybrary, severe turbulence “is characterised by large, abrupt changes in attitude and altitude with large variations in airspeed. There may be brief periods where effective control of the aircraft is impossible. Loose objects may move around the cabin and damage to aircraft structures may occur.”The pilots then decided to divert to Bangkok. Thai authorities kept emergency personnel and ambulances ready.Passengers are advised to keep their seat belts on during flights as an aircraft can fly into turbulence at any time.About two years back, a SpiceJet Mumbai-Durgapur flight encountered severe turbulence during descent at the destination that saw 14 passengers and three crew members getting injured. One of these passengers succumbed to his injuries two months after the incident.","A passenger died and many were injured when a Singapore Airlines’ Boeing 777 headed from London to Singapore encountered “severe turbulence” enroute.

But on Tuesday this happened on an IndiGo aircraft with a person not getting a seat on the full flight and then having to stand at the rear of the plane. It was only when the aircraft started taxiing at Mumbai airport to take off for Varanasi that a cabin crew member saw the extra passenger and informed the pilot.The aircraft then returned to the bay where the extra passenger alighted.The standby passenger was an IndiGo employee. Sources say one confirm passenger was late and then deemed as no show (someone who does not turn up for flight). So the employee — standby passenger — boarded the aircraft. But the passenger running late also turned up and took his seat, leaving no seat for the standby.Regulatory agencies, DGCA and BCAS, are probing this lapse. They are examining how did the standby passenger board the aircraft. It is learnt the standby passenger did not have any check-in baggage and was to travel only with a cabin bag.IndiGo said in a statement: ""There was an error during the passenger boarding process of 6E 6543 from Mumbai to Varanasi, wherein a standby passenger was allotted a seat reserved for a confirmed passenger. The error was noticed prior to the departure of the aircraft, and the standby passenger was de-boarded. This led to a slight delay in the departure of the aircraft.

So, I have to work very hard to ensure a bright future for you and your children.I don't want that your next generation should face the problems that you have experienced in your lifetime,"" the Prime Minister said at an election rally in Bihar.The Prime Minister's assertion comes days after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal cited the ""75 years age rule in BJP"" and claimed that Amit Shah would be Modi's successor when Prime Minister turns 75 next year. Kejriwal's claims were strongly rebutted by all top BJP leaders including Amit Shah and party chief JP Nadda.Attacking the BJP, Kejriwal had said: ""These people ask INDIA bloc about their (PM) face. I ask BJP who will be their PM? Modi ji is turning 75 on September 17 next year. He had made the rule that people aged 75 will be retired.

Later, the BJP leaders launched a campaign and declared themselves as ""Modi ka parivar"" on their social media profiles.In fact, a key thrust area of PM Modi's Lok Sabha campaign has been to highlight the dynasty politics of the opposition. He has been unscathing in his attack on family-based parties blaming them for the ills facing the country. In his election speeches, he has often attacked opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav and said they were ""born with silver spoons"".Interestingly, to counter his charge of ""parivarvaad"" (politics of dynasty)against the opposition parties, PM Modi in his 90-minute Independence Day speech last year used the term ""parivarjan"" (members of family) nearly 68 times.

Mid-air turbulence turns fatal: How climate change is impacting your flight journey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mid-air-turbulence-turns-fatal-how-climate-change-is-impacting-your-flight-journey/articleshow/110309146.cms,"Hazardous clear air turbulence

How hot weather impacts aircraft engine performance

NEW DELHI: Turbulence is one of the uncertain factors a flyer may encounter when travelling on a plane . While these inconvenient shake-ups are rarely fatal, they quite certainly can inflict unwarranted injuries .The rarest mishap occurred on Tuesday when a passenger died after Singapore Airlines ’ Boeing 777 encountered ""severe turbulence"". The flight was heading from London to Singapore but later diverted to Bangkok.The incident, in which many passengers were injured, has thrown up multiple questions, with climate change impact being one of them.Experts say global warming may increase instances of clear air turbulence by upto 200% by 2050. In India, the increase in flight turbulence could be felt during the pre-monsoon season.Paul D Williams, a professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Reading, UK says research has shown that severe clear-air turbulence, which is strong enough to catapult unbuckled passengers and crew around the aircraft, could become twice or even three times as common on some flight routes later this century.Paul shares, ""We’ve recently extended our analysis globally and that includes Indian airspace. We found that there will be significant increases in clear air turbulence over India within the next few decades. The projected increases are strongest in the northern half of India and are especially strong in the pre-monsoon season, in other words from March to May, when we estimate that there will be 100-200% more clear air turbulence by the period 2050-2080.""Paul explains that clear air turbulence is particularly hazardous to aircraft because it is invisible to both radar and satellites ""and also because it cannot be seen by pilots from the cockpit either"".“Clear air turbulence is caused by instabilities in the atmosphere, mainly in the jet stream and especially when wind shear is strong. Now, climate change is strengthening the wind shear. We know that the jet stream over the North Atlantic Ocean, for example, is already 15% more sheared than when the satellites began observing in the late 1970s,"" said Paul Williams.""Our studies have used climate models to show that this effect will increase the amount of severe clear air turbulence in the atmosphere by hundreds of per cent in the next few decades. And that’s just clear air turbulence. We need a lot more research before we understand whether and how the other kinds of turbulence due to storms and cumulonimbus clouds are also being modified by climate change,” says the professor,"" he added.Flying becomes a little turbulent with the mercury level going over 40°C. The high surface temperature coupled with the presence of hills nearby triggers a sudden change in the direction of wind close to the ground, and crosswinds make it difficult for pilots to keep planes stable when gliding down to land. Climbing for a takeoff is a challenge because the air is thinner. The lift of the plane caused by its aerodynamic body is reduced.Pilots, however, are trained for these very changes and keep a watch for turbulence, wind shear and birds as they come in to land on the main runway. “The turbulence can be experienced up to 10,000 feet. Planes start to waver when descending towards the airport. Often, the approach starts quite far from the city so that glide is smooth and the plane can do a go-round in case the cross wind is too strong,” said a pilot.Safety is given priority over inflight service. “The seat belt sign may remain on throughout the trip or soon after the plane starts its descent from cruising altitude. This is to prevent passengers from walking around, as turbulence can strike anytime,” he added.While planes are inspected for potential snags due to overheating, pilots take a few precautions. “In Chennai, we prefer the main run way because we get the maximum length for landing. It does not mean we insist on using it because the second runway is also safe to land. But if the main runway is available, it is preferred,” said another pilot.Airlines try to reduce cargo load to take more fuel, especially if headed to an airport with a short runway like in Trichy. This is to ensure there is enough fuel for a go-round or diversion to another airport.","Experts say global warming may increase instances of clear air turbulence by upto 200% by 2050.

"With junk food now officially defined, FSSAI has no reason not to regulate them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-junk-food-now-officially-defined-fssai-has-no-reason-not-to-regulate-them/articleshow/110305223.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) releasing new Dietary Guidelines for Indians, FSSAI ’s plea that it is hampered in regulating ultra-processed food (UPF) and foods high in fat, sugars and salt (HFSS) because the terms “have not been defined” may no longer be valid. The guidelines released last week have detailed definitions of UPF and HFSS foods put together by a scientific body.The guidelines also spell out the harm caused by consumption of UPF. “Lack of fibre and poor micronutrients makes them unhealthy. Also, UPFs contribute to high calorie (energy) intake as they are often high in fat. UPFs are consumed in larger quantities by a large population since these have unique taste, high palatability and low cost as well as are easily available even in remote areas. …UPF consumption is associated with overweight/obesity and higher risks of coronary heart disease (heart attack), cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) and diabetes. UPFs also hasten the process of ageing,” stated the guidelines.On February 5, Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest-India (NAPi), a national think tank on nutrition consisting of independent experts in epidemiology, nutrition, and paediatrics, wrote to the health ministry seeking regulations for labelling and marketing of UPF and HFSS foods “to halt their rising consumption”. Responding to the letter on April 15, FSSAI stated that “it is informed that the terms ultra-processed food and junk foods have not been defined in any of the Food Safety and Standards Regulations” and that comments and suggestions received from stakeholders on the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling & Display) Amendment Regulations, 2022 notified by the FSSAI “are under examination”.It included a list of initiatives taken by FSSAI to reduce consumption of UPFs such as Eat Right India, the social media campaign “Aaj se thoda kam” urging dietary modifications to reduce diet-related non-communicable diseases and a ban on sale/marketing of HFSS foods in schools or in areas within 50 metres from the school gate in any direction.“Why does it take FSSAI so long to examine the comments given in 2022? It has been working on regulation of front-of-pack labeling for a decade now,” said Dr Arun Gupta of NAPi. Front-of-pack labelling was proposed in 2014 by an expert committee constituted by the FSSAI on the order of the Delhi High Court on a public interest petition seeking labelling and a ban on sale of junk food in schools.On May 10, NAPi wrote to the health ministry urging the use of the NIN dietary guidelines, which are “science-based practicable guidelines”, “for developing regulations that could meaningfully prohibit advertising of HFSS and UPFs”. The guidelines also provide guidance on which food products could be regulated for front-of-pack labelling and prohibition of advertisements, stated the letter.","The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) released new Dietary Guidelines for Indians last week. The guidelines spell out the harm caused by consumption of ultra-processed food (UPF) and foods high in fat, sugars and salt (HFSS)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110305729,imgsize-1794620,width-400,resizemode-4/110305729.jpg"

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday wrote to the Union home ministry, stating that the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) allegedly received foreign funds exceeding Rs 7 crore in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).The ED discovered this information during a money laundering investigation related to drugs, involving former Punjab AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira and others, said several media reports.The ED initiated the probe in 2021 and arrested Khaira, who has since joined the Congress.In August last year, the agency sent a detailed communication to the Union home ministry, highlighting the alleged violations by AAP and categorising them as contraventions of the FCRA and The Representation of the People Act.Recently, the ED shared additional information with the Ministry of Home Affairs ( MHA ).Media reports said the ED found that the AAP had received approximately Rs 7.08 crore in overseas donations to date. The agency alleged that the party ""mis-declared and manipulated"" the identities and nationalities of the foreign donors, as well as other details.The ED provided the MHA with verified information about the donors, including their nationalities, passport numbers, donation amounts, mode of donation, bank account numbers, billing details, and payment gateway used.The agency also reported that some fundraising events organised by the AAP's overseas wing volunteers in the USA and Canada between 2015 and 2016 were allegedly conducted in violation of the FCRA.In one specific instance, the ED claimed that the names and nationalities of some Canada-based individuals had been ""concealed"" in the party's financial records to ""hide"" the foreign donations being made to the party's Indian bank account.A senior official stated that cases of FCRA violations are investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and the home ministry can request the CBI to look into the charges made by the ED.AAP leader Atishi hit back at ED's allegations, and said that this was yet another ploy by the BJP.""After the liquor scam and t he Swati Maliwal case failed to bring down AAP, the BJP has concocted this case ... this clearly shows the BJP is losing the 20 seats of Delhi and Punjab. This is not the ED's action ... but the BJP,"" said Atishi.The AAP leader said the ED's charges over foreign funding stem from a case that is 11 years old. ""This is a conspiracy by Modi to defame AAP,"" Atishi added.""I want to tell BJP and ED that since its formation, Aam Aadmi Party has given account of every single rupee to the Election Commission and the Income Tax Department,"" she said.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) wrote to the Union home ministry, stating that the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) allegedly received foreign funds exceeding Rs 7 crore in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) The ED discovered this information during a money laundering investigation related to drugs, involving former Punjab AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110277435,imgsize-36548,width-400,resizemode-4/110277435.jpg"

While flamingo deaths have gone up in the past few weeks, this is the first time that the birds have been involved in an accident involving an aircraft.Emirates flight EK 508 was on its last leg of approach to land at city's main runway around 8.30 pm when the accident occurred.""The pilots informed us that during the post landing inspection of the aircraft, multiple bird strikes were observed on the aircraft fuselage. The pilots had reported about the bird strike after landing and parking at the bay,"" said a source from the Mumbai air traffic control. ""Assuming that the aircraft would have hit the birds during the final phase of landing, before touch down, we sent a team to inspect the runway for bird carcass, but we didn't find any,"" he added.Much before the air traffic control could begun the runway inspection, the residents of Laxmi Nagar, Ghatkopar had found themselves dealing with the accident. ""The locality was littered with bird carcass. Broken pieces of wings, beaks, claws were scattered over a large area,"" said B N Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation, an NGO devoted to environmental issues. The forest department was informed and they collected most of the carcass at night, he said, adding that at least 40 birds have been killed in the accident. The birds were flying towards Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS), the only urban Ramsar site in the country, when the flight paths crossed.Though most of the carcass was cleared, early morning joggers came across remains of birds in some parts of the locality leading to much distress among residents, said a Ghatkopar resident.""It is absolutely shocking as an avian tragedy of this scale has never happened in Mumbai. Flamingos have been seen changing their flight paths due to massive construction projects such as Atal Setu. The birds are also disoriented due to light pollution, a major concern in cities such as Mumbai. The accident calls for a major investigation,"" he added.A statement from Emirates is awaited.A number of flamingo deaths have been reported from Mumbai in the past few months.In the last week of April, 12 injured flamingos were found in wetlands near Seawoods, in Navi Mumbai. Out of these over five birds died during treatment. Prior to that a flamingo was hit by a speeding vehicle on Palm Beach road. In February, three flamingos flew into a hoarding and crashed and died.

As per the survey findings, the INDIA alliance is getting more than 300 seats”, questioning whether the significant electoral support for AAP in Delhi and Punjab implied those voters were being labeled as ""Pakistani.""""Yesterday Amit Shah ji came to Delhi and less than 500 people were present in his public meeting.

I want to ask him, the people of Delhi have formed our government by giving us 62 seats, 56% vote share, are the people of Delhi Pakistani? The people of Punjab have given us 92 seats out of 117 seats, are the people of Punjab Pakistanis?""Kejriwal said.He further highlighted the support AAP has received in various states, including Gujarat, Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, and Madhya Pradesh, questioning if these voters were also being unfairly labeled.Accusing Shah of arrogance, Kejriwal said, “PM Modi has chosen you as his successor. You became so proud of this that you started abusing and threatening people. You have not become PM yet and you have become so arrogant. For your information, let me tell you that you are not becoming the PM, because people are not forming the BJP government on June 4.”Kejriwal further asked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath that he should focus on the enemies within his party instead of abusing him.""Yesterday Yogi (Adityanath) came to Delhi as well.

Theatre commands will bolster military preparedness and war-fighting: CDS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/theatre-commands-will-bolster-military-preparedness-and-war-fighting-cds/articleshow/110306950.cms,"NEW DELHI: The impending creation of integrated theatre commands will lay the foundation for catapulting the armed forces into the next orbit of military preparedness and war-fighting, while also setting the stage for the next generation of reforms, chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan said on Tuesday.The Army, Navy and IAF must also create a `joint culture’ as they move towards forming the integrated operational structures.“Jointness and integration are prerequisites for the creation of functional integrated theatre commands (ITCs),” Gen Chauhan said, delivering the Maj Gen Samir Sinha memorial lecture here.The comments come soon after the government notified and enforced from May 10 onwards the Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, which will pave the way for the long-pending ITCs in the most radical military reorganization envisaged since Independence, as was reported by TOI.“The creation of ITCs will separate the ‘operational’ functions from the `raise-train-sustain’ (RTS) and other administrative functions. They will allow greater focus of the operational (ITC) commanders to matters of security,” Gen Chauhan said.The plan is to set up two “adversary-specific” ITCs for the borders with China and Pakistan, and a maritime one for the Indian Ocean Region and the larger Indo-Pacific. At present, India has 17 single-service commands, with the Army and IAF having seven each and the Navy three.“The theatre commands will not be the end-state, but only the beginning of the next set of reforms,” the CDS said. These reforms will include moving from single to multi-domain operations and network-centric to data-centric operations as well as fusing space and cyberspace into the traditional domains of land, air and sea, among others.As for the ‘ joint culture ’, Gen Chauhan said the three services must now move towards `Jointness 2.0’ after more or less achieving ‘Jointness 1.0’, which was about creating better trust, bonhomie and consensus among them.“The joint culture, though different from service-specific culture, needs to respect the uniqueness of each service. We must be able to distil the best of each service, and incorporate the highest common factor, rather than settle for the least common denominator,” he said.","The Army, Navy and IAF must also create a `joint culture’ as they move towards forming the integrated operational structures. The government notified and enforced from May 10 onwards the Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, which will pave the way for ITCs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110307302,imgsize-895837,width-400,resizemode-4/110307302.jpg"

When our enemy is trying to capture Bharat mata, why is Yogi not saying anything? He wears saffron clothes and he talks like this. Even Ravana came to abduct Sita wearing saffron clothes...supporting wrong policies while wearing saffron clothes is wrong and an insult to Sanatan.""However it is not the first time Patole has found himself embroiled in a controversy.

All the four Shankaracharyas will purify the Ram Temple. Ram Darbar will be established in that place. It is not Lord Ram's idol there, but the child form of Ram Lalla,"" Patole had said. The statement had come just a day after President Draupadi Murmu visited the temple.This remark led to a huge political controversy with even PM Modi calling the remarks ‘an insult to the President, tribals, women and the country as a whole’ and that the Congress has ‘no right to remain in politics’.“One day after her (President Droupadi Murmu) visit, one of the biggest leaders of the Congress party said we will do purification of Ram temple with Gangajal. Do such people have the right to be in Indian politics?"" he had asked.UP CM Yogi, at that time, also attacked Congress accusing it of neglecting Lord Ram and claiming that the spirit of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb has entered the party.Patole's controversial remark against Yogi Adityanath comes in the middle of high-pitch election campaign in which the BJP is cornering the party, along with the opposition INDIA bloc, by raising the issue of party leaders not attending Ram temple inauguration ceremony and claiming that it would, ""bulldoze the Ram temple"" in Ayodhya if it came to power.","Mumbai Congress chief Nana Patole likens Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Ravana.

NEW YORK: In perhaps the first acknowledgement of its kind on a global forum that the ""new India is a dangerous entity"", Pakistan 's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.Pakistan's permanent representative at the world body also quoted from a report in a leading US daily to say the ""new India comes into your home and kills you"".Addressing the General Assembly on May 2, Akram said, ""Pakistan's foreign minister informed the Security Council, as well as the secretary general and the president of the General Assembly of India's campaign of targeted assassinations in Pakistan. This extra-territorial state terrorism is not limited to Pakistan. It has been extended to targeted killings of political opponents in Canada and attempted in the United States and probably in other countries.""""The Washington Post reported that Prime Minister Modi last week told his cheering supporters, and I quote, ""Today, even India's enemies know this is Modi. This is the new India. This new India comes into your home and kills you"". This new India is a dangerous entity, it is a net provider of insecurity, not security,"" Pakistan's permanent representative to the UN alleged.Earlier, top British daily, The Guardian, claimed in a report that the Indian government carried out assassinations of wanted individuals deep inside Pakistan as part of a ""wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil"".It said, citing intelligence sources, that targeted assassinations increased significantly in 2023, claiming India's involvement in the suspected deaths of about 15 people, ""most of whom were shot at close range by unknown gunmen"".Earlier, some countries in the West raised concerns over what they claimed were targeted killings on their soil at the behest of the Indian government.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused 'agents' allegedly in the employ of the Indian government of killing Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan leader and a designated terrorist by the country's elite National Investigation Agency (NIA), in 2020.However, India has dismissed the claim as 'absurd' and 'motivated'.Nijjar was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A purported video clip of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March, this year, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men in what was alleged to be a 'contract killing'.In a recent development in the Nijjar case, the Canadian Police arrested four Indian nationals for their alleged involvement in the killing of the separatist Khalistleader outside a gurudwara in British Columbia last June.Reacting to the arrests, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar denied receiving any evidence implicating Indian nationals' involvement in the killing in Canada of the India-designated terrorist.Responding to media queries, Jaishankar said, ""I also read that another arrest has been made. If that person is an Indian national, then usually by consular practice, you inform the government or the embassy of the country of origin. But beyond that, we have long maintained that if anything, any event in Canada, any violence in Canada, has any evidence or information which is relevant to be investigated in India, we are open to investigating it.""He emphasised that while any Indian national's arrest would usually prompt notification to the government or embassy, no specific evidence justifying investigation by Indian agencies has been received to date.""But to date, we have never received anything, which is specific and worthy of being pursued by our investigative agencies. And I'm not aware anything has changed in the last few days in that regard,"" the External Affairs Minister said at a media interaction at a seminar on Indian Capital Markets 'Roadmap for Viksit Bharat' at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in Mumbai earlier.At a weekly media briefing, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), too, informed that Canada had not formally conveyed the arrests and India had not yet received any consular access request.On being asked about the fourth Indian arrested by Canada in connection with the Nijjar killing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have seen reports of the fourth person being arrested. We have not been formally conveyed of it. So far, we have not received any consular access request as well.""Earlier, campaigning for the ongoing general elections in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a telling remark vis-a-vis its western neighbour, saying India does not send dossiers on terrorism anymore but eliminates terrorists in their own backyard.""Today, India doesn't send dossiers.(Today India strikes back at terrorists on their own turf),"" PM Modi said at a poll rally in Maharashtra's Latur.Expanding on the difference in how his government tackles terrorism as compared to previous Congress regimes at the Centre, Prime Minister Modi said the earlier approach of handing dossiers to Pakistan has been replaced by taking out the wanted terror conspirators on their own turf.At a separate rally, PM Modi doubled down on remarks made by the INDIA bloc leader Farooq Abdullah that Pakistan was not wearing bangles and was a nuclear-amed nation, saying, """" (I was told Pakistanis don't even have bangles, we will make them wear some)"".Addressing a public meeting in Muzaffarpur, PM Modi said, ""These (Congress and INDIA alliance) people are so afraid that they see Pakistan's atom bombs even in their dreams. Can such a government and leader run the country? They (INDI alliance leaders) say, ''. (i am told Pakistanis don't even have bangles...we will make them wear some. They are desperately crying out for wheat, they don't have electricity and now they don't even have bangles to wear.) Some leaders in the Opposition are even giving clean chits to the 26/11 accused.""""Some people are doubting the surgical strikes and air strikes (after the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks). These leaders want to weaken the morale of our forces and cast aspersions on our nuclear power. It seems like 'INDI alliance ne India ke khilaf supari le li hai' (INDI partners have taken out a contract against the country),"" PM Modi added.In the US, federal prosecutors earlier alleged the involvement of two Indian nationals, including a government employee, in a plot to murder Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Canadian also holding American citizenship, on its soil.According to the indictment of the US Justice Department, an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, who is currently in custody, was charged with the murder-for-hire of Pannun. The US Justice Department claimed that an Indian government employee, who was not identified in the indictment filed, recruited Gupta to hire a hitman to allegedly assassinate Pannun, which was foiled by US authorities.India set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.","Pakistan's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.

Past Perfect, Present Tense

PRAYAGRAJ (ALLAHABAD): In the winter of 1984, Allahabad was struck by Amitabh . Paradropped into national politics, the reigning Hindi cinema superstar had returned to his land of birth to challenge the seemingly unbeatable Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna in the Lok Sabha polls. And the erudite city, on the last legs of its old lustre, was swept away.Vivek Ranjan was only a teenager then, but vividly recollects how feverish young men and women would flock to the special open van, a rarity then, that the actor used for campaigning.“People would line up on roads, wave from balconies,” recalls Ranjan, who runs an NGO. He was also told about an incident when the convoys of the two contestants crossed each other. “Bachchan got down from his van, touched Bahuguna’s feet and asked for his blessings,” he remembers being told.The election’s outcome surprised many. Adulation had converted into ballots. Bachchan triumphed by 1.87 lakh votes. It was the last time Congress won the seat. Interestingly, BJP ’s Ritu Bahuguna Joshi, who won in 2019, is Hemwati’s daughter.Now, 40 years later, Congress is hoping to retrieve a city that has not only changed political hands and name — it is called Prayagraj now — but also wandered off the map of national relevance.The city of three rivers was once the garbhagriha of the national movement, a bustling epicentre of knowledge that nourished the likes of Motilal Nehru, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Akbar Allahabadi, Meghnad Saha, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Firaq Gorakhpuri, Sumitra Nandan Pant, and many others. It was, after all, a verdict in the Allahabad high court against Indira Gandhi in 1975 that changed the direction of India.The city’s centrality, says Sahitya Akademi recipient Neelum Saran Gour, was also tied to the primacy of the Nehru-Gandhi family in Indian politics that’s no longer there. “Even in the time of V P Singh, the city’s politics had a robustness. That season has faded away,” she says.Allahabad has served as the constituency of Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and V P Singh, and prominent politicians like Bahuguna and Murli Manohar Joshi. But the constituency, says social scientist Badri Narayan, didn’t enjoy the kind of infrastructural growth it should have had. “Lucknow, being the centre of state power, and Varanasi, being the PM’s constituency now, have benefited. In comparison, Prayagraj only has Kumbh as a form of symbolic power to leverage,” he says.Much has changed nonetheless. Gour says the city’s infrastructure, orderliness and amenities have improved in recent years. “But one misses Allahabad’s cosmopolitan and open climate when one didn’t have to speak with caution and communities interacted freely and with trust,” she says.Politics too is in the hands of a new generation. It’s the day of the progeny. Congress candidate Ujjwal Raman Singh, a Bhumihar by caste, is the son of Rewati Raman Singh, a two-time MP from the same constituency, and a Samajwadi Party veteran. Ujjwal served as environment minister when SP governed Uttar Pradesh. The 51-year-old postgraduate in law switched parties last month. SP and Congress have joined hands for the polls.His BJP rival, Neeraj Tripathi, a Brahmin, is the son of Kesari Nath Tripathi, who, among other things, served as Uttar Pradesh speaker and Bengal governor. Ramesh Kumar Patel, a 47-year-old agriculturist, is BSP’s candidate.Of the five state assembly segments, a mix of rural and urban, BJP and its allies hold four; SP the fifth. Brahmins, Dalits and Patels (OBC) are numerically weighty, followed by Banias and Muslims. In a city where Ganga and Yamuna converge, the Nishads (boating community), based primarily in villages close to the rivers, are significant. Nishad Party, led by Sanjay Nishad, is in alliance with BJP-led NDA.The general tone of voters is one of dissatisfaction, irrespective of voting preference. But there’s no overt indication that the social blocs have moved. Geographically, BJP is strong in the urban areas, and SP relatively in villages. “Gaon hamara, shaher tumhara,” jokes an SP supporter, who will vote for Congress.Pintoo Nishad of Arail village owns 10 boats. “Too many boats, too little income,” he says, “The educated among us have nothing to do but take photos of tourists at Sangam.” He is worried whether his two daughters — one studying engineering, the other agricultural science — will find jobs. But when it comes to votes, he says, “Sanjay Nishad jahan bhi honge, hamara vote wohin hoga (We vote for whichever party our leader supports).”Guru Prasad Prajapati of kumhar (OBC) caste from Kabra village, says, “Women in my household like Modi.” Doodhnath Pathak of Lawayanpur village runs a small eatery. “Poori duniya Modiji ki ijjat karti hai (The world respects Modi). He has done good work, built roads,” he says. But he is personally indebted to Rewati Raman Singh who, he reveals, has helped him on several occasions. “I will vote for his son. But most in my community don’t think like me,” he says.Corporator Mukund Tiwary, a Congressman, estimates there are about 4 lakh Brahmin voters. “If we get a substantial chunk of them, we have a chance,” he says. Narayan of GB Pant Social Science Institute says the upper-caste votes are going to BJP in the city. “But in rural areas, it will be fractured. The OBC votes too will be divided,” he says.Allahabad is defined by divides: past and present, river and class. In 2002, noted Hindi litterateur Gyan Ranjan wrote in the periodical Tadbhav, “Allahabad…cannot go back to what it was, nor can it strike out a new path.”That may be true, but as Gour says, there is also a sincere attempt to reclaim, virtually and physically, what the city has lost. A Facebook page, Allahabad Civil Lines Nostalgic Memories, started in 2014 and with over 7,000 members, is filled with memories of the city’s mentally exiled. “And there is a profusion of writing about the city. Heritage societies have been set up, literary meets convened, even guava festivals are being organised,” she says.Reclaiming its politics, and becoming nationally relevant again, though, could be a bridge too far.","The city of three rivers was once the garbhagriha of the national movement. It nourished the likes of Motilal Nehru, Madan Mohan Malaviya and Akbar Allahabadi. Allahabad has served as the constituency of Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and V P Singh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110316680,imgsize-1326422,width-400,resizemode-4/110316680.jpg"

is keeping a gruelling schedule, criss-crossing the country to campaign for

on a diverse set of issues. Excerpts from the interview:

Anti-incumbency after two terms is inevitable. It’s not possible to fulfil expectations of all and disappointment is a natural corollary. Why do you still feel so confident?

But there must be some apprehension about the winnability of candidates who have already completed two terms… there might be anti-incumbency against them.

There was resentment among workers, especially in west UP, against some candidates.

Then why is Hindu-Muslim debate dominating the election discourse?

Your party is talking about inheritance tax and X-ray of properties that Rahul Gandhi mentioned in his speeches.

Amit Shah

Kejriwal is also saying that Yogi Adityanath will be replaced as Uttar Pradesh CM if BJP returns to office.

But such claims got credence after Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Manohar Lal Khattar were replaced as CMs in MP and Haryana respectively?

There was said to be a party rule that those above 75 years would not contest polls. The decision was taken when you were party president.

You have spoken several times that India will reclaim

POK

.

There is a statement by you that India will kill its enemies even if they are hiding in some other country.

Your party is claiming major gains in south India. You had several rallies there. Do you think BJP will do better in these states?

There is a perception in Odisha that BJD and BJP are engaged in shadow boxing and Naveen Patnaik will let BJP improve its share of Lok Sabha seats and you, in turn, will not obstruct a fresh term for him.

From 2014 to 2019, you were home minister and then defence minister. What role do you see for yourself in the future?

You said one issue in this election is that India’s pride and respect has increased in foreign countries. How have you reached this conclusion?

BJP is raising the Swati Maliwal issue in a big way.

Some people say RSS is not actively involved in polls this time.

This is the first election after construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. It was believed that there would be excitement among people. However, the dip in voting indicates otherwise.

Is there a concern regarding the polling percentage?

Will your victory margin in Lucknow increase?

Your govt has taken a pledge (Viksit Bharat sankalp) to make India a developed country by 2047. For the past 10 years, the foundation for the same is being laid. How good is progress?

BJP’s slogan is ‘400 paar’ for NDA, whereas opposition parties claim it won’t be able to cross even 200 seats.The gap between the two claims is yawning. Who should be trusted?■ Our target is our pledge (sankalp)… The four rounds of polls have already given a majority to BJP and we are well on course to winning more than 400 seats for the alliance. Our target is based on the groundswell of support and the feedback of people. We have done a realistic assessment of our prospects, and the target is realistic.■ There is no doubt that fulfilling 100% expectations and aspirations of one and all is a challenging task. However, there should not be a question mark on the credibility of party members. Everybody has seen that the BJP brass has fulfilled whatever it has promised. Yo u can look at our party manifesto since 1950… whenever we got a majority we acted on our promises and delivered.■ See, I don’t deny that it is possible to some extent. But it gets trumped by the bigger issues in play: the way the country’s stature has risen globally, the way social welfare schemes have impacted each household and empowered them, I am sure people will repose faith in BJP. People sometimes express unhappiness about a particular individual but their trust in the leadership of Narendra Modi is unflinching and they say ‘aayega to Modi hi’.■ Every party goes for assessment through some agency or other means. Most decisions are taken based on the observations following assessment. I will not say that whatever decisions thus taken are 100% right. The probability of error is there in everything.■ We never do Hindu-Muslim politics. We believe in the mantra of ‘Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam’ — the whole world is a family — given by our sages since ancient times. So there is no question of discrimination on caste and community lines. Has there been any discrimination in delivery of social welfare schemes? I want you to quote PM Modi on this issue and I can give you a number of examples when the PM himself has clarified.But top BJP functionaries, including the PM, are saying that properties will be taken over by Congress and given to Muslims.■ We never say that it will be given solely to Muslims. But what kind of ideas are being fancied by the opposition? They should learn from the examples of other countries, like Brazil, Venezuela, etc. They turned bankrupt only due to such ideologies. I am surprised that such views still have takers. What do you do with such a mindset? Why will an investor come? Why will one earn if it will ultimately be taken away by the likes of Sam Pitroda?■ First of all, their claim has a message that they have already accepted their defeat and admitted that Modi will be PM once again. However, who is he (Kejriwal) to take a decision for BJP? Such a decision can be taken only by the political party concerned… in our case, it is parliamentary board that takes such decisions. The board has already announced that Modi will be PM. In fact, Modi will be PM also in 2029 . India will be a developed nation under his stewardship. People of the country want him to continue as the PM.■ Why? He (Adityanath) has done splendid work as chief minister. Law and order situation is in its best phase. The state has witnessed unprecedented development. Kaise hata diya jaayega? But let me tell you one thing, such talk by opposition parties also reflects that they have nothing to speak against the Modi govt, its performance as they are more focused on talking about BJP and making wild statements. It shows Congress and the opposition bloc is distressed and desperate.■ (Interrupts). Shivraj Singh Chouhan had an impeccable record as CM. He was CM for 18-19 years. He is a senior member of our party. There are plenty of responsibilities in the party... Centre is also there.■ (Interrupts). It was never decided. You can write in bold letters that no such decision was taken… I was party president, and I am saying it forcefully that there was no such decision at all. Had it been decided, it would have been mentioned in the party constitution. Moreover, had there been such a decision, our senior member L K Advani ji would not have contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.There were several others above 75 years who contested and won Lok Sabha polls in 2014 and 2019.■ I have been speaking about this for many years, it’s our commitment. I anticipate that people of POK will take a call and assert that they want to part ways with Pakistan and merge with India. Yo u must have seen people of POK removing the Pakistani flag.■ Let me repeat what exactly I said. India has never attacked any country or captured its land. Hum kisi ko aankh dikhate nahi, par koi dikhata hai to usko muhtod jawab dene ki taqat hai (We don’t go around threatening, but are capable of hitting back if someone tries to mess with us).■ We are confident of a better performance. Even in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, our party is expected to win a few seats. Our vote share will increase significantly even in Tamil Nadu. However, our party is certainly winning big in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.■ It is not at all true. Politics is serious business. BJP is an ideologydriven party and it does not resort to such games.■ This is for the party to decide. It is not necessary one continues to have responsibility throughout his life. Till the time I can work, I will discharge my responsibilities honestly and with ideological commitment. There is no discrimination at all. I believe our ideology does not allow discrimination based on caste, creed and religion.■ I had cited the example of an event that was held a few days ago in which the US ambassador was speaking. He said if you want to feel the future, come to India; if you want to see the future, come to India and if you want to work in the future, come to India. Several state heads have already said that 21st century belongs to India. There is no confusion that PM Narendra Modi has done exemplary work. Even the opponents would not deny this if asked privately. He has made the country’s economy stronger.■ It is very sad and unfortunate. I did say a day ago that it is unfortunate that such misbehaviour with a woman Rajya Sabha member has taken place at the CM’s residence. I do not have to say anything about Akhilesh Yadav, but as a well-wisher, my suggestion is that he should not have shared the dais with Arvind Kejriwal.■ (Laughs). There is no basis to it. It’s a wrong narrative. Shows the desperation of our opponents.■ Results have not come yet... (smiles). Secondly, BJP has never treated Ram temple as an election issue. It’s an issue of belief, faith and cultural heritage. We never saw this with the lens of politics. There should be development along with conservation of cultural legacy and heritage.■ It’s hot these days. Secondly, INDI Alliance has not been effective. There is no enthusiasm in its voters.What is your prediction for Amethi and Rae Bareli?■ BJP.■ It will cross 5 lakh if turnout improves.■ The foundation is very strong. It is for this reason the country has emerged as the fastest growing economy. The big size of the economy as well as the pace at which it is growing proves that the country will achieve the goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047.","Despite a lower back injury, defence minister Rajnath Singh is keeping a gruelling schedule.

NEW DELHI: The fifth phase of Lok Sabha elections for 49 seats on Monday saw 62.2% turnout (according to data available at 10.30 pm on Tuesday), which may rise marginally when final data is released by EC. In 2019, the polling in this phase was 62.5%.According to data updated by EC on its voter turnout app, among the 7 states and 2 UTs, Maharashtra, Odisha, Ladakh and J&K recorded higher turnout in this phase while West Bengal saw the maximum drop.

Overall turnout for 2019 doesn't include the delimited seat of Baramulla, which saw 59.1% polling compared with 34.6% five years ago.MUMBAI/PUNE: The five-phase polls for Maharashtra's 48 Lok Sabha seats saw an overall voter turnout of 61.3%, an improvement of 0.6% compared to 2019, state chief electoral officer S Chockalingam said Tuesday, a day after the final phase ended. This is the third highest turnout for a Lok Sabha in Maharashtra since the state was formed. The highest ever was 64.8% in 1967, while the second highest turnout was 61.75% recorded in the 1984 elections held after PM Indira Gandhi's assassination.The split in two regional parties and a bitterly contested campaign has led to even Mumbai, a city otherwise notorious for its voter apathy, clocking its second highest turnout in three decades. Mumbai has managed a respectable 54.1%, the final data shows. The turnout was just 1.3% lower than the 2019 polls even though these elections were timed almost a month later and held during the school summer vacations, in sweltering heat.As always, the elite Mumbai South constituency, home to India's richest industrialists, recorded the lowest turnout at 50%. Mumbai North, considered a BJP stronghold, had the highest turnout of 57%. Union Minister Piyush Goyal contested from here. Mumbai North West is the only city constituency where polling exceeded the percentage in 2019 at 54.8%.The five-phase polls for Maharashtra's 48 Lok Sabha seats saw an overall voter turnout of 61.3%, an improvement of 0.6% compared to 2019, state chief electoral officer S Chockalingam said Tuesday.","The fifth phase of Lok Sabha elections for 49 seats on Monday saw 62.2% turnout.

NEW DELHI: Making an exception to the norm that children in conflict with law should be granted bail irrespective of the crime's seriousness, Supreme Court denied bail to a Uttarakhand school student accused of circulating obscene videos of his classmate, a 14-year-old girl , which allegedly drove her to suicide.On Jan 10 this year, Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), Haridwar, had rejected the bail plea of the 'child in conflict with law', who had been booked under Sections 305 and 509 of IPC and Sections 13 and 14 of Pocso Act.After JJB's decision was upheld by Uttarakhand high court, the boy through his mother moved Supreme Court seeking bail.Senior advocate Lok Pal Singh argued that his parents were ready to take care of him. The child should not be kept in a reform home and his custody given to his mother, Singh appealed.But the apex court bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and Pankaj Mithal on Monday examined the HC judgement and said it was right in declining bail to the juvenile.While dismissing the boy's appeal, the SC bench said, ""After carefully perusing the material placed on record, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order passed by the high court at this stage.""The girl had gone missing from her residence on Oct 22 last year and her body was recovered later.The girls’s father lodged a police complaint alleging that the boy had shot obscene videos of her and circulated the clips among students. Fearing ignominy, she took her own life, the father said.Justice Ravindra Maithani of Uttarakhand HC on April 1 had given a reasoned order declining bail to the juvenile. He said, “For a child in conflict with law (CIL), every offence is bailable and such CIL is entitled to bail irrespective of the offence being classified as bailable or non-bailable.”However, he added, “Bail may be denied if there are reasonable grounds for believing that his release is likely to bring the ‘child in conflict with law’ into the association of any known criminal, expose him to moral, physical, or psychological danger, or if his release would defeat the ends of justice.”Perusing the social investigation report about the juvenile in the case in hand, HC said he is an undisciplined child keeping bad company and that he required strict disciplining. The report also stated that on release, there could be further untoward incidents involving him.“Having considered the social investigation report, the medical examination report, the report from the school, this court is of the view that the best interest of the child would be served if he is not granted bail. If he is released on bail, it would definitely defeat the ends of justice,” Justice Maithani had said while rejecting his bail.","Supreme Court denied bail to a Uttarakhand school student accused of circulating obscene videos of his classmate.

It says, only if the parents, guardians or owners can prove that the offence was committed without their knowledge or that they exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence, they may not be held responsible.However, it will be for them to prove this as the law mentions that the court hearing such cases shall presume that the use of the vehicle by a juvenile was with the consent of the guardian or the owner.
