Daughter looks to avenge Shinde losses as BJP eyes hat-trick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/daughter-looks-to-avenge-shinde-losses-as-bjp-eyes-hat-trick/articleshow/109899549.cms,"PUNE/KOLHAPUR: It isn’t anti-incumbency or relative weakness of allies that could come in the way of a BJP hat-trick in Solapur . What could prove to be the party’s undoing is the dismal scorecard of its MPs on ‘Smart City’ work implementation, big ticket infrastructure projects and the festering drinking water crisis — to name a few — in the last decade.While the saffron party appears to be struggling for a narrative to sell its nominee, Ram Satpute, to the people, its main challenger, Congress’s Praniti Shinde , is rubbing in the ‘no-development’ message.Amid a whirlwind of meetings and rallies in the rural hinterland, the three-term MLA from Solapur City Central makes it a point to rake up BJP’s “failures” and plead for a chance to do better.“Solapur has been suffering for the last decade as the two BJP MPs ignored the real issues plaguing the district. They could not make the airport operational or set up an IT park. I will accord priority to development projects, if elected,” Praniti recently said.On her daily rounds, Praniti never forgets to ignite a debate on Satpute’s “outsider” status. Speaking at a rally, Praniti said, “We need to pack him (Satpute) this time and send the parcel back to Beed.” Satpute was born in Ashti tehsil of Beed district, 180 km north of Solapur. His father, a sugarcane harvester, moved to Bhamburdi in Solapur’s Malshiras tehsil, where Satpute completed his secondary education before going to Pune for higher studies.Praniti’s remark prompted BJP to claim that its candidate was not “born with a silver spoon in his mouth”, an apparent reference to Praniti’s status as the daughter of former CM and Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde.“Our candidate is connected to all sections of society. He has been working hard for the poor,” Sachin Kalyanshetti, BJP’s Solapur district president and Akkalkot MLA, told TOI.In the 2014 polls, BJP’s Sharad Bansode defeated then MP Sushilkumar Shinde. In 2019, Shinde was again trounced by Lingayat seer Jaisiddeshwar Shivacharya. Data reveals that Bansode participated in just seven debates in Lok Sabha against the national average of 67. Shivacharya took part in 28 debates, while the national average was 47. Bansode asked just 43 questions and Shivacharya 112, against the national average of 293 and 210, respectively.Calling this a fight to save the Constitution, Praniti said, “Election to the Solapur Municipal Corporation has not been held for the last two years. The city receives water once a week. There are no funds for development work. Solapur elected two MPs in the last 10 years. They got a golden opportunity to develop the city, but they didn’t.”Satpute, on the other hand, has challenged Praniti to discuss the Centre’s contribution. “From water pipeline to Smart City work, the Centre has spent huge funds in the last decade. On the contrary, Sushilkumar Shinde, as Union minister and CM, didn’t do anything for So lapur. So, Praniti should tell the public what her father has done.”Praniti’s allegations are, however, not completely baseless. In 2016, Solapur was among the 20 cities selected for the Smart City project. A special administrative wing was set up for its implementation. However, eight years later, the Centre’s assessment puts the city among the six worst performers. While no major infrastructure work has been initiated, the plan to acquire 40 electric buses has been stalled over poor response from private operators. Reeling under a severe water crisis, people see their taps run dry for nearly six days a week. Water level in Ujani dam, the city’s main supply source, is depleting fast as there was scant rainfall last monsoon.The only reserved LS seat for SCs in western Maharashtra, Solapur was traditionally one of the “safest constituencies” for Congress. While BJP galloped to victory riding the Modi wave in 2014, what worked in its favour in the next elections was the support of Lingayats (20% or 3.5 lakh voters). BJP in 2019 also convinced Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar to contest. This helped divide Dalit, Muslim and Dhangar votes.“Congress candidates had traditionally got votes from Dalit and Muslim com munities in Solapur. But Ambedkar secured 1.70 lakh votes. That was a big blow to Shinde, who lost by a margin of 1.58 lakh votes,” a political observer said.But this time, the observer pointed out, BJP has neither fielded a Lingayat candidate nor is VBA in the fray. “Besides, there is a negative impression among people about the poor performance of the BJP MPs in the last two terms.”BJP is trying to woo the Padamshali community that controls most of the factories producing chaddars and towels. The community had given the party its first MP from western Maharashtra — Lingraj Valyal from Solapur in 1996. In his recent speech, PM Modi recalled his ties with the community. “During my childhood, a Padamshali family in Ahmedabad used to feed me three to four times a month. They were poor and used to live in a chawl. But they never let me sleep hungry.”BJP, too, never misses a chance to target Congress. Praniti, on the day she filed her nomination, brought the famous doppelganger of Shah Rukh Khan — Ibrahim Qadri — for campaigning. BJP’s national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla was quick to write on X that after peddling fake surveys, Congress was using deep fakes, and called it another scam of the grand old party.",Solapur is traditionally one of the safest constituencies for Congress. Praniti Shinde is rubbing in the ‘no-development’ message. Solapur elected two MPs in the last 10 years. Data reveals that Bansode participated in just seven debates in Lok Sabha.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109899634,imgsize-1298716,width-400,resizemode-4/109899634.jpg"

Jharkhand cash seizure: PM Modi says 'taking legal advice on returning looted corruption money to people'; attacks Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-cash-seizure-pm-modi-says-taking-legal-advice-on-returning-looted-corruption-money-to-people-attacks-congress/articleshow/109887591.cms,"'Don't jump to conclusions'

ED searches linked to money laundering case

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said he was taking legal advice on how to return the money of poor people 'looted' in corruption as he cited the ""mounds of cash"" seized during ED raids in Jharkhand at the premises of a domestic help allegedly linked to the secretary of Congress minister Alamgir Alam . The probe agency has claimed to have recovered an estimated Rs 20-30 crore ""unaccounted"" cash during searches.Referring to the seizure, Modi wondered why such persons were ""close to the Congress's first family"" and sought answers from Rahul Gandhi .""Why is that those, from whom mounds of cash are recovered, are close to the Congress's first family? Was the seized cash meant for supply somewhere, is it that Congress's first family has created warehouses of black money? The country wants to know from Congress shehzada,"" the PM said at an election rally in an apparent jibe at Rahul Gandhi.""They have made the worker's house a godown of corruption. This is not the first time as a bigger seizure was made from an MP (in Jharkhand) earlier also and it was such a big cache that even machines were tired of counting,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister alleged that the Congress and INDI alliance people 'abuse' him whenever he 'catches' their black money. However, he was worried not about the abuses, but the poor, ""whose money these corrupt have looted.""Prime Minister Modi said he is taking legal advice on returning the looted corruption money.""So far, the ED alone has attached property worth Rs 1.25 lakh crore and ""if others"" (central agencies) are included it may be more. I am taking legal advice on how the money can be returned to those from whom it has been looted,"" the PM said.Jharkhand rural development minister Alamgir Alam urged patience and restraint in jumping to conclusions.""Sanjiv Lal is a government employee. He is my personal secretary. Sanjiv Lal has already been personal secretary of two former ministers. There are several government employees and we usually appoint personal secretary based on experience. It is not right to comment on the raids before the ED investigation is completed,"" Alam said.The ED searches were linked to a money laundering case against the former chief engineer of the rural works department, Veerendra Kumar Ram, who was arrested last year.""Veerendra Kumar Ram, posted as chief engineer in the Rural Works Department in Ranchi, had generated proceeds of crime in the name of commission from contractors in lieu of allotment of tenders to them,"" the agency had alleged in a statement issued last year in April after it attached assets worth Rs 39 crore of the officer.""The proceeds of crime thus generated were used by Veerendra Kumar Ram and his family members to live a very lavish lifestyle,"" it said.(With inputs from agencies)","Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was taking legal advice on how to return the money of poor people 'looted' in corruption.

Acharya Pramod Krishnam: Sacked Congress leader claims Rahul Gandhi had planned to overturn Ram Mandir verdict if voted to power,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sacked-congress-leader-claims-rahul-gandhi-had-planned-to-overturn-ram-mandir-verdict-if-voted-to-power/articleshow/109883886.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Congress leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam on Monday claimed that Rahul Gandhi had made plans to overturn the Supreme Court verdict which facilitated construction of grand Ram Mandir in Ayodhya if the grand old party formed a government at the Centre.""I have spent more than 32 years in the Congress. When the Ram Mandir decision came, Rahul Gandhi in a meeting with his close aides had said that if the Congress formed a government after elections, a superpower commission would be created to overturn the Ram Mandir verdict just like Rajiv Gandhi had changed the SC ruling in the Shah Bano case ,"" Pramod Krishnam told news agency ANI.The former Congress leader further claimed that Rahul Gandhi had mooted this idea on the advice and signal of one of his well-wishers who lived in America. The reference was possibly to Indian Overseas Congress chairman Sam Pitroda . When preparations for the inauguration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya were on full swing, Pitroda had stirred a controversy by questioning the hype around the consecration ceremony and the Prime Minister's participation in the grand opening.Pitroda had then said ""I have no problem with any religion. I am only saying that don't mix religion with politics. Pandit Nehru, Lal bahadur Shashtri did not use religion for politics. It is okay to visit temple once in a while, but you can't make that the main platform. 40 per cent of the people vote for the BJP, 60 per cent of the people do not vote for the BJP. He is everybody's Prime Minister & not BJP's Prime Minister and that's the message people of India want the Prime Minister to give.""""The people of India will have to decide what are the real issues - is Ram Mandir the real issue? Or unemployment is a real issue. Is Ram Mandir the real issue or is inflation a real issue. Is Ram Mandir the real issue or is the air pollution in Delhi the real issue?"" he had added.Congress expelled Acharya Pramod Krishnam from party for “indiscipline and anti-party activities” days after he criticised party leadership for skipping Ram Lalla’s consecration ceremony in Ayodhya and termed the decision as “anti-Hindu”.On the Congress decision to field Rahul Gandhi from Rae Bareli, the former Congress leader had said that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was deliberately denied a ticket to contest the Lok Sabha elections and she was a ""victim of family and party conspiracy"".""I said this earlier that Rahul Gandhi will not contest Amethi. I said this, too, that Rahul Gandhi will not let Priyanka Gandhi Vadra fight these elections. There is a big conspiracy afoot against Priyanka. She is the victim of a conspiracy hatched by her family and the party,"" Acharya Krishnam had told ANI on Friday.The Congress had boycotted the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony in Ayodhya on January 22. The grand old party called the temple inauguration a BJP-RSS event.

Good News For Congress

MP Banks On PM, Father

Families of former Karnataka chief ministers S Bangarappa and B S Yediyurappa are once again locked in a battle for Shimoga Lok Sabha seat that votes on May 7. What makes this round different is the presence of BJP rebel and former deputy CM, K S Eshwarappa, in the fray.Eshwarappa, a lifelong ABVP/BJP adherent, was denied a BJP ticket in last year’s Karnataka assembly polls.But this time, when the party overlooked his son K E Kanthesh’s bid to contest from neighbouring Haveri Lok Sabha seat, he rebelled. Eshwarappa believes Yediyurappa and his sons engineered Kanthesh’s rejection, so he’s contesting “to teach them a lesson”.Speaking to TOI, he said he wants to rid BJP’s national leadership of its “illusion” that Yediyurappa and family are indispensable. He is canvassing Raghavendra’s Hindutva voters by telling them the Yediyurappa clan sidelined hard-core ideologues like C T Ravi, Nalin Kumar Kateel and DV Sadan anda Gowda. He is also banking on women’s self-help groups that have benefited from his family-run microfinance company, and the 25,000-odd Tamil ians in the constituency.Eshwarappa’s rebellion is good news for Congress. “The more votes he takes, the brighter our chances of victory,” said Basavarajappa, a Congress worker in Shimoga’s Eesuru village. Party candi date Geetha Shivarajkumar is the late Bangarappa’s daughter. Her husband, Kannada film star Shivarajkumar, and brother Madhu Bangarappa, a minister in the Karnataka state govt, have been campaigning for her for a month.The Yediyurappas have beaten the Bangarappas in Shimoga the last four times, but it used to be S Bangarappa’s fortress once, and he won four elections here. Last time a Bangarappa came close to winning the seat was in the 2018 by-election when Madhu contested as a Congress-JD(S) alliance candidate.Geetha is hoping to break the Yediyurappas’ hold on the seat. She is banking heavily on the five guarantees that Karnataka’s Congress govt has implemented and the party’s promise to give Rs 1 lakh per year to women heads of families. “Her victory seems certain because the backward classes, scheduled castes and tribes, who have benefited from Congress’s guarantees, dominate this constituency,” said Naveen, a Congress sympathiser.Geetha and Madhu have also been working relentlessly to consolidate the four lakh votes of their Idiga community. A few film actors, including Duniya Vijay, have drawn crowds to Geetha’s meetings and rallies.BJP’s Raghavendra is banking on his father’s popularity among voters of all castes, PM Modi’s appeal and rapid development in urban pockets over the last decade. He is credited with improving the district’s highways, roads and rail links, and even opponents concede “Raghanna” is a worker.For the Yediyurappas, winning Shimoga is key to maintaining their grip on the state BJP amid growing opposition, especially since Raghavendra’s younger brother B Y Vijayendra became BJP state unit president.“We realise the importance of winning this election and the necessity of overcoming Eshwarappa’s rebellion. But my performance as an MP and Modi’s popularity will help me win comfortably,” Raghavendra told TOI.","K S Eshwarappa, a lifelong ABVP/BJP adherent, was denied a BJP ticket in last year’s Karnataka assembly polls.

It is not the opinion of Congress,” Chennithala said. Paying rich tributes to Karkare, Chennithala said the then Congress govt had taken the case against Kasab to a logical end and the terrorist was hanged. Tharoor, on the other hand, said in Pune, “I cannot comment if the claim is true or not but since it is a serious allegation, it should be thoroughly investigated. Karkare was a popular officer. I had met him and I hold a lot of respect for him. I feel the inquiry into his death in a professional manner should be initiated.”CM Eknath Shinde accused Congress of insulting the martyrs of 26/11 and claimed it was aligning with Pakistan. He also questioned UBT Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s silence over the issue. State BJP president Chandrashekar Bawankule asked how Congress could stoop so low. Tharoor said the claim (about Kasab not killing Karkare) had been made by a retired IPS officer in his book. “Leader of opposition (Wadettiwar) raised the issue which has been in the public domain for some time… Such a serious issue should be investigated in a professional manner,” he said.Criticising Ujjwal Nikam, whom Wadettiwar accused of “suppressing the truth” as special public prosecutor in the 26/11 case, he said, “The candidate (Nikam) related to whom the issue has come up had made a claim that biryani was served to Kasab in jail, which was refuted by the then IPS officer Meeran Borwankar.” He clarified that the Congress had no sympathy for terrorism.Devika Rotawan, the youngest eyewitness in the trial of Kasab, on Monday slammed Wadettiwar without naming him and said one should not “sprinkle salt on wounds” in this manner. CM Shinde said, “Congress has no remorse for our heroes but is apparently worried about Kasab. Such remarks evoke anger in every Indian’s mind. Congress and Rahul Gandhi have no moral right to seek votes. Voters will teach them a lesson.”Shinde criticised Congress for meekly tolerating violence over the last several years, including the 26/11 attacks. “While we were expecting the Congress-led govt to avenge the attack and loss of our innocent civilians and officers, they only meekly complained to global leaders about the incident. In stark contrast, Narendra Modi, during his tenure as PM, has ensured our country bravely and promptly retaliates against all terror attempts through surgical strikes, that too in enemy lands. We are in a position now where world powers listen to us when we speak,” he said.Questioning Uddhav Thackeray’s silence, he said, “He (Uddhav) said the country doesn’t need Modi, but I am asking if we need a leader who works from home and does Facebook live. If Balasaheb was alive, he would not have tolerated this.”Bawankule said, “Do you back Ajmal Kasab to oppose BJP? Have some shame. Ever since Narendra Modi came to power, terrorists have been wiped out, but today Congress is shedding tears for them. When MVA was in power in Maharashtra, Yakub Memon’s grave was beautified, now Kasab’s regiment is marching out. People will give a befitting lesson to Congress.""

MUMBAI: Till last week, the South Mumbai Lok Sabha seat was a five-way fight as four candidates, MLA Yamini Jadhav and MP Milind Deora from the Shiv Sena led by Eknath Shinde, Speaker Rahul Narwekar and minister Mangal Prabhat from the BJP were campaigning against Sena's (UBT) sitting two-time MP Arvind Sawant . But with the Shinde-led Sena managing to wrest the seat from BJP with some hard bargaining, the South Mumbai Lok Sabha, one of the country's most prestigious seats, is now a high-stakes Sena versus Sena battle.This is the constituency that is the seat of the state's political establishment and the country's traditional financial nerve centre.It is also home to the country's richest people in Colaba, Cuffe Parade, Malabar Hill, Worli and Prabhadevi as well as middle- and working-class families in Sewri, Byculla, Mazgaon Lower Parel and Mumbai Central.The constituency has a significant Muslim population in Byculla, Mumbadevi and pockets of Christian and Parsi voters too. It also houses some of the country's most iconic institutions such as Mantralaya, Bombay Stock Exchange, Bombay High Court. It is home to several top tourist destinations such as the Gateway of India. Interestingly, it also has very active citizen groups and resident associations.Political observers said while Jadhav is banking on her support base in Byculla and on the BJP in Colaba and Malabar Hill, the Sena (UBT) old face Sawant could have a slight edge because of the Marathi-Muslim combination pattern that is working for MVA in Sewri, Worli, Byculla and Mumbadevi. ""Because of the last-minute declaration of candidates, there is also apathy among elite and upper middle-class voters. The 2024 polls will be a test case to see if the Marathi-Muslim combination and lower-, middle- and upper-class combination works for MVA,"" the observer said.However, being one of the most diverse constituencies in the city its issues also also as diverse and range from heritage conservation, open spaces and pedestrianisation, to affordable housing, upgradation of public health care through state-run and civic hospitals, revamp of tourist attractions, revamp of old bridges and upgrading infrastructure and redevelopment of cessed and tenanted buildings including the BDD Chawls, BIT Chawls and those owned by Mumbai Port Authority are a big issue concerning residents across south Mumbai.While the constituency has seen the launch of mega projects such as the Mumbai-Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) and coastal road, projects such as Metro 3 and Sewri World Connector are still under construction. The plan to reconstruct the Malabar Hill reservoir below Hanging Gardens and the redevelopment of the Mahalaxmi Racecourse are issues that have caused a lot of anger among activists and residents.Political observers said with Sena fielding Jadhav, the onus was now on BJP to help her connect with elite voters and ensure she gets a lead in Colaba and Malabar Hill assembly segments as she would face a tough task of wooing voters in Sena (UBT) strongholds of Sewri and Worli. While Jadhav is a sitting MLA from Byculla, she would also have the task of wooing Muslim voters in Byculla and Mumbadevi.I-T raises demand of ₹143cr from Jadhavs: The I-T department has raised a demand of Rs 143 crore on Shiv Sena legislator Yamini Jadhav and her husband Yashwant Jadhav for a period from 2018 to 2022. Both have moved the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal on April 10 and the appeals are pending.Yamini is the Sena's LS poll candidate from Mumbai South. She is pitted against UBT Shiv Sena's Arvind Sawant. Yamini Jadhav has submitted detailed information on liabilities against her and her spouse before the returning officer, Mumbai South parliamentary constituency as per the rules prescribed by the ECI.","The South Mumbai Lok Sabha seat is now a high-stakes Sena versus Sena battle.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat HC overturned on Monday the life imprisonment sentence of former BJP MPand six others in the 2010 murder case of RTI activist Amit Jethava, criticising both the initial investigation and subsequent CBI probe . “It appears that loopholes in the investigation are deliberately kept unfastened in order to alter the final outcome of complicity of accused in crime,” the court said.While acquitting the seven for the murder of Jethava, who was fatally shot on July 20, 2010, outside HC allegedly for using RTI to uncover illegal mining within Gir forest, the bench of Justice AS Supehia and Justice VK Vyas deemed the investigation “iniquitous and biased” from its inception, leading to its transfer to CBI.The court chastised CBI’s handling of the case. “While reposing immense faith in CBI, this court had handed over the investigation to it. However, the facts indicate that CBI also carried out a slipshod and perfunctory investigation,” HC said.The bench meticulously scrutinised the evidence, highlighting numerous instances of investigative lapses. It criticized the lack of effort in extracting relevant evidence, particularly from hostile witnesses.“No efforts were made to extract relevant evidence with corroborative value. Witnesses who were cross-examined were enjoying police protection, but all turned hostile and ditched the prosecution,” HC stated.The high court further lambasted CBI for failing to meet the “highest standards akin to its stature” and expressed disappointment that crucial steps were overlooked. “It is not palatable that CBI officer, Mukesh Sharma, would ignore or forget to visit the place where the alleged conspiracy was hatched, i.e. Harmadiya Farm,” HC said. It also pointed out the absence of essential evidence collection, such as CCTV footage and mobile phone data from the deceased.","Gujarat HC overturns life sentence of former BJP MPand six others in the 2010 murder case of RTI activist Amit Jethava.

498A getting replicated in BNS without shield for hubby worries Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/498a-getting-replicated-in-bns-without-shield-for-hubby-worries-supreme-court/articleshow/109895318.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that married women cannot use police machinery to hold husband to ransom and expressed concern over much abused Section 498A (cruelty to women in matrimonial home ) of IPC getting replicated in Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita without a semblance of protection for husband and his relatives against frivolous complaints.Quashing a 498A case filed by a woman against her husband, his parents, brother & sister, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said, ""Police machinery cannot be utilised for the purpose of holding husband to ransom so that he could be squeezed by the wife at the instigation of her parents or relatives or friends.""Writing the judgment, Justice Pardiwala Friday said, ""Police machinery should be resorted to as a measure of last resort and that too in a genuine case of cruelty and harassment."" The bench referred to SC's 2010 judgment highlighting abuse of Section 498A by married women in matrimonial disputes and the court's request to the law commission and law ministry for a relook at the provision.Cruelty in matrimonial homes is defined under Section 85 and 86 of BNS, which would come into force from July 1. SC said, ""Secs 85 & 86 are nothing but verbatim reproduction of Section 498A of IPC. The only difference is that the explanation to Section 498A of IPC, is now by way of a separate provision, that is, Section 86 of BNS.""In 2010, in Preeti Gupta case, SC had noted the abuse of Section 498A by women to implicate their husbands and in-laws in police cases and said that most of these cases emanated from trivial matrimonial disputes. It had asked the govt to take a ""serious relook"" at the provision as the tendency of over implication is reflected in a large number of cases.SC said before BNS came into force, ""we request Legislature to look into the issue as highlighted above taking into consideration the realities and consider making necessary changes in Sections 85 and 86 of the BNS.""",Supreme Court has ruled that married women cannot use police machinery to hold husband to ransom.

HC has issued a notice to the state and asked the public prosecutor to take instructions and has kept it for hearing on Tuesday.The petitioners submit that compelling the registered medical practitioner to disclose name of the minor seeking to medically terminate a pregnancy is in contravention of directions issued by Supreme Court in a 2022 decision when it comes to MTP and rights of a minor.Dr Rajendra Chawhan and Dr Nikhil Datar filed a fresh petition which their counsel Meenaz Kakalia mentioned before a division bench headed by Justice Revati Mohite Dere on Monday. Dr Chawhan was approached by a 16-year-old on April 24 at his clinic outside Mumbai. The minor disclosed she was in a consensual relationship. Her mother verified her claim. She was about 14 weeks pregnant when she went to the clinic to seek medical termination of her pregnancy but requested the doctor not to disclose her identity to the police since she is a minor. The doctor was required to report the minor's pregnancy to the police under the Pocso Act since consent of a girl less than 18 is immaterial.In the matter of X vs Health and Family Welfare dept, the petition said Supreme Court provided for protection of minor's identity and not to disclose sans consent.On April 30, Dr Chawhan wrote to the police but got a response that since the matter is under Pocso Act, the doctor must disclose her identity to the police and, in fact, ought to have sent the girl and her family to the police to complain.The petition seeks to highlight a vital aspect that doctor's say is affecting many when it comes to MTP and minors. For the limited purpose of providing MTP under the Act, SC had clarified that the registered medical practitioner - the gynaecologist authorised by law to conduct such MTP - to maintain the minor's privacy, the doctor need not disclose the minor's name and identity under Pocso Act.The petition says it is widely found that minors who engage in consensual acts and get pregnant as a result avoid going to a registered doctor out of fear of mandatory reporting which fails to protect and respect their privacy.", Bombay high court kept for urgent hearing a petition filed by two gynaecologists.
