Sunita Kejriwal steps into political arena through India Bloc rally; Kejriwal's '6 Guarantees' for Delhi

NEW DELHI: Jailed Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said he was ready to bear all ""atrocities of this dictator government "" as long as it serves to "" save the Constitution "".The message was conveyed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) minister Gopal Rai, after he along with other prominent party leaders, including Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann , MP Sanjay Singh , and AAP members Sandeep Pathak and Saurabh Bharadwaj , convened to meet Sunita Kejriwal at the Delhi CM's residence.Sunita had met her husband in Tihar jail on Tuesday and relayed his message at the meeting.""Today, Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, MP Sanjay Singh, Sandeep Pathak, Saurabh Bharadwaj and I came here to meet Sunita Kejriwal. Arvind Kejriwal has sent two messages for us from jail,"" Rai told reporters.""Firstly, he has said that the party and (state) government have to continue their services to ensure that the people of Delhi do not face any problems,"" the minister said.""Secondly, he said that he is ready to bear all the hurdles and atrocities of this dictator government, but the most important thing today is to save the Constitution,"" Rai said, adding that the CM has said that on April 14, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, the entire party should ""observe it as 'Samvidhan Bachao Tanashahi Hatao' Day"".This was the first communication by Kejriwal after his plea against arrest by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with a money launder case linked to the excise policy 'scam', was rejected by the Delhi High Court on Tuesday.He has moved the Supreme Court against the HC order, which has said it will hear the matter on April 15.After spending several days in ED custody since his arrest on March 21, Kejriwal was moved to judicial custody for 15 days till April 15.Meanwhile, AAP MP Sanjay Singh said on Wednesday that the BJP is attempting to emotionally break Kejriwal.Singh claimed that authorities at Tihar Jail threatened to restrict Kejriwal's family visits after he passed a message to AAP Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) through his lawyers.He likened the situation to the notorious ""gas chambers"" of Adolf Hitler's regime.Singh stated, ""The Modi government aims to keep an elected chief minister of Delhi behind bars ... Just two days ago, Arvind Kejriwal conveyed to his lawyer during their meeting that the elected MLAs should engage with their constituents and address their grievances. However, merely on this basis, an inquiry has been initiated against him, with threats of curtailing his access to family and legal counsel.""Recently released from Tihar Jail after spending months in custody over a money-laundering case linked to the Delhi liquor policy, Sanjay Singh asserted that Kejriwal remains resolute against any form of coercion.""Do you (BJP) wish to transform Delhi's Tihar Jail into a chamber of oppression akin to Hitler's gas chambers? Is it wrong for a CM to communicate with his MLAs regarding public issues? Your aim is to emotionally break Arvind Kejriwal, to coerce him into submission. However, these tactics will fail; Kejriwal will not yield,"" he emphasised.","Arvind Kejriwal says he is ready to bear all ""atrocities of this dictator government"" as long as it serves to "" save the Constitution"".

"Factional fights stall Congress list of Delhi, Haryana nominees",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/factional-fights-stall-congress-list-of-delhi-haryana-nominees/articleshow/109205612.cms,"NEW DELHI: Factional pressures and individual ambitions have emerged as big challenges for Congress in deciding its candidates for the Lok Sabha elections in the neighbouring states of Haryana and Delhi.The divided Haryana unit is said to have more aspirants being pushed by the dominant Hooda camp, even as rival leaders are sticking to their guns for their loyalists.Party sources said the screening committee will meet again this week to try and clinch the names for nine Lok Sabha seats.Well-placed sources said former CM Bhupinder Hooda is in favour of a ""close aide"" for Faridabad constituency, and is apparently pushing for actor-turned-politician Raj Babbar for Gurgaon. At the same time, he has not yet conveyed to the party his preference for Karnal and Sonepat, but both seats are in his area of influence. There is speculation in Karnal about a sadhu who fought elections in Uttarakhand earlier.Three constituencies - Bhiwani, Hisar and Rohtak - are seen as picking themselves. While Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda represented Rohtak thrice before losing narrowly in 2019, Hisar MP Brijendra Singh, who won in 2019 on a BJP ticket, recently joined the party along with his father and Congress veteran Birender Singh who defected to BJP in 2014. Senior leader Kiran Choudhry's daughter Shruti has represented the Bhiwani LS seat earlier.Party sources, however, said there is also a push for senior MLA and OBC leader Rao Dan Singh from Bhiwani.But four other key leaders, which recently took out a joint 'yatra' in Haryana, are eager to have their preferences being given a chance, complicating the leadership's challenge.Sources said the same problem is holding back the names in Delhi, with an exasperated ally AAP publicly demanding that Congress finalise without any further delay its three candidates, so that the joint campaign can be launched.While there were few takers for the party ticket in Delhi earlier, the rush increased after the alliance with AAP. Arvinder Lovely, Anil Chaudhary, JP Aggarwal, Udit Raj and Sandeep Dikshit have been the names under consideration for Chandni Chowk, North-West and North-East, and Kanhaiyya Kumar is also a wild card on the North-East seat. The party is still to take a decision on the candidates.A strong ticket probable, when asked, laughed that ""I am hearing a different constituency being considered for me every third day.""","Haryana unit is said to have more aspirants being pushed by the dominant Hooda camp.

Why is PM silent on Mungantiwar's insult to women: LoP Wadettiwar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-is-pm-silent-on-mungantiwars-insult-to-women-lop-wadettiwar/articleshow/109209551.cms,"GADCHIROLI/CHAMAROSHI: Chandrapur strongman and Maharashtra’s leader of the Opposition Vijay Wadettiwar on Wednesday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence on BJP candidate Sudhir Mungantiwar ’s alleged incestuous remark at a rally on his home turf, calling it an unprecedented low in India’s electoral history. “Mungantiwar ripped apart women’s dignity and heaped insult on ‘nari shakti’ at a rally, which was addressed by none other than the PM himself.Does PM Modi condone such profanity in political discourse? While BJP raised a storm over purported remarks on Kangana Ranaut, why is the party mute now,” asked Wadettiwar, who is vigorously campaigning for the Congress candidate Namdeo Kirsan in neighbouring Gadchiroli.The party has lodged two police complaints at Ram Nagar and Brahmapuri police stations in Chandrapur against Mungantiwar, besides another registered in Nagpur on Tuesday. Calling the Election Commission’s silence on the shocking violation of poll conduct as intriguing even 24 hours after Congress moved a petition to cancel the BJP minister’s candidature, Wadettiwar said, “What will we expect from the current poll body whose selection of members was unfair? Can we expect justice from this body, which is remote controlled by the govt? The party will move court,” he said, adding Mungantiwar’s words reflected the party’s ideological stand on women. “Chandrapur’s women will give a befitting reply to BJP at the hustings,” he said.In an exclusive chat with TOI on his way to a rally at Chamorshi in Gadchiroli, Wadettiwar spurned allegations of his half-hearted support to Congress’ Chandrapur candidate Pratibha Dhanorkar. “I am camping in Gadchiroli to halt the BJP candidate’s hattrick in this key tribal constituency, but my team is working round-the-clock on my home turf Chandrapur to ensure Pratibha’s win. I have already addressed a rally there and I am available for more campaigns if she seeks my presence. I may have been hurt by denial of ticket to my daughter Shivani, but for me the party is supreme. I had ensured Pratibha's husband’s ticket from Chandrapur in 2019 and catapulted him to a giant killer by decimating BJP’s two-time MP, Hansraj Ahir. I rightfully sought a ticket for Shivani, but I accept the high command’s decision to field Pratibha.”","Vijay Wadettiwar questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence on BJP candidate Sudhir Mungantiwar ’s alleged incestuous remark at a rally on his home turf.

Why you shouldn’t ignore manifestos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-you-shouldnt-ignore-manifestos/articleshow/109209202.cms,"Significant since Raj days

Most

promises

fulfilled

Who writes them?

Keep them simple, please

Go beyond Roti, Kapda, Makaan

Do election manifestos matter? Suspend scepticism for a while and consider this: in 1984, BJP promised it would abrogate Article 370. Thirty-five long years later, in 2019, it fulfilled the promise. Likewise, Congress promised the right to education in its 2004 manifesto, and implemented it in 2009. So, manifestos are more than political lip service.In fact, reading through a manifesto is like peering through a crystal ball. It gives you an idea of what the future holds. Here are some watershed moments of Indian law and policy that can be traced back to manifestos.Manifestos mattered even before Independence, when the British gradually devolved powers of legislation and administration to elected representatives. In hindsight, most social, political and economic reforms undertaken at the provincial level between 1919 (when provinces got legislative and financial authority) and 1947, came directly from these party manifestos. Here are some samples:1916 | Manifesto of Justice Party advocated a more vigorous education policy for nonBrahmins, and strengthening and deepening of constitutional reforms.1920 | Manifesto of Bal Gangadhar Tilak’s Congress Democratic Party promised to promote indigenous systems of medicine.1923 | Manifesto of National Unionist Party in Punjab advocated fair distribution of fiscal burden between agricultural and other classes.1937 | Congress manifesto recognised poverty and indebtedness of peasants as critical problems and called for reduction of agricultural rent.1937 | Muslim League manifesto dealt with funding cottage industries and making elementary education free and compulsory.The good news is that governments have shown increasing commitment to their manifesto promises over the past 20 years. For instance, UPA-1 fulfilled (fully or partially) 46% of the promises from Congress’s 2004 manifesto. UPA-2 fulfilled 64% of the promises from Congress’s 2009 manifesto, and NDA-1 did even better, fulfilling 71% of the promises made in BJP’s 2014 manifesto.Manifesto committees — small empowered bodies within parties that mostly comprise their senior leaders — make these documents, setting out a roadmap of reforms to woo the electorate. Manifestos of Congress, CPM, and DMK are already out this year. Congress has promised to restore full statehood to Jammu & Kashmir, make Delhi’s LG subservient to the state govt, and abolish the Agnipath scheme. CPM has promised to scrap legislations such as Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, and Citizenship Amendment Act, and introduce state financing of elections. DMK has promised to delete Article 356 (President’s rule) and scrap the offence of sedition from criminal law. BJP is finalising its manifesto.Although manifestos are meant for the common person, they are becoming hard to understand, and wordy like academic papers. Recent manifestos require at least graduate-level comprehension skills, which less than 10% of Indians have. Ideally, they should be concise, easy to understand and published in all Indian languages, not just Hindi and English.The title of Manoj Kumar’s 1974 hit ‘Roti, Kapada aur Makaan’ summarised India’s development vision at the time, but half a century on, as the country turns into an economic and technological powerhouse, it is time to supplement these manifesto goals with others, such as:Insaan – to guarantee social & economic justiceDukaan – to maintain free & competitive marketsVigyaan – to digitise at pace across sectors & carefully regulate emerging technologies","In 1984, BJP promised it would abrogate Article 370.

The party also shifted Burdwan-Durgapur MP, former Union minister S S Ahluwalia, to Asansol where he would be taking on TMC's incumbent Shatrughan Sinha.Neeraj Shekhar, who came to Rajya Sabha as member of Samajwadi Party, crossed over to BJP after SP boss did not field him for the Ballia seat which his father had represented multiple times.He replaces Virendra Singh Mast who won the seat five years ago but had run afoul of the cadre sentiments for calling for the construction of an auditorium in honour of SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav.Sitting Allahabad MP, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, has been replaced at Allahabad, with the party bringing in Neeeraj Tripathi, son of BJP veteran late Kesri Nath Tripathi, while Kesari Devi, the incumbent at Phulpur, has made way for Praveen Patel.With this, the number of BJP MPs who have been denied ticket in UP has touched 12. Tandon, the replacement for Kher at Chandigarh, is the son of BJP veteran Balram Das Tandon, who headed the Chandigarh unit of the party for nine years, beginning 2010. The sitting MP, who is said to be not keen to be in electoral politics, was the first to congratulate him.The decision to bring Ahluwalia, who represented Darjeeling before moving to Burdwan, to Asansol should make for a Bihari versus Bihari candidate. Family of the tech-savvy candidate, once a loyalist of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, has long been domiciled in Bihar, though he started his political career in Bengal.With the latest list, BJP has declared candidates for 70 of the 75 seats it will contest in UP. The party also announced candidates for Mainpuri, Machhlishahr, Ghazipur and Kaushambi. It repeated the Machhlishahr and Kaushambi MPs - B P Saroj and Vinod Sonkar - respectively. The party has fielded MLA and UP tourism minister Jaiveer Singh in Mainpuri and Parasnath Rai in Ghazipur.Neeraj Shekhar had won from Ballia in the 2007 by-election and then again in 2009 on SP ticket. He, however, lost to BJP's Bharat Singh in 2014.BJP's decision to field Jaiveer Singh from Mainpuri, an SP stronghold, has turned the spotlight on the saffron outfit's bid to consolidate the Thakur community which has a sizeable presence in the region. Singh, who won from Mainpuri assembly seat in 2022, will be up against SP chief Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple Yadav.The candidature of Paras Nath Rai from Ghazipur is seen as BJP's fresh bid to woo the influential Bhumihar community in the east UP region.

""If these INDI alliance people become powerful, they will break the country into pieces. Even today, they make every effort to pit one community against another.

Why US doesn't want Ukraine to attack Russian oil facilities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-us-doesnt-want-ukraine-to-attack-russian-oil-facilities/articleshow/109191305.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin voiced concerns during a Senate panel hearing on Tuesday, cautioning Ukraine against targeting Russian oil refineries. He suggested that such attacks could inadvertently escalate global oil prices amid an already tense global energy situation. Austin emphasized the strategic importance of Ukraine focusing its military efforts on tactical and operational targets directly influencing the current conflict.This stance sparked disagreement from Senator Tom Cotton , who argued that the Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil infrastructure have been effective.He insinuated that the Biden administration's concerns might be more about preventing a rise in gas prices during an election year than about global energy stability.The controversy arises as global oil prices hit a six-month high, a situation the US attributes to conflicts in the Middle East and asserts that its sanctions and price cap on Russian oil have been effective. However, Russia reports an increase in oil exports in 2023 compared to pre-conflict levels, challenging the narrative of sanctions' impact.Reports have surfaced suggesting the US had previously urged Ukraine to halt its refinery attacks, with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy indicating that the US reaction to the strikes was ""not positive."" Despite this, Ukraine's military intelligence (GUR) has declared plans to expand operations against Russian oil refineries, a Russia Today report said.The drone attacks, initiated by Ukraine over the past two months, aim to disrupt Russian military fuel supplies and ""deliver a symbolic blow by bringing the war closer to Moscow,"" according to Kiev. Zelenskyy has also framed these strikes as a form of deterrence, citing a shortage of missiles for Western-provided air defenses.Both Zelenskyy and Austin are lobbying the US Congress for over $60 billion in military aid to Ukraine. Zelensky warns that without this support, Ukraine's defeat is certain, while Austin views the aid as a boon for American workers in the military industry. The proposed ""national security supplemental"" funding would benefit at least 30 federal states, supporting industries ranging from ammunition to submarine manufacturing.",US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin voiced concerns during a Senate panel hearing on Tuesday.

Darbar had won the Mhow seat twice but contested as a rebel in 2023 after Congress gave the ticket to the just-in Shukla.Both of them are now in BJP. Antar Singh Darbar switched over last month, and Shukla had his homecoming four days ago.On Wednesday, while talking to mediapersons in Mhow, Shukla said, “I switched to Congress just be-fore the (assembly) elections, contested Mhow on a Congress ticket and lost. All this was done as part of a poll strategy and I did so under the directions of a senior RSS leader in Oct last year.”He went on to explain: “The reason for this was the weak position of BJP candidate Usha Thakur. There was large-scale opposition from within the party. Former Congress MLA Antar Singh Darbar was fightingas an independent, and looking at all these equations, I got ready to sacrifice myself.” Shukla alleged that Darbar was also fielded by BJP as an independent candidate.Asked who was the RSS leader who had given him the plan, he named Abhishek Udeniya, Indore Vibhag Sangathan Mantri of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). Videos of Shukla’s statement were soon swirling around on social media, triggering a storm.The first reaction came from Darbar, who threat-ened to sue his fellow partyman. “This is the height of irresponsibility by a senior leader like Shukla. It is a completely false allegation that BJP fielded me. I have asked Shukla to issue a clarification and I’ll wait until tonight.

MUMBAI: A little over 38 years after it was launched with a base of just 100 points, BSE sensex, the most watched stock market bellwether in India, crossed the 75,000-point mark on Tuesday, signifying past successes of Indian economy and the market, and raising hopes for more wealth creation in the years ahead.On Tuesday, sensex opened the session above the 75k mark - at 75,124 points - also its new all-time peak, but some profit-taking at those levels pulled it down to close at 74,684, down 59 points on the day.On NSE, Nifty, too, scaled a new life-time peak at 22,768 points during early trades but closed at 22,643, down 24 points.The slide was partially owing to investors' nervousness about expected US inflation data due Wednesday, more so after recent high-employment data released last week, said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services. An uptick in US inflation reading could delay rate cuts by its central bank and put global investors on the backfoot.For sensex, the 75k milestone came a day after BSE went past a major landmark - scaling the Rs 400-lakh-crore market capitalisation. In the last 10 years, since Modi-led NDA govt came to office, investors' wealth, measured by BSE's market cap, has gone up by five times.According to Sarvjeet Singh Virk, co-founder & MD, Finvasia, a tech-driven financial services firm, sensex at 75k not only reflects past successes of Indian markets but also “acts as a springboard for future growth, instilling confidence in investors who are now poised to embrace the promising journey ahead”.Among successes of the past decade were India’s move from being a $1.7 trillion market cap economy to a $4.8-trillion one now, setting up one of the world’s fastest settlement systems (T+1), one of the fastest IPO processes that involves retail as well as institutional investors and the most vibrant derivatives trading system in terms of number of contracts.All these, along with a market system that is increasingly opening up access to even small and medium enterprises to list on the bourses at a reasonable cost, and the rise of the retail investors as a major investing group (through the mutual fund route) give every investor confidence to put their money in the Indian market, industry veterans say.Looking forward, June 4 results of Lok Sabha elections will be the prime determinant of the market’s trajectory for the following few months. Additionally, the interest rate scenario in the US and other major economies, progress of monsoon in India (private forecaster SkyMet has predicted good rains for 2024), corporate results, foreign fund flows and economic fundamentals will also have a major impact on investor sentiment, market players said.In short term, investors’ focus will shift to earnings delivery as stock prices are factoring in reasonable growth during the earnings season that’s starting this week, said Naveen Kulkarni, chief investment officer, Axis Securities PMS. “If the earnings season turns out to be disappointing, then the market will correct.

"Global foray an option under evaluation, leverage Rs 75k crore USOF for devices, services: Reliance Jio president Mathew Oommen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/global-foray-an-option-under-evaluation-leverage-rs-75k-cr-usof-for-devices-services-reliance-jio-president-mathew-oommen/articleshow/104799766.cms,"NEW DELHI: After success in India, telecom major Reliance Jio sees global foray as an option which is continuously under evaluation at the company, a senior company official said.While speaking to the media at India Mobile Congress , Reliance Jio president Mathew Oommen said that India is now a tier 1 plus country and there should be no apprehension in framing policies that are right for the nation.“We think the opportunity for India to go global is big. Reliance will continue to review options to see how best to represent India globally and offer value to customers leveraging the technology capabilities that we have already operationalized in India,” Oommen said.He said that to truly drive the Digital India vision, the government should start leveraging Rs 75,700 crore Universal Services Obligation Fund (USOF) not just for mobile tower deployment but to make devices and services affordable and accessible for individuals.He said Jio Bharat Phone ecosystem is an enabler to 2G mukt Bharat and AI Yukt Bharat.He said that the underutilised USO fund should be leveraged for not just telecom infrastructure but also giving help to individuals for devices and services for those who cannot afford the transition.""Anyone who cannot afford connectivity or monthly rent should be given a device and service model by leveraging the fund,” Oommen said.The government at present charges 8 per cent of telecom companies' revenue as licence fee. Out of this, 5 per cent of the collection is earmarked for USOF which is utilised for promoting telecom connectivity in rural and remote areas.Oommen said that the 5 per cent collection for USOF should be removed and licence fees should be reduced to 3 per cent.“Let the telecom industry use those funds for continued investment. Give these as an incentive to the telecom industry to expand and enhance not just connectivity but for adoption of services by the needy to move to 4G and 5G services. There is no rationale to keep the users in the 2G era,” Oommen said.He said that devices are a very critical equation in the adoption of any service.""We brought the most affordable 4G device and the 4G adoption increased. Now the 5G devices are coming in the Rs 10,000 range and we see more and more and more 5G adoption happening. But we need to get this even lower,” Oommen said.He said that it is critical for the telecom industry to take along 240 million 2G users to grow them and connect them with modern networks.When asked about views on sustainability of the industry with current mobile call and data price, Oommen said the industry should ensure including the whole of India under the Digital India programme at the time of deciding on tariff.“Increasing the tariffs is the easiest thing that one can do but having the right tariff that takes all of India together is what I think as an industry we need to continue to embrace. That's how we will get 2G-mukt Bharat. Otherwise, you will leave over 200 million of India behind,” Oommen said.Talking about satellite communication technology, Oommen said the technology has evolved to a level that it will complement other land-based telecom networks.He said that the spectrum allocation methodology for mobile networks and satellites should be the same.“We absolutely believe, since satellite offers the same services, to the same devices, to the same customers with similar standards, why should it be considered any different. There seems to be no logic at all. Anything other than auction of the spectrum will distort the market significantly,” Oommen said.He said that Jio has demonstrated gigabit speed using satellite communications technology which is no different from the speed that can be transmitted on land based networks.","Reliance Jio president Mathew Oommen said that India is now a tier 1 plus country.
